CLEMENS POWERS YANKS PAST WHITE SOX, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At his worst moments this season, Roger Clemens would
not look at the New York Yankees' infielders before walking off the
mound. Clemens would wait, head down, for manager Joe Torre to take
the ball from him and would make a silent departure, as if he were
terribly disappointed he had not rewarded their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of the times that Clemens nodded and accepted the
good wishes of Joe Girardi, Derek Jeter and the others Thursday
night, Tino Martinez slapping Clemens with his glove before the
pitcher jogged off with the Yankees in the lead, in control.
Clemens picked up his 14th victory and the Yankees edged the
Chicago White Sox, 5-2, clinching at least a tie for a playoff
spot, before 33,586 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (93-59) swept the White Sox, have won eight of their
last nine games, and with a victory against Tampa Bay Friday night
_ or if Oakland loses _ will clinch at least a wild-card berth.
Their magic number for clinching the American League East is six.
The Yankees also are 1 1-2 games ahead of Cleveland (92-61) for the
best record in the league and home-field advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had his usual first-inning skirmish Thursday night,
allowing a single and a walk with two outs. But he struck out
Carlos Lee to end the inning _ the first of three innings he would
close with a strikeout. The Yankees took a 4-0 lead after three
innings, and in the fifth, Clemens allowed a leadoff double to Paul
Konerko, Brian Simmons singled home Konerko and Mark Johnson
walked.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Greg Norton cut the lead to 4-2 with a single. But
Clemens struck out Ray Durham and then cut down Magglio Ordonez.
Clemens would last 6 1-3 innings, walking four and striking out
six. By notching his 247th career victory, Clemens tied Joe
McGinnity and Jack Powell for 40th place all time.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Torre walked up to Shane Spencer and told him:
``You're playing today. I know you haven't heard that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer has made only a handful of starts in the last month,
primarily because he is a right-handed hitter who usually plays
against left-handed pitchers and the Yankees have faced few lefties
lately _ or this season _ and probably will not face many in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, the champions of the AL Central, do not
have a left-handed starter; the Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers,
possible October opponents for the Yankees, have one left-handed
starter apiece. There are not many quality left-handed relievers,
either; the Indians are scrambling to establish just one lefty in
their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Their chances of overcoming the Yankees will probably improve if
they do. Derek Jeter went into Thursday night's game batting more
than 100 points lower against left-handers (.265) than
right-handers (.371). Paul O'Neill is batting .193 against
left-handers; and Bernie Williams, Chuck Knoblauch and Scott
Brosius are far worse this year against left-handers. The Yankees
went into Thursday night's game hitting .289 against right-handed
pitchers, 31 points higher than against left-handers, and their
winning percentage is 72 points higher (.623 to .551) versus
right-handed starters.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Torre seizes opportunities like Thursday night,
when left-hander Jim Parque started for the White Sox, to weight
his lineup with right-handed batters. Spencer played left field,
rather than Ricky Ledee, and Leyritz _ who has only 49 at-bats in
his 54 days with the Yankees _ was the designated hitter instead of
Chili Davis or Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   All the Yankees, right-handed and left-handed, wore down Parque.
Williams singled to drive home Jeter in the first inning, and after
Martinez fouled off three pitches and had an eight-pitch at-bat to
end the inning, Parque had thrown 25 pitches. Brosius forced Parque
to throw seven pitches to him in the second inning, Knoblauch and
Jeter both drew walks, and Parque required 58 pitches in the first
two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz bounced a single leading off the third inning, before
Martinez _ a left-handed batter as effective against lefties as
right-handers this year _ bashed a two-run homer into the
right-field bleachers. The Yankees led, 4-0, enough for Clemens and
the relievers who followed.

ST. LOUIS LEADERS HOPE REBIRTH OF CUPPLES STATION WILL BE PART OF
DOWNTOWN RESURGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Cupples Station was revolutionary _ in the early
1900s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The freight depot's internal distribution system and stylish
architecture became national models. St. Louis was at the top of
its game, too, as the fourth-largest city in America and host of
the 1904 World's Fair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, both took a back seat to glitzier competitors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cupples Station's rail service lost out to trucking and air
freight. St. Louis battled _ unsuccessfully _ against the suburbs
for residents and jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, civic leaders hope the rebirth of Cupples Station's
abandoned warehouses will be part of a downtown resurgence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the state historic tax credits helping make the project
possible could have an impact on Kansas City redevelopment as
well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cupples Station, which broke ground this month, is thought to be
St. Louis' largest redevelopment project since Union Station in the
mid-1980s. The plan features offices, restaurants and a luxury
hotel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first phase is scheduled to open in fall 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder if Cupples Station can compete with the suburbs'
head start and stand out among a sea of downtown hotels and
offices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But developers say its quirky, historic buildings could be an
asset, not a detriment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to offer the best of the urban and suburban
experiences,'' said Stan Mulvihill, project manager for McCormack
Baron and Associates. ``We're eliminating the problems of downtown
_ parking, crime _ and the problems of the suburbs _ sterility,
isolation and dependence on the car.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The office complex will feature a massive parking complex,
extensive security and proximity to a light-rail station. The old
buildings' spacious floors will give employers greater
flexibility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Built between 1899 and 1917, the brick buildings on downtown's
south side were designed by noted architects William S. Eames and
Thomas Crane Young. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recent decades, however, found Cupples Station abandoned and
facing the wrecking ball. Critics called the complex an eyesore.
Some buildings were demolished to clear room for Busch Stadium and
highway ramps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Cupples Station survived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Cupples Station again will be a model, this
time for its convergence of developers, government incentives and
financing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the luckiest public development official in St.
Louis in the last 25 years,'' said Mike Jones, deputy mayor for
development. ``There's no such thing as a `silver bullet' for
redevelopment. Everything that needed to be there came together for
this project.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three powerful forces emerged to save Cupples
Station. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- McCormack Baron, a nationally known developer of central-city
housing, chose Cupples to expand its focus into office and retail.
The St. Louis-based developer is known in Kansas City for its work
at Quality Hill, Villa Del Sol on the West Side and planned
apartments at 18th and Vine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The firm usually builds homes and waits for workers to fill
them. Sometimes it worked, as when DST Systems Inc. set up shop
near Quality Hill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Cupples Station, McCormack Baron isn't sitting passively. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The project will contain 400,000 square feet of offices and
50,000 square feet of retail space, more than the firm has
developed in 25 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``After this, we'll be better armed to go into a city and not
just build housing but build schools, work with social agencies and
do retail,'' said Tony Salazar, a Kansas City native and vice
president at the firm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This new knowledge gives us more ammunition when we go about
rebuilding. We don't have to be at the mercy of other
developers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Developers are using a state historic tax credit that allows
savings of 25 percent on the costs of rehabilitating historic
structures while preserving their character. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the tax credit was approved in 1997, officials with the
Department of Economic Development have received 26 applications.
Cupples Station, which could save $8 million, will be one of the
largest statewide projects to use the credit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State officials pushed the credit to revitalize downtowns in
small towns and urban areas. The credit has been used at such
projects as The Elms Resort &AMP; Spa in Excelsior Springs and the
Northland Lofts in North Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Historic Kansas City Foundation received
a state grant to determine how the tax credits could apply to the
West Bottoms district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Historic Preservation Services, a local consulting firm, has
been hired by a Kansas City economic development agency to
determine how those credits could apply to the burgeoning Freight
House District. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that can and will have a tremendous impact on
Kansas City,'' said Elizabeth Rosen, a partner with Historic
Preservation Services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Cupples Station, developers had to contend with foundations
on wood pilings and buildings not meant to withstand seismic
disturbances. Developers also are adding glass walkways and a civic
mall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones and developers insist that Cupples Station couldn't have
happened without the tax credit's boost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- When NationsBank bought St. Louis-based Boatmen's Bank in
1996, it brought its distinctive Community Development Corp. to
Missouri. The corporation is a for-profit arm that buys and
develops land. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The former NationsBank, now Bank of America, announced a $100
million commitment to downtown St. Louis. The bank led a venture to
buy the Cupples property in December for about $5.7 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The financing saved the property, giving planners time to find
developers. McCormack Baron and SunAmerica will team on the first
phase, a 224-room Westin Hotel that will include restaurants and a
conference center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary Campbell, Bank of America's market management executive for
the Midwest, said Cupples Station will be the community development
corporation's largest project in the region. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like McCormack Baron, the corporation specializes in housing.
But Campbell said attracting workers was more important. A Downtown
St. Louis Partnership study found office space to be ``very
tight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtowns are the heart and soul of a region. Housing is
important but jobs are really the economic engine that revives
large urban downtowns,'' she said. ``You have to lead with jobs.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Bush says U.S. military requires transformation
 &HT;    By Jena Heath and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Republican presidential front-runner George
W. Bush, a governor whose international policy credentials are
untested, called Thursday for ``a transformation of our military.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Bush plan are efforts to modernize the
nation's weapons, more clearly define the military's mission and
make life in uniform a more attractive job.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a former National Guard pilot, talked of a need to ``renew
the bond of trust between the American president and the American
military.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will defend the American people against missiles and terror,
and I will begin creating the military of the next century,'' Bush
told an audience that included cadets at The Citadel, a
state-supported military school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush painted a picture of a depleted military and talked about
soldiers on food stamps, low recruitment and stretched resources.
He pledged to boost defense spending, but gave no total amount,
offering only glimpses of what his priorities would be.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, his top defense adviser, said Bush believes
the federal budget surplus ``will cover all of his priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called for ``orderly and timely withdrawal from places like
Kosovo and Bosnia,'' bolstering technology and anti-terrorism
efforts and immediate deployment of an antiballistic missile
system.
</P>
<P>
   He also said his secretary of defense would conduct a
top-to-bottom review of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will give the secretary a broad mandate to challenge the
status quo and envision a new architecture of American defense for
decades to come,'' Bush said. But he offered few specifics on how
he would achieve his broad range of goals.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve deployment of an antiballistic missile system _ a
goal that harkens back to his father's presidency _ Bush said he
would be willing to withdraw the United States from compliance with
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have a solemn obligation to protect the American people
and our allies, not to protect arms control agreements signed
almost 30 years ago,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said the governor is willing to scrap the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does not get Russian agreement to that, he is prepared
to withdraw under terms of that treaty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sought guidance in crafting his overall defense and
foreign policy views from a cadre of experts long on experience in
the Reagan and Bush administrations. Retired general Colin Powell
reviewed Thursday's speech. And Rice was a top National Security
Council aide in his father's administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very concerned, and has been concerned from the first
time we talked with him a long time ago, about deteriorating morale
in the armed forces,'' said Rice, noting that some reports have
shown that as much as two-thirds of military housing is
substandard.
</P>
<P>
   Bush laid much of the blame for the military's state on the
Clinton administration, saying too few soldiers were being sent on
too many far-flung peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work hard to find political solutions that allow an
orderly and timely withdrawal from places like Kosovo and Bosnia,''
he said. ``We will encourage our allies to take a broader role. We
will not be hasty. But we will not be permanent peacekeepers,
dividing warring parties.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, chief spokesman for the White House's National
Security Council, challenged Bush's accusation that the military
has been overused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has made one of his key national security
priorities making sure that our armed forces are the best-trained,
best-led and best-equipped fighting force in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the Bush proposals mirror those offered by
President Clinton, Bush is more intent on moving to new technology.
His plan calls for $20 billion worth of military research and
development between 2001 and 2006. That would be in addition to
approximately $173 billion proposed by Clinton for those years.
Bush said his message to the military is simple: ``We intend to
change your structure, but we will respect your culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said Bush supports the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on
gays in the military but might want to separate the genders in
basic training ``at the basic level, at least in the first several
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how dramatically military spending and structure
would change remained open even with the more detailed look at
Bush's ideas. He pledged to ``replace existing programs with new
technologies and new strategies,'' and to ``skip a generation of
technology.'' He did not say which programs or weapons would be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged a $20 billion increase in research and development
spending over five years; a $1 billion pay increase package that
would average $750 per person and include ``targeted bonuses'' for
soldiers with special skills.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Danvers, former senior director for legislative affairs at
the National Security Council, questioned how Bush would find the
money to pay for his plans and said his attacks on Clinton's Kosovo
policies were unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to spend the surplus on tax cuts, then it
seems to me it becomes complicated to make the kind of increases
that he suggests,'' Danvers said. ``. . . The mission wasn't
open-ended. The mission was to secure the peace and to do it a
certain way so that we wouldn't have to go back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush invoked both former President Franklin Roosevelt, architect
of the New Deal, and Ronald Reagan, when he talked about the
current generation, ``a generation after the hard but clear
struggle against an evil empire.''
</P>
<P>
   At once eager to ally himself with that generation and distance
himself from it, Bush did something he rarely does _ invoked, if
hazily, the image of his father, the former president and World War
II hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen leaders who fought a world war and organized the
peace,'' he said. ``We have seen power exercised without swagger
and influence displayed without bluster. We have seen the modesty
of true strength, the humility of real greatness. We have seen
American power tempered by American character. And I have seen all
of this personally and closely and clearly.''

YOUTH LEADERS DISCUSS CHANGE IN MINISTRIES AFTER SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN ROUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The slaying of seven people during a youth
rally at Wedgwood Baptist Church last week has prompted youth
leaders to study the structure of their ministries, Christian
leaders said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people, most of them youth ministry leaders and
seminary students, attended a symposium at Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary on how to help youths deal with tragedy in
light of the Sept. 15 Wedgwood shooting. Seven people were killed
and seven more injured before the gunman, 47-year-old Larry Gene
Ashbrook, fatally shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Liebrum, director of human resources for the Baptist
General Convention of Texas in Dallas, said he was dumbfounded when
he learned that several students at the Wedgwood rally mistook
Ashbrook's rampage for part of a skit. As a result, they did not
run when he started firing, witnesses have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As youth leaders, we have to have another thought about these
kinds of skits that depict violence,'' Liebrum said. ``Certainly,
they catch your attention. Maybe in this instance it may have saved
lives _ people didn't panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with all the things kids are exposed to ... there is a
fine line between reality and drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Derouen, youth minister at Travis Avenue Baptist Church
in Fort Worth, said it's difficult for youth leaders to see
children lying in a casket if they have taught, prayed with and
loved them.
</P>
<P>
   He urged counselors to grieve with surviving family members,
even if words seem ``meaningless,'' and to share stories about
their children. And as time passes, he said, contact them, because
the hurt may be even deeper months after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Lana Bull, 23, a seminary student who was at Wedgwood the night
of the shooting, said counselors should be careful about telling
survivors that God has a purpose for their lives, because it places
pressure on the survivor to discover that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can make them ignore the healing (stage) and get on with
their purpose,'' she said. ``This is a time of healing.''
</P>
<P>
   In other shooting-related news, the Texas Rangers Baseball Club
is expected to match the estimated $55,000 that Rangers players
have collected for the Wedgwood Victims Fund. Rangers owner Tom
Hicks is expected to contribute to the fund, too.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the ``Healing Bear,'' the stuffed animal that originated
as a symbol of hope to survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing in
1995, has been sent to Wedgwood members, the Denver Post reported
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The toy bear was last at Columbine High School in Colorado,
where students are recovering from the slaying of their peers and a
teacher. Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis sent a note to
Wedgwood, saying in part, ``We hope that the violence will end, and
you will not have to send the bear to another community.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at the church was available Thursday to comment.

   Problem is, Melsby's more suited to being ``a'' man than ``the''
man. His routes are flawless, his hands are claws and he has a
sneaky way of getting open at the most important moments _ as when
he caught a 61-yard touchdown pass last year to beat Oregon State
with 21 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Melsby makes big plays, but he's not a typical big-play
receiver. He lacks Poli-Dixon's long stride and knack for turning
short passes into long gains. He lacks Farmer's athleticism and
Mitchell's speed. He's simply a surehanded receiver who perfectly
complements his more flamboyant, more athletic teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are such big-play guys, they can do things I
can't,'' Melsby said. ``I'm kind of the possession receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-year senior, Melsby missed the 1996 season with torn
knee ligaments and most of the 1997 season due to post-injury
illness and exhaustion. He started slowly last year, then finished
fast with the game-winner at Oregon State, three catches at Miami
and three in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he did not drop a pass in the training camp and is
second on the team with nine receptions. But without Poli-Dixon,
his production must increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much more comfortable with the offense,'' Melsby said.
``Plus I think you have an attitude when you're a senior that,
`This is it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wait 'til next year: Poli-Dixon isn't sure if he'll need
surgery on his broken right wrist, but he doesn't expect to play
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to redshirt,'' he said. ``It's kind of disappointing
because the Pac-10 season's coming up. But there are some
positives: I still have two years (of eligibility) left.''
</P>
<P>
   Players are eligible for medical redshirts if they don't play in
more than three games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Review of the week: Defensive tackle Pete Holland, a history
major and six-time member of the director's honor roll, has agreed
to review a book each week for the Daily News. This week: ``A Man
in Full'' by Tom Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   ` ``Charlie Croker was a man in full. He had a back like a
Jersey bull.' Such is the adventurer of Southern lore, and the
protagonist of Tom Wolfe's latest novel. But beneath Croker's vast
athletic and financial conquests exists a man whose role as
namesake is as much a bane as it is a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon this simple foundation grows Wolfe's picture of
contemporary America, not only in the prestigious Buckhead section
of Croker's Atlanta, but also in Croker's vast empire, which is
crumbling under mounting debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through Croker and other characters, Wolfe uses his artful and
incomparable language to define _ and redefine _ the powers of
loyalty and emasculation in today's racially charged world of high
finance and social politics.''

MIRACLE WORKER

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He is uncomfortable with the question, maybe even
slightly embarrassed. It goes straight against his nature. But what
is Dr. Frank Jobe to do? Honesty and modesty are what he knows.
</P>
<P>
   So if Jobe cannot deny he has made a difference in the world,
neither does he particularly relish acknowledging it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think you have, and I do now sort of see it,''
Jobe said. ``But if you'd said that 15 years ago, I'd have said,
`Well, I'm just an ordinary doctor. I'm lucky.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is a monumental admission by the unpretentious Jobe, if an
almost painful one. Yet the good fortune went to those touched by
his remarkable gift, either directly or from the countless others
who adopted his innovative work. Surely, there has been nothing
ordinary about his career.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that during the past 25 years, no man has had
a greater impact on baseball than Jobe. Not some powerfully built
player with bat or executive with pen, but this gentle North
Carolina native with the deft scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Who else developed a pair of revolutionary surgeries that
enabled thousands of pitchers to avoid career-ending injury,
allowing them to continue to entertain, win games and make
millions? Who else used biomechanical engineering to pioneer motion
analysis on the act of throwing? Who designed a series of exercises
to avoid arm and shoulder injuries, now in common usage throughout
baseball and called the Jobe Exercises? Who has trained so many
other doctors and physical therapists at the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never sat and talked with him about his impact,'' said
veteran Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, who has known Jobe since he
became a team doctor 36 years ago. ``It's not the thing you do with
Frank, because he's just so self-effacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you think of all the people who have gone through
that clinic, his impact is amazing _ amazing. Then he's sending out
his disciples all over the country. Just remarkable. Yet through it
all, he's a very humble man. Frank is what Frank is. He's just a
beautiful man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe is the most famous and influential orthopedic surgeon of
his time. As with followers climbing the mountain in search of
wisdom, doctors come from all over the country, all over the world,
to Los Angeles to learn at the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly considered one of the premier fathers of modern
sports medicine,'' said Dr. James Andrews, the internationally
renowned orthopedic surgeon from Alabama. ``Without his influence,
baseball players' sports-medicine care would probably still be in
the dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Jobe rose to prominence when he came up with the
radical idea of transplanting a tendon and wrapping it into an
elbow ligament. The concept had been used on hands and to reinforce
joints on polio patients but never in the elbow, never on a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But 25 years ago on Sept. 25, baseball was forever changed when
Jobe performed the operation on Dodgers left-hander Tommy John.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now Dr. Jobe is going to give me a sterling-silver
ligament,'' John said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe told John at the time he had a ``one in one hundred''
chance of ever pitching again. John went on to win more games after
the surgery than before. Soon the operation became commonplace
throughout the country. Jobe estimates he's performed between 1,000
and 2,000 ``Tommy John'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy John surgery now is almost looked upon as an
improvement,'' said Mets right-hander Orel Hershiser. ``Guys who
come out of Tommy John surgery are throwing better than they did
prior.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was Jobe's second pioneering surgery. This time he
went from the elbow to the shoulder, designing a less-invasive
procedure that enabled him to reconstruct a shoulder that had
become unstable with stretched-out ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe had already performed the procedure on NFL quarterback Jim
McMahon and golfer Jerry Pate but never on a major-league pitcher
required to throw 90-mph fastballs some 100 times a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing he said at the beginning of our meeting was,
`I'm sorry,' so I knew it was really serious,'' Hershiser said.
</P>
<P>
   As with John, Hershiser _ then with the Dodgers _ knew his
choice was to take the chance or never pitch again. He didn't
hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation proceeded his advice on the surgery,''
Hershiser said. ``He probably prescribed the most radical thing
that could have happened to me and I didn't second-guess it all. I
didn't want a second opinion, I didn't need anybody else to tell me
what was wrong with me and how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser has now won more games since the surgery than before.
He's also earned himself another $20 million in contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If Jobe had performed all his surgeries for a percentage of
future earnings _ instead of the workman's-comp fees normally paid
by clubs _ he would probably be the wealthiest physician in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he takes one percent from me, that's $200,000,'' Hershiser
said. ``Everyone else, he'd have $50 million _ no, way more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He's made a lot of wealthy athletes a lot wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it, of course,'' Jobe said. ``But I think
most of them are very appreciative of what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe looks at athletes not by the uniform they wear, but the
help they need. It was a principle he learned as a medical staff
sergeant in the Army's 101st Airborne Division during World War II,
a stint that saw him briefly captured by Germans at Bastogne before
escaping. In war, doctors help anyone, even the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest feeling of satisfaction is going to a ballgame
and seeing people you've operated on play well,'' Jobe said. ``I'm
a fan of people who have been operated on, more than I am of
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Jobe attended a private junior college in
Tennessee. Then he decided to use the GI bill to go to college in
Southern California, studying at the University of Loma Linda
Medical School and doing a residency at Los Angeles County
hospital, where he met Dr. Robert Kerlan.
</P>
<P>
   He practiced three years as a family doctor in Westchester to
pay off school loans before returning to medical school at USC for
an orthopedic residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He delivered over a hundred babies,'' John said. ``Then he
started operating on the big babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerlan invited Jobe to join him, and on a handshake the
Kerlan-Jobe partnership was formed in 1964. Kerlan had already been
named the Dodgers' team physician, but Kerlan-Jobe would go on to
serve the Lakers, Angels, Kings, Ducks, USC, the PGA Tour and PGA
Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   And Jobe would go on to international acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there must have been someone looking after me,'' Jobe
said. ``I've been pretty lucky to get through the war, getting into
medical school, graduating, taking care of the Dodgers, the PGA
Tour _ all those things just seem to come to me without me hardly
knowing it, and they were there. They turned out to be wonderful
opportunities to do good for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 74, Jobe continues to work full time. He has cut back to
three days of surgery and now mostly assists. But he puts in full
days at the new Kerlan-Jobe Clinic in West Los Angeles, has another
year left on his contract with the Dodgers and hopes to sign
another.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Beverly, married for 40 years, have four
prosperous sons _ two doctors, an attorney and a banker. Through it
all, Jobe has remained remarkably unchanged. His success and fame
have had no outward impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not been touched by celebrity,'' Scully said. ``He's
like the great surgeon he is _ minimal scars.''
</P>
<P>
   For a revolutionary, he has almost a pacifist bearing. There is
a calmness about him, a pleasant peacefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is, Frank Jobe is probably one of the nicest,
kindest human beings that God ever put on this earth,'' John said.
``Not only is he a brilliant surgeon, he's just a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tollefson, the Mets physical therapist who worked at
Kerlan-Jobe for three years and spent five years with the Dodgers'
minor-league clubs, said he sometimes saw other doctors envious of
Jobe's medical standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some hostility and jealousy toward him in that
area,'' Tollefson said. ``But I've never seen him do anything but
act honorably in situations of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much respect for him. He always did the right thing
and was very gracious. He doesn't know everything. He doesn't get
it right all of the time. But he's obviously very good at what he
does. And he's one of the most honorable, humble, gracious men
around.''
</P>
<P>
   John understands he is doomed to be recognized more for more
than his actual career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be known more for the (elbow) surgery than I will for 288
wins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe would prefer to be known for the series of exercises he
developed to strengthen the arm and prevent injuries, but he, too,
recognizes that wish is futile.
</P>
<P>
   He was given a gift, and realized it early in his career. His
long, soft fingers know how to play no instrument save the scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jobe likens a gifted surgeon's ability to that of an
artist who must first visualize what it is he is trying to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgery is essentially the same thing,'' he said. ``You
know if you have a three-dimensional picture of the shoulder, you
know what's under the skin and where it is in relationship to the
other things, so you can do a lot of work where you don't actually
see it, but you know you're getting it right.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gotten most of it right throughout his 37-year career,
leaving a legacy matched by few before him. His has been a life of
success stories, an impact that will continue, whether he planned
his life out or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (things have) happened because I wasn't smart enough to
plan,'' he said. ``But things couldn't have happened any better if
I'd planned it. When I've thought, `How would I change it?' _ I
wouldn't change a thing.''

A NIGHT FOR WARM EMBRACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Greeting guests at the door with hard questions is
not the New York Philharmonic's idea of hospitality. So Thursday
evening's opening of the season at Avery Fisher Hall _ a prelude to
dining and dancing and a subject of scrutiny by Public Television _
became instead what pop songs of old used to call ``a warm
embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   In they came: the dressed, the overdressed, with sprinklings
everywhere of the fashion-free. (Hardcore classical music audiences
are not known for their elegance.) Symphony subscribers form a kind
of club, and given the cries of recognition and well-kissed cheeks,
it was clear that old acquaintances were not forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Mstislav Rostropovich, the Philharmonic's visiting
soloist, was escalating warm embrace to bear hug as he smothered
Dvorak's ever-touching Cello Concerto under his oversized
personality. The other music was an equally old and secure friend:
Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Rostropovich and Kurt Masur, who conducted, behaved like fast
friends with different ideas about music. The first, at 72, is past
the string player's usual age of retirement but he soldiers on with
customary effusiveness. The big gestures can get technically messy,
but Rostropovich commands the long melodic line with great
certainty. Superior string players (and he is one) invest quiet
playing with an implosive character: an inwardly moving energy that
draws the listener to it.
</P>
<P>
   As Rostropovich orated, Masur's Philharmonic was scrupulous: a
little dry, but tender where necessary. The Tchaikovsky, in much
the same way, came across as an earnest but loving lecture on sober
living: a characteristic this music does not usually advertise. The
sterness was tempered by lovely lingering episodes, and rescued by
the splendid qualities of the orchestra's soloists. Philip Myers'
horn solo in the second movement of the symphony was beautifully
done. In both pieces, Glenn Dicterow, violinist, and Stanley
Drucker, clarinetist, made lovely contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Tchaikovsky piece will be a better fit at Friday night's
first subscription concert, when it joins Stravinsky's
``Pulcinella'' Suite and ``Capriccio'' for piano and orchestra. If
Dvorak and Tchaikovsky share a universal belovedness, the
Tchaikovsky-Stravinsky bond has deeper roots, especially the shared
desire to be loyally Russian and cosmopolitan at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's composers occuopied just about parallel life
spans, though Tchaikovsky died in 1893 while Dvorak, living a more
stable and less tortured life, lasted into the 20th century. It is
matters of temperament that separate these two pieces: the Dvorak,
written in 1895, is assured and leisurely, with a horn solo in the
first movement so languidly beautiful that it seems to descend from
above. (Again the player was Myers.)
</P>
<P>
   The Symphony, finished seven years earlier, is the music of a
troubled man unafraid of dramatizing his private turmoils for
public consumption. Tchaikovsky predicts 20th-century anxiety.
Dvorak celebrates a certitude that we have just about forgotten.

OLYMPIC TRIALS GIVE WRESTLER SHOT AT DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ High finance will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Slay of Amarillo is speculating strictly in the futures
market right now.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in a way, are we _ the cities of Arlington, Fort Worth,
Dallas and all points adjacent and in between.
</P>
<P>
   The area's Olympic future is out there, as long as it has one.
But first, the appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   Slay's Olympic saga, for instance. When he left in 1993 to study
finance at Ivy League Penn University, he never imagined that he
would one day be returning home to Texas to talk about competing
for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Slay is a wrestler, as is 1996 Olympic silver medalist Matt
Ghaffari.
</P>
<P>
   While you were out snickering, trying to decide whether the
area's fantasy of hosting the 2012 Olympic Games was full- or
half-baked, somebody made Dallas the interim capital of amateur
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   From June 21-24, 2000, Dallas' Reunion Arena will stage the U.S.
Olympic Wrestling Trials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, on May 27-28, 2000, the Las Colinas area of Irving
will host the first-ever U.S. Olympic trials in the sport of
triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   As Kevin Sullivan of the Dallas 2012 Committee said yesterday at
a luncheon formally announcing both trials, ``Don't do the math and
figure out how old you're going to be in 2012.''
</P>
<P>
   His point is that the two Olympic trials are real and they're
both less than nine months away. And if you cherish the Olympics,
you'll be moved by the competitions that select the U.S. Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   For every up-close-and-personal portrait that you see on the
Olympic telecasts, there is a quilt full of great stories _ a lot
of them tear-stained _ at an Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that the Olympic trials in my sport were going to
be in Dallas, I figured it was destiny,'' said Slay, who was once a
5-foot-8, all-district linebacker at Amarillo's Tascosa High.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my family and my friends have never seen me compete in
wrestling. It has to be destiny that this is going to happen back
here in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it took a little more than that. With the impetus of
the Dallas 2012 bid, the Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Sports
Commission has actively and aggressively sought out events like the
wrestling and triathlon trials. A decision is expected next week on
whether the Frisco Superdrome will play host to next year's U.S.
Olympic Track Cycling Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 12 months, there are also major meetings or
competitions scheduled here in softball, weightlifting,
canoe/kayak, soccer and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Don't do the math. As Paul Winston of the sports commission
said, ``The Olympics are the icing on the cake for us.'' The
preliminary events that have already been awarded to the area are
the ``engine'' that can boost the Dallas 2012 bid in the eyes of
the eventual selectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you guys pull this off,'' Ghaffari said at yesterday's
luncheon, ``you guys can do 10 times better than Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Triathlon will be making its Olympic debut at the 2000 Sydney
Games. Amid enticing competition from Los Angeles and Indianapolis,
USA Triathlon officials chose Las Colinas to host its first trials.
</P>
<P>
   The event will consist of a 1,500-meter open swim, followed by
40 kilometers of cycling and a 10-kilometer run. The swimming
portion will take place in the canals of Las Colinas _ a
made-to-order venue for a publicity-savvy sport.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of Slay coming home to compete were a lot longer. While
wrestling has long thrived in neighboring Oklahoma, it wasn't until
two years ago that the UIL staged an official state championship
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Slay's father had wrestled at the University of Alabama and got
his son started in the sport at the age of 6. At Penn, Slay was
able to earn a degree in finance from the Wharton School of
Business, which he has used as a springboard to ... wrestle.
</P>
<P>
   At a tournament in Sydney last year, Slay defeated the Japanese
bronze medalist from the Atlanta Olympics. His dream suddenly
seemed closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of offers from different companies, but I figured
that that's something I can do from the time I'm 28 on,'' Slay
said. ``There's plenty of time to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed me with a gift, and I decided I'm going to
take advantage of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Slay and Ghaffari plan to be at Reunion Arena next June.
The losers _ and often the winners at an Olympic Trials _ will be
shedding real tears.

1958 WORLD CUP WAS PELE'S STAGE SIMON GONZALEZ

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With 99 days left in the 1900s, No. 99 in the 100 most memorable
sports moments of the century
</P>
<P>
   The goal was a thing of beauty, one of the greatest anywhere,
anytime.
</P>
<P>
   The young man, scarcely more than a boy, had his back to the net
and a defender closely marking him. His teammate passed to him
anyway, a looping ball he received with his thigh.
</P>
<P>
   He neatly trapped it, then let the ball drop to his foot and
flicked it back over his head. He spun around the startled
defender, and volleyed a shot into the back of the net past a
diving goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The player's name was Edson Arantes do Nascimento, but from that
moment on he became known to the world by his simple sobriquet:
Pele.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was the 1958 World Cup final in Stockholm, Sweden.
The best soccer players from around the globe gathered for the
quadrennial tournament to determine the champion of the world's
most popular sport.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the best proved to be Brazil, and the best of the
Brazilians was the youngest player in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The '58 World Cup was a coming out party for Pele, a precocious
17-year-old who made his international debut for Brazil a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   International soccer typically is a game for men. Maturity and
experience are as important as skill. Teen-agers need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   But Pele was simply too good, too talented, not to play.
</P>
<P>
   An injury kept him out of Brazil's first two matches, one of
which was a 0-0 draw against an England squad with a stout defense.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to his inside-left forward position for the third
game, and although he didn't score, he was clearly the best player
in a 2-0 victory over the Soviet Union that clinched Brazil's spot
atop the Group 4 standings.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Wales in the quarterfinals. The Welsh played a
conservative, defensive style, but Pele scored his first goal of
the tournament to give Brazil a 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   He was even better in the semifinals, scoring a hat-trick in the
second half of a 5-2 victory against France to put Brazil into the
final against Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 49,737 packed into Rasunda Stadium on June 28, hoping
to see the beloved home team pull off the victory. Brazil was at
its best, using its short passes and footwork to put on a beautiful
display of soccer, but the Swedes still had hope when they trailed
2-1 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Pele, though, squashed those hopes with his brilliant goal.
Brazil went on to a 5-2 victory, with the talented teen-ager
scoring the final goal with a header. It was his second of the
final, and his sixth in Brazil's past three games.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable achievement for anyone, let alone a
17-year-old in the high-pressure environment of a World Cup.

THE WAITING IS THE HARDEST PLAYING ON MONDAY NIGHT

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowboys' top draft pick Ebenezer Ekuban is writing a diary that
will appear weekly in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram this season.
\Nsubheds:Saturday I went to Dat Nguyen's house to watch the
Trinidad-De La Hoya fight on pay-per-view. I was rooting for
Trinidad, but I thought De La Hoya won the fight. De La Hoya
spanked him good, but the judges gave it to Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   That was OK, because I was still mad at De La Hoya for beating
my man from Ghana, Ike Quartey, back in February.
\Nsubheds:Sunday/Monday The hard part about a ``Monday Night
Football'' game, I found out, is that it's so drawn out. You do a
lot of sitting around and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, we checked into the team hotel. I tried to get
myself into a relaxed state of mind. Monday, we had one long
meeting, but mostly I just stayed in my room and read over my
objectives ... things I set for myself to accomplish in the game. I
went over plays. I read a lot. I watched television.
</P>
<P>
   Montel Williams was on TV. Man, that's when I remembered it was
Monday. No NFL games, no college games. Just talk shows.
\Nsubheds:Tuesday We beat Atlanta and that felt good, but I didn't
feel like I had a real good game myself. I had about the same
amount of playing time as I had against Washington, although I did
go in for three offensive plays at tight end on goal-line this
week.
</P>
<P>
   I was supposed to be the lead-block on the first one. Emmitt
didn't score, not on that play, but it was kind of fun just to get
a hit on Eugene Robinson. He's a player I've watched a long time in
the NFL. I didn't see the jersey number until after the play was
over ... yeah, that was kind of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt did score on the next play. That time, I was supposed to
make a drive block on Chuck Smith, but he had so much penetration,
and I lost inside leverage. But because Emmitt is Emmitt, he just
bounced it outside and scored, and I all I did was make sure Chuck
Smith couldn't get to him.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, Greg Ellis had an 87-yard interception return
for a touchdown. Greg and I were teammates at North Carolina, and I
see that he has kept his speed.
</P>
<P>
   I was worried that Danny Kanell might catch him, though, and
Greg knew that we would have been on him mercilessly if a
``quarterback'' caught him from behind.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Al Unser Jr. is a two-time CART champion with 31 career victories.
Bryan Herta is a respected driver coming off a victory two weeks
ago at Monterey, Calif. Roberto Moreno is known as ``Super Sub''
for his uncanny ability to race well while subbing in another
driver's car.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are three drivers with vastly different backgrounds, but
all three have something in common heading into Sunday's
Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of Houston: They are looking for cars to
drive next season.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a job as a CART driver is difficult, and it's becoming
harder to keep that job. Even a guy like Michael Andretti, who is
secure in his spot on the Newman-Haas team, understands there are
no guarantees in this business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure out there, and it's tough to keep
these jobs,'' Andretti said. ``It's not easy. It's not just driving
the race car anymore. It's being a public relations person and a
lot of other things, but it's all part of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser is the best-known driver in limbo. He and Roger Penske are
going their separate ways after six seasons together. Unser has not
won since 1995, but the 37-year-old racer firmly believes he still
can be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a race-car driver, and I'm a damn good one,'' Unser said.
``I've got a long time left in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   But it appears Unser's time in CART is over, although he says
reports that he already has signed with Rick Galles to drive in the
Indy Racing League next year are not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the teams I'm talking to,'' Unser said. ``That's
really all I can say. I hope something will be done in the next
three or four weeks so I can make an announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser said he also has talked to Houston's A.J. Foyt and CART
team owner Cal Wells III about the NASCAR Winston Cup teams the two
are starting next season. But Foyt has said he can't afford the $3
million annual salary Unser wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still are talking to Cal Wells,'' Unser said. ``That would
be a great opportunity to go to NASCAR, because I think his team
will be very good. I think it will be a first-class ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Unser really want to leave open-wheel racing for a
stock-car series that has 34 events a year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really, but business is business,'' he said. ``NASCAR is
the most popular series in America, and being able to race in front
of that many people appeals to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drivers there make a lot of money in their merchandising.
I'm finding out the NASCAR guys take less money in salary and keep
their merchandising profits. I prefer open-wheel racing, but if it
happens that the best deal is a car that has fenders, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser has one stipulation that would need to be included in any
NASCAR agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any NASCAR deal definitely would include me driving in the
Indy 500,'' he said. ``That's part of the negotiations. I've been
away from Indy too long. I missed the show (failing to qualify in
1995) the last time I was there. So I have some personal issues I
want to address there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Unser joins the IRL next season, he would become the first
big-name CART driver to switch to the rival league. Is he afraid of
being viewed as a defector?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to be put in any position,'' Unser said. ``I
feel both series stand on their own. The two leagues have kind of
leveled out in popularity, attendance and TV ratings, but the whole
thing is down. That's why the two leagues need to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser also said he has one major goal left before he ends his
association with Penske.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main focus right now is to get Roger his 100th win,'' Unser
said. ``He has given me so much in the past. I want to be able to
do that for him before I leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta would like to get a couple more wins before his time in
the Shell Ford/Reynard for Team Rahal comes to an end. Herta knew
before he won at Laguna Seca that he likely was trying to impress
potential new employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it helped,'' Herta said. ``That's certainly
not for me to decide. All I know is I am the same guy that I was
three weeks ago. That win came at the right time, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta has been driving for Bobby Rahal's team for the last four
seasons and has two victories. Herta said he won't leave the team
with any hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always looked to Bobby for advice,'' he said. ``No
matter what happens, we will always be friends. He has been a great
influence to me on and off the track.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Herta and Unser have cars to drive this weekend in
Houston, which is more than Moreno can say. After finishing a
career-best second at Laguna Seca in the Kmart Ford/Swift, Moreno
found himself out of a job this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Fittipaldi is returning this weekend to the Kmart car
after missing five races because of a head injury he suffered in a
practice-session accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too late to get a ride for this weekend,'' Moreno said.
``But it's possible I will be driving in the last two races. I'll
just have to play it by ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno also competed in eight races this season in the Motorola
Mercedes/Reynard for Mark Blundell, who was out with a fractured
vertebra. In his 13 starts, Moreno has six top-10 finishes,
including three top-fives, and has scored points in eight events.
</P>
<P>
   It's an impressive showing for someone trying to get the most
out of a car set up for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always thought Roberto is an awesome driver,'' Andretti
said. ``I think he is totally underrated. He could lead any team,
and he can win races. To me, his whole career has involved a lot of
bad luck and not being in the right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno is in Houston this weekend just in case Fittipaldi has a
problem in his first race back. Moreno is rumored to be close to an
agreement to drive full-time for Patrick Racing next season, so he
hopes he doesn't need to carry a sign here that says: ``Will Work
For A Ride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of that makes me sad,'' Moreno said. ``I hope I've
done enough to earn myself a full-time ride. It's a lot easier to
be able to start a season and work on a package that is set up for
you. That's what has been missing for me. But I've tried hard to
establish myself as a driver, and I think I've done that this
year.''

NOW AND AGAIN HARD TO
 DESCRIBE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  (UNDATED) - It's a lot harder to
describe Now and Again than it is to enjoy it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's drama, comedy, sci-fi, inter national terrorism, even a
little sing ing all thrown into the mix. It turns out like a good
bowl of chili _ somehow, all the ingredients come together in a
tasty combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a sneaky romance,'' creator Glenn Gordon Caron
said in an interview earlier this summer. ``That's the part that
intrigues me the most. It's about families, it's about mortality,
it's about resurrec tion, it's about _ I don't want to get
overblown about it, because at the end of the day, it's just an
entertain ment. It doesn't aspire to . . . change our life.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a certain black comedic way, it's about the role of
government, it's about big companies. It's not an accident that
it's set in New York City and photographed in New York City. It's
very much about little man, big circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   Caron, as you can see, is a chatty fellow. That's a good thing,
as anyone who remembers his earlier creation, Moonlighting, will
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always trying to see just how much heartfelt stuff you
could put in there and then butt it right up against sort of crazy
comedy,'' he said of Moonlighting. ``And it's not that different
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true. What Now and Again is really about, sort of, is an
insurance agent (John Goodman, in a one-shot role) who is killed in
a subway accident. His body is destroyed but his brain isn't. So
the government secretly plants his brain into the body of the
perfect physical speci men it's been developing. (You didn't know?)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is all very hush-hush, so the modern version of
the Six Million Dollar Man can't make contact with his wife and
teenage daughter (don't count on it).
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Haysbert is fantastic as the government doctor who
carries out the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this guy got into a lab and created an artificial
liver, an artificial heart, all these wonderful things that went
into this young man's body,'' Haysbert said this summer. ``And I
thought it was very cool that he actually built a White man.''
(Haysbert is Black.)
</P>
<P>
   His dealings with Eric Close, the government-issue hunk, promise
to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Lowe, meanwhile, is outstand ing as a ruthless insurance
executive. Perfectly despicable.
</P>
<P>
   And none of this is even the best part.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction belongs to the first five minutes of the first
episode. It's as good as anything you are likely to see on
television, this or any year. It involves an international
terrorist on a Tokyo subway.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to give anything else away, because the way it
builds is part of its effectiveness. Just know that the scene is
genuinely chilling. (It also makes good use of the great Beatles
song I Am the Walrus.)
</P>
<P>
   One more tip: Don't mistake this for the similarly titled ABC
drama Once and Again. Please. That sappy series ostensibly deals
with all life's big issues in a realistic way. Now and Again deals
with life in a much more fantastic form, yet manages to ring more
true. ...
</P>
<P>
   Other new Friday night shows:
</P>
<P>
   Harsh Realm: The latest series from X-Files mastermind Chris
Carter is a far better effort than the relentlessly dark
Millennium. Scott Bairstow stars as a decorated soldier trapped in
a virtual-reality war game. If you try too hard to make sense of
everything, you'll get a headache, not answers. Who cares? You're
watching TV, not taking the SAT. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Odd Man Out: Erik von Detten plays a teenage boy growing up in a
house full of girls and women. Rather risque for ABC's TGIF lineup.
Which is the only noteworthy thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Love &AMP; Money: Rich girl falls for handyman. Parents outraged.
View ers bored. Show canceled. (That last is just a prediction.)
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Caulfield: Year One: Sean Maher stars as a 19-year-old who
chooses policework over college. Not as bad as that sounds, but not
great, either.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Hill: Pleasant enough ani mated series. But a cartoon is
a tough sell on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cold Feet: Includes the best scene of a naked man serenading a
woman with a rose in his rear you'll ever see on television.
Actually, the whole thing is oddly charming, if slight. Reach Bill
Goodykoontz at (602) 444-8974 or at bill.goody koontz &LR; pni.com via

KELLY'S ALL HEART, HANDS AND HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kareem Kelly has more tools than a carpenter.
Before he's through, the freshman could add on another wing to
Heritage Hall, the place on the USC campus that houses the school's
hallowed athletic history.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has height, heart, great hands, a gazelle's gait and as
many gears as a Ferrari. The only thing he appears to be lacking is
experience and that's arriving via overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The sinewy split end has received plenty of passes (11) in his
first two games as a collegian but probably not enough credit. It's
too easy to look at Kelly, who will replace Windrell Hayes in the
Trojans' starting lineup Saturday at Oregon, and conclude he's just
naturally equipped for success.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, if legends were constructed on superior parts
alone, Kelly's senior teammate R. Jay Soward by now would be a
monument dwarfing the Tommy Trojan statue in the middle of campus.
</P>
<P>
   The reason he's not is in his first three years of college,
Soward didn't do as much on his own to raise his level of play as
Kelly has in his first three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the tennis ball Kelly squeezed, alternating hands, for
the duration of an extended interview the other day. If he had to
sit still for 30 minutes, he figured he might as well work on his
hand strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to help me catch the football,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   He also had football (and only football, he swears) in mind when
he signed up with a teammate and 18 women for a two-unit ballet
class that meets twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it to help me with my flexibility and balance,'' Kelly
said. ``Anything to get that edge over the next person on the
football field.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, about the only thing he hasn't stretched in the class is
his ego. Indeed, Kelly said anybody who thinks he has made a
painless transition from high school to college hasn't seen him at
the barre in his sweatpants and T-shirt and special ballet shoes,
straining to keep up with the women in leotards who look like they
were born with one leg raised and bent behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Kelly said. ``You get really sore.''
</P>
<P>
   So now you know: The stiff back that restricted Kelly to
noncontact work at practices this week might not be entirely a
residual effect of having made six acrobatic catches last weekend
against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, receivers are fast becoming an endangered
species in L.A. Hayes, a stalwart senior who was sophomore
quarterback Carson Palmer's security blanket, has a high ankle
sprain. Ditto for UCLA standout senior Danny Farmer. Another Bruin,
Brian Poli-Dixon, is lost for the season with a fractured right
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   One receiver's pain is another's break. Earlier in the week,
Kelly sounded ready to tuck the opportunity in the crook of his arm
and run with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm on top of my game, I don't see any way a defensive back
can stop me,'' Kelly said. ``I'm not a one-dimensional player. I
have speed, (soft) hands and I play physical.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kelly gets knocked off stride by a defensive back, he's apt
to return to the huddle with his head bowed. Not to worry. He isn't
brooding, just reviewing the play in his mind, editing and adapting
as he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is an astute student of the game. He notices if an
opponent is back on his heels or leaning forward before the snap.
He scans players' body language in an effort to read their
intentions. On the field, the only thing churning faster than his
legs is his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is smart in ways that don't show up on standardized tests.
His football IQ is off the charts. It doesn't hurt that he attended
a high school - Long Beach Poly - that is the closest thing that
exists to a magnet school for athletes.
</P>
<P>
   As with students who take accelerated academic courses in high
school, Kelly came to college well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That he's been able to learn everything we've thrown at him is
more extraordinary than the fact he's a very, very gifted
athlete,'' said second-year USC coach Paul Hackett. ``It's been
both a tremendous physical and mental effort on Kareem's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Against San Diego State, Kelly was in for 50 plays. To the
Aztecs' secondary, it must have seemed closer to 500.
</P>
<P>
   There could be no limiting the havoc Kelly wreaks this week,
provided his back holds up. The Ducks' defensive backs should
consider themselves forewarned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to think of me as just a freshman,'' Kelly said.
``When they sleep on me, that's my opportunity to open up my
arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kelly can do that, it'll turn the Oregon secondary into
sitting Ducks. &QL;

PROTECTED AREA EYED FOR STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A new national conservation area could stretch across
200,000 acres of Arizona, from the Mexican border to the mountains
near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., is preparing legislation that would
create a wildlife and recreation corridor linking a series of
mountain ranges and national forests in southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important as open space, wildlife habitat and
preserving a little bit of the West as the West should be,'' said
Kevin Dahl, executive director of the Tucson Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, dismiss the proposal as ``a paper park'' that
sounds impressive while accomplishing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe's staff declined to discuss the legislation before the
congressman's Saturday news conference announcing it.
</P>
<P>
   Las Cienegas National Conservation Area would stretch through
rolling grasslands that are framed by dramatic mountain ranges.
Cienega Creek runs through it like a spine, its watershed helping
to slake the thirst of metropolitan Tucson. The area is a rich mix:
caves, springs, more than 600 archaeological sites and home to a
wide range of animals.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create ``a protective umbrella'' so the land is
managed with common goals and isn't split up, said Jesse Juen,
field manager of the Tucson office of the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``These same areas are probably future hot spots for
development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the land is federally owned and overseen by the
BLM. Half is state trust land and a quarter is private.
</P>
<P>
   A recent draft of the bill would forbid the federal government
to buy any private land in the conservation area. Exchanges and
donations would be allowed, as would the purchase of development
rights on property, leaving the land in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoran Institute, a non-profit Tucson conservation
organization, has held community workshops, prepared a report and
generally championed Las Cienegas.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of the tiny towns of Sonoita and Elgin are eager
to keep the beautiful views and rural flavor of southeastern
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Development pressure is coming with the November opening of the
state's newest tourist attraction, Kartchner Cavern State Park near
Benson. Nearby Sierra Vista is booming, and ranches are being
subdivided.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents fear ``unbridled urbanization,'' said Sheldon
Clark, president of the board of Sonoita Crossroads Community
Forum, a citizens group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tucson is bursting at the seams,'' he said, ``and any place
within driving distance of Tucson is likely to become a bedroom
community.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clark said, people appreciate Kolbe's
attention to private property rights.
</P>
<P>
   State trust land makes up half the conservation area and poses a
special problem. It's not public land and must be sold or leased to
benefit schools and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   If the trust land is placed off-limits to development, ``how are
we going to be compensated?'' state Land Commissioner Michael
Anable asked.
</P>
<P>
   Draft legislation raises the possibility of purchase or trade,
but the Arizona Constitution prohibits trading trust land, and
voters have repeatedly refused to change the provision.

<P>
   At the Rincon group of the Sierra Club in southern Arizona,
``we're really thrilled with this effort,'' Assistant Chairman Rich
Genser said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wishes Kolbe would go further by protecting the upper
reaches of the watershed and banning off-road vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to give in to the ORV user,'' Genser said. ``I
can say this because my son and I each have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have harsher criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kolbe is trying to build up his environmental credentials
going into his next election bid,'' said Peter Galvin of the Center
for Biological Diversity in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin, a biologist, is troubled that Kolbe's draft bill allows
grazing within the boundaries of the conservation area. The center
has fought to kick cattle off public land, arguing that overgrazing
has destroyed the grasslands.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bill doesn't give carte blanche to ranchers. It
calls for ``environmentally responsible and sustainable livestock
uses.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin also wants Kolbe to ban mining within the boundaries ``so
we aren't faced with giant open-pit mines tearing up a conservation
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Without those kinds of steps, Galvin wonders: ``To what extent
is this conservation area just going to exist on paper? What is
going to change out there?'' &QL;

WOULD-BE OWNERS STILL TALKING TO NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's time for would-be NFL expansion owners in Los
Angeles to show how serious they really are. To wit: How much will
you pay?
</P>
<P>
   While the NFL continues to move toward awarding its 32nd team to
Houston, L.A.'s fleeting efforts might now rest with just how big a
franchise check potential expansion owners are willing to write.
</P>
<P>
   With their Sept. 15 deadline uneventfully behind them, league
owners are focusing less on location and stadium design and more on
the hard numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me, right now it's boiling down to the dollar
amount,'' said Ed Roski Jr., who has championed the Coliseum.
``They're going to analyze who's willing to pay what and how does
that fit into their program.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he met Sunday night in San Francisco with NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue _ now taking a more aggressive personal
role in the expansion process _ and was presented with a term sheet
that included several blank passages, including the franchise fee.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue met on Monday with Marvin Davis, the latecomer to the
expansion dance, who in Hollywood Park now has what the NFL
considers the most immediately doable site in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL said what it gave Roski was more an outline based on
their discussions in New York last week than an actual term sheet,
and at this point it just wants everything in writing. Other
potential owners have yet to be given similar term sheets or
outlines but are expected to be soon.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL expansion committee wants to have all the numbers in
hand and committed to prior to its Oct. 5 meeting in Atlanta.
Owners hope to award the franchise the following day, although some
now feel it will be put off again until their meeting the next
month in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NFL said in April it would establish a franchise
fee to avoid an auction, none was set and a high bid might be the
only thing that can prevent the franchise from going to Houston.
The expansion fee could be more than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're comfortable the project would work anywhere _
if they put it in Inglewood or the Coliseum or Houston,'' Roski
said. ``Now they're down to the economics of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably go to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be Davis, a billionaire who will have to make an
additional $250,000 payment today to maintain his option on the
Hollywood Park property across from the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is uncertain how serious the 74-year-old Davis is about
acquiring a franchise. Davis, 74, apparently wants to purchase the
franchise for his sons, Gregg and John. Davis will not return phone
calls to discuss publicly his expansion interests.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has a bad history of entering into discussions about
purchasing sports teams and then backing out. He's previously been
mentioned in attempts to purchase the Dallas Cowboys, Denver
Broncos, Oakland A's, and first bring major-league baseball to
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL office is in almost daily discussions with Davis, as
with Houston potential owner Bob McNair, but it's unknown whether
Davis _ while surrounded by so much uncertainty _ could muster the
24 votes required to land the expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz wants to own the team anywhere it lands in
Southern California and also remains in contact with the league.
But his originally preferred site at Carson appears buried under
concerns by too many owners of environmental cleanup and land
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum bid was left languishing by a lack of political and
local support, although Roski maintains its hopes are not dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Coliseum is still alive, I think Los Angeles is
still alive,'' he said. ``Until they make a decision, I think we
need to continue on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to all of us, the important things it to have an
expansion team in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he and partner Eli Broad had yet to determine what
expansion fee they would be willing to pay. He said they hope to
have a conference call with Tagliabue today to clarify some points
of their term sheet before detemining their expansion fee.

CLIPPERS ACQUIRE POINT GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As expected, the Los Angeles Clippers filled their
point-guard vacancy Thursday by shipping veteran small forward
Johnny Newman to New Jersey in exchange for eight-year veteran Eric
Murdock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is a proven point guard,'' said Elgin Baylor, the
Clippers' vice president of basketball operations. ``He's a
hard-nosed player, he's tough and he defends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to play hard and play with character.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's going to compete with incumbent Troy Hudson for the
starting point-guard role. Knee and groin injuries limited the
6-foot-1 Murdock to 15 games as the Nets' backup playmaker last
season. He has averaged 10.5 points and five assists in his eight
NBA seasons, with career-year numbers of 15.3 and 6.7 for the
Milwaukee Bucks in 1993-'94.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's had chance to start, he's produced,'' Baylor said of
the 6-foot-1 Murdock, who is regarded as a solid defender and
above-average shooter from long range.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a 13-year NBA veteran, was acquired from Cleveland with
Derek Anderson in the August sign-and-trade deal that sent Lamond
Murray to the Cavaliers.

NARY A PICASSO, BUT OH, FOR THE MICK'S LAST BAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Babe Ruth and Shoeless Joe Jackson taking the
spot at Sotheby's East Side Auction House that is normally reserved
for Picasso or Monet, it brought an odd assortment to the spacious
new auction hall. Bidders dressed in suits worth the price of a
1913 Chief Bender Philadelphia Athletics jersey (it went for
$24,000 on Thursday night) sat beside hopeful Yankee fans in
worn-out T-shirts that weren't worth the price of a program here on
Thursday night.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's played host to the auction of the Barry Halper
Collection of Baseball Memorabilia, the holy grail that most
collectors can only dream of, filled with items that Halper, now a
limited partner with the New York Yankees, has accumulated from
players he befriended more than 50 years. Thursday night was the
first of 16 sessions spanning seven days in which 2,481 items will
be auctioned, with over 5,000 more lots scheduled to be sold over
the Internet in November at www.Sothebys.Amazon.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bids put dollar values on the items, but surely not anywhere
near the value that they held for Halper, who had a personal story
to accompany every item. Still, $107,000 for the bat that Ruth
carried to home plate in his last appearance at Yankee Stadium is
not a bad place to start. And Dave Bushing, a Chicago area dealer
who purchased it for a client, believed he had got a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Halper, who watched the proceedings from a room off the floor,
said: ``It's not difficult to watch at all. What makes it easy is
that the Hall of Fame acquired part of my collection, so I can go
see it anytime. My wife felt worse than I did.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Providing a bit of relief for Halper was that it was not all
dealers picking through his memories. Even among the heavyweight
purchases, some were just fulfilling a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have, I have for my own pleasure,'' said Gordon
O'Brien, a 58-year-old senior vice president for human resources
for a holding company in New York. He purchased Mickey Mantle's
last game-used bat for $40,250, far above the estimate of
$10,000-$15,000 and also nearly double what he had hoped to spend.
``I'm a big Mickey Mantle fan. He was my hero growing up in
Connecticut. I have a reasonable number of items, but this is one
of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's raised over $2 million in the first session. With
bidding paddles made of paper bats and balls, it seemed a strange
fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nobody here at Sotheby's that I know of who thinks
that baseball cards, baseball bats, gloves and balls are in any way
inappropriate,'' said David Redden, the auctioneer. ``There are
serious painting-department types who would die for these things.''

DREIFORT TO GET A REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Darren Dreifort proved himself as a starter with a
torrid stretch the last seven weeks, which is why Los Angeles
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson erred on the side of caution and said
the right-hander's season is likely over.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson wouldn't rule out the possibility of Dreifort's
pitching an inning or two as a reliever, he said Dreifort wouldn't
start again this season because of tightness in his pitching
shoulder. Instead, lefty Jeff Williams will start Sunday against
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after Dreifort had trouble loosening his
ailing shoulder during an eight-minute bullpen session Thursday
afternoon, and with the Dodgers hopelessly playing out the string,
it made no sense to push him.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Claude Osteen said Dreifort also experienced
tightness in his right forearm during the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather finish (the season), but we're better off not,''
Dreifort said. ``It feels a lot better, but it's to a point where
it's taken a long time to recover from the last start and I
probably wouldn't be 100 percent for Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort won a career-high 13 games (and lost a career 13) and
had a 4.79 ERA. He's pitched 1782/3 innings, the second-highest
total of his career, and left his Sept. 15 start against Montreal
with tightness in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Dodgers said it wasn't a big deal, but
Dreifort's recovery time was slow. And with his history of arm
problems, the Dodgers didn't want to push Dreifort in meaningless
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you miss two starts late in the year, I don't see the
point (of him starting again),'' Johnson said. ``It's 80 percent
(certain that) he's done; he won't pitch again this year. If he
comes out here (Saturday) and is loose and wanted to throw an
inning, I wouldn't have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it's been a breakthrough year for Dreifort, particularly
the last two months, he doesn't view it that way. However, he did
earn a spot in next year's starting rotation by averaging 72/3
innings and going 4-1 with a 2.08 ERA in his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considered the year successful, Dreifort said,
``Nope. I can take positives in learning a lot of things this year,
but the season as a whole, I don't see it as a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of (poor) games early. You want to get better, but
I feel I didn't come through in some games when we needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Dreifort missing his last three starts, he's in for a
sizable raise. After making $1.9 million this season, he's eligible
for arbitration and could make approximately $4.5 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   __ Chasing Wills: The last Dodgers shortstop to hit .300 (with
minimum 100 at-bats) was Maury Wills, who batted .302 in 1963.
Barring one of the worst slumps in major-league baseball history,
Mark Grudzielanek will break that record.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who leads the Dodgers with a .327 average, could
go 0 for 40 and finish the year at .300. Since coming off the
disabled list July 6, Grudzielanek is hitting .352 with 16 doubles
and 33 RBI. He also leads the National League with a .378 average
in September.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: Raul Mondesi was out of the starting lineup for the
first time since his anti-management tirade in Montreal on Aug. 11.
He's been experiencing problems with his left eye, so he underwent
an exam at the UCLA eye institute. Mondesi had his pupils dilated,
and Johnson said he would be hesitant to use the right fielder even
in a pinch-hitting role. Dodgers officials hadn't received word on
the results as of Thursday night. . . . For the 14th season, the
Dodgers will pass the three million mark in attendance tonight
against the Padres.

ARIZONA ANGLES FOR 1ST DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Within two months, Republican presidential contenders
could be squaring off for their first national debate _ in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's certain yet. So far, front-runner George W. Bush has
been ducking debates. And the other candidates are wary of making a
commitment if Bush doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   But state GOP officials figure a debate must come some time. And
if not here, where? And if not Nov. 21, when?
</P>
<P>
   That's the date for the proposed debate at Arizona State
University's Gammage Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party Chairman Mike Minnaugh said the debate
would enhance the state's chance of shaping the presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to allow the citizens of Arizona to
hear these candidates,'' Minnaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   A nationally televised debate had been scheduled in Florida for
Oct. 9, but few candidates have committed to the event. Candidates
also have been invited to two town hall-style meetings in New
Hampshire next month.
</P>
<P>
   But an Arizona debate in November would likely be the first true
debate between the GOP contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Minnaugh, who has sent a letter to each of the nine GOP
candidates, said he has had positive responses from publisher Steve
Forbes, former Vice President Dan Quayle and Arizona Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Forbes, who won Arizona's primary in 1996,
said the candidate is seriously looking at attending the debate but
has not yet committed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point and time, it's something we would very much like
to do,'' Juleanna Glover Weiss said. ``It's going to get strong
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCain said the senator also would consider
attending the debate but had not yet had an opportunity to review
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend on what Bush, the front-runner, decides. The
candidate has not yet confirmed that he will attend, but organizers
are hopeful he will be drawn in by the attendance of a number of
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attendance also may be made more likely by his close
relationship with Gov. Jane Hull, who is sitting down with him in a
private meeting next week to discuss a number of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Mr. Bush will be unavailable, but he got a lot
of bad publicity in Florida for not attending,'' Minnaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bush said the candidate will examine the
debate proposal but remains unlikely to attend any until early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made any plans to debate this year, and I'm not
sure we will be making any,'' Mindy Tucker said. ``He is looking
forward to debating Republican candidates next year, when people
are paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republicans remain hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we got Forbes, Quayle, McCain, Dole and Bush, then we've
got all the key people,'' Minnaugh said. ``But we will invite all
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation list will include, for now, Pat Buchanan, who has
been making news with his high-profile ruminations over whether to
run on the Reform Party ticket, instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are even asking Buchanan,'' Minnaugh said. ``But if he
bolts to the Reform Party, he's uninvited.''
</P>
<P>
   The race to debate has grown fierce, as states jockey to move
their primaries and caucuses forward. Most states with an early
contest this year are also planning a debate.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, which will host its primary Feb. 19, will hold a
nationally televised debate on Jan. 9. Iowa, whose caucuses are
planned for late January, will be the site of a debate on Jan. 15.
New Hampshire plans to host a televised debate during the week
preceding its primary, tentatively scheduled for early February. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PITTSBURGH _ In the hip-hop vernacular, fat means something totally
different than the unfair connotation it carries in relation to
Daryle Ward.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It means living large _ coming up big _ which is exactly what
Ward has been doing.
</P>
<P>
   His newfound commitment has allowed Ward to shed more than
pounds. It also has shed some light on his potential _ and it has
the Astros rethinking how he fits into their future.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Ward has gone from being a man without a
position in spring training to the every-day left fielder in the
heat of the Astros' quest for a third consecutive National League
Central Division title. As for next season, he has the club
exploring ways to create a spot for him in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   But that's next year; for now, the Astros are pleased _ but
certainly not amazed _ that the 24-year-old slugger has responded
to the challenge of playing every day under such tense
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's emergence has some wondering how Derek Bell fits in if
and when the Astros reach the playoffs, especially since Bell has
been out for two weeks with pulled rib-cage muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Even general manager Gerry Hunsicker is uncertain about Bell's
readiness for the playoffs, if the Astros make it that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up in the air,'' Hunsicker said. ``The calendar is
starting to work against us. We just have to take it a day at a
time. I don't see him (Bell) being available before Tuesday. When
he's ready, we'll assess our options and see what's realistic at
that point.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those options is sending Bell on a rehabilitation
assignment to an instructional league (that season opens Monday);
another is going with the current outfield mix, in which Ward has
become a fixture.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the organization seems uneasy about seeing Ward's name
in the lineup daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anymore,'' Hunsicker said. ``You always worry about
throwing young players into a pennant race. But Daryle has
responded well, and I certainly wouldn't have any reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of him. Daryle has seized the opportunity.
When he came up (from Class AAA New Orleans), it was to replace
Jack Howell as a lefthanded bat off the bench. Now all of a sudden,
he has a significant role in the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, a converted first baseman, auditioned in the outfield in
the spring of 1998 but didn't show enough for the Astros to
consider him a viable option there. Hunsicker urged him to lose
weight and make a stronger commitment to playing defense, and the
chat has paid dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has lost more than 10 pounds, and his play in left field
seems to improve daily. While Ward is not nearly as polished as
Moises Alou or Richard Hidalgo _ whose injuries created Ward's
opportunity _ he certainly hasn't proved to be a defensive
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we had some players get injured, and you never
want to see anyone get injured,'' Ward said. ``I've just tried to
fill a gap, not be that player, because I'm not that player yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word is yet. Ward's potential is unlimited, and hitting
instructor Tom McCraw said his advancement is far beyond that of
any young hitter with whom he has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any player _ if he has the knowledge of what hitting is all
about _ can be successful (in the big leagues),'' McCraw said.
``The learning curve here is mental; it's not physical. Daryle is
far advanced mentally, and that's what allows him to have the
physical success that he's capable of having.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to panic. All we need to do as an organization
is give him enough consistent at-bats, and that's what's been
happening. The minute he played two or three games in a row, I
could see a whole change in his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think, `I've got to show them everything I can do in
three or four at-bats.' Now he's relaxed, and we're seeing the real
Daryle Ward. He's a fine hitter, and he's playing big for us. He's
a big part of our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   How Ward factors into the 2000 plans probably will have more to
do with his continued defensive improvement _ as well as personnel
decisions the Astros make during the offseason. For his part, Ward
plans to play winter ball to sharpen his skills, particularly in
left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get myself ready for that,'' he said. ``I just look at
myself as a player. Wherever they put me, I'll do what I'm asked
and I'll do my best. I changed my attitude about defense this year.
If I don't get a hit, I'm not going to let someone get an easy hit
on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more aggressive on defense. I think I've always played
defense pretty well, but I didn't have that intensity that guys
have here in the big leagues _ they want to stop you from getting
that hit or taking the extra base, and that's the approach I've
tried to take this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's commitment hasn't gone unnoticed among his veteran
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the one thing he's learned is that if you have a
chance to play in the big leagues, you work your butt off and play
wherever they want you to play,'' said second baseman Craig Biggio,
who began his career as a catcher. ``He's really worked hard to
become as good an outfielder as he can. He's getting better every
day, and he's getting more confidence. Every day he goes out there
and plays is a better day for him and a better day for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preparation is the key. As long as you prepare yourself and
put the work in, whether you're good or bad, no one is going to
have a problem with that. If you're not working at it to get better
_ if you're just showing up and thinking you can just put your
glove on and play _ now we're going to have a problem with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not the case here. Daryle has worked his butt
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the game seems to come easily for Ward, who is
hitting .271 and has driven in 25 runs on 36 hits (seven of them
homers) in 133 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to play hard, have a good year and let that
speak for itself,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has spoken volumes.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BROOKLINE, Mass. _ What the Europeans will do today in the 33rd
Ryder Cup is sort of like showing up for your Boston Pops audition
and whipping a kazoo out of your pocket.
<TEXT>
<P>
   You leave Seve Ballesteros, Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer _
your equivalent of the Three Tenors _ at home across the pond. You
pack your team full of rookies. One of your players, Sergio Garcia,
19, wasn't born when European captain Mark James played in his
first Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This is how a team of unified golfers becomes such an
overwhelming underdog.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what the Europeans look like as they go for
their third consecutive Ryder Cup victory. And this is exactly the
look they had in 1995 at Oak Hill Country Club in New York and
even, to some extent, on their home turf at Valderrama, Spain, two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Europeans are dangerous again.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because their success at the Ryder Cup in the past 15 years
_ they've won the trophy five of the last seven times _ proves they
have become better than the Americans at handling the pressures of
match-play competition at its highest level.
</P>
<P>
   And because Colin Montgomerie, Europe's anchor, and James are
going to see to it that their seven rookie members don't succumb to
the pressures that can turn the greatest golfers in the world into
mush.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lawrie might not be a Ballesteros. And Miguel Angel Jimenez
and Padraig Harrington are not Faldo and Langer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Europeans have faith in their newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's going to be different,'' Montgomerie said on the
eve of the opening shots. ``There's no doubt about that. These guys
(Ballesteros, Faldo and Langer) were at the top of the tree for a
long, long time. I would also include Sandy Lyle in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's our loss. But at the same time, that doesn't mean that
we can't do well without them. What's coming through Europe is
very, very good. And I'm sure we'll prove that this week.''
</P>
<P>
   James has similar confidence. He, Montgomerie and Jose Maria
Olazabal have taken it upon themselves to instruct the Europeans in
the ways of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need to be aware of how things are going to be
out there, particularly the rookies,'' James said. ``I think the
players that have been there before are perfectly able to cope with
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think motivation will be difficult. They want it
badly. They want to do well. They want to win points. And they want
to be the next Ryder Cup superstars. Motivation is just not a
problem. I've got to demotivate them so their heads don't
explode.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true Europe is in transition. Some of its rookie players
will be impact players, perhaps even bellcows, in future Ryder
Cups. But they also will be leaned upon heavily in the next three
days. In this morning's foursomes, James is sending out four
first-time players, including the Jimenez-Harrington pairing. Talk
about your trial by fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seven Ryder Cup rookies, but they probably have 60
years of tour experience behind them,'' James said. ``So I don't
see it as a big problem. It's up to me and my assistants and the
senior players on the side to make sure they know what they're in
for. And I think we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor working for the European players is they have
virtually no expectations and, therefore, only a modest amount of
pressure on them. The Americans are playing at home. They are
expected to trounce Europe. These are the circumstances that make
for tighter muscles and frayed nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always tend to go into these matches as underdogs,''
Montgomerie said. ``And it's amazing how well we've done. Because
we go in there as underdogs, we don't seem to have as much to lose.
And therefore, we play better because of it, possibly. I'm not sure
why we've won as often as we have, being underdogs. But I think
that's one of the reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   And another, he said, is because the Europeans emphasize they
are a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the Ryder Cup last time because every player got at
least one point,'' Montgomerie said. ``That's the first time it's
ever happened. That just proves that it takes 12 players to win
this and not one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have yet to prove they are a cohesive unit. The
pay-for-play controversy splintered the team and angered captain
Ben Crenshaw. And the Americans have proved they also have trouble
adapting to the match-play formats after playing individual,
stroke-play tournaments the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's particular pressure on either side,''
James said. ``The last Ryder Cup's finished and gone. We're
starting with a clean slate.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But there's considerably more baggage along with the
Americans' new slate. The Americans trumpet their superiority via
the world rankings; the Europeans seem to exude an inner calm that
suggests they know they can win. Their body language is better than
that of the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother us particularly what our status is in the
betting shops,'' James said. ``I think if you start worrying about
the other team or the odds or how people are shaping you up, it's
just distracting. I think we know we've got a pretty good side and
we're going to be hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly willing to accept that there's a possibility of
any result in this match. I'm not going to beat drums about how
we're going to definitely win. I think we have a good team. They're
playing pretty well, and I think they're going to be hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six matches have been very close, and a few rolls of
the ball here, a rub of the green there and a bit of luck in the
middle and the match can go either way. So I wouldn't say we're
definitely going to win. Equally, I wouldn't say we're definitely
going to lose. I think there's an element of luck. And you have to
be aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck. If that's the deciding factor, then the Americans are in
trouble. They've been star-crossed in this competition for years.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, losing the Ryder Cup once can be chalked up to bad
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Losing it five of seven times can't. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLINE, Mass. _ You know what they say about having to watch out
for the quiet ones.
</P>
<P>
   So go ahead, tell the Europeans their chances are better of
getting the Leaning Tower of Pisa to stand up straight than to win
the Ryder Cup, and one or more of them will nod in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Tell them Tiger Woods, David Duval and Co. will make such short
work of this biennial rivalry that they'll probably keep the
engines running in their courtesy limousines while they crank out a
few eagles on the front nine at The Country Club, and the boys from
across the pond will smile.
</P>
<P>
   Not since U.S. troops rolled down the Champs-Elysees in Paris
have so many Euros said they felt so overwhelmed and beholden to be
in the presence of one group of Americans. Then they'll cough or
clear their throats and give you that look with the twinkle in
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that talk about the Concorde. The European team must
have really flown here on Sandbag Airways. There hasn't been such a
strong scent of possum in the air since the last time Granny
Clampett made stew.
</P>
<P>
   From team captain Mark James to Ryder Cup rookie Jarmo Sandelin,
the Euros are going into today's first day of competition like a
collection of Alfred E. Neuman clones. What, me worry?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, why should the Europeans fret in the least bit about
what happens in the course of the next three days? If all goes as
expected, Tiger and his buddies will eat them for lunch and they'll
just go home and have tea. Cheerio. It's only a golf match, you
know. And wasn't Duval the one who labeled the Ryder Cup ``an
exhibition''?
</P>
<P>
   No, the Europeans don't seem to have a care in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even the overly sensitive, quick-to-burn Colin Montgomerie was
not going to rise to the bait when confronted with Jeff Maggert's
comment that the U.S. team consisted of ``the 12 best players in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want someone to bite at that, don't you?'' Montgomerie
said with a devilish grin. ``Well, I'm not going to. Jeff Maggert's
probably dead right.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way the Europeans plan on teeing it up today and
all weekend in New England, as if they are just happy to be allowed
on the same fairways and greens with the American golfing gods.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. team talks about playing golf, the Europeans talk
about being the underdogs, or ``underpuppies,'' as Jesper Parnevik
called them.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, led by the affable James, are playing the game
with the game, simultaneously keeping his rookie-laden squad loose
while shoveling all of the burden and all of the pressure onto the
backs of the U.S. players.
</P>
<P>
   The way James has it set up and the way it really is, the only
truly big story that can occur this weekend is if the heavily
favored Americans spit the bit again.
</P>
<P>
   But it shouldn't happen. It can't happen. The Euros will only be
too happy to tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows the PGA Tour is the Mercedes-Benz of golf
circuits. It exudes class and prestige. It has a money list
dominated by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Ryder Cup arrived stateside this week in the possession
of a charming collection of Englishmen, Scots, Spaniards and
Swedes. And for good measure, this time they even brought along a
Frenchman and an Irishman.
</P>
<P>
   None of these chaps seems capable of winning the U.S. Open. So
how is it they have been able to wrest the trophy from the
Americans the last two times out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably in the culture and all that,'' said Jean
Van de Velde, the Frenchman who imploded on the 72nd hole of the
British Open. ``In Europe, you jump on the plane, you travel two
hours, and you're on the other side of Europe. So you get to meet
different people. It's a different way of life. And it's not an
easy one. Not like it is here.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, being a professional golfer over there isn't the
country-club life it is here, where the players quickly become
spoiled and a major distraction is when the courtesy car arrives
five minutes late. The Euros have learned to handle adversity; the
Americans complain and then crack.
</P>
<P>
   So they revel in the underdog role and know the Americans might
just boil in the stew of controversy about wanting to get paid to
play in the Ryder Cup if they fall behind again.
</P>
<P>
   They even know American audiences love an underdog story and
might even switch allegiances _ a la the cheering for Sergio Garcia
at the PGA _ if they sniff an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been underdogs the past 10 years,'' said Montgomerie,
smiling. ``It's amazing how well we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what they say about the guy who poor-mouths on the
first tee. He's probably getting ready to lift your wallet.

   RSVP's For a `Party' ...
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Public Theater's Broadway-bound production of
``The Wild Party'' suffered a hiccup this week with news that one
of its likely stars, Vanessa Williams, would not be available for a
springtime run.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cast has not been announced, Ms. Williams'
appearance was widely anticipated. But a member of the production
staff said officials at the Public said this week that due to
personal reasons, Ms. Williams would not be able to perform in
April, when ``The Wild Party'' is scheduled to open at the Virginia
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Cafarelli, Ms. Williams' spokesman, said that he would not
comment on her personal life, but that ``conversations are
ongoing'' about the show. And while a delay in the production
schedule is conceivable, George C. Wolfe, the show's director, said
he was ``deeply committed'' to an April 6 opening.
</P>
<P>
   A production member also confirmed that the theater was looking
for another actress to fill the role that Ms. Williams was to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wild Party'' is based on a 1928 poem by Joseph Moncure
March about a boozy, jazz-era fete populated by all manner of
lovers and louts. Manhattan Theater Club is also preparing a
version of the piece, which centers around a love rectangle, with
the affections of two women, Kate and Queenie, entwined with those
of Black, a sporting man about town, and Burrs, a jealous rough.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams played Queenie in a February reading of ``The Wild
Party,'' at the Public. Wolfe said he hoped to complete casting in
two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams, a former Miss America and current film star and
pop performer, had her Broadway debut in 1994 playing Aurora in
``Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' The role displayed her sexy stage
presence and potent box office appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence is still running high over this ``Wild Party,'' which
was composed by Michael John LaChiusa and is going directly to
Broadway. Eartha Kitt and Mandy Patinkin have been mentioned for
the Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   ... And Another
</P>
<P>
   At the Manhattan Theater Club, meanwhile, producers were adding
some star power of their own to their ``The Wild Party,'' composed
by Andrew Lippa and scheduled to open in February at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble will be headlined by Taye Diggs, who will play
Black, with Idina Menzel as Kate and Julia K. Murney as Queenie.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs and Ms. Menzel were original members of the cast of
``Rent,'' and Diggs has been on a roll of late, with memorable
turns in the films ``Go'' and ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
But the idea of returning to a New York stage was too tempting to
pass up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my agents the only type of theater I wanted to do was
New York,'' he said. ``I find something completely separate and
energizing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs said he was first drawn to the show by a song, ``A Poor
Child.'' But the deeper he looked, the more he found. ``It's a
complete musical in all aspects,'' he said.``It's got song and
dance and theater in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The return to the New York stage for Diggs and Ms. Menzel, who
are a real-life couple, complements what seems to be a citywide
return of original ``Rent'' alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Jermaine Heredia is back in ``Rent''; Daphne Rubin-Vega
appears next month in ``Gum'' at the WPP Theater, and Adam Pascal
is due in Disney's ``Aida'' in the spring. Mark Setlock, who was a
``Rent'' replacement, is appearing in the one-man show ``Fully
Committed'' at the Vineyard Theater. Is That All There Is?
</P>
<P>
   When ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' opened at the Virginia Theater in
March 1995, the reception wasn't exactly warm. Many critics derided
the revue of rock-and-roll standards by Jerry Leiber and Mike
Stoller as too sterile or too hokey to make it on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But the public apparently didn't see it that way. With the
national broadcast of a sizzling routine on the 1995 Tony Awards,
the show began to build good word of mouth. That momentum was
maintained by an aggressive marketing campaign, frequent radio
plugs by Don Imus and short stints by Motown performers, including
Gladys Knight and Ben E. King. ``Smokey'' ran through the 1995
season. And the 1996 season. And the 1997 season. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   That run will end on Jan. 16, the producers said this week,
completing a stretch of some 2,036 performances, which makes
``Smokey'' the longest running revue in Broadway history. More than
that, though, ``Smokey'' may be best remembered as a test case for
the theory that savvy marketing can overcome bad reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all immensely proud of its success,'' said Tom Viertel,
a producer. ``And of all the people who helped make our dreams,
artistic and commercial, come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _Add another entry to the season o' Sondheim: ``Saturday
Night,'' his earliest effort at a full-blown Broadway-style
musical. Second Stage will present the show in January, with
Kathleen Marshall, the artistic director of the Encores
musicals-in-concent series, as the director and choreographer. Rob
Fisher, the longtime musical director of Encores, will handle the
musical direction for ``Saturday Night.'' The season's other
Sondheim entries include ``Wise Guys,'' ``Putting It Together'' and
``Do I Hear a Waltz?''
</P>
<P>
   _Donna Murphy, a two-time Tony winner in musicals, will appear
in ``Trudy Blue,'' a play by Marsha Norman, at the MCC Theater on
West 28th Street in Chelsea. It opens on Dec. 2.

BLUE JAYS GET TO BECK IN 9TH 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The magic number has become small enough for Miss
Gandy's third-graders to count it down with their fingers. In
another day, they may need just one hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Rod Beck's hands Thursday night to make it shrink even
further, but for the first time since the mustachioed relief
pitcher brought his easy-rider persona to the Red Sox, someone
knocked him off his Harley.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays jolted the previously unscratched Beck
with three ninth-inning runs Thursday &UR;  &LR; night to overtake the Red
Sox, 7-5, handing the Sox their first back-to-back defeats since
they lost four in a row a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox still moved closer to the wild card as their pursuers,
the Oakland A's, Thursday &UR;  &LR; night split a doubleheader with the
Baltimore Orioles, who come to town for a four-game set beginning
Friday night. The magic number is now six: Any combination of Sox
wins and A's losses totalling six, and Beck and the Sox will be
back in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't expect me to be perfect, but I do,'' said
Beck, who had been unscored upon in seven previous appearances with
Boston but blew his first save in four chances Thursday &UR;  &LR; night
before a startled crowd of 30,780 in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that's possible, we all know it's not,'' Beck said.
``But 30 guys in this room battled for the lead all day, I was
supposed to nail it down, and tonight I failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays second baseman Homer Bush, whose acrobatic catch of
Darren Lewis's pop fly in short center field killed a Sox rally in
the eighth, opened the ninth by flaring a single to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush saved 'em, he saved 'em this whole series,'' said Sox
designated hitter Butch Huskey, whose two-run homer had given the
Sox a 4-2 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Brumfield popped out, but Shawn Green, the splendid
Toronto outfielder who hit .404 against the Sox this season,
singled to right, sending Bush to third.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista followed with a two-run double to the gap in
right-center, Green beating Jose Offerman's relay to the plate.
Batista took third on the play and scored on Brian McRae's tapper
to first.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who had lost nine of 10 against the Sox, took the
last two games here to hand Boston its first series defeat since it
was swept in Texas Aug. 20-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I was totally ripped apart,'' Beck said.
``But I didn't make the pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line is, I didn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the night, the Sox seemed intent on showing that if
Boston can begin the countdown for the millennium early, on
Greenwich time, there was no reason the Sox couldn't begin their
countdown for the playoffs on Garciaparra time.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was hitting a two-run home run to start the Sox'
scoring, driving in a go-ahead run by hustling down the line to
beat what would have been an inning-ending double play in the
seventh, or turning a DP of his own to preserve the Sox lead an
inning later, the Red Sox shortstop did everything in his power to
ensure a win.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sox trying to rebound from Wednesday's five-error
lapse, Nomar Garciaparra followed a fourth-inning single by Jason
Varitek with a homer just to the left of the center-field camera
well, a first-pitch blast off Blue Jays starter David Wells that
tied the score at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley, who earlier had taken a batting-practice ball off
the bridge of his nose, followed with a single, and Huskey then
took Wells deep with a two-run homer into the Sox bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey had had just three hits in his last 30 at-bats, and the
home run was his first since his pinch homer off Mike Stanton of
the Yankees made the difference in an 11-10 win Sept. 11 at the
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox loaded the bases in the seventh on singles by Lewis,
Offerman, and Varitek. Garciaparra hit a smash to the right of
second baseman Bush, who made a diving stop but bobbled the ball
just long enough for Garciaparra to beat the relay to first as the
tie-breaking run scored.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra then bailed out Derek Lowe in the eighth with Blue
Jays on first and third and one out, thrusting his fist after
starting an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   But while relievers Rich Garces and Lowe held the Blue Jays
scoreless for 3 1/3 innings after they'd scored four runs off a
wild Kent Mercker (five walks, a hit batsman, and six hits in 4 2/3
innings), Wells hung in there. Wells gave up a dozen hits, but he
was still standing until the ninth, when Billy Koch came in to
finish the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hung around,'' Huskey said of the Blue Jays lefthander with
the same beer-league body type modeled by Beck. ``We roughed him up
a little bit, but he's a clutch big-league pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells had help. Left fielder Brumfield threw out Stanley trying
to score on Troy O'Leary's two-out single in the sixth, and Bush
went head over heels to grab Lewis's popup in short center field
with runners on the corners in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides, plays were made,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams.
``Beck will bounce back. He's been outstanding for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck has saved 260 games in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many saves as I have, I've blown a few,'' Beck said, ``and
you never get used to it. This time of year, it's even more
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when guys make their money, when guys get to show what
they're made of. And I will do that.''

MERCKER TAKES THE BLAME 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MERCKER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Kent Mercker didn't mince words about his return to the
Red Sox' starting rotation Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible,'' was his assessment after a 7-5 loss to Toronto,
one that was tagged on closer of the day Rod Beck but abetted by
Mercker's failure to hold a 4-2 lead in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The lefthander, traded from St. Louis to Boston late last month,
had made three starts prior to Thursday &UR;  &LR; night for his new employer
_ all games eventually won by the Red Sox. Mercker beat Kansas City
for his only Boston decision Sept. 1, but five days later in
Seattle, he injured his rib cage in a collision with Wilton Veras
on a popup. He was later placed on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercker wouldn't use the injury as an excuse for what he
also called a ``bittersweet'' return. Rather, he said his lack of
anything resembling a major league changeup cost him and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have gotten an out at Williamsport with my changeup
tonight,'' said Mercker, who lasted 4 2/3 innings but was one
batter away from escaping with a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But when Darrin Fletcher slapped a tying single to center, his
night was over and Rich Garces was brought in from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd been out for a while, but his stuff was good,'' manager
Jimy Williams said of Mercker. ``He got a little erratic with his
control in the third inning, and that got him into a higher pitch
count, but overall, I thought he threw the ball good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker was a harder marker than his manager, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to walk guys at this level,'' he said in
reference to five free passes, including consecutive walks in the
third to Shawn Green, Tony Batista, and Brian McRae, the last of
which forced home a run. ``It's one thing if you go out there and
you make some decent pitches, and they still get hits to beat you.
But when you walk that many guys, you can't expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Mercker's frustration was the fact that his team had
rocked David Wells for four runs in the fourth to go up by a pair,
but he couldn't keep that momentum going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense did a good job,'' he said. ``They gave us a chance
tonight. After the fourth, that's where I have to throw up a zero
and get my offense back in there. But it (the fifth) was a long
inning, I let them tie the game up, and I pretty much set the tone
for the evening. I don't want to do that again. I want to figure
out what I did wrong and correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   After allowing four runs and six hits and seeing his ERA with
Boston (2.35 to 3.60) go the opposite way of Thursday's Dow Jones,
Mercker refused to blame his inconsistency on his two-week layoff.
And while he showed some grit in striking out Willis Otanez and
Fletcher to end the third with the bases loaded, Mercker said, ``I
still didn't live up to my end of the bargain, mainly because I
didn't have much touch on my changeup. That's the pitch that's
going to make or break me pretty much, and I wasn't following
through finishing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had an excuse, but I don't. It was just my changeup.
I left it up and out and paid the price. The only thing I was happy
about tonight was that I was pain free and showed signs of being a
good pitcher. I've just got to take the positive from that and
carry that into my next start.''

PARK STRUGGLES AS DODGERS BEAT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A season that began with contract negotiations is
ending with thoughts of a four-week stint in the military for Chan
Ho Park when the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   In between those bookends, the right-hander started a brawl, got
suspended, gave up four grand slams, contemplated what effect
cutting his hair would have on his country, and on a pair of
occasions went a month without a win.
</P>
<P>
   So why would his final start at Dodger Stadium be anything but a
battle?
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which his native Korea came to a halt to watch him
pitch on Chu-suk, their equivalent of Thanksgiving, they saw
everything good and everything bad from the most trying season of
his four-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Park left with a one-run lead after struggling through six
innings and the Los Angeles Dodgers held on for a 5-3 win against
the San Francisco Giants on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' third win in the four-game series gave the idle
Arizona Diamondbacks a share of the NL West crown. The Diamondbacks
have the opportunity to win their division tonight in San
Francisco, where the teams begin a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Though Park (12-10) got through six innings, it wasn't easy. He
threw 114 pitches, walked six and fired a pair of wild pitches. He
offset that by striking out eight, including Rich Aurilia with two
outs and the bases loaded in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It put Park in line to win his career-high sixth straight,
though he hasn't been dominating during the run. Only once during
that seven-start span did Park pitch past the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White had a pair of RBI, scored twice and stole three
bases and Gary Sheffield hit his 29th homer to lead the Dodgers
offense. Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his 34th save.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there have been other things on Park's mind since
spring training. It began with Park thinking a multiyear contract
hinged on every pitch he threw. He hit rock bottom early when St.
Louis' Fernando Tatis hit two grand slams in one inning during an
April start. After Park was 2-2 with a 6.15 ERA through the first
month, he and then-pitching coach Charlie Hough wondered whether
the pitches were being tipped, so Park changed his glove. In June,
Park scissor-kicked Anaheim's Tim Belcher and sat through a
seven-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Park's fortune didn't begin to turn around until he shaved his
head following an Aug. 15 loss to Florida. But before doing that,
Park said he thought of how the grooming would impact the people
who revere him in his home country.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for pressure?
</P>
<P>
   In Korean lore, shaving the head is a sign of determination.
Since Park used the clippers, he's undefeated, though it had more
to do with the Dodgers scoring 44 runs in his five wins.
</P>
<P>
   Such run support wasn't the case for the Dodgers against Giants
starter Livan Hernandez, who fell to 7-12. The Giants took a 2-0
lead in the second on an RBI fielder's choice by Aurilia and an RBI
single from Marvin Bernard. The Dodgers tied it in the bottom of
the inning when Todd Hollandsworth doubled and scored on White's
single to left. White stole second and scored on Adrian Beltre's
single to center.
</P>
<P>
   White gave the Dodgers a 3-2 lead in the third when his double
scored Hollandsworth, and two innings later Sheffield boosted the
advantage to 4-2 with his homer. He has 34 RBI in his last 31 games
and is second on the Dodgers with 93.

   The Giants pulled within 4-3 in the sixth when Jay Canizaro
scored on Park's two-out wild pitch.

   25 years later, `The Miracle on the Brazos' remains an amazing
feat &QL; 
 &QL; 
By JEROME SOLOMON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Miracle _ 1. An event or action that apparently contradicts known
scientific laws and is hence thought to be due to supernatural
causes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Baylor 34, Texas 24. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WACO _ It was overcast, quite chilly and a bit wet that November
afternoon, but if someone tells you it was a beautiful day, that
does not mean he was not there.
</P>
<P>
   The sun didn't have to shine that day, the most unforgettable
day in the history of Baylor football, for it to be beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if someone tells you he sat shivering in the rain,
unconcerned with the brisk air because he was sure something
special was going to happen, do not be surprised if at some point
soon thereafter that person makes you an offer.
</P>
<P>
   He might tell you he can get you a majestic suspension bridge
that crosses the Brazos River at a below-market-value price, and
you can make a fortune on the deal by charging cars a toll to
cross.
</P>
<P>
   See, the number of people who had a feeling something special
was about to happen that day was small, as was the number of people
who sat through it all and witnessed what has since been dubbed
``The Miracle on the Brazos.''
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 9, 1974. Baylor 34, Texas 24.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 43,100 gathered that afternoon for a football game
between Baylor and Texas. Estimates are that less than a third of
that number remained from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant Longhorns, winners of six consecutive Southwest
Conference championships and owners of a 16-game winning streak
over the Bears, took a 24-7 halftime lead, convincing most that the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't want to hang around to see the misery of another
slaughter,'' said then-Baylor coach Grant Teaff, whose team was
picked to finish last in the SWC that year, had never made it to
the Cotton Bowl and had not won a league title since 1924. ``You
couldn't hear it audibly, but you knew the feeling _ same song,
second verse, or rather, 20th verse. People were just streaming out
of there at the half. They just left.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the stands were empty at the end of the
Bears' unlikely comeback. In the fourth quarter, Teaff got news via
phone from assistant coach Cotton Davidson, who was seated in the
press box, that there was a massive traffic jam in the parking lot
exits from the stadium. People were trying to get back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cotton said they were just leaving their cars where they were
because with the traffic they couldn't get back to the stadium,''
Teaff said. ``It didn't matter. They were leaving their lights on
and cars running, right where they were, and running back into the
stadium. They were flowing back.''
</P>
<P>
   How many made it back into the stadium is anybody's guess, but
Teaff said apparently those who returned brought friends and family
with them who did not have tickets. He said he has talked to at
least 150,000 fans who claim to have been there.
</P>
<P>
   Teaff, who retired from coaching in 1992 and is now the
executive director of the American Football Coaches Association,
must not get around much.
</P>
<P>
   Sports writer Dave Campbell, who next year will enter his sixth
decade of covering the Bears, figures he has come across some
500,000 people who say they were there.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely anything will happen Saturday when Texas comes
calling again that will leave such an indelible mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a monumental day for the program, and you had to be
there to believe it,'' Campbell said. ``Not only to finally beat
this powerhouse, but to do it under those circumstances made it all
the more memorable. I have to admit I was one of those who had to
see it to believe it. When they fell behind, I was thinking, `Here
they go again.'''
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't make it back in time to see the finish, the
score is permanently etched in their memory, thanks to the
scoreboard at Baylor Stadium remaining lit overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It provided a perfect night light for some members of the Baylor
administration, including executive vice president Herbert
Reynolds, who fulfilled a promise that if Baylor ever beat Texas
they would spend the night at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It is not every day that a group of families tries to sleep on a
football field, but that is the kind of mood the town was in that
day. The field was too damp to make a proper bed, so they took to
the press box for a good night's rest, and their story became part
of the day's lore.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day that fostered stories.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Neal Jeffrey had a momentary lapse in belief and
returned to the stadium after the game to make sure it really had
happened. The scoreboard lights confirmed the miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor center Aubrey Schulz, an All-American that year,
remembers that his brother Barney, who had just graduated from
Texas, hit the road at halftime, secure in his knowledge that the
Longhorns, who had won 40 of 42 conference matchups entering the
season, had sewn up another league win.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time he got to Temple (about 35 miles away), he was
hearing it on the radio and didn't know whether to come back or
not,'' Schulz said. ``You just don't come back against a team like
that. You look at the kind of players they had, and they had
totally dominated the conference for years. I could see how people
believed there was no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bears believed. In fact, ``I believe'' was their slogan
for that season. It was something Teaff figured he needed to get
across to a team that had gone 2-9 the year before, losing its
final seven games. Winning the SWC championship wasn't even in the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go into a season thinking you can win the conference
when you're on a seven-game losing streak and you're picked dead
last,'' Teaff said. ``Anybody that says they went into it with a
goal of winning the conference is either nuts or a big fat liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went in trying to believe we could compete. I wanted
them to believe they were winners and they could play with anybody.
The larger goals just kind of fell into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's streak reached nine games with losses to Oklahoma and
Missouri to open the 1974 season, but a 31-14 victory over No.
8-ranked Oklahoma State got the team rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State was the next victim, and then Arkansas fell as the
Bears opened conference play. People were starting to believe a
little. Texas A&AMP;M put those beliefs to rest with a sound 20-0
whipping in Waco, on homecoming, before 51,200, then the biggest
crowd to see a Baylor home game.
</P>
<P>
   So even a 21-7 victory over TCU did little to spark enthusiasm
for the impending defeat at the hands of the Longhorns. And after
Texas sauntered off to the locker room with a 17-point lead, the
gray skies darkened. But in the Bears' locker room, there was hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't some great rah-rah speech from coach Teaff,''
Schulz said. ``He started talking, and slowly we all chimed in that
the only people beating us was ourselves. It wasn't like they were
stopping us.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything started to change when Johnny Greene blocked a Texas
punt in the third quarter. Johnny Slaughter recovered for the Bears
at the Texas 17-yard line, and Jeffrey took advantage with a
one-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak to trim the lead to
24-14.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bears got the ball back, Jeffrey tossed a 54-yard
touchdown pass to Ricky Thompson to pull them to within three.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's defense continued to dominate. After gaining 239 total
yards in the first half, the Longhorns got only 84 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kent, following a block from guard James ``Rell'' Tipton,
outran the Longhorns to the corner to score from six yards out to
give Baylor the lead for the first time. Bubba Hicks added two
short field goals to account for the final score.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Texas coach Darrell Royal addressed the Bears in
their locker room and told them the victory was not a fluke and
they might as well go on and win the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us, `Don't worry about A&AMP;M; we'll take care of
them,''' Schulz said. ``And they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' 32-3 victory over A&AMP;M on Thanksgiving weekend paved the
way for the Bears to claim their first SWC crown in 50 years with a
24-3 win over Rice. The Owls never had a chance, and the Miracle on
the Brazos was in the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use that word, but I never even thought of it that
way,'' said Teaff, whose 21-year career at Baylor included 10
victories over Texas. ``We never played miraculously, though some
of our play was amazing. The only miracle was the guys rose to the
occasion when they were supposed to be cannon fodder for the rest
of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it sounds good. I guess you have to expect stuff like that
when it is such a surprise to everyone. And that Texas game started
it all and ended the Longhorns' dominance in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has not won back-to-back conference championships outright
since, and Baylor won the next four games against Texas at Waco.
The Bears have beaten the Longhorns nine of the last 12 times at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise the afternoon of Nov. 9, 1974, started it all.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Schulz ran across one of his former high school
coaches at a local gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously out of the loop, the coach asked Schulz who won the
game, though he thought he already knew the answer.
</P>
<P>
   When told the Bears won, the coach replied incredulously, ``No,
you didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they did. And there were half a million people there to see
it.

ONE KILLED AND 24 HURT AS CAR CRASHES THROUGH RESTAURANT WINDOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One person was killed and 24 others were injured on
Thursday night when the driver of a car leaving a midtown parking
garage lost control and her car suddenly accelerated and plowed
into an Italian restaurant across the street, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The car, a red Mercedes driven by a 51-year-old woman, sheared
off the wooden restraining arm in the parking garage, crossed the
street and went through the window of Arno Ristorante at 141 West
38th Street, pinning diners against tables and walls and smashing
plates and furniture, witnesses said. The car finally came to a
stop in the middle of the crowded dining room.
</P>
<P>
   A 62-year-old man, Ciril Trucl of Fort Lee, N.J., died of heart
trauma at Bellevue Hospital Center, and a 28-year-old woman who had
been pinned under the car was in critical condition at St.
Vincent's Hospital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Marsha Feltingoff of West New York, N.J., was not
seriously injured in the accident, which occurred at 8:22 p.m.,
said Deputy Fire Chief Michael Weinlein.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other people were hospitalized, but their injuries were not
serious, hospital officials said. The other victims were treated at
the scene. The authorities did not immediately identify any of the
other victims.
</P>
<P>
   Weinlein said it was not clear how Ms. Feltingoff lost control
of her 1993 Mercedes 500 DL convertible, but he added, ``there are
reports of substantial speed.''
</P>
<P>
   A witness, Ed Fishbaum, told reporters, ``The lady just put the
key in the ignition and the car took off 50 miles an hour right
into the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feltingoff, the vice president for marketing for the boxing
promoter Don King, was not charged in the accident. Investigators
were interviewing her to try to reconstruct how the car might have
accelerated from a standing start past the barrier arm, across the
sidewalk, across four lanes of street, onto the sidewalk and into
the restaurant, a distance of at least 60 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feltingoff seemed badly shaken after the accident and
declined to comment to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feltingoff's mother, Shirley Feltingoff of Pompano Beach,
Fla., said that her daughter had been scheduled to have a business
meeting in midtown early in the evening and was probably getting
her car to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would feel terrible if anyone got hurt,'' Shirley
Feltingoff said after being told of the accident. ``She must be so
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Russo, 46, of New Rochelle, N.Y., said he was about to walk
across the driveway of the parking garage when the car suddenly
shot past him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been five steps faster she would have nailed me,'' he
said. Russo, who owns a pattern-making company in the garment
district, said the car ``just took off like a rocket.'' He said he
ran into the restaurant, called the police on his cell phone and
helped pull out a man who was trapped under the car. He said Ms.
Feltingoff was hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just crying and crying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Caraballo, who is the manager of the Crunch Fitness gym
across from the restaurant, said that the crash transformed a
peaceful dining scene to one of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of shock and panic going on,'' he said.
``There were people pinned by the car, broken dishes, utensils,
bread all over the floor. You name it.''
</P>
<P>
   The car destroyed the restaurant's plate-glass window and the
facade beneath it, but the building that housed the restaurant,
just east of Seventh Avenue, did not appear to have sustained
serious structural damage, the chief said.

INTERNET SERVER PRICED AT TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Internet service provider NetZero was priced at
the top of a revised price range Thursday in anticipation of what
is expected to be a strong initial public offering Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect a sharp rise in the stock price after the initial
offering despite the market's poor performance Thursday. Shares of
NetZero were priced at $16 late Thursday, well above the $9 to $11
range the company expected when it announced its IPO earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means is there's a lot of demand for the company's
stock,'' said Gail Bronson, senior analyst for Calabasas-based IPO
Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It also means more capital for the company. Selling 10 million
shares at $16 will raise $160 million, while under its previous
price range the company would have raised only $90 million to $110
million.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently are impressed with NetZero's free Internet
service business model, Bronson said. The company gives users free
Internet service in exchange for their agreeing to tolerate a
continuous stream of advertising banners on a portion of their
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a product of Pasadena-based incubator idealab, will
be listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol
NZRO.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taulli, Internet stock analyst and author of a weekly IPO
column published by Internet.com, said he was only slightly
concerned about the effect of the broader market's performance
Thursday on NetZero's initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nasdaq lost 3.8 percent of its value, Taulli said
he believes NetZero's stock could peak at $100 today, more than six
times its offering price.
</P>
<P>
   The recent wave of Internet IPOs has not satiated the market's
pent-up demand for strong initial offerings, Taulli said.
</P>
<P>
   EGain Communications Corp. had a strong first day of trading
Thursday despite the fact the market was down. EGain jumped $11 to
$23. ``The Internet is very strong. It usually doesn't go away very
quickly,'' Taulli said.
</P>
<P>
   The price of NetZero likely will go sharply higher before
sliding downward a bit, Taulli said. He predicted the stock will
stabilize well above its initial price of $16 a share, though, he
said.

CHEESECAKE FACTORY SUES MIAMI EATERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As far as The Cheesecake Factory is concerned,
imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing restaurant chain has sued the Nexxt Cafe in
Miami for allegedly hiring away a dozen Cheesecake Factory
employees who had photocopied its secret recipes, then using many
``strikingly similar'' items on its own menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rip-off of valuable properties,'' said Stephen
Nagin, attorney for The Cheesecake Factory, on Thursday. ``It's no
different from stealing Coca-Cola's recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for Nexxt said the lawsuit ``has the consistency of
watery mashed potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last week in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, accuses
Nexxt and 17 other defendants of violating Florida's trade secrets
law and of breaking signed confidentiality agreements not to
divulge Cheesecake Factory's recipes. It seeks an injunction to
stop using the recipes and unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   The case developed after Cheesecake Factory managers sampled the
menu at Nexxt, which opened in May in Miami's popular Lincoln Road
shopping area. Cheesecake Factory representatives say Nexxt's Tex
Mex Egg Rolls, Chinese Chicken Salad and Apple Banana-Nut French
Toast _ to mention just three examples _ carry the same names and
ingredients as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nagin said the Cheesecake Factory, which operates 30 outlets
including five in Florida, spends over $500,000 annually to develop
recipes and train chefs at its headquarters in Calabasas.
</P>
<P>
   Nexxt attorney Andrew Rosenblatt called the suit a sham, since
the ingredients are published on Cheesecake Factory's menu, placing
the recipes in the public domain, and many of the recipes and
individuals are not named. Additionally, he noted, Nexxt is 15
miles away from the closest Cheesecake Factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's akin to a restaurant in Santa Monica filing suit against
one in Long Beach,'' Rosenblatt said. ``The suit is full of
generalities and has the consistency of watery mashed potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagin insisted the recipes are proprietary despite the
ingredients being published on the menu, adding, ``What's listed on
the menu does not include all the ingredients nor how to make the
items.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Zerzollo, Cheesecake Factory's general counsel, said the
suit is the first such action her company has taken against a
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of The Cheesecake Factory rose 6.25 cents to $28.1875 on
light volume Thursday.

SHOOTING VICTIM TRIUMPHS OVER TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Riding a fire engine home from the hospital,
Benjamin Kadish lived a boy's dream _ six weeks after he nearly
died in the Jewish Community Center shooting.
</P>
<P>
   With a bashful smile, the 5-year-old was lifted by Los Angeles
firefighters out of a wheelchair and into the cab of Engine 72. He
wore an orange firefighter's helmet as a motorcade with lights
flashing, featuring an LAPD patrol car, the engine and a paramedic
ambulance, left Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Punctuating his poignant return, Benjamin pushed the siren pedal
in front of his family's West Hills home before he was carried
inside. Ben's family was overjoyed with his return home 44 days
after a lone gunman sprayed bullets inside the North Valley Jewish
Community Center in Los Angeles. Avowed white supremacist Buford
O'Neal Furrow Jr. admitted being the gunman when he surrendered to
the FBI in Las Vegas the next day, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to thank the paramedics who responded on that
tragic day in August. They essentially saved Benjamin's life,''
said his mother, Eleanor Kadish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would also like to thank the rest of the Los Angeles city
Fire Department for all that they have done on Benjamin's behalf
and of course for the ride home this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benjamin has been looking forward to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Also anticipating this day were firefighters, police officers,
residents shocked by the shooting and the entire Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   One of the firefighters who visited Benjamin both at Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles and at Kaiser and was there for his departure
was Todd Carb. The firefighter paramedic and his partner, Danny
Jordan, cared for Benjamin in the minutes after two bullets ripped
into his stomach and left thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pallor I remember when I first saw him was replaced with
color. The vacant stare has been replaced with the bright sparkle
in his eye,'' Carb said.
</P>
<P>
   Any lingering doubts about Benjamin's recovery were settled for
the firefighters when they gave him a red plastic toy fire helmet _
and he wished for a real one instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benjamin's quite a character; he's got a lot of personality,''
Carb said. ``He's got what we call chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin did get the helmet, after the firefighters plucked a
yellow one off the engine and placed it on his head for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Benjamin on the engine were his mother and his father,
Charles Kadish, and his 9-year-old brother, Joshua. Three of
Benjamin's friends were given rides in the paramedic ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade was the idea of city Fire Chief William Bamattre
``since we had an intimate relationship with Ben'' from the day of
the shooting, said Steve Ruda, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's wounds were the worst and his hospitalization the
longest among the five shooting victims at the community center.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Shalometh, the 68-year-old receptionist, was released
from the hospital on the night of the shooting. Mindy Finkelstein,
the 16-year-old camp counselor, and 6-year-old James Zidell were
released from hospitals two days later. Joshua Stepakoff, also 6,
was released from a hospital three days after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's homecoming was inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most significant milestones _ to know that
he's home. He was in the hospital an awfully long time,'' said Jeff
Rouss, executive vice president of the Jewish Community Centers of
Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew he was an incredibly strong boy. It was just a
matter of being patient and praying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's parents were thankful for the heartfelt support.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all our friends, old and new, in our fine community and
across the nation who have been so supportive and who have shared
their good wishes with Ben and our family we express our sincere
appreciation,'' Eleanor Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   Tears of joy were shed by those in the crowd around the
hospital's entrance Thursday to see Benjamin go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's positive to see the boy going home,'' said Terri Ching, a
Chatsworth Post Office clerk who brought her mom to Kaiser for
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Letter carrier Joseph Ileto was delivering mail from the
Chatsworth Post Office on Aug. 10 when he was shot and killed a few
miles away from the Jewish center. Authorities said Furrow
confessed to both shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Ching spoke briefly with Charles Kadish, offering encouraging
words and letting him know the Chatsworth Post Office workers were
thinking of his son. She noted they began wearing black armbands in
Ileto's memory this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(His return home) does help the healing,'' Ching said. ``I
don't know even how any of them survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's recovery will depend on him a great deal, said his
orthopedic surgeon at Kaiser. He said the boy is in good spirits
and making strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to get up and go. Once they get going, they're very
energetic,'' said Dr. David Mesna.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin is able to walk with assistance 50 or 60 feet. He will
be allowed to walk alone in about six weeks when four pins and a
metal bar supporting his broken left femur are removed. Nurses and
physical therapists will work with Benjamin mostly at his home,
Mesna said.
</P>
<P>
   The colostomy given to Benjamin so his bowel could heal likely
will be removed in about a month, said Lisa Kort, a Kaiser
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle,'' Charles Kadish said.

OFFSEASON OF MAJOR DECISIONS CONFRONTS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lee Pelekoudas has spent 20 years in the Mariners
front office, and he's never seen anything like it. Every offseason
is important, but the one starting in 10 days is unprecedented in
its confluence of major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With as many key players, with as many players that have been
a part of the organization for as long and contributed as much _
there hasn't been one (like this) in my judgment,'' said
Pelekoudas, Mariners vice president for baseball administration.
``It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelekoudas is one of two Mariners executives eager to take on
the challenge Woody Woodward passed up when he announced his
retirement last week. The other, Roger Jongewaard, also recognizes
the magnitude of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One real problem with being too young or too old is that you
run into too many of the same problems at the same time,'' said
Jongewaard, M's vice president for scouting and player development.
``You have to keep them coming in a steady flow so they come one
year at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe things will be that way in a regime headed by Pelekoudas
or Jongewaard _ or an outside candidate such as Pat Gillick or Bob
Watson. But for now, whoever gets the job is confronted with issues
at almost every spot in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best thing to come from this season is the
emergence of a pitching staff with every important member signed
for next season. Jamie Moyer, Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Gil
Meche will be back as starters, Jose Paniagua and Jose Mesa will
return in the bullpen, and Paul Abbott can be a starter or reliever
depending on what the Mariners find in free agency or trades.
</P>
<P>
   Midseason trades of Butch Huskey and David Segui boosted a
pitching staff that already was deep at Class AAA. And though none
of the prospects has distinguished himself consistently in Seattle,
the Mariners are hoping to use the young pitching depth to trade
for offensive help. This month's auditions by Robert Ramsay, Ken
Cloude, Brett Hinchliffe, et al, could be intended for the other 29
teams as much as for the M's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's market, you can get a very good player for one
pitcher,'' said Jongewaard. ``It was harder to do that before; you
might need to give up two pitchers. With today's shortage of
pitching, that changes. A good, young pitcher a team has control of
for six years _ that's worth a lot. I feel like if we had to trade
a pitcher for a player, we could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle acquired Huskey last winter for a Class A pitcher, and
got Brian Hunter in April for a Class A pitcher and outfielder.
Similar trades can be expected this winter because of the Mariners'
lack of position players in the high minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because our club has always been deep (in position players),
we've concentrated on pitching,'' Jongewaard said. ``We have some
good players coming, but I think they're between Rookie and A-ball.
The next wave of prospects will be players, and that's by design.
It's tough to keep the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the front office still has no word from ownership on
whether it will raise the payroll this winter, the Mariners at
least will have flexibility. Jeff Fassero, Mark Leiter, David
Segui, Huskey, Bobby Ayala, Butch Henry and Matt Mieske combined to
make about $15 million this year, and the only two left are the
injured Leiter and Henry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players acquired last winter were coming off
disappointing seasons that placed them in the M's price range. This
winter should offer a chance to find free agents coming off solid
years, like first baseman John Olerud or relievers Mike Jackson,
Graeme Lloyd, Mike Munoz, Arthur Rhodes, Mike Stanton and Mike
Trombley.
</P>
<P>
   Adding two relievers and shuffling Abbott back to the rotation
may be the best way to improve the pitching. The only attractive
free-agent starters seem unlikely fits for Seattle _ Omar Olivares
and Kenny Rogers are Scott Boras clients who will get top dollar,
and it will take plenty to lure David Cone or Chuck Finley from
comfortable homes.
</P>
<P>
   As for position players, free agency would solve at least one
spot, first base.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an examination of each position:
</P>
<P>
   FIRST BASE
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Olerud is a perfect fit. Olerud, a 31-year-old Seattle
native, has hit .290 or better in six of his past seven years and
had his best years in Toronto while Gillick was the GM there.
</P>
<P>
   The Segui trade exposed the Mariners' lack of left-handed
hitting, a flaw Piniella and Woodward recognized last winter when
they tried but failed to land players such as Jose Offerman, Steve
Finley and Robin Ventura. The procession of part-time players at
first will last only through September; the M's offered $18 million
to Segui for three years and can be expected to offer at least as
much to Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND BASE/SHORTSTOP/THIRD BASE
</P>
<P>
   David Bell has been a stalwart in the field and at the plate,
and he's signed for next season at $1.175 million. He no longer can
be considered a part-time player, and should see regular time at
second or third.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guillen, who will play designated hitter in winter ball
if his injured right knee cooperates, may return to second and bat
leadoff, forcing Bell to third base.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Russ Davis plays, of course, but Davis is in for a
raise from his $2.2 million salary and doesn't know if the M's will
go to arbitration or trade him. Davis improved markedly in the
field this year, and he could be attractive to a club that thinks
it can extract from him a breakthrough offensive season.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's shortstop Alex Rodriguez. It's almost inconceivable
that Rodriguez will sign a contract extension this winter _ he
would have everything to gain by waiting until 2000 to test free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, Baltimore and the Mets are all rumored destinations,
and there's a chance a team would trade dearly to get him,
believing a year in their city would convince Rodriguez to forego
free agency. That tactic worked for the Cardinals with Mark McGwire
in 1997, and for the Mets with Mike Piazza last year. Both players
liked their new teams and signed handsome contracts before open
bidding began.
</P>
<P>
   But with no guarantee from Rodriguez or Boras _ for whom free
agency is usually the preferred option _ it could be hard for the
Mariners to make the megadeal many expect.
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER
</P>
<P>
   The Dan Wilson/Tom Lampkin tandem has been a success, and the
Mariners can keep it intact by picking up Wilson's $4.4 million
option. Better still would be a contract extension for the
30-year-old catcher, but extending Rodriguez and center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr. is obviously most pressing. Lampkin is signed for 2000
at $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGNATED HITTER
</P>
<P>
   Like Rodriguez and Griffey, Edgar Martinez wants to win. And
unlike his more heralded teammates, Martinez, 36, has fewer years
in which to do it. His return to Seattle has always been assumed,
but Martinez's free agency puts his future with the M's in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar's always been a Mariner,'' said president Chuck
Armstrong. ``We would hope Edgar would complete his career as a
Mariner.''
</P>
<P>
   His brilliant season has proven Martinez could probably hit
until he's 50. He will command a one- or two-year deal worth well
more than the $3.5 million he made this season.
</P>
<P>
   LEFT FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is eligible for arbitration (he made $1.75 million in
'99) and despite his offensive struggles, his speed and defense
make him likely to return. The Mariners and Hunter acknowledge he
is miscast as a leadoff hitter, and if he's back he probably will
hit ninth.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Nobody _ not Griffey, Rodriguez, manager Lou Piniella, the front
office, the fans nor the new GM _ wants the pending free agency of
Griffey and Rodriguez to hang over the 2000 season. The issue has
been omnipresent in '99, at home and on the road. Contractually,
both players have a full season left here. But that's only on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to remember is Alex and Junior are under contract
for next year,'' Pelekoudas said. ``That doesn't mean we're not
going to try or haven't been trying to do something before then,
but they're not free agents until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we recognize the dilemma it puts everybody in.''
</P>
<P>
   With his veto power over any trade, Griffey controls his own
fate _ as he freely told a group of reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Possible destinations abound: With the Braves, he could win a
title, train at home in Orlando and chase Hank Aaron's home run
record on Hank Aaron Drive. With the Reds, he could play in a new
ballpark tailored to his liking and wear the uniform in which his
father starred. With the Mets, he could get revenge for a childhood
slight by Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. And signing an
extension with the trading team could appeal to Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with Seattle, he'd be revered for staying and remain
master of all he surveys. Clearly, this is the issue that won't go
away, and priority No. 1 for the next GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that may be bigger than the GM, really,''
Jongewaard said. ``But I'd rather have them and worry about
bringing them back than not have them and worry about getting
them.''
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Jay Buhner has acknowledged that he may have to
renegotiate to return to the Mariners. His $6.3 million option has
a $400,000 buyout, but the most likely scenario is that the
Mariners decline the option and re-sign Buhner to a one-year
contract for a lower base salary, with significant incentives.
</P>
<P>
   If he returns, it will likely be in the same role as this year _
right fielder, with left-handed hitting Raul Ibanez and John Mabry
filling in two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the ball still jumping off his bat well, he still has
the desire to work and compete,'' Piniella said. ``He does a very
nice job in that clubhouse; he's positive and he has the respect of
the players. You miss the amount of time he's missed the last
couple of years, it's hard. It's not easy to play with nagging
things.''
</P>
<P>
   MANAGER
</P>
<P>
   The future of Piniella, who is signed through next year, is
understandably on hold until a new general manager comes in.
Piniella has no interest in a large-scale rebuilding process, and
if that's what the GM envisions, he'll likely look elsewhere for a
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Piniella has no doubts he can coexist with the new GM. More
than anything, he believes, his people skills have served him best
as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job, basically, is to get along with people,'' Piniella
said. ``Whoever the organization brings in here, I'm sure he'll be
the right guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Piniella is the right guy for the GM, of course, will be
up to the GM.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of bases for the new general manager to cover in
the weeks and months ahead. So take a good look at the current
Mariners on this final homestand, which ends Sunday. There could be
a lot of turnover before the Mariners return for their next
homestand in spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to be very active in free agency and
trades, at least as far as effort goes,'' Pelekoudas said of the
impending off-season. ``There are never any guarantees you'll get
anything done, but the effort will be there.''

END OF AN ERA COULD BE HERE FOR MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Is this the end for Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez?
</P>
<P>
   In the saga of the Mariners superstars, another mile marker has
been reached. Thursday, they spent their last off day of the season
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Griffey and Rodriguez were packing boxes, canceling cable
TV accounts or arranging to have cars sent crosscountry. Tonight,
the Mariners begin their final series at Safeco Field before a
season-ending road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Will they ever come back? When will negotiations on contract
extensions reach ground zero?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Griffey met with a group of reporters in the
Mariners clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have you all assembled in one place, let me just say
that no one is going to decide what I'm going to do. Not my wife.
Not my agent. Not Woody (Woodward). Not Chuck (Armstrong). Just
me,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   That same night, Rodriguez spoke with a reporter from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it would be difficult to leave Seattle,'' Rodriguez said.
``But if I can foresee myself playing for a .400 baseball team
every year, it won't be that hard. Losing is not fun ... it would
be very hard to be in a situation like we're in right now, where
you don't have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Griffey and Rodriguez are heading into the weekend
thinking this could be the end for them in Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's agent said Thursday that twice this season, Griffey
and Rodriguez were interested in talking to the Mariners about
negotiating simultaneous deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of months ago, I made the suggestion that we go in
together to talk to the Mariners,'' Brian Goldberg said from his
office in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggested that (Rodriguez's agent) Scott (Boras), Kenny,
Alex and myself _ or any combination of the bunch _ talk. It seemed
to fall on receptive ears with the Mariners. They wanted to do it,
but Scott wasn't real interested,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in spring training. Then, I made the suggestion again
early in the season, just before Alex was back from knee surgery.
We were in Cleveland and again, Alex seemed receptive and said he'd
pass it along to Scott, but Scott didn't go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the hard-nosed Boras would reject any forum in which
his client's financial interests could be compromised. But the
point is, Griffey and Rodriguez understood that the best chance of
the Mariners keeping them was for the pair to work in tandem _
something unprecedented in modern-day sports free agency.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, it is good to remember, Rodriguez twice has
rejected Boras' advice on deals with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to borrow a phrase from Ken about him and Ken Sr., but
Kenny and Alex are not joined at the hip,'' Goldberg said. ``But
they have become genuinely good friends, and I think they
understand that the team is better with both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But four months have passed since the dynamic duo considered a
joint meeting with the M's. The mood for both Griffey and Rodriguez
is more serious, more suspicious about what the Mariners have
planned in terms of payroll and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that brings optimism to me is: How much are
they going to spend on this team?'' Rodriguez told the Denver Post.
``You can have Pope John Paul III come in as general manager and
with a $37 million payroll, we're not going anywhere. That's just
the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, with crunch time right around the corner, the Mariners
may be realizing that signing both players will be close to
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners have been very good in saying this is an
extremely high priority to get him signed,'' Goldberg said of
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they've never suggested that it will be my guy or this
guy. They don't want anyone to be in an uncomfortable position.
Certainly, it's going to be tough (to sign both).''
</P>
<P>
   That is why there is a sense around baseball that A-Rod will go
to the Mets, Rockies, Orioles or White Sox, while Griffey could go
to Atlanta _ a contender close to his Orlando home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the many theories about trades, neither Griffey nor
Rodriguez has made up his mind that his days in Seattle are done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about money,'' Rodriguez said. ``For me, this is
about winning a World Series ring. You could offer me $500 million
and I'm running away from it, especially if I could get $80 million
and have a chance to win it all. I'm looking for an opportunity to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Griffey, he is enough of a crowd-pleaser and enough of a
student of the game to understand he has the chance to do what few
others besides Cal Ripken or Tony Gwynn have done: Be an icon by
remaining with one team his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny's good at prioritizing factors and there are a lot of
things on both sides,'' Goldberg said. ``I'm sure it's on his mind
right now. It's not easy. If he stays, what kind of crimp is that
on his family situation, and if he goes, he'll break some hearts of
people who have been very good to him. Neither way is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mariners fans, the best hope is that neither Griffey nor
Rodriguez wants to be the first to say goodbye.

PARK STRUGGLES IN DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park gets to knock off early and miss the
three-game series finale in Houston, a reason for the rest of the
Los Angeles Dodgers to be jealous.
</P>
<P>
   But the right-hander won't exactly be kickin' back to a resort
hideaway to ease the mental and physical bumps of a disastrous
season. Instead, Park will be getting ready for a month-long
military excursion in his native Korea.
</P>
<P>
   It's just another in the long list of things that has
complicated the most trying season of Park's four-year career.
</P>
<P>
   That he pitched six innings to beat the San Francisco Giants 5-3
Thursday at Dodger Stadium to ensure his third straight winning
season is only a sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, despite being idle, clinched a tie for the NL West
crown. The Diamondbacks can win it tonight when they begin a
three-game series with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll shoot a few guns, do some running, try to have fun
with it,'' Park said of fulfilling his military commitment. ``I
have to be careful I don't get hurt. That's the one thing I worry
about.''
</P>
<P>
   A season that began with contract negotiations is ending with
thoughts of the military stint. In between, the right-hander
started a brawl, got suspended, gave up four grand slams,
contemplated what effect cutting his hair would have on his
country, and on a pair of occasions went a month without a win.
</P>
<P>
   So why should his final start at Dodger Stadium be anything but
a battle? Though Park (12-10) got through six innings for the third
straight start, it was never easy. He threw 114 pitches, walked six
and fired a pair of wild pitches. He offset that by striking out
eight, including Rich Aurilia with two outs and the bases loaded in
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It put Park in line to win his career-high sixth straight,
though he hasn't been dominating during the run. Only once during
that seven-start span did Park pitch past the sixth inning. Park
will make his last start of the season next week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times he's losing concentration and throws the ball all
over the place, he's not throwing the ball over the plate and
getting hit,'' said closer Jeff Shaw, who pitched the ninth for his
34th save. ``If he can keep that concentration level for the time
he's out there, he'll be in the eighth inning and have 90 or 95
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there have been other things on Park's mind since
spring training. The Dodgers can only hope Park continues to mature
and develop going into next season.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Park's thinking a multiyear contract hinged on
every pitch he threw. He hit rock-bottom early when St. Louis'
Fernando Tatis hit two grand slams in one inning during an April
start. Park's fortune didn't begin to turn around until he shaved
his head following an Aug. 15 loss to Florida. But before doing it,
Park said he thought of how the grooming would impact the people
who revere him in his home country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making his pitches when he has to in crucial
situations,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said. ``You'd rather not
get in those situations, but he's making the pitches when he has
to. He's really got a grip on his cut fastball and his sinker, and
early in the year he didn't have a cut fastball and was reaching
for his sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   In Korean custom, shaving the head is a sign of determination.
Since Park used the clippers, he's undefeated, though it had more
to do with the Dodgers scoring 49 runs in his six wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (the Dodgers) score, all I have to do is relax and get
hitters out,'' Park said. ``I got a got a couple bad experiences
this year, but I learned a lot.''

 TOP GOP HOPEFULS SKIP STATE CONVENTION TO AVOID PLATFORM BATTLE  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the California Republican Party gathers this weekend for what
should have been an exuberant kickoff of the presidential campaign
season, it is facing infighting that threatens to derail efforts to
win key state and congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   With California's high-profile presidential primary just six
months away, serious Republican candidates are avoiding the state
party's battle over its conservative platform by skipping this
weekend's convention in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Both front-runner George W. Bush and John McCain passed up the
chance to speak to over 1,000 party loyalists expected to attend,
citing scheduling conflicts. However, each plans to spend several
days in the state next week.
</P>
<P>
   The warfare in the party over its conservative stance on
abortion and gun control, and the resulting financial disarray, may
be trouble for GOP candidates in the so-called down ballot races.
</P>
<P>
   At stake next year are 80 Assembly districts, 20 state Senate
districts and 52 congressional seats. In addition, Democratic Sen.
Dianne Feinstein is seeking re-election in a potentially
high-profile race.
</P>
<P>
   The party _ headed by Silicon Valley software executive John
McGraw _ is in debt and faces a threat of a splinter group trying
to stop donations from going to the official party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is not addressing the problem that lost
the last election,'' said Bob Larkin, a member of the GOP executive
committee and organizer of a moderate group, the California
Congress of Republicans, that is holding an ``alternative''
convention this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Californians don't agree with the
Republican leadership,'' Larkin added. ``If it is going to keep
running on these issues, they are going to get the same 25 percent
of the vote and lose. We have to stop doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said about 100 moderates will meet across the street from
the official convention to adopt a platform that ``any Republican
candidate can run on.''
</P>
<P>
   But a party spokesman cited this week's special election in San
Bernardino to fill the seat of Democratic Rep. George E. Brown, who
died earlier this year, as an example of how well the party is
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got united behind one candidate, both at the state and
local level,'' said spokesman Stewart DeVeaux. ``Our goal is to get
Republicans elected.'' Republicans backed lawyer Elia Pirozzi, who
faces a runoff with state Sen. Joe Baca, the top Democratic
vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   But McGraw has faced criticism since he was elected for his
strict anti-abortion stance. More moderate GOP members said women
and minorities, and others who may not share McGraw's position on
abortion, have been shut out of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a few people trying to control the party, it is
always going to hurt,'' said Michael Mack, president of the
California Young Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The group has endorsed Bush, considered by Mack the type of
candidate who will overcome the fractures in the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``His views are strong and positive for the whole country,''
Mack said. ``I think he is the candidate that can not only bridge
the gap between Republicans, but can also bring in independents and
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the absence of Bush, convention attendees will hear a
keynote speech by Steve Forbes, who took a bus tour through central
California this week, trying to position himself as the only true
Reagan Republican and the alternative if Bush stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees also will hear from Elizabeth Dole, considered more
moderate than many of the other candidates, including talk-show
host Alan Keyes and state Sen. Ray Haynes, R-Riverside, who is
going to announce tomorrow at the convention that he is running for
Feinstein's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives in the party, who are the foot soldiers ... have
not had anyone in the party who has inspired them to go out and
work,'' Haynes said. ``I think my candidacy will re-energize the
party from the grassroots up.''

 MARS CRAFT LOST IN ORBIT APPROACH  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's space program suffered a loss when a Mars-bound
spacecraft &UR;  &LR; flying on a dangerous course toward the Red Planet
apparently burned up or broke apart when it hit the thin Martian
atmosphere Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After a record 20 successful missions demanding the most precise
computer navigation across millions of miles of space, NASA project
engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena were stunned
by the loss of their $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   But the spacecraft's companion vehicle, the Mars Polar Lander,
was safely headed on its independent flight path toward a delicate
December 3 landing on the edge of the planet's frozen south polar
region, mission controllers said.
</P>
<P>
   Not since August 1993, when NASA's Mars Observer was lost in
space because of a catastrophic fuel line rupture, have earthbound
scientists suffered such a major loss in their efforts to explore
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   The global system of listening posts for NASA's Deep Space
Network continued sweeping the skies Thursday in an effort to pick
up signals from the lost spacecraft, but they heard no trace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to report that we have a very serious problem with
the Mars Climate Orbiter,'' Carl Pilcher, chief of solar system
exploration for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be facing a loss of mission. If in fact we have lost
the spacecraft, it is very serious, but it is not devastating to
the Mars Surveyor program,'' he said. ``This is not necessarily
science lost, it is science delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Surveyor program involves a fleet of spacecraft to the
planet, with launches scheduled for 2001, 2003 and 2005. NASA will
send robot vehicles traveling across hundreds of miles of the
planet's varied terrain, studying how the planet evolved and
searching for evidence of water deep beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   By 2008, NASA's plans _ as yet unfunded _ include at least two
more missions to dig up Martian soil and bring samples back to
Earth. The loss of the orbiter comes as Congress is threatening to
cut a large portion of NASA's space exploration budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft was flying around the back
side of Mars, out of radio contact, and had just fired its main
engine to place it in its first orbit at about 2 a.m. Thursday. The
spacecraft was supposed to emerge to signal mission controllers at
2:26 a.m., but there was only silence, said Richard Cook, project
manager for Mars Surveyor operations at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cook, flight controllers had planned to approach
the planet at an altitude of about 93 miles, but after reviewing
navigation data from the spacecraft during the last six to eight
hours of its flight, it appeared that the actual altitude was far
too low _ only about 37 miles, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   At that altitude, the orbiter would have entered the upper Mars
atmosphere, which, while thin, was still dense enough to destroy
the spacecraft and burn up every trace of it. Cook said the orbiter
could not possibly have survived at an altitude of less than 53
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal error was apparently due to a faulty navigation
program, mission engineers suggested, and a thorough review of the
spacecraft's onboard computer commands has already begun, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiter was supposed to serve as NASA's first weather
satellite around another planet and also as a relay station for
signals from its companion, the $202 million Mars Polar Lander. But
data from that mission will not be lost with the failure of the
orbiter, mission controllers said, because the lander carries its
own radio and can send its findings directly to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Another spacecraft, the Mars Global Surveyor, has been flying in
orbit around the planet since July 1997, when Mars Pathfinder
landed and deployed its tiny Sojourner rover to examine and analyze
the rocks surrounding the landing site.
</P>
<P>
   Both the lander and its rover are now silent, but the Global
Surveyor is alive and radioing volumes of data from its orbital
path, and it also could serve as a relay station for the Mars Polar
Lander, mission engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Polar Lander also carries a roving vehicle, and it will
explore the flat and layered south polar region to search for
evidence of water, which is essential for life.
</P>
<P>
   During the final minutes of its descent, the lander is scheduled
to fire two ``microprobes'' penetrating at least a yard into the
Martian surface. Those unique devices will be linked to radio
transmitters on the surface, and they too can send data on the
findings of the probes directly to Earth.

CLINTON VETOES $792 BILLION GOP TAX-CUT BILL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he promised all along, President Clinton vetoed
the Republicans' $792 billion, 10-year tax cut Thursday, calling it
a return ``to the failed policies of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   With the veto, Clinton killed a raft of items, from an
across-the-board cut in income taxes to ``marriage penalty''
relief, as well as one of Silicon Valley's top priorities _ a
five-year, $13.1 billion extension of the research and development
tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   In a Rose Garden ceremony replete with a five-piece brass
ensemble playing ``Summertime'' from ``Porgy and Bess,'' Clinton
nonetheless signaled that he would be open to negotiation, on his
terms. If Republicans adopt his proposal to add a prescription drug
benefit to Medicare and bolster Social Security with general tax
revenue, the president said, he will be open to a smaller tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can work together to meet these objectives, we can also
work together to pass tax relief we can afford,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans swiftly denounced the veto, declaring that they will
not negotiate a smaller package with Clinton, but will make another
run at their own  &LR; tax cut next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret the president has stolen this tax cut from working
American families,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it that the president doesn't like about this bill?''
added Lott, ticking off some of its most popular provisions.
</P>
<P>
   With a veto expected for months and Republicans lacking anywhere
near the votes to override it, the tax bill serves chiefly as a
political totem to highlight differences between the parties in the
run-up to the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans calculate that they are better off spotlighting
Clinton's veto than negotiating a scaled-back compromise that could
gut many of their favorite provisions, such as a cut in
capital-gains taxes, while creating new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, repeating a familiar refrain from his past successful
budget confrontations with the GOP, accused Republicans of
squandering the projected $1 trillion budget surplus on tax breaks
for the wealthy. The bill would ``force drastic cuts in education,
health care and other vital areas,'' Clinton said. ``It's too big,
too bloated (and) places too great a burden on the American
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., countered that the GOP
``will not trade tax cuts for massive government spending that
steals from the Social Security trust fund and robs us from paying
down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said the tax cut demonstrates the ``difference in
philosophy between this Congress and the White House,'' in which
Republicans believe ``that the American people should have a little
bit more control over their own money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the tax bill _ heralded by Republicans as the
biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan's first term and derided by
Democrats such as Vice President Al Gore as a ``gigantic, risky tax
scheme'' _ would scarcely have been noticeable to most taxpayers,
at least in the early years.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was to be phased in over 10 years in line with
gradually increased budget-surplus projections, many of its
provisions would not have taken effect for several years. The 1
percent cut in tax rates would not have kicked in until 2005, well
after the end of the next president's first term. Seldom has
Congress left the tax code alone for so long.
</P>
<P>
   If anything is to be salvaged from this year's tax bill, the
research and development tax credit is sure to be at the top of the
list. Both parties are tripping over themselves to court the
high-tech industry, and the credit, backed not just by Silicon
Valley but nearly the entire business sector, enjoys firm support
in both parties. Gore has said he would like to make it permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The credit expired June 30, and if it is not extended,
businesses stand to lose $1.6 billion in tax breaks next year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he would be willing to consider a very limited tax
package that would resuscitate the credit and other provisions
expiring this year. ``We're not ruling that out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee will move immediately to
craft such a package and include a provision to abolish the
alternative minimum tax for individuals. Originally aimed at the
wealthy, the tax is now paid by 8.4 million people in part because
they take child care and education tax credits that push them into
higher tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   Lott cautioned, however, that ``if we do one (package) it will
be very minimal,'' including just a handful of expiring tax
provisions. The majority leader said he feared that any new tax
bill would instantly attract dozens of other pet tax breaks that
would swamp the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These usually become an engine that pulls a lot of cars,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv, however, said ``it would be a
mistake'' to craft a package of expiring tax provisions without
addressing provisions such as child care, long-term care or other
items in the GOP tax bill that Clinton favors.
</P>
<P>
   The chief tax lobbyist for the National Association of
Manufacturers, Monica McGuire, said she was ``guardedly
optimistic'' that the research and development credit would
survive.
</P>
<P>
   However, McGuire said it would probably not come in a separate
tax package, which is fraught with procedural and political perils
this late in the year, but be folded into a giant spending bill
passed at the last minute. Congress is racing to complete its
must-pass spending bills by October, leaving little time for other
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it has any chance, it'll be part of an omnibus spending
bill, which is exactly what they did last year,'' McGuire said.
``It came literally in the last 24 hours before they adjourned, and
that's my best guess at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also talk of combining a Democratic proposal to
increase the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15, over two years with the
more popular items in the GOP tax bill, including the research and
development credit, as well as marriage penalty relief, a credit
for long-term health care and, perhaps, even a cut in estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have enough support from both Republicans and
Democrats for (an R&AMP;D extension),'' said Connie Correll,
spokeswoman for the Information Technology Industry Council, a
trade group representing large high-tech companies including Cisco
Systems and Microsoft. ``Both sides want to do something to help
the industry, so they may find something.''

 FEAR NOT, O.J.'S ON THE CASE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Johnnie Cochran, Barry Scheck and Robert
Shapiro, wherever you are: Please pick up the white courtesy phone.
</P>
<P>
   That was O.J. Simpson's legal Dream Team. The Juice made them
famous, and now it might be time for them to repay his kindness.
</P>
<P>
   In the big Housing Authority bribery scandal, one of the 24
people charged by the feds is Tracy Baker, alleged to have
falsified documents to obtain a housing voucher, a federal rent
assist.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also is accused of helping arrange for seven others,
including her sister Toni Baker, to improperly purchase the
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy and Toni are cooperating with the government in exchange
for a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the O.J. connection: Tracy and Toni are O.J.'s nieces.
They are daughters of Juice's sister, Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a housing scam, I can't help but wonder if Kato
Kaelin is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O.J. has dedicated himself to finding the  &UR; real &LR; 
housing cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   HISSED OFF: Wednesday evening at the cable-car turnaround at
Market and Powell, I saw a man with two huge snakes twined around
his neck and arms.
</P>
<P>
   At least I assumed he was the owner of the snakes, not merely a
man who walked under the wrong tree. Who knows what's lurking in
all those palm trees they're planting along the Embarcadero?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, snake ``owner'' is an offensive term. As the
animal-rights people are teaching us, animals are not owned. Those
snakes are the man's significant others, or domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   They were large. One looked big enough to mate with Lombard
Street.
</P>
<P>
   They're the first snakes I remember seeing in the city, and I
suspect their appearance is due to Willie Brown's recent comments
that San Francisco has 780,000 snakes ready to bite him.
</P>
<P>
   The snakes looked a lot like Clint Reilly and Frank Jordan.
Maybe Brown's remarks gave them the courage to come out of the
closet, be openly proud that they are flaming reptiles and court
the snake vote.
</P>
<P>
   Someone should warn Willie. Frank and Clint would consider da
Mayor's ankles a fang-tastic snack. Or they might be setting their
sights even higher.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOOD FOLKS at Pac Bell were kind enough to build the Giants
and their fans a ballpark, so you won't hear me gripe about the
name _ Pac Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   But let's face reality: Few people are going to use the
ballpark's proper name. Maybe folks will call it the Bell, or go
generic-hip and refer to it as the ballyard.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other possibilities. I read up on the history of
the ballpark site, supplied by club exec Alfonso Felder, and a few
other names come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The land was home at various times to the S.F. Gas Light
Company, the Citizen Gas Company, a coal gasification plant and a
gas station. So we could call it the Gas House, intending no
disrespect to the ballpark's hot-dog supplier.
</P>
<P>
   This acreage was also a major docking area and a lumber wharf,
so the Dock or the Lumberyard might fit.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the property is former bay that was probably filled with
rubble from the '06 Quake. Thus: Quakey Acres.
</P>
<P>
   Or we could nickname the park after a business that occupied the
site earlier this century: the Ice House.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fitting name in many ways. The new park won't be as
frigid as Candlestick, but nobody will mistake it for Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   The city will have the coolest ballpark in baseball and the
coolest manager. Why not go with the coolest name?
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVORS of the Quake of '89 are already rounding up their
memories for the 10th anniversary on October 17.
</P>
<P>
   First announced memorial/celebration: A noon lunch on October 15
at the Gold Coast on California Street, featuring heroes of the
Loma Prieta Quake and music and costumes of that period.
</P>
<P>
   And your own quake memory might win you free dinners. Send it,
one page max, to the Gold Coast (230 California St., 94111).
</P>
<P>
   I'VE NEVER SMOKED a factory-made cigarette, not even in a moment
of Youthful Indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm going to organize a Bay Area Puff-In to protest the
government's persecution of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   We'll gather in Golden Gate Park and hold aloft our lighters as
we sing ``Puff the Magic Dragon,'' ``Smokin' in the Boys' Room''
and other smoker-freedom songs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the tobacco people are lying sacks and murderers, but
let's be fair. The U.S. government suing cigarette makers for
duping the public and spreading disease and death is like Bonnie
suing Clyde for robbing banks.
</P>
<P>
   Why not sue McDonald's, or 31 Flavors?

   Others think his scowl is a fatal political liability,
especially when telegenic political campaigns are all the rage in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The man under the microscope is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, one of
Mexico's most enigmatic opposition politicians. Two years ago, the
notoriously dour Cardenas led a revolution at the polls here,
becoming the first mayor of Mexico City to be democratically
elected by the people rather than appointed by Mexico's president.
</P>
<P>
   He was swept into office in July 1997 by jubilant voters who
wanted to wound Mexico's ruling Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and
elect one of the party's most persistent critics. Now Cardenas is
about to step out of office to run for Mexico's presidency as
either the candidate of the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, or an opposition alliance. But 20 months after he
was sworn in as mayor with high hopes for leaving his mark on this
troubled city, Cardenas' popularity has dropped and he is sinking
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters are criticizing their hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He inherited a city with deep-seated corruption and chaos. And
he, in good faith, thought things could be changed faster than they
could. Little by little, he found out that wasn't so,'' said
Reforma newspaper columnist Guadalupe Loaeza, who still would like
to see Cardenas win the presidency in Mexico's July 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, Loaeza said, is that 65-year-old Cardenas has been
crippled by infamously bad public relations skills _ his own _ and
those of his aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't been able to promote the good things they've
done,'' said Loaeza, who recently wrote a ``Dear Cuauhtemoc''
column that pleaded with him to improve his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political culture has changed dramatically in the last
year, Loaeza and other analysts note, and Cardenas has been
eclipsed by other presidential hopefuls who are already selling
themselves _ in clever ads, on billboards and in frequent
interviews and cheerful appearances on television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   In August Cardenas began radio and television ads describing
improved social programs in the city and advances against crime.
But Cardenas is the only candidate for the presidency who has
refused to appear on a late-night talk show where he would have to
submit to a free-wheeling interview with a popular comic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Cardenas just hasn't been able to intuitively adapt to
these changes,'' Loaeza said. ``But it doesn't really suit him. It
would be as if he were to suddenly put on jeans and a lumberjack
shirt after wearing suits for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   In an August 1998 poll taken by Mexico's Indemerc-Lou Harris
polling service, Cardenas was the top candidate among all
presidential frontrunners. A year later the same polling operation
found he was trailing those same candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cardenas was preferred by only 11.7 percent of poll
respondents compared to 25.2 percent who preferred another
opposition candidate, Vicente Fox of the conservative National
Action Party, or PAN. Roberto Madrazo and Francisco Labastida, who
are competing against each other in a November primary for the
PRI's nomination, were preferred by 25.2 percent and 23.7 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' decline is attributed in great part to his poor
communications skills and his failure to make a dramatic dent in
Mexico City's notorious crime problem. He says his administration
has arrested hundreds of criminal rings and begun the painstaking
task of revamping the police and rooting out corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But that appears lost on the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although in recent weeks we've seen his television spots,
where he says things have changed, we the citizens don't feel these
changes,'' said Hector Ramirez, a 40-year-old federal government
employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's archaic,'' said 22-year-old student Veronica Jimenez.
``He never seems to give concrete answers. He evades the press by
saying that everything needs to be analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic Fox, who has been campaigning actively for more
than two years, has also stolen Cardenas' thunder by waging a
campaign that's friendly to the press and other media. ``Middle
class Mexico City voters who turned out for Cardenas may now swing
over to Fox,'' says political writer Raymundo Riva Palacio.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for Cardenas to remain a contender, analysts say,
is for Mexico's opposition parties to unite in an alliance that
backs one candidate in 2000. The purpose would be to beat the PRI,
which has controlled Mexico's presidency for more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Daily negotiations are underway to shape an alliance, even
though many political insiders believe such a front is hopeless
given the profound differences between Cardenas' PRD and Fox's PAN.
A citizens' council on Tuesday submitted a plan to Mexico's
opposition parties that calls for holding a nationwide primary to
select an alliance candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Polls often put Fox in the lead in such a primary. But Cardenas
has a chance if the PRD can muster its loyalists, who are better
organized and more likely to turn out at polls than PAN
sympathizers, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People admire Cardenas' perseverance,'' said Joel Estudillo of
the Mexican Institute of Political Studies. ``Cardenas is a very
traditional figure. His speeches may be boring. But in spite of
that he's managed to remain a leader of the movement for
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a type of halo,'' Loaeza agrees.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas inherited his noble image, in part, from his father,
Lazaro Cardenas, a beloved figure here akin to Franklin D.
Roosevelt. As president of Mexico in the 1930s, Lazaro Cardenas
distributed land, built public works and nationalized Mexico's oil
industry, which is celebrated as a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc (pronounced, ``Kwow-TAY-mok'') is named after the
Aztecs' martyred last emperor, who was tortured by Spanish
conquistadors seeking gold.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was a member of the PRI who served in
various jobs, including governor of Michoacan state. In the
mid-1980s he formed a dissident ``democratic current'' within the
party and then broke away to become the 1988 presidential candidate
of a united leftist front.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans believe Cardenas won that 1988 election but that
the PRI's Carlos Salinas de Gortari stole it from him. Cardenas
went on to co-found the PRD, which objected to many of Salinas'
free-market economic reforms. Cardenas then ran a lackluster
campaign for president again in 1994 and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas rebounded, however, when the PRI's credibility plunged
along with the Mexican peso in 1995. He vaulted into the mayor's
job, which was meant as a springboard to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Cardenas took office, he was met with resistance,
however.
</P>
<P>
   In response to demands for more order, Cardenas tried to have
street venders removed from downtown streets where they clog roads
and often sell stolen or black-market goods.
</P>
<P>
   But the venders, many of whom are organized into PRI-controlled
unions, put up a stiff fight, creating even more chaos by clashing
with police and portraying themselves as oppressed urban poor.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas also inherited a city with a huge debt the federal
government has refused to absorb. And as mayor, he has been
subjected to television coverage biased in favor of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very clear there's been no truce with Cardenas,''
Estudillo said. When television comic Paco Stanley was shot to
death on a Mexico City street, television anchors _ even the
president of one company _ instantly took to the airwaves to blame
Cardenas for allowing crime to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Stanley is believed to have been killed by
drug traffickers with whom he was consorting rather than common
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Cardenas has done quite so bad a job as people
make it seem,'' said Peter Ward, a University of Texas at Austin,
Mexico specialist who authored a book on Mexico City and has been
studying Cardenas' administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas bungled some appointments, which made him vulnerable to
charges of ineptitude. Squabbling among the PRD ranks serving in
city government hasn't helped, nor have attacks on Cardenas by a
PRD co-founder, Porfirio Munoz Ledo, another presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas' government has managed to fix roads and make some
``honest'' attempts to correct Mexico's massive environmental,
traffic and law-enforcement problems, according to Ward. Cardenas
has also tried to ``crack the whip'' with city employees to
inculcate a more responsive attitude, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rather soft, touchy-feely kinds of things,'' Ward
said. ``But I get the sense that there's much closer contact with
people. And in Mexico I think that's a real achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state-of-the-city speech on Sept. 17, Cardenas portrayed
his administration as the beginning of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can go back to governing the way they did before,'' he
said. ``This democratic change is irreversible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is saying, 'I laid down the foundation for a new
relationship between government and the people,''' said Estudillo.
``That's what Cardenas is going to exploit in his campaign. The
trouble is he should have started doing that a long time ago.''

<P>
   GIZA, Egypt _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Sunday will
extend his reign in a way befitting the land of the pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   Unopposed in a planned referendum, Mubarak will win his fourth
six-year term from Egyptians accustomed to distant leaders and
limited options.
</P>
<P>
   The stocky son of humble origins in the Nile delta is already
Egypt's longest serving president. He has held office 18 years,
surpassing such giants as Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hardly has their charisma or ego, the 71-year-old
ex-bomber pilot has championed ``mega-projects'' that literally
divert the Nile and create new cities. He has stabilized his
country's once-bankrupt economy, though poverty is still widespread
among the 67 million people.
</P>
<P>
   He re-established Egypt's status as the most influential Arab
country, with a foreign policy based on a closeness with the United
States. Finally, he has contained terrorists that seek to replace
his regime with one based on fundamental Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But, Egyptians wonder whether Mubarak can now set aside his
government's authoritarian tactics and create a modern democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups count thousands of political prisoners in
Egyptian jails where torture, including electric shock, is
systematic. Even Mubarak's campaign tours are preceded with
sweeping arrests of locals. Egyptian officials say they only jail
members of terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The slums of the Imbaba area of downtown Giza has seen both
sides of the Mubarak rule _ the hard edge and the public works.
</P>
<P>
   Here, 800,000 people live on streets strewn with trash and
rutted by donkey carts. Retired construction worker Fathi Mabruk
broke into wry laughter when asked if he will vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? You think I am going to tell you if I'm not,'' he said,
drawing his index finger across his throat.
</P>
<P>
   This was once a stronghold for anti-government Islamists. Six
years ago, Mubarak sent thousands of troops and armored cars onto
these streets. They jailed many, including Imams who were replaced
in their mosques by other religious leaders friendly to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Mubarak followed up with badly needed sewage systems,
water service and health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   His National Democratic Party held a rally there last week. He
did not attend, but the roads were lined with signs, such as,
``Yes, Mubarak, president for life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government provides all these services, the least I can
do is vote,'' construction worker Mabruk conceded, as a government
worker urged him to hang a campaign poster.
</P>
<P>
   Salah Eissa, a political writer and leader of a drive to
establish a parliamentary democracy, said Mubarak phased out
Egypt's old socialist economic approach. But, he held off needed
political reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the closest thing to an absolute monarchy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is some latitude for free speech, political parties
must be approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian law lets the president control the parliament, appoint
local governors, and keep the country under sweeping emergency
powers allowing detention without trials.
</P>
<P>
   Eissa's coalition, including political parties and human rights
groups, calls for an end to the emergency law, a scaling back of
presidential powers and free elections.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Mubarak has had to focus on the economy before
political reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``His priority was not the constitution,'' said Nabil Osman,
chairman of the Egyptian state information service and close
Mubarak aide. ``His priority was the bankrupt economy. A
constitutional debate would not unify the country. It would have
divided the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech to college students, Mubarak made vague
promises of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the forthcoming period,'' he said. ``We shall not hesitate
to achieve changes or reforms that enhance the participation of
citizens in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   But, questions about what that means highlight how closed
Egyptian politics are.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of change? Only the president will know,'' Osman
said. ``He is the only one. He is studying it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional adds follow.)
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak is famous, and sometimes criticized, for his studious
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Born in a farming community in the Nile delta, he rose through
the Egyptian Air Force to become a bomber pilot, receiving training
twice in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   He flew missions in the 1956 and 1967 wars against Israel. He
commanded the air force in its surprise attack on Israel,
considered a huge success in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, 1981, Mubarak and Sadat were reviewing a parade
commemorating the 1973 war. Militants in the army attacked the
reviewing stand and killed Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   The assassins opposed the peace Sadat had made with Israel and,
some say, the brush with death is one reason the cautious Mubarak
has only traveled to Israel once.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has little of Sadat's imperial manner. He uses a
common-man's Arabic and occasionally drives his own Mercedes-Benz
in official motor pools.
</P>
<P>
   At 71, he is said to be an avid squash player and not yet
entertaining notions of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very simple man and a very modest man,'' said Osama
El-Ghazali Harb, editor of the semi-official International Politics
Review and a member of the Egyptian parliament. ``He insists he is
not a politician by profession and came to politics accidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, Mubarak has followed Sadat's path in peace, reaffirming
relations with Israel even while much of the Egyptian press has
opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   That has helped seal relations with the United States. Egypt
receives $2 billion a year in U.S. aid, second only to Israel's
nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak has put the aid, and Egyptian money, into thousands of
health clinics and industrial complexes. His government oversaw the
$7 billion Cairo subway, a badly needed and popular transportation
system.
</P>
<P>
   His largest project is the diversion of water from the Nile to
create new farmlands in the desert. It is expected to cost more
than $40 billion when completed.
</P>
<P>
   But, the country's illiteracy rates still hover around 50
percent and government bureaucracy is still notoriously lethargic.
</P>
<P>
   The political scene is especially lifeless and few feel Sunday's
referendum is anything but a democratic facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is challenging the power of the regime itself,'' said
Walid Kazziha, political scientist at the American University in
Cairo. ``In that sense, the regime has been successful.''

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Soaring unemployment, political unrest,
restive labor unions, stifled consumer spending: the portrait of
Venezuela's economy isn't one to invite a stampede of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American companies are already here in a big way, their
names gracing Caracas' soaring skyscrapers or plastered over
billboards lining the country's modern interstate-like highway
system: Ford, IBM, Coca-Cola and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn here by the oil boom of the 1970s that vaulted Venezuela
to a broad-based prosperity that became the envy of Latin America,
the companies have weathered previous downturns, although none
perhaps as serious as the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is hurting,'' said Jorge Redmond, owner of a
chocolate-making firm and president of the Venezuelan-American
Chamber of Commerce. ``Our sales are down 15 percent, and that
applies to most consumer items. Even beer sales are down, and
that's unheard of. Unemployment is rising and people don't have
money, so they aren't spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over the nation's political turmoil has sparked a
reported 40 percent drop in foreign investment this year, so far.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that uncertainty is Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, an outspoken populist who swept to power in a campaign last
fall based on a promise to toss out the country's corrupt political
system, rewrite the constitution and redistribute the nation's oil
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has worried business leaders by lashing out at the
``savage'' impact of market reforms in which state-run companies
have been turned over to the private sector. When the president of
Venezuela's state-owned oil company resigned, he quickly appointed
a close ally and vowed to wipe out the company's lavish habits of
paying executives huge salaries and squiring them around the world
in private jets.
</P>
<P>
   His actions have sent a wave of concern through financial
markets. Earlier this month, Moody's Investor Service placed
several affiliates of the Venezuelan oil company under review for a
possible downgrade, citing concerns that the Chavez administration
might try to exert undue control over the company.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech to the United Nations and in a meeting with
President Clinton last week, Chavez went out of his way to reassure
the international community about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pledge to the whole world from this podium that
Venezuela has respected, is respecting and will respect the essence
of a democratic process that arose from the will of the people,''
he told the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials called their meeting with Chavez
``positive,'' although Clinton did express concerns over
Venezuela's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more confident about him,'' said Kenneth ``Buddy''
McKay, Clinton's special envoy for Latin America, who attended the
meeting with the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Venezuela, most business leaders remain guarded in their
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say most of the business community did
not accompany Mr. Chavez to the ballot box,'' Redmond said. ``But
far from being belligerent, we're in the mode of being helpful
where we can. We're trying very hard to get our ideas into the new
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Atlanta-base Coca-Cola Co., which became
Venezuela's dominant soft drink three years ago after luring away
rival PepsiCo Inc.'s longtime bottling partner, said they never
comment on politics in any of the countries where they do business.
They acknowledged, however, that the severe economic downturn and a
renewed effort by Pepsi have made for a challenging situation in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   One American company that has managed to skate above the turmoil
is BellSouth Corp., which moved into Venezuela's fledgling cellular
telephone market in the early 1990s. The Atlanta-based
telecommunications giant now owns 78 percent of TelCel, which
controls nearly two-thirds of the Venezuelan cellular market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been growing by 50 to 60 percent a year from the day we
started,'' said Mario Lizaso, BellSouth's point man at TelCel.
``Many industries here are hurting, but people are making a choice
about what they want to spend their money on, and fortunately for
us, they feel a hunger for telecommunications . . . we offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan companies, meanwhile, appear to be lobbying hard to
get Chavez to address the economic situation. They realize the
nation has taken something of a public-relations beating, with news
reports raising the specter of a dictatorship and a possible round
of nationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community around the world has gotten the view
that it is a very difficult situation here,'' said Vicente Britos,
president of Fedecamaras, the national association of Venezuelan
Chambers of Commerce. ``But they should realize that our political
confrontation and change have come about as a public debate. There
have been no actions or decisions taken against the business
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who has met with Chavez personally and finds him
cordial and attentive, agrees. But he worries that Chavez has spent
his first months in office focusing on politics and rewriting the
constitution, allowing the stumbling economy to worsen
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't stuck a finger in business's eye, but we're also
very much waiting for a signal that the economy will be what he
will attend to next,'' he said. ``It's very difficult to say where
he's going next.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond says the biggest worry of most business leaders is the
caliber of Chavez's economic team.
</P>

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Soaring unemployment, political unrest,
restive labor unions, stifled consumer spending: the portrait of
Venezuela's economy isn't one to invite a stampede of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American companies are already here in a big way, their
names gracing Caracas' soaring skyscrapers or plastered over
billboards lining the country's modern interstate-like highway
system: Ford, IBM, Coca-Cola and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn here by the oil boom of the 1970s that vaulted Venezuela
to a broad-based prosperity that became the envy of Latin America,
the companies have weathered previous downturns, although none
perhaps as serious as the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is hurting,'' said Jorge Redmond, owner of a
chocolate-making firm and president of the Venezuelan-American
Chamber of Commerce. ``Our sales are down 15 percent, and that
applies to most consumer items. Even beer sales are down, and
that's unheard of. Unemployment is rising and people don't have
money, so they aren't spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over the nation's political turmoil has sparked a
reported 40 percent drop in foreign investment this year, so far.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that uncertainty is Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, an outspoken populist who swept to power in a campaign last
fall based on a promise to toss out the country's corrupt political
system, rewrite the constitution and redistribute the nation's oil
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has worried business leaders by lashing out at the
``savage'' impact of market reforms in which state-run companies
have been turned over to the private sector. When the president of
Venezuela's state-owned oil company resigned, he quickly appointed
a close ally and vowed to wipe out the company's lavish habits of
paying executives huge salaries and squiring them around the world
in private jets.
</P>
<P>
   His actions have sent a wave of concern through financial
markets. Earlier this month, Moody's Investor Service placed
several affiliates of the Venezuelan oil company under review for a
possible downgrade, citing concerns that the Chavez administration
might try to exert undue control over the company.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech to the United Nations and in a meeting with
President Clinton last week, Chavez went out of his way to reassure
the international community about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pledge to the whole world from this podium that
Venezuela has respected, is respecting and will respect the essence
of a democratic process that arose from the will of the people,''
he told the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials called their meeting with Chavez
``positive,'' although Clinton did express concerns over
Venezuela's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more confident about him,'' said Kenneth ``Buddy''
McKay, Clinton's special envoy for Latin America, who attended the
meeting with the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Venezuela, most business leaders remain guarded in their
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say most of the business community did
not accompany Mr. Chavez to the ballot box,'' Redmond said. ``But
far from being belligerent, we're in the mode of being helpful
where we can. We're trying very hard to get our ideas into the new
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Atlanta-base Coca-Cola Co., which became
Venezuela's dominant soft drink three years ago after luring away
rival PepsiCo Inc.'s longtime bottling partner, said they never
comment on politics in any of the countries where they do business.
They acknowledged, however, that the severe economic downturn and a
renewed effort by Pepsi have made for a challenging situation in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   One American company that has managed to skate above the turmoil
is BellSouth Corp., which moved into Venezuela's fledgling cellular
telephone market in the early 1990s. The Atlanta-based
telecommunications giant now owns 78 percent of TelCel, which
controls nearly two-thirds of the Venezuelan cellular market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been growing by 50 to 60 percent a year from the day we
started,'' said Mario Lizaso, BellSouth's point man at TelCel.
``Many industries here are hurting, but people are making a choice
about what they want to spend their money on, and fortunately for
us, they feel a hunger for telecommunications . . . we offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan companies, meanwhile, appear to be lobbying hard to
get Chavez to address the economic situation. They realize the
nation has taken something of a public-relations beating, with news
reports raising the specter of a dictatorship and a possible round
of nationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community around the world has gotten the view
that it is a very difficult situation here,'' said Vicente Britos,
president of Fedecamaras, the national association of Venezuelan
Chambers of Commerce. ``But they should realize that our political
confrontation and change have come about as a public debate. There
have been no actions or decisions taken against the business
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who has met with Chavez personally and finds him
cordial and attentive, agrees. But he worries that Chavez has spent
his first months in office focusing on politics and rewriting the
constitution, allowing the stumbling economy to worsen
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't stuck a finger in business's eye, but we're also
very much waiting for a signal that the economy will be what he
will attend to next,'' he said. ``It's very difficult to say where
he's going next.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond says the biggest worry of most business leaders is the
caliber of Chavez's economic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clearly doesn't have any economic training, and he's
surrounded with people who are from the leftist parties,'' he said.
``On the other hand, he clearly has a huge mandate from the people,
and we all agree there is a real need for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond and other business leaders were expected to accompany
Chavez on a trip to New York and Washington last week(CQ),
hopefully using the visit to reassure financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want this president to be a success,'' he said.
``People are giving him the benefit of the doubt. But as with
everything else, he is going to have to be the one giving the
message. We're still anxiously awaiting that message.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ This is a labor of lore for Ben Crenshaw.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have given himself such a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Golf's foremost antiquarian has willingly exposed his views to
potential ridicule for being antiquated, so passionate is his
devotion to the game's roots.
</P>
<P>
   In his cherished role as US Ryder Cup captain, Crenshaw couldn't
stomach the squabbling between the PGA of America and some touring
pros over the charitable distribution of revenues from the matches.
So, without prompting on the eve of the PGA Championship at
Medinah, Ill., last month, he publicly castigated four of his
players _ Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, David Duval, and Phil
Mickelson _ for making too much of the matter for too long, as if
they were trampling upon sacred ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affront to others who came before them,'' he said at
the time. ``Men like Byron Nelson and Henry Cotton and Arnold
Palmer and Christy O'Connor.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking those four names, which are sprinkled through some of
the 450 books on golf history he keeps in his home library in
Austin, Texas, didn't get Crenshaw in trouble. But mentioning the
other four _ who happen to constitute a key third of the 12-man
team he will is sending against Europe at The Country Club _ put a
torch to the peace that supposedly had been achieved the day
before. Twenty-four hours later, Crenshaw expressed his regrets for
naming names. But he wouldn't retreat from his purist's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get emotional talking about golf,'' he said. ``To me, it's
an honor to play for your country. It's a duty. Maybe I
overreacted. I'm from a different generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Crenshaw's heart belongs as much to the past as the
present. That's why he is humbled by his selection to lead the
Americans in the biennial competition that began in 1927, one he
has played in four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great, great honor for a pro golfer to be chosen for
this role,'' he said. ``It's just wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also perfect symmetry that Crenshaw, 47, has been anointed
to cap his career at the very club where his appreciation for the
game's tradition was cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the 16-year-old Crenshaw had qualified for the US
Junior Championship at The Country Club. To prepare him for his
first venture outside Texas, Charlie Crenshaw, an Austin attorney
and scratch golfer, gave his son a book entitled ``The World of
Golf'' by Charlie Price. It opened up a whole new world for Ben. He
read with particular fascination the account of amateur Francis
Ouimet's fabled triumph over British aces Harry Vardon and Ted Ray
in the 1913 US Open at The Country Club and thought, ``Wow. I'm
going there.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got there, it was beyond what he imagined. Though he
lost in the quarterfinals, the exposure he received was priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history, the competition, the architecture all hit me in
one week,'' he said. ``The place was enthralling. It was very
important in my incubation.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was much more than an admirer of the game. Eventually, he
earned a place in its history. Tutored by the legendary Harvey
Penick, he became a three-time NCAA champion at the University of
Texas. And after turning pro _ an announcement he made at the 1973
Pleasant Valley tournament, to which he had received a sponsor's
exemption from Cuz Mingolla _ Crenshaw won his PGA Tour debut,
appropriately at the Texas-San Antonio Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had early success, which helped tremendously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That success peaked with two Masters triumphs _ in 1984 and
1995, the latter made indelibly poignant when Crenshaw, who had
served as a pallbearer at Penick's funeral less than a week before,
bent over in tears of grief and tribute for his beloved mentor
after sinking the clinching putt. He wound up winning 22 times
around the world, and along the way, he acquired the nickname
Gentle Ben, reflecting his stature as the game's quintessential
gentleman, albeit one with a ferocious competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career has been very up-and-down,'' he said. ``The more
complex I tried to get with my game, the worse I got. I would go
back to Harvey and he would say, `Trust in your ability.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't win as often as he'd have liked or his potential
indicated. But Crenshaw found a consolation prize that's good for a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been so lucky,'' he said. ``I've been able to satisfy my
affinity for history on both sides of the Atlantic. The people, the
places, the equipment, the implements, the courses _ no game has
been written about like golf. I spend hours in my library.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is still open on what impact Crenshaw's August outburst
will have on a US team that is considered vastly superior to the
Europeans but has lost the last two Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw insists the matter is behind them. Among the alleged
culprits, the reaction seems mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Woods harbors no animosity. ``I think Ben will do a wonderful
job,'' he said. ``Ben has already done a pretty good job of things
so far. And he's been under a lot of scrutiny and a lot of
pressure. He's handled it well _ except for that one little time at
the PGA. But other than that, he's done a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any lingering rift, Woods said, ``We've all talked about
it. It's out of here, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Mickelson and Duval politely declined to
elaborate on the record, perhaps an indication that they admire the
man and resent the scolding. And O'Meara, who seemed the most
offended among the four, took the time to call Crenshaw on his cell
phone as he was leaving the PGA and offer a bit of intelligence
that helped the captain settle on Steve Pate as one of his two
discretionary choices. The tip: O'Meara remembered that Pate had
finished third in the 1988 US Open. At The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since the Americans assembled Monday in Brookline, the
money issue has been verboten _ ``It dissipated quickly,'' said
Crenshaw _ the players have expressed a unanimity of purpose and
blissful harmony, and the support for their captain has been
unconditional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll do a great job as captain,'' said US Open
champion Payne Stewart, who makes his ardor for tradition public
with the knickers he wears in competition. ``Some think he might be
too soft, but I don't see it that way at all. If guys aren't
playing well, he won't be afraid to sit them right down. Not
everyone is going to play every match, and he knows he's not there
to make friends; he's there to win back the Ryder Cup. I don't
think he'll be afraid of confrontations.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, the other captain's pick, sees two sides to Crenshaw
and finds value in both.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has calmness, a cool, laid-back demeanor,'' said Lehman.
``He's not going to tolerate a lot of tomfoolery. If he sees
something, he doesn't like, he'll handle it in a cool, calm
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Like at Medinah?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a temper,'' said Lehman. ``He can blow up. That's
what I like about him. He's got a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk prefers the gentler Ben.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real interested in the team and involved in every
aspect,'' said Furyk. ``I don't think he's a criticizing type of
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Not critical? Furyk must not have been paying attention at
Medinah. On the other hand, if appearances in Brookline are to be
believed, L'Affaire Crenshaw has become ancient history.

GOLF CHANNEL NOT JUST HANGING AROUND

<P>
   While NBC and USA have the lion's share of coverage of the Ryder
Cup, the Golf Channel is hustling its way around The Country Club
to give its estimated 28 million global cable viewers a taste of
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one hours of shows, updates, and analysis is nothing to
discount and symbolizes the growth of one of the country's most
popular niche networks.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder Cup coordinating producer Paul Farnsworth started with the
network five years ago. The Orlando, Fla.-based network was in its
infancy, with about 100,000 households, and Farnsworth remembers
covering events with only three poeple.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are over. The network has 39 people at the Ryder Cup,
and while they are able to air only the opening and closing
ceremonies, they have managed to air several interesting programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 30,000 people crowding around to watch a limited number
of matches, the best place to watch the Ryder Cup is at home on
television,'' Farnsworth said. ``The Golf Channel is still the new
kid on the block, but we have established ourselves as the place to
go before and after the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the 27 hours of coverage by USA and NBC coupled with
the Golf Channel's 21 hours, ``there's no shortage of
information,'' said Farnsworth.
</P>
<P>
   The Golf Channel, for instance, went live Thursday when Ryder
Cup pairings were announced at 2 p.m. At 2:30, it aired the press
conferences of both the European and American team captains and
followed up at 3:30 p.m. with the ``Golf Talk Live'' hosted by
Peter Kessler, who featured Brad Faxon and teaching pro Jim McLean
at the channel's make-shift studio at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth, who has been at The Country Club since Monday, says
he is impressed with the looseness of the European players. ``You
can tell that they are serious when they are out practicing, but in
our interview rooms they have been one laugh after another,'' said
Farnsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans have had their game faces on since day one,
especially after Justin Leonard told the media that he wasn't
answering any questions about the compensation issue. They have had
humorous moments, but for the most part, the Americans have been
very tight. The Europeans know that they are underdogs and who
knows. You hear all the time about football teams that come out to
tight and end up losing.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC anlalyst Roger Matlbie doesn't want to hear any pop
psychology when it comes to the Ryder Cup. Especially when it comes
to the pairings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my way of thinking, Crenshaw has to put the best players on
the course,'' Maltbie said. ``He has been looking at the guys for
the last two years and he knows who is playing the best right now.
Those are the guys that have to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC lead analyst Johnny Miller agreed. In the past, the
Americans have fallen behind early to the Eurpopeans and pairing
selections have been based on friendships and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben has to stay with his guns,'' Miller said. ``You know the
Eurpeans are going to play Montgomerie, Sergio, and their top guys.
Ben has to forget about diplomacy and go with his guns, the big
guns, the Guns of Navarone.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOW DOES RYDER RATE?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How quickly has this event grown? Consider that the PGA of
America will issue roughly 1,200 media credentials for the matches
at The Country Club and USA and NBC will combine to televise 27
hours of competition over the three days. To put that growth in
perspective, the 1983 Ryder Cup at Palm Beach Gardens in Florida
attracted a handful of media members (most of them Brits) and a
local ABC affiliate shooting highlight clips. Live coverage did not
begin until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Notable: USA paid $200,000 in rights fees for the first live
coverage in 1989. That jumped to $2 million when NBC jumped into
the picture in '91. This year, the combined rights fee is $13
million.

HE'S MATCHLESS AT MIND GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Tom Lehman was about to discover what Paul
Azinger had discovered. And what Chip Beck and Payne Stewart and
Larry Nelson had discovered, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is, Seve Ballesteros likes to play with your mind.
</P>
<P>
   After tapping in for par 3 at the 12th, Lehman could see the
shadow descending as Ballesteros came near. A rules official joined
in and the issue was quickly apparent _ Lehman had hit out of turn.
It was the first singles match of the 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill in
Rochester, N.Y., and Lehman (who would win, 4 and 3) was in
control.
</P>
<P>
   He was also in a bit of a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, Lehman realized the error of his ways. In match play,
there is no continuous putting, so the American should have left
his mark down, some 6 inches from the cup. Instead, he had marked,
cleaned his ball, and returned it to its spot to tap in.
</P>
<P>
   That Ballesteros made an issue of it (the Spaniard said the
marker would help with his line on his birdie attempt) was of no
surprise to anyone who has competed against him. His reputation, as
they say, greatly preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know if he meant anything by it,'' said Lehman.
Then he smiled. ``At least, I'll give him the benefit of the
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger, for instance. He and Ballesteros had memorable
confrontations (the different compression ball at Kiawah Island in
1991 stands out) and doesn't hesitate when asked what sort of
tricks the Spaniard had up his sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the coughing?'' said Azinger.
</P>
<P>
   You mean he did things like that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he would do stuff like that.'' And move slightly, by
uncrossing his leg, when you were in your backswing, too. We are
talking about a man who, as captain in 1997, ordered his players to
sandpaper the soles of their dress shoes to eliminate the chance of
a slip during the gala dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Just another example of gamesmanship? Perhaps. Which would be
fine, except some wonder when it crosses over into poor
sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Barnes, a six-time Ryder Cup participant, is afraid the
line gets crossed too often these days. He remembers defeating Hale
Irwin in singles in 1977 and US captain Dow Finsterwald coming over
to shake his hand, except ``Hale stormed off the 18th green,'' said
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was Hale. He's a very competitive person. But no
gamesmanship at all. Never. Ever. As far as he's concerned _ as
most of the top players are _ they believe the only way that anyone
should beat them is with their ability on the golf course that day.
With their golf clubs, not with their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Some examples of gamesmanship are obvious, others far more
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Hagen was famous for giving 2- and 3-foot putts early,
maybe even a 4-footer or two. Then you would knock it to a foot on
the 10th hole and be clueless as to how to make it.
</P>
<P>
   Observers remember watching Davis Love in his match with
Costantino Rocca at the Belfry in 1993. Rocca had just missed a
3-footer that could have won the hole, and after Love tapped in to
halve the hole, the Italian stormed to the 18th tee. Where he
waited. And waited.
</P>
<P>
   Love, as is his right in match play, took several practice putts
on the 17th green. Sort of like letting the field goal kicker think
about things with a timeout. In this case it worked; Rocca hit an
awful drive and lost the hole and the match.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's first taste of Ryder Cup competition, in 1987, found
him in a match with Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal. ``They
would be talking their Spanish,'' said Stewart, who had always
conversed in English with them, ``and it got you to wondering what
they were saying. It was hard, at first, not to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick, said Nelson, was to mentally prepare for what you
were in for with Ballesteros. In 1979, Nelson, a first-time player,
drew a European Ryder Cup rookie, Ballesteros. He had been warned
about the young Spaniard by Lanny Wadkins, who was playing in his
second Ryder Cup and was well versed in the ways of Ballesteros.
</P>
<P>
   In three matches, Nelson-Wadkins beat teams that included
Ballesteros. Then, in singles, Nelson drew the fiery Spaniard and
didn't have an ounce of worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I got to the singles match, I pretty much knew all
there was to know (about Seve).''
</P>
<P>
   But even those who know Ballesteros are always surprised by the
methods of his madness. To this day, no one can explain the shot
Per-Ulrik Johansson made at Valderrama. With his partner, Jesper
Parnevik, in tight with his approach, Johansson went off for a
consultation with Ballesteros. On his return, he hit his approach a
mile off line, where he couldn't play it.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. There is speculation that Ballesteros told the
Swede to purposely hit it out of play, so as to not put a second
ball on the green and give the US a putt that could help with their
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' said Jim Furyk, who was in that match, ``is that
Per-Ulrik is a better player than that.''

JAMES PLAYING DIFFERENT ROLE THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ While the dollar sign was replacing the Stars
and Stripes as the US team logo during the tawdry tussle over Ryder
Cup revenues, traditionalists placed their hand over their heart
and insisted they would be willing to pay to play in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Mark James has proven it.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 European captain has donated his services and then some
to seven Ryder teams. Admittedly, the extra contribution wasn't by
choice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., James
was fined 1,500 pounds by the brass buttons of the European golf
establishment for various breaches of protocol. ``A whole list of
things,'' says James, ``none of which were true.''
</P>
<P>
   The perceived grievances included being late for a team meeting
and photo and failing to wear the European ensemble at social
functions. ``I might not have liked the team uniform,'' says James,
``but I wouldn't have dreamt of not wearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged offenses certainly didn't bother team captain John
Jacobs. ``He was fine,'' says James. ``He knew there was nothing to
it. In fact, he gave me a wild card to the next Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   What it boiled down to, James maintains, was ``a clash of
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the stiff upper lips don't hold a grudge. Twenty years
later, James has been installed as the leader of the 12-man team
that will try to win its third straight Cup against the Americans
at The Country Club in Brookline Sept. 24-26. And it's rather
difficult to imagine anyone having a personal problem with the
45-year-old veteran, whose affable nature and understated British
humor have stamped him as one of the jolly good fellows among his
European peers, including those who will be his charges in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody likes him,'' says Sweden's Jesper Parnevik,
who has good reason to, since he was one of James's two captain's
picks.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, James just as easily could have selected himself.
Still playing full-time, he finished 13th in the Ryder points
standings. As the season progressed and he remained a contender for
a playing berth, he created plenty of intrigue by saying it was
impossible to be a playing captain and he hadn't decided what he'd
do if he finished in the top 10 and automatically qualified for the
team. In fact, he already had made up his mind _ he would have
played. He'd put assistant captain Ken Brown on alert to be ready
to take over just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, James refused to make his intentions public until after
the fact, which could have created tension among the other
candidates. But his popularity remained undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other players thought I should play if I qualified,'' he
said. ``My feeling was that if I made it on points and didn't play,
we wouldn't have our strongest team. Plus, I'm still on Tour
full-time. It's what I do for a living. And the Ryder Cup is the
ultimate arena, really. To qualify and not play for me would be
inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   James first conceived of playing as a youngster learning the
game at Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire and Burghley Park in
Lincolnshire. In high school, he made a deal with his father, the
managing director of a pet food company: If Mark earned his
A-levels, the equivalent of a diploma, at 18, then Jimmy James
would underwrite his tour of the amateur circuit that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great deal because I didn't have to work a real
job,'' says James. ``It beat working for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   He did well enough that he never suffered that grim fate, save
for spending that winter in a warehouse loading supermarket
supplies. Then Jimmy James advanced his son 1,000 quid and said,
``Go play in South Africa for five weeks, see how you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark made a small profit from his endeavors there and in
Zimbabwe, so no more paternal funding was necessary. ``Of course,''
he says, ``I don't know if there would have been any more,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he set out on the European Tour, and suddenly, Mark James
disappeared. It wasn't that he was a failure; in fact, he won 17
tournaments and became an international fixture. But in his early
20s, his given name gave way to the handle ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm called that all the time now,'' says James, ``by
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem an odd moniker in a country that knows Dodge as a
car, not a Wild West boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get American movies over here, too,'' explains Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. At any rate, the Europeans started calling him captain
13 months ago after a selection process that had begun the previous
December when both James and countryman Sam Torrance were
nominated. By the 1998 British Open, James figured he should get
the job, but not necessarily because he was the better man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Sam I was going to put my name forward because I was
playing like a haddock and he still had a chance to make the
team,'' says James. ``Sam was all for it because he didn't want any
distractions in trying to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   As it wound up, it was James who almost made the team, even
while he was fulfilling his duties as captain. Had he eventually
abdicated, he wouldn't have sought another term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great honor, something I'm thrilled to have a go at _
once,'' says James. ``It hasn't affected my game yet, but it could.
It's tough for a full-time golfer. I have a lot of media
responsibilities and I find myself writing letters a lot more often
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows he'll get plenty of letters if Europe doesn't keep the
Cup, but he isn't daunted either by the challenge or the
inexperienced squad he'll guide into it. Seven players on the Green
Team are Ryder rookies, and one was of James's choosing _ Scot
Andrew Coltart, whom he named a captain's pick over trusty old
hands Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam, and Bernhard Langer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risky to go with experience, because maybe the guys
aren't playing that well,'' says James. ``I'm not saying that's the
case here, but you want players who are at their best. You can get
hurt taking experience for the sake of taking experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that firmness, James is the antithesis of his
predecessor, fire-and-brimstone 1997 captain Seve Ballesteros. But
the players don't expect, or want, a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be Seve,'' says Ballesteros's fellow
Spaniard, Jose Maria Olazabal. ``But he has his own personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be more forceful than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's strong-willed,'' says compatriot Lee Westwood. ``He
speaks his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best logic is the most simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a captain, he's probably the best for the team,'' says
19-year-old Spaniard Sergio Garcia, the youngest Ryder Cupper ever.
``You've got to be the best to win the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, maybe James can get a refund for 1979.

 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Europe and the United States have finally
begun their Ryder Cup matches to determine which side of the
Atlantic is home to the world's best golfers. In three days of
practice, some of the best and worst moments of the tournament have
already been recorded. Now, in the interest of those who are just
paying attention, and those who might be visiting The Country Club,
we look at some of the bests and worsts _ many of which might have
been overlooked, and some that are yet to develop. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best shot of redemption _ On his first loop here, France's Jean
Van de Velde birdied the 18th hole, popping his third shot in from
the bunker. Too bad he didn't have that touch on the 18th at the
British Open, where a triple bogey proved fatal. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best Bill Parcells lookalike _ Colin Montgomerie. Tuna and the
full Monty could pass as twins. Unfortunate for them both. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best footwear _ Rain earlier this week made for some slippery
slopes along the ropes. Wear something with extra grip, preferably
golf shoes. Smooth-soled loafers will have you hanging 10 in a lot
of spots. Sandals with socks could win you a role in Dumb and
Dumber Part 3. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Worst Kodak moment _ Ready to smack his drive on the 15th
Wednesday, Spanish wunderkind Sergio Garcia abruptly abandoned in
mid-swing when a flurry of clicking cameras fractured his
concentration. ``C'mon, give the kid a break!'' bellowed one
spectator near the tee box. Garcia quickly composed himself,
stepped back in and hammered. ``Way to rip it, Sergio,'' said the
same spectator. Everyone wants that picture of a young Sergio for
their album, but inconsiderate shutterbugs have to work on their
timing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Worst place for a shopaholic _ The Ryder Cup Golf Shop, 20,000
square feet of wallet-busting souvenirs, mementoes, and
commemorative wear. Susan Hickman, the shop's director of
merchandising, categorized business thus far as brisk. ``It's
trending to be a great event for us,'' she said. Read: Sharks in
feeding frenzy. Rumor had it that the shop did $2 million in sales
Wednesday, but Hickman would not divulge any numbers. When it's all
over, she said, men's sweaters and shirts will lead the sales list,
but women's wear has been strong. A $120 hand-knit sweater for
women, said Hickman, has been almost impossible to keep on the
shelves. The line just to enter the Golf Shop Thursday ran upwards
of 200 at times. Small green shopping baskets were handed out at
the door. No fewer than 40 cash registers, each with one volunteer
ringing and another bagging, kept the cash flow at flood level:
Shirt, $63; T-shirt, $17; Ryder Cup cap, $26; Ryder Cup/TCC coffee
mug, $14. It's the kind of turf you find at Tiffany's. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best service by scalpers _ Spectators arriving by MBTA shuttle
buses at TCC Thursday were greeted curbside by scalpers, who
immediately broke into their entrepreneurial chants of, ``Need any?
Got any? Selling extras?'' Sales were slow for the practice rounds.
No doubt, prices will begin to soar, beginning Friday. Parking
violations used to be a scofflaw here in the Commonwealth. Couldn't
we find a Denver Boot for these guys? &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best etiquette _ Work on your whisper before leaving the house.
Once you arrive on site, everything you say will be worth
repeating, because no one will be able to hear what you said the
first time. And if someone steps on your toes in the gallery,
remember, hold your tongue with one hand and hop like a bunny until
the pain stops. Could start a new dance craze. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best viewing edge _ Pack a small pair of binoculars and have an
excuse ready as to why you can't loan them (a vague reference to e
coli conjunctivitis should do). Crowds are thickest near the tees
and greens. Parked mid-fairway, with binox at the ready, you'll
have some extra elbow room and be able to zoom in when necessary.
By the time you show up at work on Monday, the raccoon rings around
your eyes should be just about gone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Worst snack bar pricing _ Both the imported draft beer and the
domestic stuff sell for $4.75. But non-alcoholic beer costs the
same. The economics of it all just makes it harder to abstain from
the demon ale. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best Jaromir Jagr lookalike _ Padraig Harrington. Hey, no one in
Dublin probably knows Jagr, but that goes for Padraig in Prague,
too. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best imitation of a Secret Serviceman _ Tiger Woods, wearing what
looked like government-issue dark sunglasses during Thursday's
opening-ceremony introductions. He only lacked the wire, earpiece
and miniature microphone in his lapel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Worst show of patriotism _ Young girls with US flags painted on
their fingernails. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best show of patriotism _ When the F-14s strafed the place in
Thursday's opening ceremonies. They ran a little higher and slower
than their last appearance at Fenway for the All-Star Game, but
they still provided that roar that carries the reminder that the
USA has the bestest, baddest war toys on the planet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Worst placement of a Post Office _ There's a USPS tent just to
the right of the first fairway. It's great if you want to send home
a Ryder Cup postcard (``Hi, Mom, send more money.'') But what
happens when one of those disgruntled postal workers of the month
runs amok? &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best placement of a First-Aid trailer _ Fittingly, right next to
the USPS tent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Best place to experience a piece of the good life _ The bleachers
behind the green on No. 9 back up to the monolithic manse being
built by Reebok boss Paul Fireman. Those who fill the stands come
to watch the golf and gawk at the sneaker sultan's garish digs.
It's a comfortable, shady place to see the action unfold. And with
all that opulence at your back, you can forget for a moment that
you're an hourly wage earner. &QL;

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ While the dollar sign was replacing the Stars
and Stripes as the US team logo during the tawdry tussle over Ryder
Cup revenues, traditionalists placed their hand over their heart
and insisted they would be willing to pay to play in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Mark James has proven it.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 European captain has donated his services and then some
to seven Ryder teams. Admittedly, the extra contribution wasn't by
choice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., James
was fined 1,500 pounds by the brass buttons of the European golf
establishment for various breaches of protocol. ``A whole list of
things,'' says James, ``none of which were true.''
</P>
<P>
   The perceived grievances included being late for a team meeting
and photo and failing to wear the European ensemble at social
functions. ``I might not have liked the team uniform,'' says James,
``but I wouldn't have dreamt of not wearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged offenses certainly didn't bother team captain John
Jacobs. ``He was fine,'' says James. ``He knew there was nothing to
it. In fact, he gave me a wild card to the next Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   What it boiled down to, James maintains, was ``a clash of
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the stiff upper lips don't hold a grudge. Twenty years
later, James has been installed as the leader of the 12-man team
that will try to win its third straight Cup against the Americans
at The Country Club in Brookline Sept. 24-26. And it's rather
difficult to imagine anyone having a personal problem with the
45-year-old veteran, whose affable nature and understated British
humor have stamped him as one of the jolly good fellows among his
European peers, including those who will be his charges in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody likes him,'' says Sweden's Jesper Parnevik,
who has good reason to, since he was one of James's two captain's
picks.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, James just as easily could have selected himself.
Still playing full-time, he finished 13th in the Ryder points
standings. As the season progressed and he remained a contender for
a playing berth, he created plenty of intrigue by saying it was
impossible to be a playing captain and he hadn't decided what he'd
do if he finished in the top 10 and automatically qualified for the
team. In fact, he already had made up his mind _ he would have
played. He'd put assistant captain Ken Brown on alert to be ready
to take over just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, James refused to make his intentions public until after
the fact, which could have created tension among the other
candidates. But his popularity remained undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other players thought I should play if I qualified,'' he
said. ``My feeling was that if I made it on points and didn't play,
we wouldn't have our strongest team. Plus, I'm still on Tour
full-time. It's what I do for a living. And the Ryder Cup is the
ultimate arena, really. To qualify and not play for me would be
inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   James first conceived of playing as a youngster learning the
game at Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire and Burghley Park in
Lincolnshire. In high school, he made a deal with his father, the
managing director of a pet food company: If Mark earned his
A-levels, the equivalent of a diploma, at 18, then Jimmy James
would underwrite his tour of the amateur circuit that summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great deal because I didn't have to work a real
job,'' says James. ``It beat working for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   He did well enough that he never suffered that grim fate, save
for spending that winter in a warehouse loading supermarket
supplies. Then Jimmy James advanced his son 1,000 quid and said,
``Go play in South Africa for five weeks, see how you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark made a small profit from his endeavors there and in
Zimbabwe, so no more paternal funding was necessary. ``Of course,''
he says, ``I don't know if there would have been any more,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he set out on the European Tour, and suddenly, Mark James
disappeared. It wasn't that he was a failure; in fact, he won 17
tournaments and became an international fixture. But in his early
20s, his given name gave way to the handle ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm called that all the time now,'' says James, ``by
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem an odd moniker in a country that knows Dodge as a
car, not a Wild West boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get American movies over here, too,'' explains Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. At any rate, the Europeans started calling him captain
13 months ago after a selection process that had begun the previous
December when both James and countryman Sam Torrance were
nominated. By the 1998 British Open, James figured he should get
the job, but not necessarily because he was the better man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Sam I was going to put my name forward because I was
playing like a haddock and he still had a chance to make the
team,'' says James. ``Sam was all for it because he didn't want any
distractions in trying to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   As it wound up, it was James who almost made the team, even
while he was fulfilling his duties as captain. Had he eventually
abdicated, he wouldn't have sought another term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great honor, something I'm thrilled to have a go at _
once,'' says James. ``It hasn't affected my game yet, but it could.
It's tough for a full-time golfer. I have a lot of media
responsibilities and I find myself writing letters a lot more often
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows he'll get plenty of letters if Europe doesn't keep the
Cup, but he isn't daunted either by the challenge or the
inexperienced squad he'll guide into it. Seven players on the Green
Team are Ryder rookies, and one was of James's choosing _ Scot
Andrew Coltart, whom he named a captain's pick over trusty old
hands Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam, and Bernhard Langer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risky to go with experience, because maybe the guys
aren't playing that well,'' says James. ``I'm not saying that's the
case here, but you want players who are at their best. You can get
hurt taking experience for the sake of taking experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that firmness, James is the antithesis of his
predecessor, fire-and-brimstone 1997 captain Seve Ballesteros. But
the players don't expect, or want, a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be Seve,'' says Ballesteros's fellow
Spaniard, Jose Maria Olazabal. ``But he has his own personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be more forceful than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's strong-willed,'' says compatriot Lee Westwood. ``He
speaks his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best logic is the most simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a captain, he's probably the best for the team,'' says
19-year-old Spaniard Sergio Garcia, the youngest Ryder Cupper ever.
``You've got to be the best to win the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, maybe James can get a refund for 1979.

 &HT;    Whatever the load _ have trailer, will haul
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I bought a 10-foot flatbed trailer the
other day. I feel like a true East Texan.
</P>
<P>
   This is a purchase I have studied for over a year, since
discovering that I was spending an inordinate amount of time
hauling things: Moving my daughters' possessions to college (which
largely consist of furniture they've filched from me); taking the
golf cart to be repaired; buying a load of oak or black-walnut
lumber for the woodshop; or heading to the landfill with the
detritus of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   I don't own a truck. I have an SUV, which is like a truck except
it has a very expensive, nonremovable camper on it, but it has
limited capacity for hauling stuff. I have hauled 250 cedar pickets
inside this vehicle, then spent an hour cleaning the sawdust out of
it. The upside was a pleasant cedar smell; the downside is that
passengers get splinters in their behinds.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want a truck, particularly. You can't haul enough
rugrats around in a truck, and a goodly portion of my life is spent
hauling rugrats here and there. My plan is to buy the stepson, on
the cusp of turning 16, a small truck that I will borrow at will,
being as how I'm financing this venture. In the interim, however,
it was time to buy a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   A good friend has a fine 5-by-10-foot trailer that he built
himself. For the past year, it has been parked in my yard as often
as it has his. He doesn't complain, and even tried to talk me out
of buying my own, but guilt finally set in when I held his trailer
ransom for three weeks because it was loaded with black walnut. So
I sold enough of the lumber to buy my own trailer and finally
relinquished his. I'm sure he's grateful, though too much of a
gentleman to say so.
</P>
<P>
   So I studied the proposition for some time, pricing trailers
from here to Houston, checking out used trailers and generally
making a nuisance of myself before finally buying one here in town.
It's metallic blue and actually has lights and a legal license
plate, a relative rarity in our neck of the woods. And the lights
work, too. I'm concerned this trailer may be a bit too uptown, but
there you go.
</P>
<P>
   Now I can go to the dump on Saturday morning and get rid of the
recyclables without stinking up my SUV with the smell of soft-drink
syrup. I know, you're supposed to call it a landfill, just like
you're supposed to call dogcatchers ``animal control officers.''
Whatever. It's still the dump. As a former dogcatcher for the city
of Nacogdoches, I am proud of the title. It's a tough job.
</P>
<P>
   I have found myself engaged in ``trailer talk'' since I began
considering my purchase, weighing the relative merits of the
different trailers on the market. A good friend bought a trailer
from the same fellow from which I bought mine. We spent most of a
Rotary Club luncheon discussing the trick to letting down the gate
without getting a hernia, and whether it was worth putting
steel-mesh along the siding to keep stuff from sliding out. Good
Lord, I thought at one point. We have become our fathers, spending
time talking about topics that would put most right-thinking people
into a coma. I enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   My wife used the trailer the other day to haul the Prop From
Hell, a clogging platform I built at her request for the kids'
beauty pageant. It weighs about 150 pounds, requires a dolly I also
had to build to move it, and is festively decorated in
red-white-and blue stars and boots. Well-built, heavy as
all-get-out. Use the trailer, I advised, and you won't have to
corral stray males to haul the thing inside. She used it, still
found a stray man to help, and the kid won Miss Angelina County in
her age group. I figure the credit goes to the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   A fringe benefit to owning this trailer is being able to pull
through the high-school parking lot while dropping off the
teen-agers, reveling in their embarrassment at being taken to
school in a vehicle hauling a trailer with a load of ... whatever
on it.
</P>
<P>
   Another fringe benefit: After years of practice, I can actually
back up a trailer. There is definitely a trick to it. A previous
wife used to gently scoff at my ineptitude in backing a trailer,
which she could do with ease. She tried to teach me without
success. The only way I can succeed now is by turning around,
ignoring the mirrors, and following the trailer's movement. It's
counter-intuitive, backing up a trailer, since you have to turn in
the opposite direction your brain wants you to turn. One of my
finest moments was when I actually backed the trailer into our
two-car garage with a car parked alongside on the first shot. It's
one of the few times I wished I had a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about organizing trailer drag races down the main
thoroughfare. My trailer-owning buddy is interested. He has an SUV
also. Maybe we can make it a Rotary Club fund-raising event.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I've

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Mary Brennan Payne doesn't
understand what all the fuss is about, frankly. The 92-year-old
Centerville woman is believed to be the last survivor among the six
co-eds who infiltrated the University of Dayton in the fall of
1926, the first women to attend any UD program. They took courses
at night and on weekends, paving the way for the women who were
first allowed to enroll in full-time day classes in 1935. Now, as
UD kicks off its year-long sesquicentennial celebration with a
public celebration Saturday afternoon, Payne is getting full-scale
celebrity treatment. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED FOR

   WALKER-COLUMN _ LONGVIEW, Texas _ Horrors! My name was on the
men's bathroom wall. And it was my husband who put it there. The
story of what brought me to this seemingly low point in my life is
not a long one but it's involved. It began as fund-raiser for our
son's school. Please, don't jump to any conclusions yet. Here's
what happened. (Ana Pecina Walker is managing editor of the

<P>
   EMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ As the sun sets on this
century, it has become painfully clear that we are addicted to
speed. Faster mail, faster computers and phones that are never more
than a few inches away have become the way of life in this final
decade of the 20th century. Have you become a galley slave to
technology? Here are some signs that maybe you've had too much of

   GEEWAX-Y2K-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Americans won't know for

bug. (Geewax, Cox News Service). FOR SUNDAY

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The Reform Party started out as a cracked egg
laid by the cackling Ross Perot. This time around, it shows signs
of frying itself. What remains of the Reform Party is betraying
even the residual hopes of its best-intentioned folks by going
completely nuts in public. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ I was a taxpayer, although not much of one, when
my government superiors strongly urged me to start smoking. ``Smoke
'em if you got 'em,'' the drill sergeants would tell us back in the
1950s at Fort Dix, N.J. Standing around without a glowing butt in
hand during that hard winter could lead to orders to do something
useful, like scrubbing pots. However, we had to wait for nearly a
decade until government, in the person of the U.S. surgeon general,
told us that smoking could kill you. (Andy Glass is a columnist for

 &HT;    Too much of the '90s
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ As the sun sets on this century, it has become
painfully clear that we are addicted to speed. Faster mail, faster
computers and phones that are never more than a few inches away
have become the way of life in this final decade of the 20th
century. Have you become a galley slave to technology? Here are
some signs that maybe you've had too much of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   And how did I get them? Through e-mail, of course.
</P>
<P>
   You try to enter your password on the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't played solitaire with real cards in years.
</P>
<P>
   You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of
three.
</P>
<P>
   You e-mail your work colleague at the desk next to you to ask
``Do you want to grab something to eat?'' and they reply ``Yeah,
give me five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   You chat several times a day with a stranger from South Africa,
but you haven't spoken to your next door neighbor yet this year.
</P>
<P>
   You buy a computer and a week later it is out of date.
</P>
<P>
   Your reason for not staying in touch with friends is that they
do not have e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   You consider mailing a letter painfully slow.
</P>
<P>
   Your idea of being organized is multicolored sticky notes.
</P>
<P>
   You hear most of your jokes via e-mail instead of in person.

 &HT;    Woman's role in opening door for co-ed education at UD worth the
fuss
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mary Brennan Payne doesn't understand what all
the fuss is about, frankly.
</P>
<P>
   The 92-year-old Centerville woman is believed to be the last
survivor among the six co-eds who infiltrated the University of
Dayton in the fall of 1926, the first women to attend any UD
program. They took courses at night and on weekends, paving the way
for the women who were first allowed to enroll in full-time day
classes in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as UD kicks off its year-long sesquicentennial celebration
with a public celebration Saturday afternoon, Payne is getting
full-scale celebrity treatment. And she doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks we ought to be making a fuss over her daughter, Sally
Martino of Washington Twp., a 1995 winner of the Alliance for
Education Excellence in Teaching award. Or her granddaughter, Liz
Payne Palermo, a vice president for Citibank in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``What my children and grandchildren are doing is so much more
interesting,'' she says matter-of-factly, her blue eyes bright,
bemused, without a trace of false modesty.
</P>
<P>
   I play devil's advocate: ``Don't you think women like you helped
pave the way for those of us who came after?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe you're right,'' she concedes.
</P>
<P>
   When Mary Brennan entered UD, friends told her, ``You're nuts.
You know you're going to get married. You're wasting your time.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old defied convention and enrolled, armed only with
her hunger for knowledge and the support of her parents, William
and Nora Brennan. She decided to study law, her interest piqued by
a job with a Dayton law firm.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman had never heard of terms such as sexual
harassment or gender discrimination. ``I've read about it since
then, but I never experienced it,'' she says. She pauses and adds
drolly, ``I don't know if that's a compliment or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the young woman found a warm welcome from faculty:
``The priests and the brothers were so nice; they all came up to
welcome us.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne took her studies seriously _ she still has two fat
typewritten volumes of meticulously typewritten law school notes _
but found time for fun. Early in her college years she met her
future husband, Robert Payne, seven years her senior. She started
running with an older crowd, even frequenting speakeasies. Though
she didn't drink anything stronger than lemonade, she loved the
adventure, the mystery of it, the drive into the country and the
secret door through which patrons were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Payne practiced law briefly after graduating in 1930 and married
Bob Payne that September. ``My mother didn't think I should get
married,'' she says. ``She would have liked to have been doing what
I had been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   While college had not been an option for Payne's mother, not
going to college was never considered an option for her own three
daughters and two sons. ``We all knew, yes, we were going to
college, and yes, we were going to UD,'' says Martino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew if grandma was an attorney in the 1930s,
anything was possible for us,'' says Martino's daughter, Vicky Ryan
of Washington Twp., also a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In one generation, so much had changed. No one told Martino she
was nuts to attend college. No one told her not to waste her time.
</P>
<P>
   College-educated women everywhere owe the difference to the
pioneering spirit of women like Mary Brennan Payne.
</P>
<P>
   And, whether she likes it or not, that's worth making a fuss
over.

 &HT;    Town kids vs. farm boys
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I've been reading a magnificent book by
James Tobin about Ernie Pyle, the famous World War II
correspondent. I didn't realize we had so much in common.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle grew up on a farm in Indiana, outside the little town of
Dana. I grew up on a farm a few miles south of Fayetteville. We
both suffered feelings of inferiority when we were thrown in with
town children at school.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised to read what Mr. Pyle had to say years later,
when his columns from North Africa, Sicily, Italy and Normandy
surpassed the reporting of Hemingway, Steinbeck and the best that
The New York Times, The Associated Press and all the others could
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a farm boy,'' he said, ``and town kids can make you feel
awfully backward when you're young. Even 30 years later I feel
self-conscious when I walk down the street in Dana, imagining the
town boys are making fun of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fayetteville isn't exactly Buckhead or Peachtree City, and I'm
half a century past school days, but I still don't feel entirely
comfortable when I go to town.
</P>
<P>
   Anytime I made the Saturday shopping trip with my dad to Mr.
John M. Jackson's store, I was afraid I'd have to go to the
bathroom, with no idea how to find one. I spent painful hours
waiting for my father to finish his business and head for home, and
relief.
</P>
<P>
   The change from grammar school in Woolsey to the county high
school in Fayetteville was traumatic. After the traditional
outhouse that served our needs at the Woolsey school, I had to
train myself not to jump back when I flushed a urinal and water
came cascading out of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch was a social line drawn between town and country. Some
town kids walked home to lunch. Others brought sandwiches made with
loaf bread bought at a grocery store. Country kids ate side meat,
sausage, biscuits and baked sweet potatoes from brown paper sacks.
An egg sandwich was the best we could do on rare occasions when we
had sliced store-bought bread. The town kids called egg sandwiches
``country sandwiches'' and made fun of ours.
</P>
<P>
   Farm boys were self-conscious about the way they smelled. They
had to do the milking before school, and cows have a certain smell.
So does fresh milk warm from the source. The cow-milk smell doesn't
wash off easily when there's no running water for a tub bath or a
shower. So farm boys sat through algebra and civics and English,
hoping classmates wouldn't detect the scent of warm milk spiced
with a whiff of cow manure.
</P>
<P>
   I feel a lot better knowing a famous journalist like Ernie Pyle
suffered the same feelings of not quite belonging that I did then
and do now whenever I go to town. Perhaps some of my apprehensions
date back to my grandfather. He wouldn't let his daughters go to
Fayetteville on Saturday because there were ``too many bootleggers
and roughnecks from the western part of the county on the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather would be shocked to know the ``western part of
the county,'' then regarded as a wild frontier populated by rough
and tumble folks partial to whiskey and fighting, has turned into
Peachtree City and is populated by sophisticated immigrants who
look down on Fayetteville and environs.
</P>
<P>
   I don't regret my rural upbringing, but it might have been fun
growing up in a small town. Country kids envied the crowd that hung
around the drug store. In our secret hearts, we wanted to be
worldly like Jack Dettmering and Lawrence Nelms, who never seemed
to have cows to milk or stove wood to cut in the afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Although it didn't become famous until after my time, we
certainly had nothing out in the country to rival Willie Eason's
cafe, featuring two-on-a-plate hotdogs and a pool table in the
back. It was the in-place for a generation of town boys.
</P>
<P>
   Willie ran it like a high school principal. The only incident
that ever happened occurred early one morning just as he was
opening for the day. I noticed the commotion while driving our boys
to school. After dropping them off, I circled back to see what it
was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hippie pulled a gun and tried to rob Willie,'' explained
Sheriff James Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what happened?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie had to fire a warning shot, and the hippie got hit,''
James replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did he get hit?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right between his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Fayetteville, USA. Probably pretty much like Dana,
Ind., when Ernie Pyle was growing up, and as much like Andy
Griffith's Mayberry as you can get short of building a Hollywood
set.
</P>
<P>
   It's gone with the wind. Lawrence Nelms migrated over to Newnan,
and you hardly ever see Jack Dettmering at the drug store. Instead
of Eason's Cafe, Fayetteville has McDonald's and Wendy's and Burger
King and a fancy pool hall, but I don't think grown men will be
telling stories about them 40 years from now.

 &HT;    For a real good cause, call Ana
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Horrors!
</P>
<P>
   My name was on the men's bathroom wall. And it was my husband
who put it there.
</P>
<P>
   The story of what brought me to this seemingly low point in my
life is not a long one but it's involved.
</P>
<P>
   It began as fund-raiser for our son's school. Please, don't jump
to any conclusions yet.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, St. Mary's Catholic School hosts Wunderfall, a German
festival that includes a drawing for a car. This year, the car is a
1968 Ford Mustang, red, convertible, a/c, you get the picture. A
real classy deal. With all the baby boomers like me running around,
tickets for the drawing have been selling like hotcakes.
</P>
<P>
   My husband Paul is on this year's Wunderfall committee and his
zeal for the school, plus his public relations and marketing
skills, have resulted in some terrific ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 2: Last weekend in my hometown of Marlin, my family
celebrated our parents' 60th wedding anniversary. It began with a
Mass at St. Joseph's Church. Then we adjourned to the Knights of
Columbus hall for a meal followed by a dance.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Marlin on Saturday to begin decorating and seeing
to other preparations for the Sunday gathering. I noticed Paul
placing posters for Wunderfall in strategic places around the
kitchen and in an anteroom at the KC Hall. The posters advertised
the event and the car. In the corner, Paul had written ``See Ana
Pecina Walker for raffle tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew my very large Catholic family would be supportive,
clever man that he is. I just asked him not to place any posters
around the main dining room. He agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's proceedings were wonderful. More than 200 people
attended and things went very smoothly. In the midst of the
excitement and seeing family I don't get to see very often, I
forgot about the posters.
</P>
<P>
   That is until my cousin Louis said he wanted to buy two raffle
tickets. I said sure and went to retrieve the tickets. Then my
cousin Andrew said he wanted some too. Then my cousin Christine's
friend Darryl. Usually, it's the women who want to buy such things
and I wondered briefly what was motivating so many of the men.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl clued me in. Turns out he's a very enthusiastic fan of
Ford products and the poster of the Mustang caught his eye, he
said, when he was standing in the men's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I said.
</P>
<P>
   My brain did a rewind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing in the men's bathroom, standing in the men's,
standing in the ...
</P>
<P>
   Standing!!!!!
</P>
<P>
   Click.
</P>
<P>
   My marketing specialist husband informs me that many restaurants
place the sports pages and other advertisements in front of the
standing spot in men's bathrooms because, well, because they will
be read.
</P>
<P>
   But why couldn't he have put his name on the poster in the
bathroom of the KC Hall and not mine?
</P>
<P>
   Because, more of my family knows me. He's so logical.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I got over the shock and was grateful for the chance to
sell more tickets. After all, it's for a good cause. But Sunday
night as we were cleaning up, I asked Paul if he had removed the
poster from the men's room and he said he thought he would just
leave it there.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I put my foot down. He good-naturedly retrieved it
and I watched him put it in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard the snickers and jokes about the men's room wall
but I never knew the trauma of actually having my name there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I remain grateful for small favors: Paul didn't have
access to the water tower.

   Scientists are still studying the effects this long-known drug
has on the body
</P>
<P>
   By STEPHANIE ALLMON
</P>
<P>
   Tribune-Herald staff writer
</P>
<P>
   When the ``father of medicine'' felt a headache coming on in the
5th century B.C., he reached for the same remedy many people do
today: aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   To take his pain reliever, Hippocrates had to extract it from
willow tree bark, but patients today can choose from dozens of
varieties that contain the same basic pain relieving substances
that Hippocrates himself used.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and researchers have dubbed aspirin a ``miracle
drug,'' used to treat ailments from fevers to arthritis to heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, aspirin has been linked to reducing the risk of
heart attack. More recently, aspirin has been shown to help prevent
strokes, and researchers are studying whether it might help fight
colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors are now cautioning that too much aspirin may
actually be too much of a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Harvard Medical School found that while
regularly taking up to six aspirins a week can lower the risk of
strokes caused by blocked blood vessels, routinely taking more than
15 aspirins a week can actually increase the chances of developing
less common ``bleeding strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemorrhagic strokes, which account for 8 percent of all strokes,
occur when blood floods over the brain after an aneurysm, or
malformation of an artery, bursts like a bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Aspirin inhibits blood's ability to clot, which may be why high
doses of the drug may trigger bleeding, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Shaw, pharmacy manager of K-Mart Supercenter on New
Road, saw firsthand this ``thinning'' effect when a friend died of
a gall bladder attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went in (to the hospital), his blood was so thin, they
couldn't stop the bleeding. He'd taken one aspirin a day,'' Shaw
said. ``(Aspirin) is a great drug, but people don't realize how
potent it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But incidents like this shouldn't scare people out of using
aspirin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the benefit outweighs the risk,'' he said.
It's still the best pain reliever for arthritis because patients
don't build up tolerance to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said taking a lower-dose 81-milligram aspirin will not thin
blood as rapidly as the standard 325-milligram aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   And low doses of aspirin may allow blood to flow more easily
through blood vessels to the brain, preventing the more common
ischemic strokes, caused by blockage of large arteries of the
brain. Ischemic strokes account for 85 percent of all strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though aspirin became the No. 1 drug worldwide 100 years
ago, researchers are still studying the effects it has on the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general feeling of informed doctors is that, boy, we
really wish we had more data, and you really have to individualize
it to patients,'' said Dr. Joe Cunningham, internal medicine
specialist and executive director of Providence Health Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can take aspirin. It's generally not recommended
for children younger than 15 or for people who have bleeding
ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy young adults probably don't need to take it just to
prevent heart attack and stroke, without changing other lifestyle
factors like exercise, Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a general rule, I do not recommend just everybody take
aspirin,'' he said. ``When you see doctors for general checkups,
that's the kind of thing you should talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Aspirin has long contributed to the history of medicine, and not
just for its own uses. Much can be learned about diseases when
studying aspirin's effects on the body, Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think aspirin has had a very, very prominent place in
history,'' he said. ``It has pushed the research because we say,
'Hey, wow, we've got this neat medicine here. I wonder why that
would be effective for that.' You investigate and discover
something about the disease that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But with grocery aisles packed with colorful bottles and labels
promising to relieve aches and pains, Cunningham said, aspirin's
not going to work any miracles on headaches that the brands next to
it won't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most, it doesn't matter whether you take two Tylenol or
two aspirin or two Advil,'' he said. ``It's all gonna cure your
headache.''

a gall bladder attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went in (to the hospital), his blood was so thin, they
couldn't stop the bleeding. He'd taken one aspirin a day,'' Shaw
said. ``(Aspirin) is a great drug, but people don't realize how
potent it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But incidents like this shouldn't scare people out of using
aspirin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the benefit outweighs the risk,'' he said.
It's still the best pain reliever for arthritis because patients
don't build up tolerance to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said taking a lower-dose 81-milligram aspirin will not thin
blood as rapidly as the standard 325-milligram aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   And low doses of aspirin may allow blood to flow more easily
through blood vessels to the brain, preventing the more common
ischemic strokes, caused by blockage of large arteries of the
brain. Ischemic strokes account for 85 percent of all strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though aspirin became the No. 1 drug worldwide 100 years
ago, researchers are still studying the effects it has on the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general feeling of informed doctors is that, boy, we
really wish we had more data, and you really have to individualize
it to patients,'' said Dr. Joe Cunningham, internal medicine
specialist and executive director of Providence Health Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can take aspirin. It's generally not recommended
for children younger than 15 or for people who have bleeding
ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy young adults probably don't need to take it just to
prevent heart attack and stroke, without changing other lifestyle
factors like exercise, Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a general rule, I do not recommend just everybody take
aspirin,'' he said. ``When you see doctors for general checkups,
that's the kind of thing you should talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Aspirin has long contributed to the history of medicine, and not
just for its own uses. Much can be learned about diseases when
studying aspirin's effects on the body, Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think aspirin has had a very, very prominent place in
history,'' he said. ``It has pushed the research because we say,
'Hey, wow, we've got this neat medicine here. I wonder why that
would be effective for that.' You investigate and discover
something about the disease that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But with grocery aisles packed with colorful bottles and labels
promising to relieve aches and pains, Cunningham said, aspirin's
not going to work any miracles on headaches that the brands next to
it won't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most, it doesn't matter whether you take two Tylenol or
two aspirin or two Advil,'' he said. ``It's all gonna cure your
headache.''

   DIABETES _ Ben Newell was only 4 when he went on his first Walk
to Cure Diabetes two years ago. As he and his parents reached their
car afterward, Ben had a question. ``Is my diabetes cured now?'' he
said. ``That's what we told him,'' says his mother, June. ``This is
the walk to cure diabetes.'' As Ben goes door-to-door rasing money
this week for this year's walk on Saturday, the disease shared by
16 million Americans remains incurable but the prospects are
looking more hopeful. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News). 23. WITH PHOTO.

   THE PAST IN PERIL: Buying, Selling, Stealing History
</P>
<P>
   EDS: This is the second installment of The Past in Peril, an
occasional series from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Pulitzer
Prize-winning science writer Mike Toner, who for 25 years has
covered archaeology and other science topics, concieved this
project as a way to look at threats to the world's common cultural
inheritance. This special report on the global market in
antiquities cuts across the lines of science, art, politics,
economics, crime and history.

<P>
   GOLDEN-BOWL _ The Phiale of Achyris may soon be winging its way
home to Italy, the last leg of a decade long odyssey that has
spanned the cultural divide between a smuggling ring in rural
Sicily and the Fifth Avenue apartment of a well-known Wall Street
financier. The fuss over the ancient bowl - 99 per cent pure gold
shaped into concentric circles of acorns and beechnuts and
honeybees - has provided a rare, revealing glimpse of the
international antiquities market in action. (Toner, Atlanta

   GEORGIA-POTS _ Georgia's hot pots just keep popping up. A
quarter of a century after thieves cleaned out the little museum at
Kolomoki Mounds State Park, near Blakely, Georgia, the state's most
famous stolen pots are still showing up in out of the way places.
Each new siting offers a fleeting glimpse of the black market in
American antiquities and new hope that more of the 1,500-year old
pots will someday be found. (Toner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUITIES-ONLINE _ The mood is tense. Bidding on the
gray-green Mayan jade mask is rising in $5,000 increments and
auctioneer C. Hugh Hildesley is quick to move the bidding upwards
with sharp raps of his ivory gavel. So it has been at Sotheby's
since 1744, when London bookseller Samuel Baker founded what would
become one of the world's premier venues for the sale of art,
antiquities and over collectibles -from rare baseball memorabilia
to $78 million Renoirs. Now Sotheby's is launching a venture that
it hopes will revolutionize the auction business --selling in
cyberspace. It is a move that has the art world buzzing and
archaeologists uneasy about the potential impact that the millions
of potential new buyers could have on the global demand for
antiquities. (Toner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   DOCS-WAITING _ The waiting room: Patients rank it as their No. 1
complaint: The long wait to see a doctor. In metro Atlanta, some
specialist book appointments 6 months in advance - and once you get
into the waiting room, it can be several hours of reading
out-of-date magazines and stewing over the arrogance. What's behind
all this? Do doctors overbook'' in the same way airlines do? What
are some of the tricks of the trade - the latest trend is to move
patients from a waiting room to a patient room (where you may wait,
in your undies, another 45 minutes). We talk to patients/docs about
the problem, and suggest ways to address it or file complaints.

   ASPIRIN _ When the ``father of medicine'' felt a headache coming
on in the 5th century B.C., he reached for the same remedy many
people do today: aspirin. For 50 years, aspirin has been linked to
reducing the risk of heart attack. More recently, aspirin has been
shown to help prevent strokes, and researchers are studying whether
it might help fight colon cancer. But doctors are now cautioning
that too much aspirin may actually be too much of a good thing.

 &HT;    Even minirouter must be used correctly
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A fellow cries for help on the Internet, saying he is
trying to use his Dremel tool but is having trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to use one to cut inlay lines for stringing,'' he
says. ``But the bit kept pulling into the wood so that the line
became deeper and deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dremel is the ideal tool for a job like this, but you need
to install it in the router base the company sells, and then
proceed slowly. I suspect this gentleman is using a dull bit, or
taking too deep a cut, or both. He needs to remember this is
essentially a miniature router, and you have to miniaturize your
methods to suit it.
</P>
<P>
   You might take a 1/4-inch bite in one pass with a 3-hp router
holding a quarter-inch bit. With the Dremel, I'd never consider
cutting deeper than about 3/16-inch in one pass with a 1/16 or
1/8-inch bit. If it doesn't cut easily, you're trying to take off
too much in one pass. Don't be in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Another gentleman writes that ``If I want to rip about 1/8 inch
from, say, a
</P>
<P>
   2-by-4 via the table saw, which is better, given that the guard
won't let me get the rip fence that close to the blade:
</P>
<P>
   ``Place the work between the fence and the blade? I seem to
remember reading that this is not recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remove the guard and get the fence up snug?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not entirely clear what he means by ``place the work between
the fence and the blade.'' I would make the cut on the outside of
the 2x4, using a featherboard placed ahead of the cut to keep the
board snug up against the fence, with a push stick to guide the
board through the final half inch or so.
</P>
<P>
   Doing that, the sawyer could presumably use the blade guard.
However, I wouldn't use this technique simply because the blade
guard can be kept in place. I'd use it because the broader the
board, the more stable it will be, and I want the more stable
portion against the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, table saw injuries result from the hand coming down
on top of the blade or being shoved or pulled into it from the
front. Resting the blade on the fence will protect from a downward
fall into the blade, and of course the use of a push stick is
always wise to avoid the blade in the last few inches of the rip.
</P>
<P>
   Always be sure, when ripping, that the featherboard or any other
side-pressure jig is applied, to the workpiece only, before it
reaches the blade. You don't want that pressure against the blade
itself, or against the two pieces after the rip. The latter would
be a very good way to engender a kickback.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm considering using vertical grain fir for interior trim in
my house. Does anyone have suggestions for a clear finish? I'm not
wild about poly. How about shellac?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not wild about polyurethane either, but shellac isn't much
of a finish. It's best used on the interiors of boxes or drawers
where some protection for the wood is wanted, but odor must be kept
to a minimum because of the closed conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Some kind of varnish, preferably a matte polyurethane, is
certainly the best choice for interior house trim.

1926, the first women to attend any UD program. They took courses

   DIABETES _ Ben Newell was only 4 when he went on his first Walk
to Cure Diabetes two years ago. As he and his parents reached their
car afterward, Ben had a question. ``Is my diabetes cured now?'' he
said. ``That's what we told him,'' says his mother, June. ``This is
the walk to cure diabetes.'' As Ben goes door-to-door rasing money
this week for this year's walk on Saturday, the disease shared by
16 million Americans remains incurable but the prospects are
looking more hopeful. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News). 23. WITH PHOTO.

   THE PAST IN PERIL: Buying, Selling, Stealing History
</P>
<P>
   EDS: This is the second installment of The Past in Peril, an
occasional series from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Pulitzer
Prize-winning science writer Mike Toner, who for 25 years has
covered archaeology and other science topics, concieved this
project as a way to look at threats to the world's common cultural
inheritance. This special report on the global market in
antiquities cuts across the lines of science, art, politics,
economics, crime and history.

   GOLDEN-BOWL _ The Phiale of Achyris may soon be winging its way
home to Italy, the last leg of a decade long odyssey that has
spanned the cultural divide between a smuggling ring in rural
Sicily and the Fifth Avenue apartment of a well-known Wall Street
financier. The fuss over the ancient bowl - 99 per cent pure gold
shaped into concentric circles of acorns and beechnuts and
honeybees - has provided a rare, revealing glimpse of the
international antiquities market in action. (Toner, Atlanta

   ANTIQUITIES-ONLINE _ The mood is tense. Bidding on the

auctioneer C. Hugh Hildesley is quick to move the bidding upwards
with sharp raps of his ivory gavel. So it has been at Sotheby's
since 1744, when London bookseller Samuel Baker founded what would
become one of the world's premier venues for the sale of art,
antiquities and over collectibles -from rare baseball memorabilia
to $78 million Renoirs. Now Sotheby's is launching a venture that
it hopes will revolutionize the auction business --selling in
cyberspace. It is a move that has the art world buzzing and
archaeologists uneasy about the potential impact that the millions
of potential new buyers could have on the global demand for
antiquities. (Toner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

out-of-date magazines and stewing over the arrogance. What's behind
all this? Do doctors overbook'' in the same way airlines do? What
are some of the tricks of the trade - the latest trend is to move
patients from a waiting room to a patient room (where you may wait,

shown to help prevent strokes, and researchers are studying whether
it might help fight colon cancer. But doctors are now cautioning
that too much aspirin may actually be too much of a good thing.

 &HT;    Even minirouter must be used correctly
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A fellow cries for help on the Internet, saying he is
trying to use his Dremel tool but is having trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to use one to cut inlay lines for stringing,'' he
says. ``But the bit kept pulling into the wood so that the line
became deeper and deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dremel is the ideal tool for a job like this, but you need
to install it in the router base the company sells, and then
proceed slowly. I suspect this gentleman is using a dull bit, or
taking too deep a cut, or both. He needs to remember this is
essentially a miniature router, and you have to miniaturize your
methods to suit it.
</P>
<P>
   You might take a 1/4-inch bite in one pass with a 3-hp router
holding a quarter-inch bit. With the Dremel, I'd never consider
cutting deeper than about 3/16-inch in one pass with a 1/16 or
1/8-inch bit. If it doesn't cut easily, you're trying to take off
too much in one pass. Don't be in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Another gentleman writes that ``If I want to rip about 1/8 inch
from, say, a
</P>
<P>
   2-by-4 via the table saw, which is better, given that the guard
won't let me get the rip fence that close to the blade:
</P>
<P>
   ``Place the work between the fence and the blade? I seem to
remember reading that this is not recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remove the guard and get the fence up snug?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not entirely clear what he means by ``place the work between
the fence and the blade.'' I would make the cut on the outside of
the 2x4, using a featherboard placed ahead of the cut to keep the
board snug up against the fence, with a push stick to guide the
board through the final half inch or so.
</P>
<P>
   Doing that, the sawyer could presumably use the blade guard.
However, I wouldn't use this technique simply because the blade
guard can be kept in place. I'd use it because the broader the
board, the more stable it will be, and I want the more stable
portion against the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, table saw injuries result from the hand coming down
on top of the blade or being shoved or pulled into it from the
front. Resting the blade on the fence will protect from a downward
fall into the blade, and of course the use of a push stick is
always wise to avoid the blade in the last few inches of the rip.
</P>
<P>
   Always be sure, when ripping, that the featherboard or any other
side-pressure jig is applied, to the workpiece only, before it
reaches the blade. You don't want that pressure against the blade
itself, or against the two pieces after the rip. The latter would
be a very good way to engender a kickback.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm considering using vertical grain fir for interior trim in
my house. Does anyone have suggestions for a clear finish? I'm not
wild about poly. How about shellac?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not wild about polyurethane either, but shellac isn't much
of a finish. It's best used on the interiors of boxes or drawers
where some protection for the wood is wanted, but odor must be kept
to a minimum because of the closed conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Some kind of varnish, preferably a matte polyurethane, is
certainly the best choice for interior house trim.

 COMMENTARY: McCAIN'S FRESH AIR  
(jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking with clean clarity, Sen. John McCain has become the
only Republican presidential candidate to accept and pass a
political and moral challenge that faces them all. He said exactly
where Pat Buchanan belonged in the Republican Party _ out.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican running for the nomination ever supported
Buchanan's racism, and anti-Semitism and the rest of the sickness
of soul he tries to deodorize with sprays of populism. Heavens, no.
</P>
<P>
   But until McCain came along to make things awkward for them,
Republicans had a decade of ducking the critical Buchanan question.
Should he be thrown out even though it might cost other Republicans
some revengeful Buchananite votes in primaries?
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Buchanan blamed the Jews of Israel and America for
``beating the drums'' for the Gulf War. Buchanan would not have
allowed that Jew war. If the United States had obeyed him, today
Iraq's piles and factories of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological
weapons could have been seen by Americans wherever they cowered.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaigns of 1992 and '96, after Buchanan's influence had
been watered several times a week by his salaried appearances on
CNN, fellow Republican presidential candidates did not demand that
he pack up his knapsack of bigotry and march out of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign, Buchanan gives his opponents another chance to
show what they are made of, and they do. His new book does not hide
his belief that it would have been better if Nazi Germany had won
the war.
</P>
<P>
   No vital American interest was threatened by Hitler, he says.
But don't think he does not have his tender spots, old Pat.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that if Britain and France had not gone to the
rescue of Poland, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had not tricked
Americans into getting into the war, the Nazis would have been able
to conquer Europe and the Soviet Union, so there might have been no
blitz or Dunkirk. And the Jews _ well so many would not have been
destroyed in places like Norway, the Netherlands, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's airpower somehow would have allowed it to survive and
keep its empire, you see. Japan would dominate in Asia, and America
would be ``mistress'' of Western Europe, in bliss with Hitler, who
would be ``master of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Buchanan figured the book would disgust enough
Republican leaders so they would push him out. Then in righteous
wrath he would fulfill his ambition of becoming a third-party
leader of America's crackpots and conservatives too stupid to
deserve the name. If so he thought, he overestimated all but one.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle have asked him to
stay Republican. When I asked Gary Bauer, he denounced Buchanan but
thought it would be better for the Republican conservatives if he
stayed in the party. Elizabeth Dole said if Buchanan stayed in the
party, it would then decide if it wanted him as its candidate _
gourmet duck a la politician. I called Alan Keyes, who said there
were no grounds for Buchanan to leave the party and that he was not
going to decide who should go or stay.
</P>
<P>
   Now for a little fresh air. On Wednesday and Thursday, McCain
said Buchanan's own rhetoric, and his views about Hitler and Nazi
Germany, had no place in the Republican Party. Buchanan started
screaming he did not say this, didn't mean the other. Amusing,
almost.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe McCain's clarity and Buchanan's mental ugliness will bring
a smidgen of moral courage to Bush, Dole &AMP; Co. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, when I first saw Auschwitz, as a reporter, I understood
that silence was a sin. Ten years later, on an anniversary of the
creation of the Warsaw ghetto by the Germans, I wrote from Asia
that if a time of the beast ever approached again, from the world
over would rise a prayer: ``Forgive them not, Father, for they know
what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   And now I have to add, in America: And forgive not those who
still preach that America had no stake.
</P>
<P>
   Given his life and nature, McCain probably doesn't think his
attempt to free his party from Buchanan is particularly brave. It
wasn't, except among Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's comments had the perfect pitch of political
goodness and decency. We owe him thanks and an embrace for
reminding us what they are like.

DIRECTOR PUTS ANOTHER WOMAN BEHIND BARS IN `DOUBLE JEOPARDY' 
</HEADLINE>

 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many movies about incarcerated women can one man make?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Bruce Beresford, three: the earnest ``Paradise Road,''
about a makeshift women's choir in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp;
the dullsville ``Last Dance,'' about a convicted murderer (Sharon
Stone) facing death row and Rob Morrow's squint; and now ``Double
Jeopardy,'' a casually absurd thriller about a convicted murderer
(Ashley Judd) whose supposedly dead husband is actually alive and
living with her supposedly best friend. Supposedly.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford also directed ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Black
Robe,'' neither of which featured women under lock and key. (His
best film, the terse ``Breaker Morant,'' locked up a few men.)
</P>
<P>
   This time he's working from a script by David Weisberg and
Douglas S. Cook, who wrote that masterwork of absurdity ``The
Rock,'' so he isn't the only one with a thing for penitentiaries.
</P>
<P>
   To be completely fair, ``Double Jeopardy'' doesn't spend much
time behind bars. Within the first 35 minutes, Our Heroine has:
gone sailing with her husband (Bruce Greenwood), had sex with him,
awakened in a blood-soaked bed, traced his gory footprints to the
side of the boat, been arrested for murder, gone to trial, sobbed
pathetically for the jury (``I didn't kill my husband!''), been
convicted, entrusted her son (Spencer Treat Clark) to her best
friend (Annabeth Gish), discovered that her husband is alive,
toughed out six long years, gone up for parole, hit the street and
clashed with her new parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones). Phew.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, see, is that the U.S. Constitution prevents anyone
from getting convicted twice for the same crime: double jeopardy.
In other words, Our Heroine can track down her slimeball of a
husband and plug him with a .38 special _ without going back to
prison! This sounds pretty iffy to us (isn't a crime particular to
time and place?), but the beauty of ``Double Jeopardy,'' if it can
be said to possess such a thing, is that no one involved in its
creation seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ridiculous movie, but it is good-natured in its
ridiculousness; nothing makes much sense, from chasmal plot gaps to
Tommy Lee Jones' game rehash of every other big-tough-softie
authority figure he's ever played.
</P>
<P>
   And poor Ashley Judd: so smart, so graceful, saddled with such a
hopelessly stupid character. This is the sort of doofus who'll
stumble across a bloody steak knife _ duh, her husband's murder
weapon _ and pick it up with her bare hands just as the Coast Guard
arrives. This is also the sort of woman who, upon learning that her
dead husband breathes still, decides to stew in jail for, oh,
another five years, when all she really has to do is phone her
lawyer. (She has one; he disappears after two scenes.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Judd's scenes with Clark are honestly
touching, Greenwood makes a nice, oily sociopath, and Judd has fun
destroying things once she's on the hunt. Watch her left eyebrow _
whenever she wrecks a car, it's cocked with glee. Plot be damned,
it seems to say.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Double Jeopardy,'' Ashley Judd gets to shoot her way out of
a coffin. And isn't that all that matters?

`AMERICAN BEAUTY' UNMASKS A NOT-SO-PRETTY SUBURBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lester Burnham, as Lester Burnham will readily admit, isn't
alive. He tells us so upfront, in dry, gorgeously sardonic
narration, introducing the story of his death with the piquant
amusement of a man recounting a weird day at the office.
</P>
<P>
   When he says ``This is my life,'' you know it'll be a tale worth
telling.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with ``American Beauty,'' an anti-suburban rant so
full of contradictions that even irony isn't what it seems to be;
it's idealism. In a film that equates hope with cynicism, faith
with nihilism and beauty with death, a voice-over done by a dead
man is the least of its oxymorons.
</P>
<P>
   Written by television scribe Alan Ball, ``American Beauty,''
marks the film debut of theatrical director Sam Mendes
(``Cabaret,'' ``The Blue Room''), who uses his characters the way a
still-life artist uses paint: to show us what we already know, only
more so.
</P>
<P>
   The world of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is both mundane and
hyper-articulated, a suburban environment so stiflingly average
that even death is preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Lester has a wife named Carolyn (Annette Bening) who loathes
him, a daughter named Jane (Thora Birch) who loathes him and a job
as a writer for a media trade magazine for which he has neither
aptitude nor passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and
they're right,'' he says in ghostly narration, as his former self
slumps, half-sentient, through his day. ``I have lost something.''
</P>
<P>
   Joie de vivre, zest for life, whatever Lester lacks it, in
spades. But when Jane introduces him to a pouty friend (Mena
Suvari, who played the virginal chorus singer in ``American Pie''),
Lester is seized by libidinous impulses and thereafter devotes his
paltry life to attracting her. He lifts weights. He jogs with the
gay men down the street. He studies his naked form in the
reflection of a basement window, dismay turning to raw narcissism
as his workouts yield results. Drifts of red rose petals enter his
dreams nocturnal and waking as Lester imagines himself with his
beloved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's more here than some artsy ``Lolita'' lust-scape.
``American Beauty'' isn't about sex; it's about the transformative
power of desire. The mere fact of Lester's yearning frees him from
his half-conscious state. No longer content to be a drone, he quits
his job, takes a new one flipping burgers at a joint called Mr.
Smiley's, buys a sports car (``I rule,'' he says, fist in air) and
starts smoking high-grade pot, which he buys from the
philosophizing Peeping Tom-videographer-next-door (Wes Bentley).
</P>
<P>
   Here's where ``American Beauty'' gets ironic. More than ironic,
actually: It gets deep. One reason the movie has earned so many
glowing early reviews is because it doesn't behave precisely the
way we expect. We know enough, for instance, to expect Kevin Spacey
to pull off a caustic role, but we don't expect him to play a fool
with such sympathy, accuracy or wit. (``Oh, it's OK, I wouldn't
remember me, either,'' he says, as a hot-shot played by Peter
Gallagher stares at him, blank-faced.) Spacey's lined, watchful
face betrays an innocence it's never shown before the vulnerability
of someone who's just rolled out of bed and spotted the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   We know enough to expect Bening to play a shrill suburban wife,
but we don't expect her to be pathetic, or hilarious, or true. We
know enough to expect movies about suburbia to be funny and
depressing and angry and pessimistic and acrid and black but we
don't expect it to contain jewel-like dissertations on the nature
of God and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed?''
asks Ricky, the Peeping Tom, at the start of a relationship with
Jane. The object of beauty: a paper bag, dancing in the wind with a
swirl of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky films dead things, too, looking for epiphany (``when you
see something like that, it's like God is looking at you''). That
he finds it is one of the movie's boldest strokes of cleverness not
quite genius and one of its biggest shocks. ``It's a great thing
when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself,''
intones Lester's voice-over, which takes on a measured Zen
benevolence as the tale unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   But cool as Spacey is, he roils next to Bentley, who delivers a
performance of such spooky control that frost seems to form on his
brow. It's a remarkable bit of work for a young actor, and he has
an unsettlingly mature chemistry with Birch; she bears the broad,
knowing face of a slightly-less-vampish Christina Ricci. With the
adults in their lives behaving like snot-nosed brats, Ricky and
Jane come across as preternatural forces of calm.
</P>
<P>
   If ``American Beauty'' has a single flaw, it's the insistence on
having it both ways: There's something shifty about a film that
boasts a drug-dealing voyeur as its moral center. And Ball's
screenplay gets lazy here and there, relying on a stock bad guy
Ricky's violent, homophobic Marine of a father (Chris Cooper) to
shove the plot around.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``American Beauty'' is so unlike so many movies in so many
ways that, flaws or no, it compels us to watch and be moved.
Confident in its direction, vicious in its humor, brilliant in its
acting and astonishing in its redemptive spirit, Mendes' film shows
the tragedy and the beauty of a humdrum world. And since when has a
satire moved us to tears?

REPORT SHOWS CALIFORNIANS SKIPPING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A state health report says Californians are
eating more fast food and getting less exercise, a potentially
lethal combination that defies images that residents of the Golden
State lead healthier lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity and diabetes are up, the consumption of fruits and
vegetables is down, and the consumption of fast food is going
through the roof, the state Department of Health Services found in
its sampling of more than 5,000 Californians over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are all pointing the same way, and it's the wrong
way,'' said Susan B. Foerster, chief of cancer prevention and
nutrition for the department. ``When we looked at it all together,
we were really kind of concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials point to the proliferation of advertising for high-fat
and fast foods, combined with time pressures that are depriving
families of home-cooked meals.
</P>
<P>
   Californians are not exercising as much as they should, either,
and the rising obesity rate shows it. It all adds up to a poorer
health picture for Californians. After tobacco use, a bad diet and
physical inactivity are the leading causes of preventable death.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Tuesday, found that in California:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer than half the people follow the eating recommendations
needed for preventing cancer and heart disease. One bright spot:
Hispanic adults and women in general under 25 both improved their
diets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer people are eating fruits and vegetables, reversing an
upward trend over the last several years. Blacks and women ate
significantly less.
</P>
<P>
   _ More people are eating fast food meals. In 1997 nearly half of
all adults who ate out on an average day ate at outlets such as
McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, up 30 percent from 1989. In
addition, the average customer is increasingly older, better
educated and wealthier than fast-food consumers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer people are eating the healthy, high-fiber breakfast
cereals that became popular in the mid-1980s, following a
nationwide push by government and cereal maker Kellogg to promote
food high in bran.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rate of obesity has risen 25 percent since 1990 and 50
percent since 1984. Obesity is especially acute among poor,
Hispanic and black women. The rate of diabetes, linked to obesity,
is up 25 percent since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the consumption of fruits and vegetables is most
worrisome to Foerster, who said she was stunned to learn that the
numbers for Californians had gone down while those for the nation
overall had gone up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been seeing an increase up through 1995, and the
federal government had reported an increase nationwide, so we were
expecting better results,'' she said. ``We were distressed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said researchers had interviewed middle-aged and
middle-income women last year and been surprised to find that many
didn't know that five servings of fruits and vegetables a day were
recommended. They also found that many of the participants led
chaotic lives that didn't have room for meal planning.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Brainin-Rodriguez, a nutritionist at the San Francisco
Health Department who works with poor families, said people are
working two or more jobs to try to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves people at the mercy of fast food,'' she said. ``It's
hard to compete with a 39-cent hamburger. You can't make that kind
of food in your house for that kind of money.''

   FILM-REVIEW-JEOPARDY (Undated) _ Bruce Beresford's ``Double

ridiculousness. Nothing makes much sense, from huge plot gaps to
Tommy Lee Jones' game rehash of every other big-tough-softie
authority figure he's ever played. And poor Ashley Judd, who plays
the convicted murderer: so smart, so graceful, saddled with such a
hopelessly stupid character. By AMY BIANCOLLI.

   FILM-REVIEW-MUMFORD (Undated) _ Lawrence Kasdan's ``Mumford''
makes you realize that he's one of those directors you don't miss

   SCOTT-APPRECIATION (Undated) _ Over the course of almost 40
years and 80 feature and telefilms, George C. Scott was

smoking, a lot of kids are going to lose out on preschool. By ROB

DIRECTOR PUTS ANOTHER WOMAN BEHIND BARS IN `DOUBLE JEOPARDY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many movies about incarcerated women can one man make?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Bruce Beresford, three: the earnest ``Paradise Road,''
about a makeshift women's choir in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp;
the dullsville ``Last Dance,'' about a convicted murderer (Sharon
Stone) facing death row and Rob Morrow's squint; and now ``Double
Jeopardy,'' a casually absurd thriller about a convicted murderer
(Ashley Judd) whose supposedly dead husband is actually alive and
living with her supposedly best friend. Supposedly.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford also directed ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Black
Robe,'' neither of which featured women under lock and key. (His
best film, the terse ``Breaker Morant,'' locked up a few men.)
</P>
<P>
   This time he's working from a script by David Weisberg and
Douglas S. Cook, who wrote that masterwork of absurdity ``The
Rock,'' so he isn't the only one with a thing for penitentiaries.
</P>
<P>
   To be completely fair, ``Double Jeopardy'' doesn't spend much
time behind bars. Within the first 35 minutes, Our Heroine has:
gone sailing with her husband (Bruce Greenwood), had sex with him,
awakened in a blood-soaked bed, traced his gory footprints to the
side of the boat, been arrested for murder, gone to trial, sobbed
pathetically for the jury (``I didn't kill my husband!''), been
convicted, entrusted her son (Spencer Treat Clark) to her best
friend (Annabeth Gish), discovered that her husband is alive,
toughed out six long years, gone up for parole, hit the street and
clashed with her new parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones). Phew.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, see, is that the U.S. Constitution prevents anyone
from getting convicted twice for the same crime: double jeopardy.
In other words, Our Heroine can track down her slimeball of a
husband and plug him with a .38 special _ without going back to
prison! This sounds pretty iffy to us (isn't a crime particular to
time and place?), but the beauty of ``Double Jeopardy,'' if it can
be said to possess such a thing, is that no one involved in its
creation seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ridiculous movie, but it is good-natured in its
ridiculousness; nothing makes much sense, from chasmal plot gaps to
Tommy Lee Jones' game rehash of every other big-tough-softie
authority figure he's ever played.
</P>
<P>
   And poor Ashley Judd: so smart, so graceful, saddled with such a
hopelessly stupid character. This is the sort of doofus who'll
stumble across a bloody steak knife _ duh, her husband's murder
weapon _ and pick it up with her bare hands just as the Coast Guard
arrives. This is also the sort of woman who, upon learning that her
dead husband breathes still, decides to stew in jail for, oh,
another five years, when all she really has to do is phone her
lawyer. (She has one; he disappears after two scenes.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Judd's scenes with Clark are honestly
touching, Greenwood makes a nice, oily sociopath, and Judd has fun
destroying things once she's on the hunt. Watch her left eyebrow _
whenever she wrecks a car, it's cocked with glee. Plot be damned,
it seems to say.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Double Jeopardy,'' Ashley Judd gets to shoot her way out of
a coffin. And isn't that all that matters?

from Peter Magowan. He's the managing general partner of the

Stoneham, who stuck the Giants at Candlestick in the first place.

   FILM-REVIEW-JEOPARDY (Undated) _ Bruce Beresford's ``Double
Jeopardy'' is a ridiculous movie, but it is good-natured in its
ridiculousness. Nothing makes much sense, from huge plot gaps to
Tommy Lee Jones' game rehash of every other big-tough-softie
authority figure he's ever played. And poor Ashley Judd, who plays
the convicted murderer: so smart, so graceful, saddled with such a
hopelessly stupid character. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BEAUTY (Undated) _ ``American Beauty'' is so unlike
so many movies in so many ways that it compels us to watch and be
moved. Confident in its direction, vicious in its humor, brilliant
in its acting and astonishing in its redemptive spirit, theatrical
director Sam Mendes' film shows the tragedy and the beauty of a
humdrum world. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-MUMFORD (Undated) _ Lawrence Kasdan's ``Mumford''
makes you realize that he's one of those directors you don't miss
until he's back. ``Mumford,'' Kasdan's ninth and latest film, is a
humongously entertaining ensemble number that's his most confident
and narratively successful film since 1992's ``Grand Canyon.'' By
WESLEY MORRIS.

<P>
   SCOTT-APPRECIATION (Undated) _ Over the course of almost 40
years and 80 feature and telefilms, George C. Scott was
simultaneously renowned for the enormity of his volcanic talent and
notorious for his eruptive convictions. But he was a beast of a
different nature, one incapable of extinguishing his passion for
acting, regardless of how many times he tried to give it up. By
WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-JAKOB (Undated) _ His allegiance to vaudeville casts
a discomforting pall over the Polish ghettos in Robin Williams'
latest foray into unmitigated, but redemptive, tear-jerking. Set in
1944, ``Jakob the Liar'' casts Williams as an interned Jew who's
lost his wife and his cafe at the hands of the Nazi invasion. By
WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-RETURN (Undated) _ Some critics are making political
comparisons between ``Return with Honor,'' a documentary about
American POWs in Vietnam, and ``Regret to Inform,'' a documentary
on American and Vietnamese widows of the war. And that's too bad.

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ If I didn't hate cigarettes so
much and if I didn't hate tobacco companies so much, I'd take up

early childhood education, the beneficiary of the state's new
50-cent-a-pack tax. With cigarette taxes way up this year,
cigarettes sales have dropped almost 30 percent. If everyone quits
smoking, a lot of kids are going to lose out on preschool. By ROB

DIRECTOR PUTS ANOTHER WOMAN BEHIND BARS IN `DOUBLE JEOPARDY' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   How many movies about incarcerated women can one man make?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Bruce Beresford, three: the earnest ``Paradise Road,''
about a makeshift women's choir in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp;
the dullsville ``Last Dance,'' about a convicted murderer (Sharon
Stone) facing death row and Rob Morrow's squint; and now ``Double
Jeopardy,'' a casually absurd thriller about a convicted murderer
(Ashley Judd) whose supposedly dead husband is actually alive and
living with her supposedly best friend. Supposedly.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford also directed ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Black
Robe,'' neither of which featured women under lock and key. (His
best film, the terse ``Breaker Morant,'' locked up a few men.)
</P>
<P>
   This time he's working from a script by David Weisberg and
Douglas S. Cook, who wrote that masterwork of absurdity ``The
Rock,'' so he isn't the only one with a thing for penitentiaries.
</P>
<P>
   To be completely fair, ``Double Jeopardy'' doesn't spend much
time behind bars. Within the first 35 minutes, Our Heroine has:
gone sailing with her husband (Bruce Greenwood), had sex with him,
awakened in a blood-soaked bed, traced his gory footprints to the
side of the boat, been arrested for murder, gone to trial, sobbed
pathetically for the jury (``I didn't kill my husband!''), been
convicted, entrusted her son (Spencer Treat Clark) to her best
friend (Annabeth Gish), discovered that her husband is alive,
toughed out six long years, gone up for parole, hit the street and
clashed with her new parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones). Phew.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, see, is that the U.S. Constitution prevents anyone
from getting convicted twice for the same crime: double jeopardy.
In other words, Our Heroine can track down her slimeball of a
husband and plug him with a .38 special _ without going back to
prison! This sounds pretty iffy to us (isn't a crime particular to
time and place?), but the beauty of ``Double Jeopardy,'' if it can
be said to possess such a thing, is that no one involved in its
creation seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   It is a ridiculous movie, but it is good-natured in its
ridiculousness; nothing makes much sense, from chasmal plot gaps to
Tommy Lee Jones' game rehash of every other big-tough-softie
authority figure he's ever played.
</P>
<P>
   And poor Ashley Judd: so smart, so graceful, saddled with such a
hopelessly stupid character. This is the sort of doofus who'll
stumble across a bloody steak knife _ duh, her husband's murder
weapon _ and pick it up with her bare hands just as the Coast Guard
arrives. This is also the sort of woman who, upon learning that her
dead husband breathes still, decides to stew in jail for, oh,
another five years, when all she really has to do is phone her
lawyer. (She has one; he disappears after two scenes.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Judd's scenes with Clark are honestly
touching, Greenwood makes a nice, oily sociopath, and Judd has fun
destroying things once she's on the hunt. Watch her left eyebrow _
whenever she wrecks a car, it's cocked with glee. Plot be damned,
it seems to say.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Double Jeopardy,'' Ashley Judd gets to shoot her way out of
a coffin. And isn't that all that matters?

`AMERICAN BEAUTY' UNMASKS A NOT-SO-PRETTY SUBURBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lester Burnham, as Lester Burnham will readily admit, isn't
alive. He tells us so upfront, in dry, gorgeously sardonic
narration, introducing the story of his death with the piquant
amusement of a man recounting a weird day at the office.
</P>
<P>
   When he says ``This is my life,'' you know it'll be a tale worth
telling.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with ``American Beauty,'' an anti-suburban rant so
full of contradictions that even irony isn't what it seems to be;
it's idealism. In a film that equates hope with cynicism, faith
with nihilism and beauty with death, a voice-over done by a dead
man is the least of its oxymorons.
</P>
<P>
   Written by television scribe Alan Ball, ``American Beauty,''
marks the film debut of theatrical director Sam Mendes
(``Cabaret,'' ``The Blue Room''), who uses his characters the way a
still-life artist uses paint: to show us what we already know, only
more so.
</P>
<P>
   The world of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is both mundane and
hyper-articulated, a suburban environment so stiflingly average
that even death is preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Lester has a wife named Carolyn (Annette Bening) who loathes
him, a daughter named Jane (Thora Birch) who loathes him and a job
as a writer for a media trade magazine for which he has neither
aptitude nor passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and
they're right,'' he says in ghostly narration, as his former self
slumps, half-sentient, through his day. ``I have lost something.''
</P>
<P>
   Joie de vivre, zest for life, whatever Lester lacks it, in
spades. But when Jane introduces him to a pouty friend (Mena
Suvari, who played the virginal chorus singer in ``American Pie''),
Lester is seized by libidinous impulses and thereafter devotes his
paltry life to attracting her. He lifts weights. He jogs with the
gay men down the street. He studies his naked form in the
reflection of a basement window, dismay turning to raw narcissism
as his workouts yield results. Drifts of red rose petals enter his
dreams nocturnal and waking as Lester imagines himself with his
beloved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's more here than some artsy ``Lolita'' lust-scape.
``American Beauty'' isn't about sex; it's about the transformative
power of desire. The mere fact of Lester's yearning frees him from
his half-conscious state. No longer content to be a drone, he quits
his job, takes a new one flipping burgers at a joint called Mr.
Smiley's, buys a sports car (``I rule,'' he says, fist in air) and
starts smoking high-grade pot, which he buys from the
philosophizing Peeping Tom-videographer-next-door (Wes Bentley).
</P>
<P>
   Here's where ``American Beauty'' gets ironic. More than ironic,
actually: It gets deep. One reason the movie has earned so many
glowing early reviews is because it doesn't behave precisely the
way we expect. We know enough, for instance, to expect Kevin Spacey
to pull off a caustic role, but we don't expect him to play a fool
with such sympathy, accuracy or wit. (``Oh, it's OK, I wouldn't
remember me, either,'' he says, as a hot-shot played by Peter
Gallagher stares at him, blank-faced.) Spacey's lined, watchful
face betrays an innocence it's never shown before the vulnerability
of someone who's just rolled out of bed and spotted the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   We know enough to expect Bening to play a shrill suburban wife,
but we don't expect her to be pathetic, or hilarious, or true. We
know enough to expect movies about suburbia to be funny and
depressing and angry and pessimistic and acrid and black but we
don't expect it to contain jewel-like dissertations on the nature
of God and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed?''
asks Ricky, the Peeping Tom, at the start of a relationship with
Jane. The object of beauty: a paper bag, dancing in the wind with a
swirl of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky films dead things, too, looking for epiphany (``when you
see something like that, it's like God is looking at you''). That
he finds it is one of the movie's boldest strokes of cleverness not
quite genius and one of its biggest shocks. ``It's a great thing
when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself,''
intones Lester's voice-over, which takes on a measured Zen
benevolence as the tale unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   But cool as Spacey is, he roils next to Bentley, who delivers a
performance of such spooky control that frost seems to form on his
brow. It's a remarkable bit of work for a young actor, and he has
an unsettlingly mature chemistry with Birch; she bears the broad,
knowing face of a slightly-less-vampish Christina Ricci. With the
adults in their lives behaving like snot-nosed brats, Ricky and
Jane come across as preternatural forces of calm.
</P>
<P>
   If ``American Beauty'' has a single flaw, it's the insistence on
having it both ways: There's something shifty about a film that
boasts a drug-dealing voyeur as its moral center. And Ball's
screenplay gets lazy here and there, relying on a stock bad guy
Ricky's violent, homophobic Marine of a father (Chris Cooper) to
shove the plot around.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``American Beauty'' is so unlike so many movies in so many
ways that, flaws or no, it compels us to watch and be moved.
Confident in its direction, vicious in its humor, brilliant in its
acting and astonishing in its redemptive spirit, Mendes' film shows
the tragedy and the beauty of a humdrum world. And since when has a
satire moved us to tears?

REPORT SHOWS CALIFORNIANS SKIPPING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A state health report says Californians are
eating more fast food and getting less exercise, a potentially
lethal combination that defies images that residents of the Golden
State lead healthier lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity and diabetes are up, the consumption of fruits and
vegetables is down, and the consumption of fast food is going
through the roof, the state Department of Health Services found in
its sampling of more than 5,000 Californians over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are all pointing the same way, and it's the wrong
way,'' said Susan B. Foerster, chief of cancer prevention and
nutrition for the department. ``When we looked at it all together,
we were really kind of concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials point to the proliferation of advertising for high-fat
and fast foods, combined with time pressures that are depriving
families of home-cooked meals.
</P>
<P>
   Californians are not exercising as much as they should, either,
and the rising obesity rate shows it. It all adds up to a poorer
health picture for Californians. After tobacco use, a bad diet and
physical inactivity are the leading causes of preventable death.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Tuesday, found that in California:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer than half the people follow the eating recommendations
needed for preventing cancer and heart disease. One bright spot:
Hispanic adults and women in general under 25 both improved their
diets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer people are eating fruits and vegetables, reversing an
upward trend over the last several years. Blacks and women ate
significantly less.
</P>
<P>
   _ More people are eating fast food meals. In 1997 nearly half of
all adults who ate out on an average day ate at outlets such as
McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, up 30 percent from 1989. In
addition, the average customer is increasingly older, better
educated and wealthier than fast-food consumers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer people are eating the healthy, high-fiber breakfast
cereals that became popular in the mid-1980s, following a
nationwide push by government and cereal maker Kellogg to promote
food high in bran.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rate of obesity has risen 25 percent since 1990 and 50
percent since 1984. Obesity is especially acute among poor,
Hispanic and black women. The rate of diabetes, linked to obesity,
is up 25 percent since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the consumption of fruits and vegetables is most
worrisome to Foerster, who said she was stunned to learn that the
numbers for Californians had gone down while those for the nation
overall had gone up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been seeing an increase up through 1995, and the
federal government had reported an increase nationwide, so we were
expecting better results,'' she said. ``We were distressed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said researchers had interviewed middle-aged and
middle-income women last year and been surprised to find that many
didn't know that five servings of fruits and vegetables a day were
recommended. They also found that many of the participants led
chaotic lives that didn't have room for meal planning.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Brainin-Rodriguez, a nutritionist at the San Francisco
Health Department who works with poor families, said people are
working two or more jobs to try to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves people at the mercy of fast food,'' she said. ``It's
hard to compete with a 39-cent hamburger. You can't make that kind
of food in your house for that kind of money.''

GEORGE C. SCOTT: THE BULLDOG WHO PERSONIFIED AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foremost he was a bulldog. That gruff, raging, tenacious force
whose bark was not as fearsome as his bite.
</P>
<P>
   George Campbell Scott, who died in Los Angeles on Wednesday at
71, had the voice of used sandpaper and a weathered face that often
appeared older than it was, with a body that _ like the other great
hurricane thespians (Welles, Brando) _ was trying to catch up.
Maybe like them he was full of himself, or maybe he gave too much
of himself over to his craft.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of almost 40 years and 80 feature and television
films, Scott was simultaneously renowned for the enormity of his
volcanic talent and notorious for his eruptive convictions.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a beast of a different nature, one incapable of
extinguishing his passion for acting, regardless of how many times
he tried to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Like the alcohol Scott fought for years to leave alone, acting
was an addiction he wanted to overcome because he never felt he'd
done justice to most of the men whose riled, sometimes diabolical
souls he'd made bigger than life. Drinking was an attempt to salve
the nagging dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. George S. Patton made him an icon, but it was a role that
further fueled his self-criticism. He was offered the part only
after Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum, Lee Marvin and Rod Steiger
said no. The bombast of the film annoyed Scott; he felt it was
inconsistent with the nuances of the complex man he was trying to
develop. ``Patton was misunderstood contemporaneously and he's
misunderstood here _ I'm ashamed of being a part of it,'' he once
told the London Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
   But watching the means that Scott and director Franklin
Schaffner used to lionize him, ``bombastic'' is the only way to
describe the film's portrait of the general. Scott occupies nearly
every frame and he's such an enthralling, impregnable, magnificent,
arrogant presence that he makes Schaffner forget that Francis Ford
Coppola and Edmund H. North's script is a satire.
</P>
<P>
   The swollen self-importance Scott bequeathed Patton is at once
funny but deadly serious: In all its fire-breathing flamboyance,
his performance has taken on the superpatriotic-superheroic weight
of a symbol with a heavier cultural- historic currency than the man
he was playing. Scott's Patton became like Henry Fonda's Tom Joad,
Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey and John Wayne in everything:
America.
</P>
<P>
   For his personification of America, Scott was offered an Oscar
in 1971, which he never accepted. His refusal of the statue along
with the long, omnipresent shadow ``Patton'' cast _ if not over the
roles offered him, then the roles he selected _ marked a turning
point in the quality of work Scott would do. The next year he gave
one of his last prominent performances in Paddy Chayefsky and
Arthur Hiller's ``The Hospital,'' a heavy-handed farce about the
incompetence of municipal hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   He played the impotent, abandoned Henry Block, the head of
surgery at a teaching hospital. This time Scott seemed to be in on
the film's joke as opposed to transcending it. He received his
fourth and last Oscar nomination. If it was difficult for Scott to
find any redeeming value in film work before ``The Hospital,'' it
became impossible after. He'd gone from unlikely movie star to
tarnished rock star, giving in to his drinking, destroying a little
of himself along with a few hotel rooms and watering holes.
</P>
<P>
   The aptly named ``The Last Run'' (1971) was about an aging
gangster who comes out of retirement for one final job. A disaster
for Scott both creatively and personally, the film cast his wife,
the late Colleen Dewhurst, as a whore and Trish Van Devere as a
moll.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage with Dewhurst, who had married him for a second
time, was crumbling and that next year Scott would marry Van
Devere, who remained his wife until his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work in the theater to stay sane,'' he said. ``You
can attack the stage fresh every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott sustained his lifestyle on a steady diet of grievous movie
and TV work that never really challenged him as actor so much as
paid the rent and supported his six children. Understanding his
needs as an actor, Scott returned to the theater, earning a slew of
plaudits, including the last two of his four Tony awards.
</P>
<P>
   Scott evaded other people's acknowledgement of his behavior as
if each fractured character he played was more than an extension of
himself. They were him, realer-than-real moving snapshots of a man
he didn't want to deal with _ let alone other people. He once
described himself as ``lonely _ paradoxically optimistic _ and
private.''
</P>
<P>
   After a collection of blistering performances in episodes of the
``Hallmark Hall of Fame'' and the ``Kraft Mystery Theater,'' his
film debut came in 1959 as the religious psychopath opposite Gary
Cooper in ``The Hanging Tree.'' But it was the insinuation he
brought in that same year to Otto Preminger's ``Anatomy of a
Murder'' as the prosecutor Claude Dancer, his trademark blowhard
persona having a lean, sexual wickedness, that made him a star.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood leapt on him as if the town had struck oil. And Scott
was more than happy to mix thunder, unctuousness, mania and a touch
of evil for a run of performances that included turns as Burt
Gordon in ``The Hustler'' (1962) and what may be his most fully
realized screen performance as the cripplingly indulgent Buck
Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick's ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   Turgidson represented the only time in Scott's film career that
his being out of control was so brilliantly funny it sometimes
seemed more satisfying than what Peter Sellers had to do as three
characters.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Patton that defined Scott as much as he came to
define the role. And in 1986, he returned to Patton in a TV movie
called ``The Last Days of Patton'' to try to right the role he felt
he most wronged. ``I never felt satisfied about it in my own
mind,'' he told the New York Times that year, as though he was
exorcising a demon.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael once called Scott a
``great, spangled ham.'' She was wrong. He was deviled.

   Revisiting Monty Python
</P>
<P>
   As he did regularly on the BBC and later on PBS, the wild-eyed
old fellow with the scraggly beard staggers up to the camera
seemingly ready to expire. ``It's,'' he gasps. ``It's ... It's ...'
Actually it's ``Monty Python's Flying Circus,'' available from A&AMP;E
on Tuesday in an extensive recycling of material from a show that,
along with ``Saturday Night Live,'' took over television comedy for
a time in the '70s and still lingers in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1969, the show seems to pop up for a good remarketing
at every 10th anniversary or other significant occasion. To pave
the way for home video, A&AMP;E began its 30th-birthday revival on
television in July. Now 13 episodes are on two sets of six
videocassettes each and two sets of DVD's with two disks each.

<P>
   For the Python crew _ Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle,
Terry Gilliam (the one American), Terry Jones and Michael Palin _
tape is fine, but for their style of humor and delivery disk is
better because one can skip about at random in a sea of comedy that
caroms here and there totally at whim.
</P>
<P>
   The Pythons could be with a maniac from Guatemala one second and
a man who puts bricks to sleep the next. Today as then, the humor
ranges from sharp to the excruciatingly humdrum, but the
helter-skelter style is always a treat, as are the personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Cleese is a marvel in drag or at delivering verbal convolutions.
``Introduce me to allow myself,'' he announces in the role of
Inspector Tiger, who has just arrived on a murder scene. ``I must
not ask anyone to leave the room.'' Jones makes a superb stripper
as a man who keeps trying to change into his bathing suit at the
beach and finally ends up onstage at a vaudeville house.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of half the world, Queen Victoria hikes her skirts and
races around the lawn in pursuit of William Gladstone. Python humor
always had an academic tinge, especially when it came to historical
matters. Was Trafalgar fought at sea or was it really on land?
Cardinal Richelieu could appear at any second on British soil (``I
love your country,'' he says).
</P>
<P>
   The dead could play a hand. During a trial, testimony is taken
from a body in a coffin. One knock means yes, two mean no.
Restaurants were scenes of little dramas that could rise to
operatic heights, with aggrieved diners and hysterical waiters
getting increasingly out of hand. At one point a maitre d' commits
suicide by falling on a fork.
</P>
<P>
   In a museum, women chat self-importantly about the art, pausing
to smack their children, who are trashing the exhibits. At another
point a man gives a cat a case of influenza. The Pythons were
ardent animal abusers. Episodes ricochet from flying sheep to
gorilla librarians to 18th-century social legislation to seduced
milkmen to nonillegal robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best parts of these videos are Gilliam's animated
artworks, especially the quarreling statuary. The videocassettes
are $29.95 a set, the DVD's, $44.95.

   The Mummy
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of the golden trove of Hamunaptra, a legendary
Egyptian crypt under Saharan sands, some pushy young scholars and
grave robbers get themselves into serious difficulties with the
army of zombies who guard the place. Blame Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo,
above), an ancient priest who, having misbehaved with the Pharaoh's
mistress, was put to a horrible death. Now his vengeful spirit is
unwisely loosed by the modern-day (1923) interlopers, who are
defended by a Harrison Ford knockoff named Rick (Brendan Fraser).
Stephen Sommers' film may bill itself as a ``reimagining'' of the
1932 horror classic, but, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times, it really ``has no pretenses to be anything other than a
gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen.''

   Three Seasons
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bui, a 26-year-old director who escaped Vietnam as a child,
creates a rain-soaked elegy for a culture that is being swept away
by hard-edged modernism. As if in a dream, washed in warm rains,
four innocent victims _ a peddler of lotus blossoms, an embittered
poet dying of leprosy, a cyclo driver infatuated with a scornful
prostitute, and a street boy who sells trinkets before losing his
sample case _ float in a cinematic poem ``so languidly paced that
it occasionally turns vague and meandering'' (Holden).

   The Out-of-Towners

   None of the appeal and energy of Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn
can do much to salvage a misguided remake of the 1970 Neil Simon
comedy. With their children grown and gone from their Ohio nest,
Nancy Clark (Ms. Hawn) and her husband, Henry ( Martin), come to
New York, where he is to have a job inerview. Of course, the Big
Apple bites back in a story that can't decide whether it's more
about it or them. ``Accordingly, they are sometimes characters,
sometimes cartoons and never credible comic creations'' (Lawrence
Van Gelder).

<P>
   A cyberthriller sets up parallel worlds in 1937 and 1990's Los
Angeles. Characters lead different lives, starting with the
visionary contemporary magnate (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who has
fashioned a chip that recreates the '30s. Returning to that scene,
he is murdered. Back in the present, his heir apparent (Craig
Bierko) wakes up to find the boss' blood-soaked shirt and himself
the prime suspect. Strong performances help a film that begins
promisingly, but then unravels in an ``overplotted and ultimately
illogical combination of science fiction, mystery and romance''
(Van Gelder).

   AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY. Recently on PBS, Jennifer Fox's
acclaimed documentary chronicles the 30-year love affair and
interracial marriage of Bill Sims, a black musician, and Karen
Wilson, a white businesswoman. Ms. Fox spent nearly two years with
the family, which includes Cicily, 20, a Colgate senior, and
Chaney, 12, a seventh grader. Cicily's struggle to be accepted as
herself and not a skin color becomes the gripping central drama in,
Caryn James wrote in The New York Times, a ``subtly artful,

wrote in The New York Times, helps ``elevate a tear-stained parable
into an exploration of the human spirit.'' 1999. HBO. $74.99. 101
minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.

 UNDATED: two (Maslin). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
( Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age
mush (think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIGMATA,' starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne and
Jonathan Pryce. Directed by Rupert Wainwright (R, 102 minutes).
When Frankie Paige (Ms. Arquette), a vapid Pittsburgh hairdresser,
receives the present of a rosary lifted from the dead body of a
Brazilian priest, her life becomes a supernatural horror show.
Byrne is the Vatican cleric who investigates the case and Pryce the
evil cardinal who wants to cover up evidence that could damage the
church. The seizures in this poorly acted melange of shock effects
and religious imagery are bargain-basement ``Exorcist.'' Instead of
pea soup and spinning heads, we get breaking glass, dripping blood
and flurries of feathers from agitated doves (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIR OF ECHOES,' starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
Directed by David Koepp (R, 99 minutes). Another little boy talks
to a ghost at the start of this thriller, but it isn't an instant
``Sixth Sense'' sequel. Instead it shows what happens when the
boy's closed-minded father lets himself be hypnotized and awakens
to find himself receiving otherworldly stimuli. Bacon gives a
grippingly intense performance as a man terrified by his new
extrasensory powers. And Koepp conveys a potent sense of what it
means to unravel. Despite its strong, spooky start and early
momentum, the film winds up with too earthbound an explanation for
the havoc it unleashes (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SUGAR TOWN,' starring Rosanna Arquette, Ally Sheedy, Beverly
D'Angelo, Jade Gordon, John Taylor and John Doe. Directed by
Allison Anders and Kurt Voss (R, 92 minutes). An Altmanesque
cross-section of California show-biz strivers, and a film with an
inordinate supply of strong, funny female characters. Made so
quickly that its actors' obvious enthusiasm never has a chance to
flag, it illuminates such subjects as power dating and the travails
of a has-been rock band. Ms. Sheedy is especially memorable as the
walking embodiment of every self-help fad and Type A trait. But
it's not easy to pick a favorite character in this warm, knowing
ensemble comedy (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE 13TH WARRIOR,' starring Antonio Banderas and Omar Sharif.
Directed by John McTiernan (R, 103 minutes). Set in the 10th
century and adapted from a novel by Michael Crichton, this
grunting, sweating, blood-gushing medieval answer to professional
wrestling is inspired by Ahmed Ibn Fadhlan's historical account of
his adventures in Central Asia. Banderas plays an exiled Persian
poet who hooks up with a group of Norse warriors to do battle with
an evil tribe of flesh eaters. The screenplay is monosyllabic, but
the action scenes, which take you into the thick of battle, are
excitingly photographed. A charging score by Jerry Goldsmith helps
ennoble the grisly derring-do (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CHAOS AND COMEDY: THE FILMS OF BLAKE EDWARDS.' A 12-film
retrospective devoted to Blake Edwards winds up this weekend at the
American Museum of the Moving Image with a four-film outburst of
comedy, romance, satire and farce highlighted by a dialogue with
the filmmaker himself at 2 p.m. Saturday. The appearance by
Edwards, the director of more than 50 films and the creator of the
Pink Panther series, follows a 2 p.m. screening of his 1979 hit,
``10,'' which starred Dudley Moore and Bo Derek as the object of
his midlife desires. At 5:30 p.m., the attraction is ``S.O.B.,''
the 1981 satire in which Edwards vented his spleen on Hollywood.
Sunday's attractions include a 2 p.m. screening of ``Darling Lili''
(1970), with Julie Andrews (Mrs. Edwards) as a World War I German
spy, and a 5 p.m. screening of ``Victor/Victoria'' (1982), the
musical farce starring Ms. Andrews that later became a Broadway
musical (Van Gelder).

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Finley and Thora Burch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Though the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOWFINGER,' starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Heather
Graham. Written by Martin. Directed by Frank Oz (PG-13, 97
minutes). This hilarious, good-hearted spiritual descendant of
``The Producers'' is a comic coup for Martin. And it's directed by
Oz every bit as winningly as his ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' and
``In and Out.'' Murphy is razor sharp in a dual role as both a
grinning fall guy and the kind of hotshot action star whose very
presence is enough to get a movie made. Martin, sublimely funny,
runs circles around him as an unscrupulous filmmaker trying to
trick the star into appearing in his movie. ``Did you know that Tom
Cruise had no idea he was in that vampire movie until two years
later?'' this filmmaker inquires. Made fondly and knowingly, with
nonstop good humor (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS,' starring Bruce Willis and Nick Nolte.
Directed by Alan Rudolph (R, 110 minutes). Stuffed with visual gags
and acted with the cartoonish exaggeration of a John Waters film
divested of camp, Rudolph's screen adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut
Jr.'s 1973 novel is a psychedelic fun house of a movie. The movie's
style is so hyperventilated that it is exhausting to watch. And if
the satire on such easy targets as middle-class conformity,
American kitsch culture and Puritanism 1950s-style is relentless,
it also seems old hat. Still, you've got to admire the director's
courage in making a movie this uncompromisingly weird and
noncommercial (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (Not rated, 99 minutes). It is
1947, and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FOR LOVE OF THE GAME,' starring Kevin Costner and Kelly
Preston. Directed by Sam Raimi (PG-13, 140 minutes). This film,
starring Costner as an aging Detroit Tigers pitcher, is a baseball
movie the way ``You've Got Mail'' was a movie about the retail book
business. Deep down, the film is really about the love of a
difficult man for a good woman, played by Ms. Preston. The baseball
story, thanks to Costner's athletic credibility (see ``Bull
Durham'' and ``Field of Dreams'') and a complement of real
ballplayers, works better than the romance. Taken together, they
add up to routine entertainment, because the overloaded love story
doesn't really tug the heartstrings. Underlying the story of Billy
Chapel's crucial game is the story of his five-year romance with
Jane (Ms. Preston), seen in flashbacks, as the star pitcher tries
to coax one more win out of a worn-out arm. Is it time for Chapel
to quit? Filmmaking, like baseball, is a team game, and sometimes
even a talented lineup produces unexceptional results (Lawrence Van
Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `LUCIE AUBRAC,' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel Auteuil.
Produced, written and directed by Claude Berri (R, 116 minutes).
What lifts this taut World War II thriller based on a true story
above the ordinary are the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet
and Auteuil as Lucie and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters
in the French Resistance. When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and
convicted of war crimes, Lucie conceives an outrageously audacious
plan for his escape. Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically
intense as Bogey and Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' but here the woman
is the one who ends up doing the thinking for both of them
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MUSE,' starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie
MacDowell and Jeff Bridges. Directed by Brooks (PG-13, 97 minutes).
In his latest mordantly hilarious cri de coeur about contemporary
life, the ever grousing Brooks takes on the capriciousness of
success in a world of show-business ethics. And in coming up with
the title character, played by Ms. Stone in a delectable comic
performance, he gives that world exactly the kind of divinity it
deserves. This muse is quite a piece of work, but she seems to get
results, on the evidence of a couple of inspired cameos here. The
joke of a premise winds down before it reaches a punch line. But
Brooks again manages to be funny and bleak with equal ease
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE,' starring Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin, Amy
Smart and George Wendt. Written by Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly
and Michael Corrente. Directed by Corrente (R, 95 minutes). Three
of Rhode Island's finest, the director of ``Federal Hill'' and the
brothers behind ``There's Something About Mary,'' collaborate on a
rowdily funny yet also unexpectedly tender coming-of-age tale. This
rueful and very likable comedy tells of a Pawtucket teen-ager who
is abruptly separated from his druggy old cronies and packed off to
a Connecticut prep school, where he is a sharp-eyed observer of the
characters around him. Loosely knit, sometimes uproarious, the film
benefits enormously from Baldwin's deft performance as the boy's
small-minded, memorably impossible father (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ROMANCE,' starring Caroline Ducey, Sagamore Stevenin, Francois
Berleand and Rocco Siffredi. Written and directed by Catherine
Breillat (not rated, 93 minutes). A solemn, sexually graphic
exploration of the nature of a woman's need for male attention and
erotic love, even if its insights are already familiar to readers
of Cosmopolitan and the Marquis de Sade. And it's doubtful that the
film's intellectual aspects would command the same attention if its
camera did not make the actors' genitals as familiar as their
faces. The carnal and cerebral erotica here have already achieved
the considerable feat of shocking France, but the film is often
stilted and methodical to the point of tediousness. It hovers
between passion and philosophical argument without often achieving
Ms. Breillat's ambition to fuse the two (Maslin).

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(``Tonight'' refers to Sunday, Sept. 26)  
By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a great old ``Calvin and Hobbes'' comic
strip that finds Calvin playing with one of those old paddle-ball
toys for a panel or two. He quickly gets stultifyingly bored and
grouses, ``I kind of resent the manufacturer's implicit assumption
that this would amuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how you may feel after sitting through the two new shows
premiering tonight. ``Snoops,'' a piece of shameless eye candy from
newly feted King of TV David E. Kelley, is a royal washout. ``Jack
&AMP; Jill,'' from screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer, who wrote ``Mrs.
Doubtfire'' _ did anyone recommend that movie on the strength of
its screenplay? _ is as generic as romantic comedy comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snoops'' is simply a high-tech ``Charlie's Angels,'' about a
private-investigation firm that looks like the inside of a video
game and is run by three women (Gina Gershon, Paula Marshall and
Paula Jai Parker) whose beauty is an actual plot point. They employ
all sorts of surveillance gadgets to invade their subjects'
personal lives and have never met a Fourth Amendment argument they
didn't like _ well, Marshall's character is skeptical at the outset
_ so breaking and entering and illegal wiretaps are routine tricks
of their trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more in common with the criminals _ we just have
better intentions,'' Glenn Hall (Gershon) concedes. In an era rife
with concern about technology stripping away our personal privacy,
it's odd that Kelley posits these women as heroes. In the second
episode, the police even ask them to break the law to help with an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In between break-ins _ and there's a lot of downtime for
jabbering here _ the women sit around and snipe at one another with
weak one-liners that Kelley would never force upon Calista
Flockhart. ``We don't do put-downs here,'' Glenn says, when in fact
that's all they do. The second episode introduces the
``nipple-cam,'' a gimmick so leering and gratuitous that even
Marshall's character is incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   Boasting a colorful production design, the show is certainly
easy on the eye, a sprinkling of brightly colored lights that
allows viewers to sit slack-jawed while waiting for ``The
Practice.'' Kelley's grating assumption seems to be that the
assembled pulchritude will convince viewers to forgive a multitude
of other faults. But isn't that also the point of the Spice
Channel? With this, Kelley _ whom ABC, in its press release for
this series, describes as ``prolific,'' as if that's better than
``acclaimed'' or ``award-winning'' _  &QL; 
takes that first big step toward becoming Aaron Spelling. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Snoops.'' &QL; 
What: Comedy-action series about women running a high-tech
private-investigation firm.  &QL; 
Who: Gina Gershon, Paula Marshall, Paula Jai Parker, Danny Nucci,
Edward Kerr. &QL; 
Where: ABC (Channel 7). &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 2 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`JACK &AMP; JILL'
</P>
<P>
   High-concept really hits a new low with ``Jack &AMP; Jill.'' Get
this _ she's Jack (actually, Jaqueline Barrett, played by Amanda
Peet), and  &UR; !ital! &LR; he's Jill (actually, David Jillefsky, portrayed
by Ivan Sergei)! Imagining the pitch meeting where that idea was
actually green-lit gives me hives.
</P>
<P>
   Jack just dumped her cad of a fiance at the altar; Jill's in a
decent relationship with another woman who just happens to be
Jack's new best friend (New York City being a small world and all).
When the title characters first meet, Jack blurts out, ``I'm just
not ready for a rebound relationship!'' before ``Hello.'' The two,
nonetheless, sense a chemistry that under other conditions would
prove explosive (Peet and Sergei don't quite convey this, alas).
</P>
<P>
   This is the premise for a TV movie on the Lifetime channel, not
an entire TV series. Too-cute dialogue has the synthetic feel of
100 supporting-character bull sessions you've heard before. Peet's
narration, in both scripting and performance, struggles way too
hard to be cute. Fairy tales are a recurring theme, ostensibly
playing off the title and ignoring the fact that the original
``Jack and Jill'' isn't a fairy tale, just a silly little poem.
</P>
<P>
   A doo-wop quartet (the show's idea of ethnic diversity) that
turns up on streets upon which the characters stroll is considered
a magical conceit _ by the same people, mind you, who thought
switching Jack and Jill's genders was brilliance incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they forgot how that rhyme ended: Jack fell down and
broke his (or, here, her) crown, and Jill came tumbling after. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Jack &AMP; Jill.'' &QL; 
What: Romantic comedy about a perfect couple who meets at the
perfectly wrong time. &QL; 
Who: Amanda Peet, Ivan Sergei, Jaime Pressly, Sarah Paulson. &QL; 
Where: WB (Channel 5). &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 1 1/2 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`THE PRACTICE'
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley has so much on his plate, he must think life is
All-You-Can-Eat Night at the Sizzler. In addition to launching
``Snoops,'' relaunching ``Chicago Hope,'' cutting ``Ally McBeal''
episodes down into a half-hour format called ``Ally'' (he also had
two film scripts produced this year) _ he's still in charge of
writing most episodes for the year's big Emmy winners, ``McBeal''
and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, judging from the first new episodes of ``The
Practice,'' which returns tonight, Kelley doesn't seem to be giving

attorney _ and therefore accustomed to working insanely long hours
_ he has the background to make his quixotic legal stories here and

   In the season premiere, Henry Winkler guest-stars as a dentist
accused of murdering a patient who's obsessive about dental

educates his prime-time audience into the ``crush club'' culture.
The courtroom dialogue, as attorneys battle with blistering
verbiage, remains wickedly tart.

   Next week offers up murder with a twist, forcing Lindsay (Kelli
Williams), who survived an attack last season, to reflect, ``I
don't know what's worse _ the fact that we freed another murderer,
or the fact that it doesn't really bother us anymore.'' And the
perpetually smug and smooth Bobby (Dylan McDermott) lets a little
glimpse of the man under the machine peek through. Note: In the

scripts kill off a whopping 10 women. &QL;

   Well, of course, the resolution is far more complicated than a

`SABRINA DOWN UNDER'
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wonderful World of Disney'' returns tonight with a new
telefilm, ``Sabrina Down Under,'' starring Melissa Joan Hart,
irrepressibly clean-cut on TV and significantly less so in the
latest issue of Maxim magazine.
</P>
<P>
   (It's obvious why she'd undress for Maxim's cover _ after all,
the publication's readership no doubt falls, at least
intellectually, into ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch's'' demographic.
But how will beleaguered parents respond to young fans of the show
who ask them, ``Daddy, why is Sabrina's black bra unbuttoned?'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabrina Down Under'' _ the title refers to Australia, not a
set-up from the Maxim photo shoot _ represents, like its
predecessor, ``Sabrina Goes to Rome,'' a terrific all-expenses-paid
vacation for Hart. For the rest of us, it's a sporadically engaging
travelogue about the Great Barrier Reef padded to feature length by
underwater and party sequences. Here, humor is represented by
Sabrina's observation, ``For being down under, everything is
surprisingly right-side up.'' Smart-alecky cat Salem is in tow to
offer plenty of warmed-over fishy shtick.
</P>
<P>
   The story offers a watery environmental fable, as Sabrina helps
a merman and his waterlogged pals fend off a ship's offshore
dumping and a marine biologist's scientific snooping. Those under
10 will be utterly enchanted, while Hart's innate charm will be the
only draw for older viewers.

`KING OF THE HILL,' ``THE SIMPSONS,' AND `FUTURAMA'
</P>
<P>
   Fox's holy trinity of animation _ ``King of the Hill,'' ``The
Simpsons'' and ``Futurama'' _ all open their seasons with reliably
entertaining episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' remains a modern miracle, keeping fresh and
even unpredictable going into this, its 11th season. This week, Mel
Gibson hires Homer to help him salvage his remake of ``Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington'' by, naturally, ladling on sacrilegious
mega-violence. It features ruthlessly funny digs at Motion Picture
Association chief Jack Valenti, Robert Downey Jr. and the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's episode is one of those classics, featuring Bart at
his worst, until he's diagnosed with Attention-deficit disorder and
put on an experimental medication. Its blissfully surreal
conclusion features a visit from home-run hero Mark McGuire, who
choppers into Springfield on a sinister mission.
</P>
<P>
   Groening's ``Futurama'' hasn't quite kicked into a regiment of
routine excellence, but it's still trying. Tonight's episode is a
``Titanic'' parody; next week's agreeably gooses ``Ally McBeal.''
At this point, however, ``Futurama's'' Bart Simpson-meets-``Blade
Runner'' visuals remain more memorable than its gags.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill'' goes for more poignancy than usual but
still manages some laughs. It picks up where last season left off,
with Peggy surviving her ill-fated parachute jump in a body cast
but still trying to find ways to make herself useful. Hank tries to
assuage her fears with his observation, ``Helen Keller was largely
useless, but look how we remember her _ First Lady of the American
Stage.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``The Simpsons.'' &QL;

(``Tonight'' refers to Sunday, Sept. 26)  
By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a great old ``Calvin and Hobbes'' comic
strip that finds Calvin playing with one of those old paddle-ball
toys for a panel or two. He quickly gets stultifyingly bored and
grouses, ``I kind of resent the manufacturer's implicit assumption
that this would amuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how you may feel after sitting through the two new shows
premiering tonight. ``Snoops,'' a piece of shameless eye candy from
newly feted King of TV David E. Kelley, is a royal washout. ``Jack
&AMP; Jill,'' from screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer, who wrote ``Mrs.
Doubtfire'' _ did anyone recommend that movie on the strength of
its screenplay? _ is as generic as romantic comedy comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snoops'' is simply a high-tech ``Charlie's Angels,'' about a
private-investigation firm that looks like the inside of a video
game and is run by three women (Gina Gershon, Paula Marshall and
Paula Jai Parker) whose beauty is an actual plot point. They employ
all sorts of surveillance gadgets to invade their subjects'
personal lives and have never met a Fourth Amendment argument they
didn't like _ well, Marshall's character is skeptical at the outset
_ so breaking and entering and illegal wiretaps are routine tricks
of their trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more in common with the criminals _ we just have
better intentions,'' Glenn Hall (Gershon) concedes. In an era rife
with concern about technology stripping away our personal privacy,
it's odd that Kelley posits these women as heroes. In the second
episode, the police even ask them to break the law to help with an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In between break-ins _ and there's a lot of downtime for
jabbering here _ the women sit around and snipe at one another with
weak one-liners that Kelley would never force upon Calista
Flockhart. ``We don't do put-downs here,'' Glenn says, when in fact
that's all they do. The second episode introduces the
``nipple-cam,'' a gimmick so leering and gratuitous that even
Marshall's character is incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   Boasting a colorful production design, the show is certainly
easy on the eye, a sprinkling of brightly colored lights that
allows viewers to sit slack-jawed while waiting for ``The
Practice.'' Kelley's grating assumption seems to be that the
assembled pulchritude will convince viewers to forgive a multitude
of other faults. But isn't that also the point of the Spice
Channel? With this, Kelley _ whom ABC, in its press release for
this series, describes as ``prolific,'' as if that's better than
``acclaimed'' or ``award-winning'' _  &QL; 
takes that first big step toward becoming Aaron Spelling. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Snoops.'' &QL; 
What: Comedy-action series about women running a high-tech
private-investigation firm.  &QL; 
Who: Gina Gershon, Paula Marshall, Paula Jai Parker, Danny Nucci,
Edward Kerr. &QL; 
Where: ABC (Channel 7). &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 2 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`JACK &AMP; JILL'
</P>
<P>
   High-concept really hits a new low with ``Jack &AMP; Jill.'' Get
this _ she's Jack (actually, Jaqueline Barrett, played by Amanda
Peet), and  &UR; !ital! &LR; he's Jill (actually, David Jillefsky, portrayed
by Ivan Sergei)! Imagining the pitch meeting where that idea was
actually green-lit gives me hives.
</P>
<P>
   Jack just dumped her cad of a fiance at the altar; Jill's in a
decent relationship with another woman who just happens to be
Jack's new best friend (New York City being a small world and all).
When the title characters first meet, Jack blurts out, ``I'm just
not ready for a rebound relationship!'' before ``Hello.'' The two,
nonetheless, sense a chemistry that under other conditions would
prove explosive (Peet and Sergei don't quite convey this, alas).
</P>
<P>
   This is the premise for a TV movie on the Lifetime channel, not
an entire TV series. Too-cute dialogue has the synthetic feel of
100 supporting-character bull sessions you've heard before. Peet's
narration, in both scripting and performance, struggles way too
hard to be cute. Fairy tales are a recurring theme, ostensibly
playing off the title and ignoring the fact that the original
``Jack and Jill'' isn't a fairy tale, just a silly little poem.
</P>
<P>
   A doo-wop quartet (the show's idea of ethnic diversity) that
turns up on streets upon which the characters stroll is considered
a magical conceit _ by the same people, mind you, who thought
switching Jack and Jill's genders was brilliance incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently they forgot how that rhyme ended: Jack fell down and
broke his (or, here, her) crown, and Jill came tumbling after. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Jack &AMP; Jill.'' &QL; 
What: Romantic comedy about a perfect couple who meets at the
perfectly wrong time. &QL; 
Who: Amanda Peet, Ivan Sergei, Jaime Pressly, Sarah Paulson. &QL; 
Where: WB (Channel 5). &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 1 1/2 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`THE PRACTICE'
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley has so much on his plate, he must think life is
All-You-Can-Eat Night at the Sizzler. In addition to launching
``Snoops,'' relaunching ``Chicago Hope,'' cutting ``Ally McBeal''
episodes down into a half-hour format called ``Ally'' (he also had
two film scripts produced this year) _ he's still in charge of
writing most episodes for the year's big Emmy winners, ``McBeal''
and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, judging from the first new episodes of ``The
Practice,'' which returns tonight, Kelley doesn't seem to be giving
his benchmark creation short shrift. Since Kelley is a former
attorney _ and therefore accustomed to working insanely long hours
_ he has the background to make his quixotic legal stories here and
on ``Ally'' credible, while his concoctions on ``Hope'' and
``Snoops'' have the whiff of someone straining for quirkiness.
</P>
<P>
   In the season premiere, Henry Winkler guest-stars as a dentist

called the Lost Dog Registry in Kansas City. This group kept a
lookout for it but was losing hope. Then the dog happened to wander
by the house of an Overland Park woman. Her kids wanted to keep it.
Nevertheless, she turned in the dog to the Lost Dog Registry. Man

   That odor you smell this morning is coming from the Midwest.
It's called Notre Dame football. If you follow college football at
all, you know the Irish are 1-3. You know they have lost two games
this season by failing to score on the final drive and displaying
poor clock management. You know they are 0-3 against the Big Ten, a
league the Irish seriously considered joining.
</P>
<P>
   You know there is an ongoing NCAA investigation of the program,
with at least minimal penalties to come down.
</P>
<P>
   You may not know that in the past few weeks more allegations _
tutors writing papers for players, players misusing complimentary
tickets, and other minor misdeeds _ have recently surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know Bob Davie's coaching staff has been sizzled by
the media and fans for everything from poor play selection to
misuse of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, these are not major crimes according to the NCAA.
Collectively, it is a sign of something more serious. South Bend,
Ind., you've got a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, whether you like it or hate it (and few people are
neutral when it comes to the Irish), has always stood for something
special about college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the image from movie roles played by Pat O'Brien
and Ronald Reagan as Knute Rockne and George Gipp, respectively;
whether it's the almost cliched image of College Football America
at Notre Dame Stadium on a crisp autumn afternoon with Touchdown
Jesus and the Golden Dome glistening in the sunlight, serenaded by
the school's fight song; or whether it's the image of
student-athletes in the truest sense of the word, those who play as
a passion rather than a profession, Notre Dame has carried the
banner of college football for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now that image is in tatters. In the past few years, we have had
sex and money (the Kim Dunbar case), age discrimination (the Joe
Moore case), ticket scalping, and now athletes having school work
done for them by other students.
</P>
<P>
   This is a football team that, on the surface, seems to be
talented enough to compete at the highest level. But the Irish have
played poorly against good teams, which has not only dropped them
out of national title contention but also has made them a
questionable Bowl team (a required six wins against 1-A
competition).
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Irish have become mediocre, which seems to be the
greatest sin of all.
</P>
<P>
   At other schools, success goes in cycles, and people accept it.
At Notre Dame, that isn't good enough. The Irish still have NBC
broadcasting every home game. It still has a national radio
network, allowing you to follow the team whether you are sitting in
Amherst or snoozing in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the heat has come down on Davie. Some suggest he is in
over his head. Instead of being mentioned with Parseghian, Leahy,
and Rockne, Davie is now mentioned with Gerry Faust and Joe
Kuharich, former Irish coaches who were either overwhelmed or
overmatched by the constant spotlight that beams on Notre Dame
football.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to make any formal judgments on Davie.
Like his predecessors, he deserves the full five-year cycle that
Notre Dame gives all of its coaches before making any pronouncement
of failure or success.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Davie, he will not have the luxury of fixing
things in the back shop. That doesn't happen at Notre Dame. And the
upcoming schedule _ games against Tennessee and Southern
California, as well as Boston College _ doesn't get a whole lot
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Right now things stink at Notre Dame. Nothing is going right,
either on the field or off it.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be fixed? Of course. But it can not be fixed quickly and
who knows, maybe Davie is not the man to do it.
</P>
<P>
   But as we have seen throughout the years, Notre Dame has a
presence that is stronger than any one coach. The school will
survive and the football program will be back among the elite,
probably sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   But right now things are as bad as they have ever been under the
Golden Dome.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seminole solution
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much talk has been centered around Miami and its possible
defection to the Atlantic Coast Conference. Here's a solution for
the Big East: Instead of fighting off a raid on one of your teams,
go after someone else's. Go after the ACC and Florida State. It
would create a powerful East Coast presence in football from New
England to Florida. It would add another major presence in Florida
and it would also help the basketball conference far more than the
inclusion of Virginia Tech as the 14th member.
</P>
<P>
   For Florida State, the benefits are also obvious. It would break
clear of the Carolina-axis that has controlled the ACC for years,
and create a league rivalry between Miami and Florida State that
would equal Michigan-Ohio State, Florida-Tennessee, or any other
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the Huskies
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The issue of University of Connecticut football moving up to 1-A
and joining the Big East is clearly in the hands of the Huskies.
The Big East has not given school officials any timetable other
than this: have a 1-A quality stadium ready for the 2003 season and
the plans needed to move the Huskies into the conference will be
implemented quickly . . . Each year, the Southeastern Conference is
tops in attendance. Last year SEC teams filled 99.9 percent of
their capacity for the entire season. How do you top that? This
year, SEC teams have been playing to 102.5 percent capacity . . .
Scheduling note: Don't play Florida in September. In the 1990s, the
Gators are 31-3, which should increase to 32-3 with an expected win
over Kentucky Saturday . . . If defense wins games, what happened
to Syracuse, which lost to Michigan last week despite holding the
Wolverines to three third-down conversions? . . . Good omen for
Penn State? In beating Arizona and Miami, the Nittany Lions have
beaten two Top 10 teams. The last time that happened was in 1986
when they beat Alabama and Miami (in the Fiesta Bowl) to win the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in a Rut
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider the plight of Rutgers fans. In three-plus years under
Terry Shea, the Scarlet Knights are 7-28. The wins have come
against Villanova, Richmond, Army, Navy, Temple (twice), and
Pittsburgh. Rutgers is 0-2 (Texas and California) this season and
has not held a lead. Since 1963, Rutgers has started 0-3 only once
(1997, in Shea's first season). The school has not had a winning
season since 1992 (7-4) . . . Coaches' poll note: Miami is 13th
this week, while Ohio State is No. 10. Hmmm. Doesn't make sense
since Miami beat the Buckeyes, 23-12, in the Kickoff Classic and
Miami's only loss was in the last minute against unbeaten Penn
State . . . Who would have predicted Illinois-Michigan State as a
battle of two unbeaten teams?

GOVERNMENT OF LAWYERS, FOR LAWYERS AND BY LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If I didn't hate cigarettes so much, if I didn't
hate tobacco companies so much and if I didn't hate having to stand
in front of buildings with slouching reprobates, I'd take up
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   It's the least a patriotic Californian can do to support early
childhood education, the beneficiary of the state's new
50-cent-a-pack tax. With cigarette taxes way up this year,
cigarettes sales have dropped almost 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone quits smoking, a lot of kids are going to lose out
on preschool.
</P>
<P>
   We voters in California put ourselves in that bind by passing
Proposition 10 last year, so we can't complain. We just have to
smoke, for the children.
</P>
<P>
   California also is about to start receiving $1 billion a year
from the tobacco companies' $206 billion settlement of a lawsuit
against them brought by 46 states. Some legislators say the tobacco
money should be spent only on health programs, while Gov. Gray
Davis wants the money to go for general state spending.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where the cigarette industry gets that kind of
money. But I do know I'm not taking up smoking to support the
Department of Motor Vehicles, the California Department of
Transportation and upgrades of the crummy state computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Now I need to take a drag just to consider the implications of
the latest action by the fourth branch of government, the lawsuit
branch.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has filed a lawsuit against the tobacco
companies to recover billions of dollars spent over the years by
the Veterans Administration, Medicare and other federal programs
treating those with smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The government is suing the entire tobacco industry under the
organized crime statute, the first time in history an entire
industry with stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange has been
considered a gang of racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   That's one way to look at those in the business of making money
from addiction and death. But what does that make the federal
government? The feds, aware of the hazards of tobacco, have been
giving subsidies and taking payoffs in the form of taxes from the
tobacco mob for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the federal government a more powerful mob.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the tobacco companies called the federal government
hypocritical. The tobacco moguls should be able to afford better
lawyers than that. You might as well call a cat furry.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy is as much a part of government as desks and memos.
</P>
<P>
   What's new here is that if the government considers an activity
dangerous or immoral, it no longer has the courage to outlaw it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the government resorts to an extremely cruel but
all-too-usual punishment in America: It sues.
</P>
<P>
   Ours is now a government of the lawyers, by the lawyers and for
the lawyers _ and not just the usual lawyers, but ambulance
chasers.
</P>
<P>
   The symbol of our way of life isn't the Statue of Liberty
holding a torch, but a woman holding a cup of hot McDonald's
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation by litigation is happening at all levels of
government. State attorneys general scored big with that suit
against tobacco companies. Cities are suing gun makers to recover
medical costs of gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Congress and state legislatures have an innate
inability to act against industries that make big campaign
contributions and have powerful lobbies or constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer and gunshot wounds are expensive. So why not sue?
</P>
<P>
   First, it's just plain gutless. It's a way of saying an industry
is evil, and we're going to take as much of its dirty money as
possible. But we won't outlaw it.
</P>
<P>
   Civil suits have easier burdens of proof, too. To win a civil
suit against a tobacco company, the government doesn't have to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt they are a bunch of racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   The government just needs a preponderance of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the government is trying to drive an industry out of
business without convicting it of a crime or taking a vote, and
that just seems wrong, no matter how evil the industry might be.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the government lawsuits against the tobacco industry
seem to be taxation with too much representation. The lawsuits
provide employment to hundreds of lawyers, and taxpayers are paying
for half of them. If you're a taxpayer and you smoke, you're paying
for all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I won't take up smoking after all. It leaves a bad taste
in my mouth.
</P>

ROLE PLAYING HAS SLADE DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Let's play name association. OK, Chris
Slade? Is he: a) an actor in an adventure series; b) a comedian on
a late-night talk show; c) a pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is c, a pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be confusion regarding Slade's role. The average
Patriots fan thinks Slade should be chasing the quarterback all the
time, and when he's not, the usual response is, ``Geez, when is
Slade is going to show up?''
</P>
<P>
   All of which infuriates the Patriots' senior linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm known for is getting to the quarterback and that's
how people identify me,'' Slade said. ``And people wonder sometimes
`why isn't he getting to the quarterback,' but if you don't know
what I'm doing every single assignment, on every play, then you
can't criticize me.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop fans from doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know on certain downs that I'm supposed to cover the
backs, on certain downs I'm supposed to cover the tight end, on
certain downs I'm supposed to watch for the reverse, on certain
downs I'm supposed to drop back in coverage, if you can look at my
game and evaluate 65 plays, and you can tell specifically what I'm
doing and you can see he didn't do that or didn't do this, then you
can criticize me,'' Slade said. ``A lot of people just don't
understand what my responsibilities are. If you don't know what I'm
supposed to be doing on every play then you have no room to talk.
They just look at the numbers and say, `well, he's not doing
anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is Patriots fans got used to seeing Slade as a pass
rusher under Bill Parcells. Under Parcells, Slade was platooned
with Dwayne Sabb, with Sabb playing running downs and Slade on
passing downs. After Parcells left, one of Pete Carroll's first
duties as coach was to announce Slade's signing a lucrative
five-year contract, telling one and all that he thought Slade was a
full-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blitz me on occasions on first and second down depending
on the system we're facing,'' said Slade. ``I always like to rush
the passer. When you're a pass rusher, and when you don't get to
rush as much as you'd like, you're never happy about it. But we
have a system, a defensive scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a linebacker. I'm not a defensive end. I have to pick my
spots and the coaches determine that. I don't get to rush on every
down. I have to go back in coverage, cover tight ends and backs. I
have to play the run. That's just the way it is. We don't play in a
conventional 3-4 where the outside linebackers are feature guys. I
have to do a lot of compensating for a lot of coverage stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   After two games, Slade feels he's done a good job. Carroll
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris has been strong,'' said Carroll. ``He's more effective
now on his rushes than he was last year because he's healthy and
he's able to run. He's rushing at times in early downs and during
the course of a season he'll get 500-600 rushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade questions whether he'll get that many, but he feels he
understands what the coaches expect from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more comfortable in the system and the scheme,'' he
said. ``I think I have a thorough understanding of what we're
trying to do and accomplish. My health is good. I think I'm playing
good football right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year because of the injuries it got me out of what I do
best a little bit. It wasn't a good year for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade missed only one game but played most of the season with a
bad knee and bad ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' he said. ``I thrive on being a big-play player
and I want to be out there all the time, but injuries are part of
the game. I had to deal with it the best I could and get it taken
care of in the offseason. I couldn't cut the way I wanted, I
couldn't push off, I couldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was my knee, then it was my ankle. I was pretty much
limited in what I could do. After I hurt my ankle in the
Indianapolis game, the next week we played Atlanta, and I shouldn't
have been playing. The next week we played Buffalo and I didn't
play. After that, I wasn't myself. I couldn't run.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade had offseason surgery on his knee, rehabbed it, and took
part in strength coach Johnny Parker's conditioning program. He's
had to adjust to playing with a young linebacking group, with
rookie Andy Katzenmoyer in the middle and fourth-year man Tedy
Bruschi on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katz has stepped in and done a good job. He hasn't hurt us a
bit,'' Slade said. ``Bruschi is playing great. I don't think we've
had a falloff at that position at all. Obviously, with Ted in
there, you have the freedom to do more, but Andy has played well.
I've been asked to make a few more calls and adjustments than I
normally would, but hey, I'm the oldest linebacker out there. I
should be expected to do that stuff and do it well.''
</P>
<P>
   After two games, Slade has 8 tackles, 1 interception, 2 passes
defensed, and no sacks. He had four sacks last year and nine in his
Pro Bowl season of 1997. He has 42 1/2 sacks in six years, with 32
1/2 of them at home, a phenomenon he can't explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was my worst year, but as far as being on top of
everything, being sharp with my assignments, so far this year I'm
at my best,'' he said. ``To me, it's more important than always
having 10-12 tackles and busting a bunch of assignments or getting
a bunch of sacks. I'm on my stuff this year and to me that's a sign
of a solid player.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade also poked a little fun at the media and said, ``You guys
thought we'd be 0-2 or 1-1 at best. That's how much you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the answer to the name association should be: b, a
comedian on a late-night talk show.

NEW CHARITY MAKES IT EASY FOR INTERNET USERS TO BOOST GIVING

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Breen, a 42-year-old computer programmer from Bloomington,
Ind., wanted to do something to improve the lot of children in
Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   And though he had never been on the Internet, he believed it was
a natural launching pad to help end world hunger and get others
involved, too.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The Hunger Site, a Web-based company that combines
corporate sponsorship and the ever-increasing popularity of the
Internet to feed the needy.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of creating his three-month-old Web site, Breen's
ingenuity has sparked what could be the latest trend in charitable
contributions, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based companies that parlay consumer purchases into
charitible donations have grown steadily in popularity, according
to marketing specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Most such companies donate a portion of the profit they make
through on-line sales directly to charity, said Carol Cone, chief
executive officer of Cone Inc., a Boston-based marketing and
communications firm that has tracked charitable giving on the Web
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Breen's site differs in that it isn't linked to a business
and requires no payments from consumers. Corporations pay to have
their name and products advertised. In exchange, that revenue is
used to pay for small servings of food distributed through the
United Nations World Food Program to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Clapp-Buffington, an over-the-counter pharmaceuticals
company based in Canton, has been a sponsor of The Hunger Site
since July. In the last two months, other firms have signed up,
including proflowers.com and greatergood.com.
</P>
<P>
   A Web surfer need only navigate to thehungersite.com and click a
button marked ``donate free food.'' The commitment ends there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a highly innovative site,'' Cone said. ``I'd give him an
A, A(plus) for creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anything like it,'' she said. ``I think
it's interesting that it came from an individual,'' rather than a
large corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth J. Gore, vice president of sales and marketing for Otis
Clapp-Buffington, said his company chose to participate in Breen's
site because the concept seemed a cutting-edge way to tap into a
huge consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (number of) hits he gets on the Web is frightening,'' Gore
said with a laugh. ``I just wonder if (those) people work.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone teamed with Roper Starch Worldwide, a New York-based
research firm, to do a five-year analysis of cause-related
marketing. Their 1999 report affirms that companies like Otis
Clapp-Buffington do well to associate themselves with a high-tech
charitable effort.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report:
</P>
<P>
   --A majority of Americans say they are more likely to trust
companies aligned with a social issue.
</P>
<P>
   --Eight in ten said they carry a more positive image of
companies that support a cause they care about.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly two-thirds of all US consumers report they would be
likely to switch from one brand or retailer to another associated
with a good cause, when price and quality are equal.
</P>
<P>
   But there can be problems with such a system of donations, and
the biggest is accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, donors have not been able to verify that the
money they gave had actually been received by the charities, Cone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that producers of such Web sites should be
required to tell consumers that donations have as much to do with
publicity for the sponsors as with charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's hard for a lot of people to grasp is that
doing good has now become a form of public relations,'' said
William P. Massey, president of the National Charities Information
Bureau, a New York-based company that reviews and evaluates
national charities.
</P>
<P>
   In its list of frequently asked questions, thehungersite.com
states: ``Our sponsors pay for the donations as a form of public
relations advertising. For them, it is analogous to funding shows
on public television or making corporate donations to other worthy
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, cyber-giving sites ``are in the business of
cause-related marketing,'' Massey said. ``It's not the same as
philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   If a company made a charitable donation, ``it would mean that
that money came out of that company's philanthropic budget,'' he
said. In cyber-giving, the money for the ad ``is coming out of
their marketing department,'' he said. ``That is a payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it count less to the charity? No. But my point is to call
it what it is. Let's not confuse people.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the concept is a charity portal that would let
Web users contribute to one of several charities.
</P>
<P>
   While Cone believes that thehungersite.com is unlikely to be
duplicated in large numbers, she does see more public-private
partnerships blossoming on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As consumers become more comfortable about credit cards
online, it should grow and decrease administrative costs,'' she
said. ``It will invite a whole new level of giver, a younger
giver.''

   TOKYO _ A Japanese bank recently chose an unusual way to try to
reinvigorate one of its ailing branches. It asked McDonald's to
move in. Now the fast food restaurant and the Bank of Yokohama
share space in the city of Yokosuka, offering customers a
two-for-one service of yen and Big Macs.
</P>
<P>
   It's only an experiment, but other banks and restaurants are
eyeing the McBank venture with interest. In a country whose banks
have captained the helm of economic disaster, it's a happy sign of
innovation and rejuvenation. And it is a signal, however small,
that Japan, mired for so long in recession, may have found the will
to pull itself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, the economy was comatose, almost braindead. Now it
has begun to move, although it is not yet ready to run a
marathon,'' said Ron Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz
Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A whiff of optimism is in the air, as analysts and economists
predict that Japan's economy may finally have bottomed out and may
be headed for a sustainable recovery. Much to the surprise of
forecasters, the economy posted its second consecutive quarter of
growth, following five straight quarters of contraction.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of improvement are visible across a wide spectrum: in
a revitalized banking system and deregulating financial markets; in
rising industrial production and housing starts; in the cramped
offices of Internet start-up companies; in Tokyo's tony Ginza
neighborhood, where young women tuck newly purchased Louis Vuitton
and Prada bags under their arms. And signs of recovery are found
amid the bustle of the Tokyo stock exchange, where investors have
pushed the benchmark Nikkei index up almost 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recovery comes with many caveats. It has a long way
to go. Unemployment is at a postwar high of 4.9 percent, and many
Japanese are still faced with declining wages. ``If I work
overtime, I'm not paid extra. And my bonus has been cut,'' bemoaned
Isao Kuroawa, 33, an auto parts company employee.
</P>
<P>
   Most worrisome is that the yen is dangerously strong, which
makes Japanese exports very expensive. If the yen doesn't come down
soon, the recovery could collapse.
</P>
<P>
   What's important long term, perhaps, is whether Japan has cured
itself of its fundamental weaknesses. Nearly a decade of economic
turmoil has certainly taught Japan Inc. some valuable lessons,
economists say. But while many companies have restructured and the
government has embarked on liberalization efforts, the work is far
from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing a cyclical rebound, but what's not clear is
whether Japan is really experiencing a structural rebound, too,''
said Bevacqua.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to envision Japan ever returning to the reckless
ways of the 1980s and early 1990s, the so-called bubble years.
Then, real estate values skyrocketed, debt piled up, businessmen
treated clients to thousand dollar evenings at hostess bars, and
salarymen were secure in their jobs for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The lean years have given Japan companies, in some significant
ways, a new perspective. Companies in many industries _ from
banking to insurance to shipbuilding _ are cutting costs, closing
down unprofitable businesses, and looking for new opportunities in
their core businesses instead of diversifying wildly. Many
corporations that once sniffed their noses at keeping shareholders
happy have changed their ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are paying more attention to making profits and
reordering priorities to pay more attention to shareholders,'' said
Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Barings in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger is not always better is another lesson Japanese companies
are learning. Instead of grabbing for market share at all costs,
many are consolidating. One example is Sumitomo Metal Industries,
one of Japan's largest steel makers, which had been slow to stem
its ballooning losses. Now, the company has announced it will scrap
several facilities, sell off two furnaces, and cut its staff by
5,000. Analysts expect the rest of the industry to follow
Sumitomo's lead.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, which a year ago almost caused a financial
meltdown, also appears to be getting its act together. Analysts are
applauding the impending marriage of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji
Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan, whose combined assets will
top $1 trillion. The merger would create the world's largest bank.
It would also streamline operations.
</P>
<P>
   The banks plan to reduce overlapping investment in technology,
close 150 branches, and phase out 6,000 jobs in five years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from last year, when the Long Term Credit Bank of
Japan filed for bankruptcy and nearly took the rest of the banking
industry with it. ``Consumers were panicked. Now with the financial
industry more secure, things are getting a bit back to normal,''
said Brian Rose, senior economist at Warburg Dillon Read. Consumer
spending rose a surprising 0.8 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   There's little sign of recession on the streets of Akihabara,
Tokyo's neon-lit electronics district, where young and old, men and
women, jostle to purchase PCs, laptops, software, CD-ROMs, anything
that hooks them up to the information age. Shipments of PCs rose a
remarkable 38 percent in the second quarter over a year earlier.
Long considered laggards in the wired age, the Japanese are logging
on to e-mail and the Internet in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The auto sector is also getting a boost, led by a boom in sales
of mini-vehicles, tiny doll-like cars that cost far less than the
average four-door sedan. Toyota has hired 1,300 short-term workers
to fill expected demand for a new small car, twice as many as it
had planned. In August, mini-vehicle sales rose for an 11th
consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers and businesses alike, there's a sense in Japan of
disaster averted and possibility restored. Small and mid-sized
businesses are expanding, helped by tax incentives and burgeoning
industries. That's a far cry from last year, when they were seized
by fears of bankruptcy until the government stepped in with a loan
guarantee program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, small businesses have something else to look forward to:
two over-the-counter stock markets are getting ready to launch,
including a Japanese version of Nasdaq. They should inject much
needed capital into fledgling businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges will also be a boon to would-be entrepreneurs, a
growing crop of Japanese who have lost their faith in large
corporations and lifetime employment.
</P>
<P>
   Noriko Hiramatsu, 38, who runs a Web design business from her
house and is teaching others how to do the same, says the recession
is what drove her to become an entrepreneur. ``Big companies don't
have the value they used to. I'd rather depend on myself,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, the government is encouraging
start-ups with loan guarantees and tax breaks. Office buildings are
being divided, with tiny one-room offices created to cater to
fledgling businesses. ``There's a lot of activity on that front.
People underestimate just how entrepreneurial the Japanese can
be,'' said economist Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The growing sense of optimism in Japan is shared by foreign
investors. Many foreign institutions have increased the weight of
Japanese shares in their portfolios. They've been buying more
shares of Japanese stock than they've been selling for 30 out of
the last 33 weeks. It's this buying that's helped fuel the surge in
the Japanese stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists credit the government's nearly $400 billion
worth of stimulus measures for pulling Japan out of the doldrums.
The government plans to move ahead with another $50 billion to $100
billion in a supplementary budget to ensure the economy does not
falter this year. ``Unless the economy is lifted by a two-stage
rocket of consumption and capital investment, the government will
have to continue to take supportive measures,'' Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa recently told the Nikkei Keizai Shimbun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   That of course, raises questions about how long the Japanese
government can afford to prop up the economy. Its debt is already
the highest of any industrialized nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for many Japanese, recovery will take a long time to
trickle down. And the pain is likely to get worse before it gets
better. Small businesses that can't hack the more competitive
environment will get squeezed out. Economists forecast a wider gap
between rich and poor in this normally middle-class-heavy society.
Continued corporate restructuring is sure to keep unemployment up
and wages down.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still widespread fear that the economic recovery
could falter or stagnate. For example, it'll be hard for consumer
spending to pick up dramatically when wages are still falling.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has experienced false starts before. In 1997, the
recession appeared to be ending. But then the government raised the
sales from tax 3 percent to 5 percent, and the recovery froze in
its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The strong yen, a sign of rising investor confidence in the
country's resurgence, is Japan's biggest fear. At its highest level
against the dollar in nearly four years, the yen threatens to make
Japanese exports unaffordable. The Ministry of Finance and the Bank
of Japan are trying to find ways to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   It's all rather ironic: the very symbol of Japan's strengthening
economy could be the very thing that pulls it back down.

HARVARD SUFFERS NET LOSS, DESPITE ALL THE HOOPLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's quite amusing to read about Harvard administrators'
visionary plans to market their ``brand'' on the World Wide Web,
given that the university has proved to be the Rip Van Winkle of
on-line technology. Like most universities, Harvard uses its main
Web address, harvard.edu, primarily for informational purposes. The
potentially lucrative Web address harvard.com was snapped up six
years ago by Frank Kramer, owner of the Harvard Book Store in
Cambridge, at the suggestion of Internet pioneer Rob Raisch. (It
was just around that time that a 27-year-old Stanford Business
School grad nailed down boston.com _ originally trademarked by Au
Bon Pain as a defensive maneuver against Boston Chicken _ for the
Globe.) Kramer does a fair amount of business off the site, and has
good relations with Harvard, which also happens to be his landlord.
He hasn't received any formal overtures about selling. ``The
address has great potential,'' Kramer says. ``What the university
might want to do with it I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Harvard Business School, which purports to be conversant
with new technologies, let the Web addresses hbs.com fall into the
hands of a London-based consulting firm that has never been willing
to surrender it. An enterprising B-school grad, Laurence McKinney,
class of '69, locked up the addresses harvardbusiness.com,
harvardbusinessschool.com and hbsgrad.com several years ago, and is
milking them for all they are worth. McKinney has just launched a
private placement to raise $1.5 million for his First Website
Corporation, which plans to cash in on the B-school grads' penchant
for networking, literal and figurative. He already operates
hbsgrad.com, and has other configurations in mind. His angle?
``These sites target the most affluent affinity group in the
world.''

   What Editors Do
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Editors are generally maligned by writers, and properly so. If
editors had any talent, they'd be writing, as anyone can figure
out. But just to get a hint of what editors do, you might want to
visit the Web site blairjackson.com, belonging to Jerry Garcia's
biographer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's book, ``Garcia: An American Life,'' has just been
published by Viking, to mostly favorable reviews. But, as Jackson
explains, the publisher made him cut 400 manuscript pages from his
original submission, because Viking planned to publish a book
``only'' 512 pages long. As a public service, Jackson has posted
practically all of the deleted pages on his Web site, so you can
read text like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of bad trips at Altamont,'' Wynans says.
``But at the same time, it was one of those `couldn't-get-high'
days for a lot of people; that's the summation for me. It was
difficult to get high, because it was like you were in a cosmic
sink. A sink in the broadest meaning of the word is the lowest
spot, to which all the waste or whatever goes. At a certain point
you're in a psychic sink because that's where the low energy has
gravitated.
</P>
<P>
   `It just wasn't a `lift-off' kind of event. I was looking for
that. I was going through the crowd photographing everywhere and it
was obvious that most people weren't getting off. My friend James
said he was down front and he took every drug that came by him _
anything that anybody handed him _ and he didn't get high. It was
like a black hole _ everything that went into it disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess those Viking editors are earning their pay after all.

   Many readers tried to win the Fedex-ed chicken sandwich offered

your many creative suggestions. The readers who suggested Car and
Driver or Road &AMP; Track came the closest _ but why didn't someone
mention the superb bicycyling tabloid, Velo News? The correct
answer does concern locomotion: Runner's World. I don't really run,
but I love the nutrition tips (Eat fish! No _ Eat chocolate!),
which veer widely from month to month, depending on the dietary
research du jour.

PAINTING PLASTER? NO PRIMER NEEDED AS A GENERAL RULE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 26, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. All my walls and ceilings look great, made of Blueboard
(plasterboard) skimcoated with plaster. I recall you writing that a
primer was not needed when plaster is painted. Is this so? I am
painting my rooms _ walls and ceilings _ and I want to do the best
job possible.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTOPHER DAVIES, Bridgewater, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is so. As a rule, plastered surfaces do not need priming
or applying an enamel undercoater. Two coats of a latex ceiling
paint or latex wall paint are all that is needed. Be sure they are
thin coats. The handyman feels strongly that this is so, because
when his opinion on the subject is published or aired, he gets no
brickbats or claims that he is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, you can continue painting walls and ceilings,
without priming.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to prime the walls, it will do no harm and
may even do some good. If you do prime the walls, I suggest you use
a latex enamel undercoater, also called primer-sealer.
</P>
<P>
   For virtually every other surface _ bare wood or painted wood,
painted metal, even bare metal _ you need a primer, also called a
latex enamel undercoater, before finish painting. Undercoaters were
developed to go over shiny surfaces without sanding, and work very
well on all surfaces. They are particularly useful in preventing
chipping of paint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put up faced insulation (fiberglass faced with paper) with
the paper showing in the room. A few wayward punctures from a
back-pocket screwdriver created holes and tore the paper. Can I
leave them when I put up plasterboard as a wall finish?
</P>
<P>
   KEITH BUDAY, Holliston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure, but it will make the paper backing (vapor barrier)
useless. A vapor barrier with holes is no longer a vapor barrier.
So, before putting up the wall finish, tape those holes and tears
with duct tape or clear sealing tape of any kind; the clear stuff
that makes a horrendous noise when you take it off the roll is
best. If you have a lot of holes and tears, you can staple
polyethylene plastic on the entire wall; while this is an extra
vapor barrier, it will cover all those holes very well, and the
wall finish will press it against the paper backing, creating, in
effect, one vapor barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The point of a vapor barrier is to stop the loss of air and heat
from the house, and to do that, it must be in one piece. Yes, nails
or screws used to hold the plasterboard do penetrate the vapor
barrier, but it cannot be helped; engineers have not figured out a
punctureless fastening system.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The concrete slab floor of my new addition (12 by 16 feet)
was poured 1/4 to 1/2 inch lower then the house floor. Is there a
way to slope that floor so that it will look level? I can't put a
threshold over the lip because the opening to the addition is as
wide as the addition itself.
</P>
<P>
   MITTIE JACKSON, Brockton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Trying to slope the floor is impossible to do invisibly; you
would see it for an eternity, and it would bug you. What bugs me is
how the men who poured and smoothed the concrete could miss the
existing floor by that much.
</P>
<P>
   If there were a vapor barrier of plastic sheeting under the
newly-laid concrete, then you could glue 1/4-inch plywood to the
new floor, evening out the difference. This might not work because,
as you say, the lip varies from 1/4 to 1/2 inch. If there is no
vapor barrier under the slab, this cannot be done.
</P>
<P>
   So, the only cure is to put a bonding agent on the new floor,
then a skimcoat of mortar to even everything out.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it is not quite the only cure; getting back to the
threshold, you could do this, if you don't mind a threshold of
sorts covering the entire opening to the addition. You could buy an
oak plank 12 long and bevel the edges to make a threshold-type
board. Glue this board on the high or low edge of the floor with an
adhesive caulk. At least this is a sight easier and less expensive
than pouring a new floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The plaster in one of the rooms of my 100-plus-year-old house
has a crack going from mantel to ceiling, and is bulging along the
crack. I cannot push the bulge back into position; I think I tried.
How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   PEGGY MURDOCK, Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you cannot push the plaster back into position, you have
to cut out the bulging plaster, exposing the wood lath underneath.
Make sure the lath is still attached to the studs. Nail or screw on
a plasterboard patch. You can't nail into the lath; it is too
bouncy. You can nail into studs, but you must screw into lath,
predrilling pilot holes.
</P>
<P>
   Then fill the joints with joint compound, smooth off and apply
paper tape, smooth joint compound over the tape, let dry, and sand
smooth. Repeat the last three steps twice more. No kidding;
anything less will show.
</P>
<P>

 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The hallway outside Dr. Koichiro Fujita's office at
Tokyo Medical and Dental University is dim and lined with dusty
wooden cabinets, each cluttered with glass jars holding all forms
of parasites, worms, bacteria, and germs, like the remains of some
ghastly experiment. The stench of formaldehyde makes it difficult
to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita sees nothing wrong with the place. Rather, it is the
perfect setting from which to preach his gospel: A little mess is a
good thing. Cleanliness is not just overrated, it's even unhealthy,
says the parasitologist, who might better be called Japan's Dr.
Dirt. Being too clean, he says, weakens the body and makes it
susceptible to certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point that nasty creatures like parasites and worms
have health value, Fujita has swallowed a few tapeworms, letting
them live in his body for up to a year. He keeps the remains of one
in a jar in his office as a memento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much to our detriment, the Japanese are obsessed with
cleanliness,'' said Fujita, who has authored nearly a dozen books
on the subject. His latest, ``Cleanliness is a Sickness,'' has sold
30,000 copies, promoting the belief that too much attention to
hygiene can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita's message is especially striking in a country where
keeping clean often seems like an act of worship. Shoes are not
worn in the house, garbage is neatly packed and piled, taxi drivers
wear white gloves, chopsticks are tossed out after one use, public
toilets are flushed by infrared sensors. Perhaps most telling is
that the Japanese word for clean, kirei, is also the word for
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, anti-bacterial products have littered the
Japanese landscape. Proclamations of kokin (anti-bacterial) and
boshu (anti-smell) poke out from labels of hundreds of items:
blankets, sheets, pantyhouse, underwear, plastic cups, detergents,
slippers, pens, knives, toothbrushes, scissors, sponges, pots.
</P>
<P>
   For many Japanese, there's simply no virtue in untidiness. ``You
can't be too clean,'' said Ryuichi Kamizmi, a salesman. He is
puzzled by the notion that Japan is any different than any other
country in that regard. ``Aren't other countries as clean as we
are?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every item produced in Japan, says Fujita, is laced with
antibacterial chemicals. Only those products using particularly
strong anti-bacterial agents are labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita raps the coffee table in his cluttered _ but pleasant _
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said of the table, ``televisions, clothes,
everything. I went to a fishing store. Even the bait was
anti-bacterial.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is the problem with trying to ward off germs?
Asthma, dermatitis and allergies, for starters. Some of the pesky
bacteria Japanese manufacturers are zapping are actually beneficial
to the body, warding off other diseases, says Fujita.
</P>
<P>
   There has certainly been a rise in asthma, allergies and
dermatitis in developed countries, particularly Japan, in the past
20 years, which begs an explanation. In Japan, one-third of the
population has allergies and nearly half of all children under 9
suffer from dermatitis.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is this: that by killing off too much bacteria, the
body loses adequate stimulation of a protective immunity called
TH1. That drives to the fore TH2, a hyper immune response that
causes allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is considered especially acute among children, who
are so immunized these days that their bodies do not become
educated to infection.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of Fujita's theory suggests that TH2's job is to
fight things like parasitic infections and worms. With fewer of
those crawling around, TH2 doesn't have enough to occupy it, and
winds up functioning abnormally, causing asthma, allergies, and
other reactions.
</P>
<P>
   These theories, especially the former, are broadly accepted, or
at least examined, in the United States. A paper in support of the
subject was given at a conference earlier this year by the American
Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hypothesis is pretty well-accepted,'' said Dr. Leonard
Altman, a professor at the University of Washington who attended
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still a bit of controversy among the US medical
community. ``It's certainly a possibility that by cleaning up and
immunizing our environment too much, we may inadvertently be
preventing normal stimulus, but there's no hard data,'' said Dr.
Stephen Wasserman, chief of medicine at the University of
California at San Diego and past president of the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita's strong belief in the too-clean theory gets a much
colder reception in Japan. Although he is editor of the Japanese
Journal of Parasitology and a faculty member of the Tokyo Medical
and Dental University, his opinions can be quite unpopular,
especially with the Japanese medical community which views his
theories as traitorous. ``The Japan Allergic Association won't even
let me speak before them,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the association don't even want to speak about him.
``Everything he says is a lie,'' said Dr. Ko Okumura, director of
immunology at Juntendo University.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujita continues delivering his message, believing Japan's
health problems are getting broader. He points to a cholera
epidemic that swept the Indonesian resort island of Bali a few
years ago. Tourists were there from all over the world, but only
the Japanese _ about 200 of them _ got sick. Most of them were
younger people, which Fujita says is evidence that Japanese
protective immunities are growing weaker by the generation.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been a clean country for centuries. Going as far back
as the 1600s, the capital Edo _ modern day Tokyo _ recycled
garbage, including human waste. That gave much of the Japanese
population roundworms, but Fujita says the low level infestation
was helpful in preventing hyper-immunities. In the 1950s and '60s
roundworms were eradicated, as Japan indulged in a postwar penchant
for a modern, clean country. As the roundworms decreased, ailments
like asthma and allergies grew.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs that Japan's long recession is forcing the
country to shed some of its unsullied ways. Used clothing and
bookstores, long anathema here, have started to pop up. To attract
customers, though, their goods have to look practically new. At a
Tokyo store called Book Off, a machine shaves off the edges of the
pages of every book, making it seem practically untouched by human
hands.
</P>
<P>
   A few Japanese are buying Fujita's arguments, and his 12 books,
which have sold 300,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being too clean is abnormal. It's nice when things are a bit
messy. It seems natural,'' said Sadae Ishimura, a housewife
shopping at a Tokyo department store. She bought a blanket, passing
up the anti-bacterial ones whose labels carry a cartoon picture of
a germ with an X through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't go too far. It starts to affect interpersonal
relations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's something Fujita agrees with heartily. He believes that
Japan's cleanliness fetish is building a socially sanitary country
of intolerance and conformity. ``Japan, inhabited by a people who
promptly reject anything offensive or displeasing, has become a
thoroughly anti-bacterial society,'' Fujita wrote in a recent
magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   He's horrified by just how far Japan's cleanliness obsession has
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even OK to smell like a human being anymore,'' said
Fujita. Many Japanese have moved way beyond a slick of deodorant
under their arms. There is a popular drug on the market that
removes the odor from perspiration and feces. Also, toilets are
equipped with disinfectant sprays. And now the Japanese cosmetics
company Shiseido has launched a men's line of lotions and powders
designed to get rid of what Japanese call old man's smell.
</P>
<P>
   It is targeted at middle-aged and elderly men who, Shiseido
claims it has proven, develop an odd odor.
</P>
<P>
   Naoko Miura welcomes the products. The 23-year-old stewardess
says she doesn't like to touch a subway strap after a middle-aged
man has held it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smells and it doesn't seem clean,'' she said, crinkling her
nose.

<P>
   TOKYO _ A Japanese bank recently chose an unusual way to try to
reinvigorate one of its ailing branches. It asked McDonald's to
move in. Now the fast food restaurant and the Bank of Yokohama
share space in the city of Yokosuka, offering customers a
two-for-one service of yen and Big Macs.
</P>
<P>
   It's only an experiment, but other banks and restaurants are
eyeing the McBank venture with interest. In a country whose banks
have captained the helm of economic disaster, it's a happy sign of
innovation and rejuvenation. And it is a signal, however small,
that Japan, mired for so long in recession, may have found the will
to pull itself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, the economy was comatose, almost braindead. Now it
has begun to move, although it is not yet ready to run a
marathon,'' said Ron Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz
Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A whiff of optimism is in the air, as analysts and economists
predict that Japan's economy may finally have bottomed out and may
be headed for a sustainable recovery. Much to the surprise of
forecasters, the economy posted its second consecutive quarter of
growth, following five straight quarters of contraction.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of improvement are visible across a wide spectrum: in
a revitalized banking system and deregulating financial markets; in
rising industrial production and housing starts; in the cramped
offices of Internet start-up companies; in Tokyo's tony Ginza
neighborhood, where young women tuck newly purchased Louis Vuitton
and Prada bags under their arms. And signs of recovery are found
amid the bustle of the Tokyo stock exchange, where investors have
pushed the benchmark Nikkei index up almost 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recovery comes with many caveats. It has a long way
to go. Unemployment is at a postwar high of 4.9 percent, and many
Japanese are still faced with declining wages. ``If I work
overtime, I'm not paid extra. And my bonus has been cut,'' bemoaned
Isao Kuroawa, 33, an auto parts company employee.
</P>
<P>
   Most worrisome is that the yen is dangerously strong, which
makes Japanese exports very expensive. If the yen doesn't come down
soon, the recovery could collapse.
</P>
<P>
   What's important long term, perhaps, is whether Japan has cured
itself of its fundamental weaknesses. Nearly a decade of economic
turmoil has certainly taught Japan Inc. some valuable lessons,
economists say. But while many companies have restructured and the
government has embarked on liberalization efforts, the work is far
from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing a cyclical rebound, but what's not clear is
whether Japan is really experiencing a structural rebound, too,''
said Bevacqua.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to envision Japan ever returning to the reckless
ways of the 1980s and early 1990s, the so-called bubble years.
Then, real estate values skyrocketed, debt piled up, businessmen
treated clients to thousand dollar evenings at hostess bars, and
salarymen were secure in their jobs for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The lean years have given Japan companies, in some significant
ways, a new perspective. Companies in many industries _ from
banking to insurance to shipbuilding _ are cutting costs, closing
down unprofitable businesses, and looking for new opportunities in
their core businesses instead of diversifying wildly. Many
corporations that once sniffed their noses at keeping shareholders
happy have changed their ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are paying more attention to making profits and
reordering priorities to pay more attention to shareholders,'' said
Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Barings in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger is not always better is another lesson Japanese companies
are learning. Instead of grabbing for market share at all costs,
many are consolidating. One example is Sumitomo Metal Industries,
one of Japan's largest steel makers, which had been slow to stem
its ballooning losses. Now, the company has announced it will scrap
several facilities, sell off two furnaces, and cut its staff by
5,000. Analysts expect the rest of the industry to follow
Sumitomo's lead.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, which a year ago almost caused a financial
meltdown, also appears to be getting its act together. Analysts are
applauding the impending marriage of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji
Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan, whose combined assets will
top $1 trillion. The merger would create the world's largest bank.
It would also streamline operations.
</P>
<P>
   The banks plan to reduce overlapping investment in technology,
close 150 branches, and phase out 6,000 jobs in five years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from last year, when the Long Term Credit Bank of
Japan filed for bankruptcy and nearly took the rest of the banking
industry with it. ``Consumers were panicked. Now with the financial
industry more secure, things are getting a bit back to normal,''
said Brian Rose, senior economist at Warburg Dillon Read. Consumer
spending rose a surprising 0.8 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   There's little sign of recession on the streets of Akihabara,
Tokyo's neon-lit electronics district, where young and old, men and
women, jostle to purchase PCs, laptops, software, CD-ROMs, anything
that hooks them up to the information age. Shipments of PCs rose a
remarkable 38 percent in the second quarter over a year earlier.
Long considered laggards in the wired age, the Japanese are logging
on to e-mail and the Internet in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The auto sector is also getting a boost, led by a boom in sales
of mini-vehicles, tiny doll-like cars that cost far less than the
average four-door sedan. Toyota has hired 1,300 short-term workers
to fill expected demand for a new small car, twice as many as it
had planned. In August, mini-vehicle sales rose for an 11th
consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers and businesses alike, there's a sense in Japan of
disaster averted and possibility restored. Small and mid-sized
businesses are expanding, helped by tax incentives and burgeoning
industries. That's a far cry from last year, when they were seized
by fears of bankruptcy until the government stepped in with a loan
guarantee program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, small businesses have something else to look forward to:
two over-the-counter stock markets are getting ready to launch,
including a Japanese version of Nasdaq. They should inject much
needed capital into fledgling businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges will also be a boon to would-be entrepreneurs, a
growing crop of Japanese who have lost their faith in large
corporations and lifetime employment.
</P>
<P>
   Noriko Hiramatsu, 38, who runs a Web design business from her
house and is teaching others how to do the same, says the recession
is what drove her to become an entrepreneur. ``Big companies don't
have the value they used to. I'd rather depend on myself,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, the government is encouraging
start-ups with loan guarantees and tax breaks. Office buildings are
being divided, with tiny one-room offices created to cater to
fledgling businesses. ``There's a lot of activity on that front.
People underestimate just how entrepreneurial the Japanese can
be,'' said economist Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The growing sense of optimism in Japan is shared by foreign
investors. Many foreign institutions have increased the weight of
Japanese shares in their portfolios. They've been buying more
shares of Japanese stock than they've been selling for 30 out of
the last 33 weeks. It's this buying that's helped fuel the surge in
the Japanese stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists credit the government's nearly $400 billion
worth of stimulus measures for pulling Japan out of the doldrums.
The government plans to move ahead with another $50 billion to $100
billion in a supplementary budget to ensure the economy does not
falter this year. ``Unless the economy is lifted by a two-stage
rocket of consumption and capital investment, the government will
have to continue to take supportive measures,'' Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa recently told the Nikkei Keizai Shimbun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   That of course, raises questions about how long the Japanese
government can afford to prop up the economy. Its debt is already
the highest of any industrialized nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for many Japanese, recovery will take a long time to
trickle down. And the pain is likely to get worse before it gets
better. Small businesses that can't hack the more competitive
environment will get squeezed out. Economists forecast a wider gap
between rich and poor in this normally middle-class-heavy society.
Continued corporate restructuring is sure to keep unemployment up
and wages down.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still widespread fear that the economic recovery
could falter or stagnate. For example, it'll be hard for consumer
spending to pick up dramatically when wages are still falling.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has experienced false starts before. In 1997, the
recession appeared to be ending. But then the government raised the
sales from tax 3 percent to 5 percent, and the recovery froze in
its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The strong yen, a sign of rising investor confidence in the
country's resurgence, is Japan's biggest fear. At its highest level
against the dollar in nearly four years, the yen threatens to make
Japanese exports unaffordable. The Ministry of Finance and the Bank
of Japan are trying to find ways to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   It's all rather ironic: the very symbol of Japan's strengthening
economy could be the very thing that pulls it back down.

JUDD SINGULAR IN `DOUBLE JEOPARDY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DOUBLE JEOPARDY 
Directed by: Bruce Beresford 
Screenplay by: David Weisberg &AMP; Douglas Cook 
Starring: Tommy Lee Jones, Ashley Judd, Bruce Greenwood, Annabeth
Gish, Roma Maffia, Davenia McFadden 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: R (language, a scene of sexuality and some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' reverses the usual revenge thriller formula
by having a woman go after a conniving husband who faked his own
murder, assumed a new identity to get out from under financial
reverses, and took off with their young son, but not before framing
her for his supposed murder.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicts her and she does six years in a conveniently
unthreatening prison before getting out on parole with murder in
her heart. This means that for once a woman gets to carry a violent
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   The producers' instincts were right in hitching their film to
Ashley Judd. She's clever and tenacious, and she's the only one
onscreen who appears to be feeling anything resembling an emotion.
She also has what amounts to a license to kill.
</P>
<P>
   As a prison lawyer explains, under the principle of double
jeopardy you can't be tried twice for the same crime. The fact that
she has been convicted and has served a prison term for murdering
her husband means that she's now free to really kill him and walk
free. The problem the film sets itself is how to strike a balance
between delivering the bullet-riddled payoff it promises while
keeping Judd's wronged wife and mother sympathetic. Bruce
Beresford's direction keeps the screen reasonably free of genre and
visual cliches, but it would have been easier if she didn't seem
the only three-dimensional character in this otherwise pretty
lukewarm outing that mostly just bops from plot point to plot
point.
</P>
<P>
   As her parole officer, Tommy Lee Jones presumably was expected
to replicate the bulldog tenacity of his US Marshal chasing
Harrison Ford in ``The Fugitive.'' But as a busted lawyer who has
suffered a few reverses of his own, and is climbing back up the
ladder, he's subdued to the point of seeming something of a
recessive presence, partly because he's supposed to at some level
sympathize with Judd's character after she breaks parole and runs
off to track her cheating hubby and get her son back.
</P>
<P>
   The film also misses a key opportunity by making Bruce
Greenwood's sleazy husband a washout, without the personality one
hopes for in a bad guy who's supposed to supply entertainment
value, too.
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying that Judd is pretty much on her
own _ an assignment she mostly can handle with aplomb. She's in
terrific shape, and easily measures up to the athletic demands put
on her fleeing character who's able to stay just a step ahead of
Jones's pursuer. He, in turn, is motivated by the threat of losing
his job for letting her get away.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges are pretty perfunctory in this rather too
unsurprisingly linear exercise as it proceeds from Puget Sound to a
Colorado mountain town to New Orleans. Most of the fun lies in
watching Judd connect the dots, or trick someone else into doing it
for her on this or that computer, as she tracks her nasty scamster
husband down to his latest cushy berth, an elegant little New
Orleans hotel. Judd does her job. She persuades us she's
emotionally reachable, yet she's very much in charge and is
altogether self-empowered. The trouble is that she's got nobody her
own size and weight, dramatically speaking, to slug it out with.

VAMP CAMP TAKES ON CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SNOOPS 
Starring: Gina Gershon, Paula Marshall, Danny Nucci 
On: ABC, Monday at 12:30 a.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their distinctive ways, ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal''
transform the big ethical issues of our time into nothing more and
nothing less than pop culture. Issue-tainment is business as usual
in the David E. Kelley cosmos, with euthanasia, Internet romance,
and maybe the amorality of our entire legal system taking on the
identity of a few great plot twists. Yes, ``Ally McBeal'' is a
carnival of a show, with its pet frogs and dancing babies, but when
Nelle delivered her heartfelt apology for job discrimination
against women with children, you couldn't say the show wasn't
trying to stir debate.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, this review is not about those Kelley series, both of
which have won him a mantelful of Emmys. It's about the new
hourlong show that the writer-producer has created with his nifty
zeitgiest machine turned off. Called ``Snoops,'' it's a stylized
crime romp that is solidly built to be fluffy and kicky and
tongue-in-cheek. It's not as original as ``Ally McBeal'' or ``The
Practice,'' but it gives the prime-time spoof a good run for its
money. And that's not a bad thing, when it's done with as much
casting savvy and polish as it is here. ``Snoops'' premieres Sunday
night at 9 on Ch. 5.
</P>
<P>
   More than most Kelley shows, ``Snoops'' rides on the charisma of
its leading actress. Gina Gershon sets the tone with her vamp-camp
attitude, which reaches from her heavy eye makeup to her
skintight-leather fashions. She has a Chrissie Hynde-like
toughness, and it's layered with vestiges of the likes of Morticia
Addams, Elvira, and Emma Peel from that other spoofish TV vehicle,
``The Avengers.'' When you hear the show's theme song _ Blondie's
``One Way or Another'' _ you can almost imagine her singing it.
Gershon, who starred in the movie ``Bound,'' plays the seductive
owner of a PI firm who'll do anything to solve a case, from illegal
hacking to promising sex to a kidnapper. Her office is a futuristic
array of high-tech privacy-invading devices, and she's knows how to
use them. The dirtier the better, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   This being David E. Kelley, there are, of course, a few other
attractive women in the office, and a catfight is always in the
air. In Sunday's episode, Gershon hires Paula Marshall's
soon-to-be-former cop, and the two are quickly volleying snide
insults. ``Over the phone you sounded less attractive,'' Gershon
notes right off the bat, and the playful tension takes off from
there. The uptight Marshall is daunted by Gershon's unsavory
methods, but she's no killjoy, and she indulges in her own
quirkiness when she questions a pair of murder suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The firm includes two other investigators, one of whom serves as
the Kelley chorus. Just as ``Ally McBeal'' has Vonda Shepherd
translating Ally's feelings into song, ``Snoops'' keeps returning
to Danny Nucci's Manny as he sings along with the music system in
his beloved new car. The songs give the show a slick sense of
movement, as do the many bold visual touches, from zooming glimpses
of LA to the neon-lit office scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, ``Snoops'' will follow the women as they work on
cases, but don't expect them to be wrestling with the heart of the
millennial American psyche. Sunday's episode, for instance,
revolves around the most conventional of murder investigations,
with the tightly wound John Glover as a possible murderer. Did he
poison the victim? Or was it his wife? We don't really care. No,
the fun on ``Snoops'' is in the elaborate gadgetry, the
unscrupulous invasions of privacy, and the raised-eyebrow ambience,
which harkens all the way back to a TV relic titled ``Get Smart''
and a fellow named Bond, James Bond.

NEW CHARITY MAKES IT EASY FOR INTERNET USERS TO BOOST GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HERMIONE MALONE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Breen, a 42-year-old computer programmer from Bloomington,
Ind., wanted to do something to improve the lot of children in
Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   And though he had never been on the Internet, he believed it was
a natural launching pad to help end world hunger and get others
involved, too.
</P>
<P>
   The result: The Hunger Site, a Web-based company that combines
corporate sponsorship and the ever-increasing popularity of the
Internet to feed the needy.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of creating his three-month-old Web site, Breen's
ingenuity has sparked what could be the latest trend in charitable
contributions, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based companies that parlay consumer purchases into
charitible donations have grown steadily in popularity, according
to marketing specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Most such companies donate a portion of the profit they make
through on-line sales directly to charity, said Carol Cone, chief
executive officer of Cone Inc., a Boston-based marketing and
communications firm that has tracked charitable giving on the Web
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Breen's site differs in that it isn't linked to a business
and requires no payments from consumers. Corporations pay to have
their name and products advertised. In exchange, that revenue is
used to pay for small servings of food distributed through the
United Nations World Food Program to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Clapp-Buffington, an over-the-counter pharmaceuticals
company based in Canton, has been a sponsor of The Hunger Site
since July. In the last two months, other firms have signed up,
including proflowers.com and greatergood.com.
</P>
<P>
   A Web surfer need only navigate to thehungersite.com and click a
button marked ``donate free food.'' The commitment ends there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a highly innovative site,'' Cone said. ``I'd give him an
A, A(plus) for creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anything like it,'' she said. ``I think
it's interesting that it came from an individual,'' rather than a
large corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth J. Gore, vice president of sales and marketing for Otis
Clapp-Buffington, said his company chose to participate in Breen's
site because the concept seemed a cutting-edge way to tap into a
huge consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (number of) hits he gets on the Web is frightening,'' Gore
said with a laugh. ``I just wonder if (those) people work.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone teamed with Roper Starch Worldwide, a New York-based
research firm, to do a five-year analysis of cause-related
marketing. Their 1999 report affirms that companies like Otis
Clapp-Buffington do well to associate themselves with a high-tech
charitable effort.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report:
</P>
<P>
   --A majority of Americans say they are more likely to trust
companies aligned with a social issue.
</P>
<P>
   --Eight in ten said they carry a more positive image of
companies that support a cause they care about.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly two-thirds of all US consumers report they would be
likely to switch from one brand or retailer to another associated
with a good cause, when price and quality are equal.
</P>
<P>
   But there can be problems with such a system of donations, and
the biggest is accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, donors have not been able to verify that the
money they gave had actually been received by the charities, Cone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that producers of such Web sites should be
required to tell consumers that donations have as much to do with
publicity for the sponsors as with charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's hard for a lot of people to grasp is that
doing good has now become a form of public relations,'' said
William P. Massey, president of the National Charities Information
Bureau, a New York-based company that reviews and evaluates
national charities.
</P>
<P>
   In its list of frequently asked questions, thehungersite.com
states: ``Our sponsors pay for the donations as a form of public
relations advertising. For them, it is analogous to funding shows
on public television or making corporate donations to other worthy
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, cyber-giving sites ``are in the business of
cause-related marketing,'' Massey said. ``It's not the same as
philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   If a company made a charitable donation, ``it would mean that
that money came out of that company's philanthropic budget,'' he
said. In cyber-giving, the money for the ad ``is coming out of
their marketing department,'' he said. ``That is a payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it count less to the charity? No. But my point is to call
it what it is. Let's not confuse people.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the concept is a charity portal that would let
Web users contribute to one of several charities.
</P>
<P>
   While Cone believes that thehungersite.com is unlikely to be
duplicated in large numbers, she does see more public-private
partnerships blossoming on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As consumers become more comfortable about credit cards
online, it should grow and decrease administrative costs,'' she
said. ``It will invite a whole new level of giver, a younger
giver.''

   New Hampshire has less than one-half of one percent of the
country's population, but it is Ellis Island for presidential
nominees, the port of entry where you have to prove your case or
risk rejection.
</P>
<P>
   You don't always have to win it _ Bill Clinton finished behind
Paul Tsongas in '92, Walter Mondale wobbled on to the nomination
after succumbing to Gary Hart in '84, Bob Dole got clocked by Pat
Buchanan last time _ but it has killed off more candidacies than
any other state. That is why the climactic phase of John McCain's
all-or-nothing strike for the Republican nomination commences
Monday in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, as for his corresponding challenger in the
Democratic side, Bill Bradley, New Hampshire is probably the ball
game: lose here next February, and the New Hampshire victor rolls
on like a player with six kings against one or two lonely little
checkers. It'll just be a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   This is not complicated. Frontrunners can recover from a New
Hampshire uppercut; dark horses cannot. And it is that belief,
widespread among Granite State voters, that they exercise pivotal
control over the presidency's first lap, that McCain and Bradley
count on. The state is small enough, sophisticated enough, and
cheap enough for the outsider to have what Aussies call ``a fair
go.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all any challenger can expect. If Al Gore and George W.
Bush roll up their competitors here, it's hard to see any other
place where primary voters will buck the odds. The campaign
schedule is so front-loaded, and TV ads so expensive, that the Big
Money candidacies have a lopsided advantage after New Hampshire if
they win the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising number of New Hampshire voters _ one out of three
or even higher _ wait till the last week or 10 days to decide on a
candidate. This makes for shaky poll leads, queasy stomachs in the
frontrunners' camps, and volatility in the final days. It also
makes for vicious last-minute television onslaughts against a
candidate with momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The early line on the Republican side goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor Bush is way out in front. Since he's raising
money at the rate of $2 million a week so far this year, he's
chosen not to take federal matching money, so he can spend without
abiding by the campaign limits the federal law dictates.
Billionaire Steve Forbes will spend lots of his own dough, freeing
him of the limits also.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is the likely inheritor of the editorial support of the
Manchester Union Leader, which backed Buchanan last time. So Bush
can expect hostile jabs from the state's largest newspaper, as well
as a blistering air war from Forbes's media machine.
</P>
<P>
   While no one thinks the GOP will nominate Forbes, his inherited
fortune gives him Perot-like potential in the early going. The
tendency in politics is for a well-funded negative advertising
campaign to hit not only its target _ in this case Bush _ but to
rebound against its sponsor, in this case Forbes. Who benefits:
McCain or Elizabeth Dole?
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole survived the Iowa straw poll, which Lamar Alexander
did not. Dan Quayle is on life support. McCain is like a stock car
racer trying to sneak through the pack to position himself within
striking distance of Bush, who has lapped the field. McCain's
strategy seems to be: roar into the corners, take the high road on
the curves with gutsy stands on issues, and hope that Dole does not
drift to the outside to prevent him from drafting on the streaking
Bushmobile.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the first negative attack emanates from the Bush
camp, the Forbes squad, or the Union Leader, we will know that
McCain is gaining precious ground at the New Hampshire Presidential
Raceway. Outspoken hostility from his rivals will bring more
attention and free media to his issues.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a fortituitous confluence of events, McCain's issues
are hot at just the moment when the former Navy combat pilot hopes
to clinch the sale in New Hampshire. McCain is the spearhead of
three movements in Congress: to rein in the corrupt system of soft
money and influence-peddling that siphons contributions to
incumbent politicians, to take on Big Tobacco, and to protect the
consumer against predators in the giant telecommunications outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Squads of lobbyists whose paychecks flow from soft money deals,
including gun lobby and antiabortion fund-raisers, are fanning out
to denounce McCain. They're fighting him in New Hampshire because
they're afraid his crusade is catching on. If enough Republicans
and independents buy into McCain's approach, it would be the
beginning of the end for the political pinball game that launders
lobbyists' soft money into the fetid political system.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the best reason why the 99.6 percent of Americans
who do not live in New Hampshire should begin to pay attention to
the Captain Dauntless of the Republican field. You want to clean up
politics, then Crash McCain is your New Hampshire man. Even
Democrats shuld write him a check.

`NOW AND AGAIN': WINNING SCI-FI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
NOW AND AGAIN 
Starring: Margaret Colin, Dennis Haysbert, Heather Matarazzo, Eric
Close, Gerrit Graham 
On: CBS, Friday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
ODD MAN OUT 
Starring: Erik von Detten, Vicki Davis, Marina Malota, Markie Post,
Trevor Fehrman, Jessica Capshaw, Natalia Cigliutu 
On: ABC, Friday at 9:30 p.m. 
Rated: TVG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a way, ``Now and Again'' is the fall season's emblematic
series. As the networks introduce a slate of new shows preoccupied
with the teen and twentysomething years, ``Now and Again'' tells
the story of a middle-aged man whose brain winds up in the body of
a 26-year-old hunk. Yesterday, he was a shleppy insurance salesman
with a paunch. Today, he's a shiny stud with a cool haircut. Are
wrinkles illegal on prime-time TV?
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, ``Now and Again'' works. Developed by
``Moonlighting'' creator Glenn Gordon Caron, it is a promising
science-fiction tale with an added romantic twist. The premiere,
sails along winningly as it establishes the series' unusual, ``Six
Million Dollar Man''-like premise. The idea is that after guest
star John Goodman is hit by a subway train, his brain is secretly
removed by the government and placed in a $3 billion bioengineered
body. The hitch is that the new, improved Wiseman, played by Eric
Close, is not allowed to contact his wife and daughter, who think
he's dead. Also, he must work for the government as it pursues a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   The lightly stylized show has some nice touches. Dennis Haysbert
plays the Frankenstein-like doctor responsible for Wiseman, and he
is dripping with charm, pride, and, at moments, hostility. When his
new creation stares at his own new body, Haysbert joyously sings
``Close to You.'' And you won't want to miss the dynamic opening
sequence, which gives the terrorism plot an air of evil whimsy.
Also, the show has the potential to generate some emotional
tension, as Wiseman increasingly despises being a spied-upon
experiment and longs to see his family. Sure, he looks like a
chiseled perfume model, but he really just wants to pick up the
remote and lean back into his trusty Barcalounger.

`ODD MAN' OFFERS MORE OF THE USUAL
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Odd Man Out'' view of the world, 15-year-old boys have
nothing on their minds except sex, and 15-year-old girls enjoy
nothing more than ridiculing 15-year-old boys who have nothing on
their minds except sex.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simplistic and repetitive? Then don't bother with this
new sitcom, which joins ABC's ``TGIF'' lineup. ``Odd Man Out''
turns adolescence into a string of breast jokes and gender cliches,
all of which the laugh track finds absolutely hysterical. Produced
by the cowriters of ``There's Something About Mary,'' it's hard to
believe this forgettable half-hour is what the pair developed with
their newfound recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The central character in ``Odd Man Out'' is Erik von Detten's
Andrew, and, as on CBS's ``Ladies Man,'' he's the only male in a
suburban household of females, including his widowed mother, his
aunt, and his three sisters. When Andrew isn't hitting on his
sister's girlfriends, or stealing his mother's Victoria's Secret
catalog, he's complaining about how ``all women are nuts.'' And
truly, his family of women is rather nuts. But it's impossible to
sympathize with this odd man out, as he prances and preens and
yammers his way around the house.

COMPELLING VIETNAM FILMS CAUGHT IN POLITICAL CROSS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for FILM-REVIEW-RETURN.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political comparisons are being made between ``Return with
Honor,'' a documentary about American prisoners of war in Vietnam,
and ``Regret to Inform,'' a documentary on American and Vietnamese
widows of the war. That's too bad.
</P>
<P>
   It is true they can be seen as opposites, one centering on the
heroism of the men fighting that war, the other on the heroism of
women who suffered its consequences. But that doesn't mean one film
should be spit on and the other given four stars.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Return with Honor'' stacks the deck in favor of American
POWs, ``Regret to Inform'' does the same for the widows of North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong. Barbara Sonneborn, of Berkeley, Calif.,
who put the film together over 10 years, acknowledges that at the
time she traveled to Vietnam in 1992, ``it would have been
dangerous'' for South Vietnamese widows to speak out. The result is
a documentary that makes every atrocity an American atrocity, every
death the fault of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regret to Inform'' grew out of Sonneborn's need to go to
Vietnam to find the place where her husband, an infantryman, was
killed in 1968. The couple had been sweethearts since they were 14,
and Sonneborn got notice of his death on her 24th birthday. His dog
tags and wedding ring, arriving later, were crusted with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to shake his death, Sonneborn contacted other American
widows and went to Vietnam to talk with Vietnamese widows about
their war. The result is ``Regret to Inform,'' a truly affecting
film that won best documentary at the 1999 Sundance Festival and
was nominated for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the movie starts and ends with Sonneborn's journey
to Vietnam and revolves around the memories of American and North
Vietnamese widows, it is a South Vietnamese who makes the strongest
impression. Xuan Ngoc Evans, Sonneborn's translator, has the most
riveting interviews in the documentary as she talks of having her
house bombed as a 14-year-old and watching her 5-year-old cousin
killed before her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who married an American, said she still searches in the
eyes of veterans she sees for the man who killed her cousin because
``he had a horrified look in his eye. As much as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brutally honest, Evans remembers leaving behind a neighbor
pleading for help and taking food from a dying friend, because ``I
am going to live. I am 14 years old. Why am I forced to make a
decision like that ... who is going to live, who is going to die?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regret to Inform'' is filled with cruel stories. The
Vietnamese woman who watched nine members of her family herded out
and killed ``without even having their breakfast.'' The American
widow who received a letter from her husband a day after receiving
his death notice. The widow who got her husband's wallet in the
mail ``with mud on it ... the smell, the earth of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regret to Inform'' does not identify the women as they're
speaking, perhaps to underline the anonymity of death, the shared
grief of being a widow. The interviews are interspersed with rarely
seen footage of the war and quiet scenes of the postwar
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no mistaking the political intent of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   American widows wonder aloud if their husbands were murderers
and Sonneborn says after locating the place where her husband was
killed that what hurts ``is not only that Jeff died here, but that
he had to be a part of this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make ``Regret to Inform'' any more or less valid
than ``Return with Honor.'' They both have something to say. Can't
we listen to them both? The war is over. Can't we all just get
along?

PRIME-TIME TV'S INSULTING NEW LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a game by the white whippersnappers of Hollywood to find
the least offensive way to offend people of color.
</P>
<P>
   First, the whippersnappers play the game of ``Colorblind.'' They
take their cue from certain white people in the real world who
abuse this disarmingly neutral term to shove black and brown people
out of their way for jobs and education.
</P>
<P>
   The whippersnappers, who answer only to the ratings, play out
the fantasy of eradication to a logical end. With the subtlety of a
neutron bomb, they unveiled a new lineup of prime-time shows where
the top characters were nearly all white, even though most shows
are set in cities where people of color are the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Vaporizing black, brown, and yellow folks turned out to be too
crude. The NAACP was indignant. The National Council of LaRaza held
a ``brownout,'' boycotting the fall premieres. This sent the white
whippersnappers back to the editing room.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the whippersnappers feigned ignorance. ``Oh, OK, maybe
the shows are a little too white,'' they said. Actually, when they
retreated to the editing room, it was with a cigar and a sneer.
After all, these are people who think so highly of themselves, they
are already crafting their speeches for next year's Emmys. ``So the
NAACP and LaRaza think they're so smart?'' They must have said.
``Let's see what they think about this!''
</P>
<P>
   Their answer was Rosario Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario Salazar is a Salvadoran maid on NBC's ``Will and
Grace.'' In an otherwise all-white episode this week, there is a
scene where Rosario is obviously moving much too slowly for her
wealthy boss, Karen Walker. In the original taping, which was sent
out to the media to preview, Karen says to Rosario:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you're on the clock, tamale. Get to work!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamale'' was an unmistakable ethnic slur, just as no non-black
person would call a black person a watermelon or no non-Jewish
person would call a Jew a matzo ball. Once again, LaRaza was up in
arms. ``Here's the network that's under siege for not having enough
diversity in its minority characters, and the writers and producers
aren't making the connection that maybe they shouldn't engage in
this kind of thing,'' said LaRaza's Lisa Navarrete.
</P>
<P>
   So once again, the writers and executive producers had to
explain themselves. The executive director of ``Will and Grace,''
David Kohan, said that they knew ``tamale,'' fighting words among
some Latinos, was hardly a respectful way to address a Latina.
Kohan said a longer version of the scene had Karen being told she
was wrong. But showing how dispensible Latino feelings are, Kohan
said the scene was left on the cutting room floor.
</P>
<P>
   LaRaza's uproar over ``tamale'' was so swift that Kohan and his
team went back into the studio for an emergency edit. Kohan told
the media that viewers will see over time that Karen has a caring
``much more evenhanded'' relationship with Rosario. But in the
darkness of their editing room, a room reeking less with
sensitivity than with creative arrogance, Kohan could not release
himself from his racial preconceptions. In the new scene, you can
see Karen mouth tamale, but a dubbed voiceover says:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you're on the clock, honey. Get to work!''
</P>
<P>
   They could get rid of the slur, but they could not edit the
message. In a real world where many Latinas are moving into the
professions, the Latina on ``Will and Grace'' is of use to young
wealthy white people only to clean toilets and make beds.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario is allowed in the script to mouth back after the
tamale/honey attack, ``Listen lady, I'll squash you like a wormy
apple.'' But there is nothing racial about her retort. Rosario
knows she can go only so far before being fired.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, she was no different than the Latino employees
of Avis Rent-a-Car in San Francisco who were subjected to racist
barbs by a supervisor. Last month, the California Supreme Court
ruled, despite objections by free-speech advocates, that judges can
ban abusive employees from using racist language. The court said
employees are a ``captive audience'' who deserve protection.
</P>
<P>
   Prime-time network television is so insipid, rude, violent, and
segregated that our family has a permanent blackout, brownout, and
tuneout. But given that ``Will and Grace'' was the 18th-ranked show
last week with nearly 8 million viewers, it is important to note
how much these shows tell us about the conscious and unconscious
wish to maintain white dominance in an increasingly multicultural
America. Even when the networks add a dash of pepper and cinnamon,
it hardly matters. It cannot matter when you sprinkle even these
most pungent of dark spices, let alone a hot tamale, onto a
landscape as vast, as monochromatic and as cold as Antarctica.

STAY AND SMILE WITH ENGAGING `DOG PARK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DOG PARK 
Starring: Natasha Henstridge, Luke Wilson, Janeane Garofalo and
Bruce McCulloch 
Written and directed by: Bruce McCulloch 
Running Time: 93 minutes 
Rated: R (mild sexual situations and profanity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Link the words ``romantic'' and ``comedy,'' send me to a movie
where that's the genre, and I'll generally be the one with my
fingers down my throat. Sorry, but the usual levels of sappiness
and cliche _ to say nothing of the never-surprising resolution _
prove eminently resistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog Park,'' a bittersweet film written and directed by ex-Kids
in the Hall comic Bruce McCulloch, is something else again: a
romantic comedy with an adult sensibility, a film that avoids
characters-as-caricatures (with one exception), and deftly mixes
cynicism and hope.
</P>
<P>
   The dog park in question is your basic modern outdoor singles
bar, where all the main folks in the movie meet or end up
eventually, walking, talking, and scooping poo. One of them, on poo
patrol in the dark, wishes they could make dog food with something
in it that would make it come out fluorescent at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Our main man Andy (Luke Wilson, from ``Bottle Rocket'' and
``Blue Streak'') has been dumped by Cheryl (Kathleen Robertson),
who has not only taken a new, punkish lover, Trevor (Gordon
Currie), but also has taken his beloved pooch, Mr. Mogley (Casey).
</P>
<P>
   Our main woman Lorna (Natasha Henstridge, Sil from ``Species''),
who plays the host of a TV kiddie show as Miss Bookworm, is the
owner of Peanut (Blackie) the recalcitrant pup and the lady Trevor
left for Cheryl. We also have Jeri (Janeane Garofolo, currently in
every movie being made) and Jeff (McCulloch) as Andy's pals, the
perfect couple who may not be quite so perfect.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dog Park,'' all these worlds, plus a few others collide,
and a few folks get bruised. Not without some humor going down,
such as a sweatsuit and a raincoat being described as ``the uniform
of the depressed,'' and Andy and Lorna's potential first-time
sexual encounter ending prematurely with her riding the porecelain
bus, hurling booze and, as she says, ``bar snacks,'' feeling
pathetic. Lifting her hair from the pool of vomit, Andy assures her
``You're not pathetic . . . but you are puking bar snacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Doggie behavior is often the catalyst for the human behavior,
and the canine shrink Dr. Cavin (Mark McKinney, another ex-Kid in
the Hall) everyone goes to is prone to Mr. Rogers-cum-Stuart
Smalley from hell pronouncements like ``Dogs are not our children,
dogs are better.'' The estranged couple of Andy and Cheryl are
going to the good doc to cure Mr. Mogley's blues. The doctor
surmises Mogley is down in the dumps because he's been watching
Cheryl and Trevor have hot sex, causing everyone to squirm. Humor
aside, a lot of what these people do, the mistakes they make and
mini-triumphs they have ring true. You care about this lot; the 90
minutes you spend with them is a breeze.

FEEL THE PAIN WITH NINE INCH NAILS (WHEW!) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world is an ugly mess, chaos rules, corruption is part of
the landscape, paranoia makes sense, and people are motivated
entirely by self-interest. That, plus a dose of decadence, has been
the basis of Trent Reznor's corrosive, assaultive vision since he
unleashed his ``group'' Nine Inch Nails upon the rock world in
1988. (The word group is in quotation marks because NIN is,
largely, a one-man band in the studio, fleshed out with four other
players in concert.)
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Fragile'' (Nothing/Interscope), NIN's double-CD
released on Tuesday, it would seem, upon initial listenings, that
not much has changed. A song called ``Somewhat Damaged'' begins the
effort; soon after comes ``The Wretched.'' ``Into the Void'' pops
up midway through, and the graceful, chilly instrumental ``Ripe
(With Decay)'' closes the work. The titles are not postmodern
irony. They are purely evocative of the artistic impulses expressed
within. It's dark out there.
</P>
<P>
   But not just out there; it's dark inside Reznor's brainbox, too.
Often, as we know, one's loathing of the world at large is matched
by an equal level of self-loathing. Reznor opens up his wrists and
bleeds here. ``The Fragile'' is about the process of failure. This
is conveyed musically, lyrically, totally. The window of hope is
closed. And yet, as this two-disc affair unfolds _ NIN's first
album in five years, 23 songs (six of them instrumentals) spread
over 104 minutes _ there is beauty to behold. Just call it a very
dark beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Double albums (or CDs) _ ones that are not live recordings, but
studio efforts of new material _ have become increasingly rare in
the pop world. Why? Short attention spans, a pervasive hit
single/radio friendly mentality, and the chunk of change it costs
to buy one _ though you can buy ``The Fragile'' for around $20. The
very nature of a double disc connotes the idea of Major Work and,
indeed, the publication Alternative Press dubbed this effort,
recorded in Reznor's New Orleans studio and coproduced by Reznor
and Alan Moulder, the most-awaited album of the decade. Time went
further, calling Reznor ``one of the most influential people in
America.'' Like, wow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fragile,'' divided into ``left'' and ``right'' discs, is
ambitious and often embittered. Even ``We're in This Together,''
where Reznor sings ``You're the queen and I'm the king,'' is
tempered by the thought that the happy couple is clinging together
after ``all our hope is gone'' and countered by a vicious assault
of guitars, drums, and keyboards. In the title cut, Reznor roars,
``I won't let you fall apart,'' then surrenders his own self: ``If
I could fix myself I'd/But it's too late for me.'' God shows up in
``The Wretched'' only to reach his hand out from heaven to push you
down. As Husker Du once sang, ``Everything falls apart.'' To this,
Reznor says, amen. Reznor may have not found much he likes about
humanity, his or anyone else's, but he certainly loves sound, his
ability to manipulate it in the studio and the effect it can have.
</P>
<P>
   As with the previous disc, ``The Downward Spiral,'' Reznor is
enamored of sharp juxtaposition: massive attacks offset by quiet,
spare passages. The numerous instrumentals serve to give us a break
from Reznor's rage-filled, filtered vocals, and allow him to
indulge in his progressive-rock compositional tendencies.
(Prog-rockers Yes released an album called ``Fragile.'') There are
violins, cellos, and vocal chants in this dense, yet sharply
defined mix. Guests include King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew and
David Bowie keyboardist Mike Garson. Reznor, rather ingeniously,
blends melody and discord, a tricky balancing act but his longtime
forte.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the dark shadow of former Pink Floyd avatar Roger
Waters looms over Nine Inch Nails. They both are concerned with
detailed cynicism, pervasive gloom, and wide-screen grandeur; both
meticulously use the studio as a canvas; both have found receptive
audiences with themes not generally addressed in the rock
mainstream. Like Waters, Reznor attacks the rock star-as-god
mentality, including himself in the strafing. There's a cool lyric
cop from Carly Simon: ``All your pain/How did we ever get by
without you/You're so vain/I bet you think this song is about
you/Don't you? Don't you? Don't you? Don't you?'' This comes in a
cathartic, full-bore song we can't mention here. Reznor also
employs veteran Pink Floyd/Lou Reed/Alice Cooper producer Bob Ezrin
for two tracks.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Fragile,'' Nine Inch Nails asks you to swallow a big
gulp of angst with barely a spoonful of sugar. It's not easy
listening, but it is compelling, exhilarating at points. Long live
the tortured artist.

GUSTER GOES FOR THE GUSTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Call them the alternative nation's little engine that
could. Hardly even qualifying as a rock band _ no bass, no drum
kit, only two guitars and a hand percussionist _ the Boston trio
Guster merrily chugged along from dorm room to frat parties to
coffeehouses to clubs, gathering steam and fans by way of sheer
pluck, excellent attitude, and a few fistfuls of spare, smart,
ridiculously catchy pop tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when we were playing at the Middle East bakery, passing
the hat for train money, we had a CD (``Parachute,'' released in
1994 during the members' junior year at Tufts ) but no label, no
distribution,'' explains Brian Rosenworcel, Guster's percussionist.
Enter the Guster Rep: enthusiastic and industrious fans who
essentially promoted and distributed the band's first record.
``We'd get them 10 CDs, they'd sell them, and send us a hundred
bucks,'' says Rosenworcel. Over time Guster amassed over a thousand
reps around the country, who were compensated for their efforts
with band T-shirts and free tickets to shows. A remarkable 35,000
copies of ``Parachute'' sold by word-of-mouth alone, followed by
another self-made CD, ``Goldfly.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history _ or more accurately, the future. Guster got
a record deal (Sire), a top-tier producer (Steve Lillywhite, of U2
and Dave Matthews Band fame), and what looks to be a decent shot at
the big time. The band's major label debut, ``Lost and Gone
Forever,'' hits stores Tuesday; Guster will make an in-store
appearance at Tower Records on Newbury Street Wednesday, and play
the Orpheum Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high-profile backing and increasing exposure, Guster
is bent on staying true to its original vision. ``This thing was
born out of friendship,'' says Rosenworcel, who recently moved to
his own apartment after four years of living in Allston and
Somerville with bandmates, singer-guitarists Ryan Miller and Adam
Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all happened to play instruments that didn't quite add up
to a band,'' says Rosenworcel. ``But we made it our mission to make
it add up to a band. Now we have a great new producer, we had a
couple of months to record, and there were no budget pressures.''
It's a recipe for giddy overproduction that not a few newly signed
bands have fallen prey to. ``Actually, instead of focusing on what
we needed to complement the Guster sound,'' he says, ``we focused
on making the Guster sound as good as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach involved rounding up 11 patrons from a Woodstock,
N.Y., watering hole near the recording studio to sing on ``Fa Fa,
'' and using whatever instruments musical guests had in their cars
when they showed up at the session. Remarkably, the big wigs at the
record label left them almost entirely alone when it came to making
artistic decisions _ from selecting the first single (``Barrel of a
Gun'') to Rosenworcel's staunch refusal to pick up a pair of
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't ever wish I had a drum kit,'' he says. ``What I
wish is that I had more limbs. But when you start from a point of
being limited, it forces you to pay more attention to dynamics and
arrangements. It forces you to be more creative.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Caught in the act: If the Ramones and Joan Jett had a baby _
well, four baby girls _ they would be the Donnas, a San
Fransisco-based fab four that rocked the soldout Middle East
Downstairs last Friday. Their Lookout label-mates, Pansy Division
and the Mr. T Experience, each had their punk rock merits, but the
Donnas were at the head of the class. It's all sass, sex, and
defiance, power-driven by a few infectious chord changes and
infused with a winning good/bad girl attitude. In concert, the
Donnas _ Donnas A., C., F., and R. _ had an edgier attack than is
evident on their latest CD, ``Get Skintight.'' If there was a
redundancy in the material, so be it; their's is an elementary, but
much needed, kind of pleasure.

   Freebo keeps the faith: Local fans with long memories will
remember Freebo, the stringy-haired bassist who played with Bonnie
Raitt as a duo in the early '70s in Boston, then stayed in her
bands for the next decade. The LA-based musician just released his
first solo album, ``The End of the Beginning,'' on his own Poppabo
label. (For info, check out http://www.freebo.com.)
</P>
<P>
   The album features guest shots by Raitt, Valerie Carter, Albert
Lee (longtime touring guitarist with Eric Clapton), and Little
Feat's Paul Barrere, among others. The music spans rock, blues,
reggae, country, R &AMP; B, jazz, and gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made this record for that caring population of people
between 30 and 60 who feel extremely disenfranchised by what's
going on in music today,'' says Freebo, who performs at Scullers
Wednesday on a bill with singer-songwriter/anti-nuke activist John
Hall. They also plan to play some tunes together.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   This and that: Think Tom Waits's three consecutive sold-out
shows at the Orpheum was astounding? In a way, it was. Box office
manager Paul McDonald says the tickets went on sale in the busiest
season and directly up against Bruce Springsteen (who, by the way,
turned 50 Thursday), with the first show coinciding with Yom
Kippur. But Dave Marsden, VP at the SFX-owned Don Law Co., says the
demand was so strong Waits could have sold out three more shows,
making for a Tweeter Center-like audience of nearly 18,000.

MISCHIEVOUS `MUMFORD' RECALLS FILMMAKING SPIRIT OF '30S, '40S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MUMFORD 
Written and directed by: Lawrence Kasdan 
Starring: Jane Adams, Ted Danson, Hope Davis, Zooey Deschanel,
Loren Dean, Dana Ivey, Jason Lee, Mary McDonnell, David Paymer,
Martin Short, Robert Stack, Kenneth Tighe, Pruitt Taylor Vince,
Alfre Woodard 
Running time: 112 minutes 
Rated: R (sex-related images, language and drug content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Kasdan's ``Mumford'' is the kind of pleasurable
ensemble piece that Hollywood felt much freer to make in the 1930s
and '40s than it does today.
</P>
<P>
   It's part parable, part celebration of commonsensical virtues,
always gently humane as it sets about its tongue-in-cheek mischief
that begins with Loren Dean's stranger coincidentally named Mumford
arriving in a town named Mumford, setting up shop as a therapist,
and doing such a successful job of it that in four months he's got
more patients than he can handle, including the town's other
therapists. His nonthreatening nice-guy blandness encourages them
all to open up.
</P>
<P>
   His high success rate stems from his empathetic way of
listening, followed by unorthodox and candid advice that cuts to
the heart of the problem. When the excellent Hope Davis's sufferer
from chronic fatigue syndrome shows up on his couch, for instance,
he decides that the thing to do is to get her moving, so he begins
taking long walks with her. When Jason Lee's maladroit local
high-tech billionaire hires Mumford to just hang out and be his
friend, Mumford figures that isn't good enough. Wanting to see the
town benefactor move through local society as smoothly as he rides
his skateboard through the streets, he unhesitatingly goes into the
Cupid mode.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, in fact. In his underplayed low-key way, he
mixes and matches the town's various misfits, including Zooey
Deschanel's charmingly scatty teenager, Pruitt Taylor Vince's dumpy
pharmacist (whose couch fantasies give Kasdan the chance to do some
amusing black-and-white riffs on film noir and his own ``Body
Heat''), Mary McDonnell's unhappy divorcee fighting feelings of
inadequacy and even Alfre Woodard's warm, honest, level-headed
restaurant owner who's doing OK, but, Mumford concludes, could and
should be doing better. Of course, it all sounds a little too good
to be true, and it is.
</P>
<P>
   The women have rather the best of it here, benefiting from
juicier writing than the men, even in smaller roles, such as Dana
Ivey's mom, demeaning her daughter played by Davis and remaining
unswervably suspicious of Dean's doc. Not surprisingly, Mumford's
got a secret himself. But of more immediate import is the fact that
his unusual treatment methods allow for him to blab everyone else's
secrets pretty freely around town.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be said that ``Mumford'' strives for a lot of
unpredictability, but neither does it lunge at amped-up dramatics.
The performances are disarming and ``Mumford'' is the kind of
comedy that grows on you if you give it a chance.

`SUGAR TOWN' IS A TASTY CONFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allison Anders' and Kurt Voss's ``Sugar Town'' attaches generous
quantities of humor and heart to a cliche-prone gang of
over-the-hill LA rockers and those connected to them. Key roles are
played by musicians: Michael Des Barres (of Detective and Power
Station) as Nick, John Taylor (of Duran Duran) as Clive, and Martin
Kemp (of Spandau Ballet) as Jonesy. Although they're performers,
musicians don't always convince as actors. But these three do. The
funniest is Des Barres's Nick, who still thinks he's a sex pistol
until two teeny-boppers set him straight. He resigns himself to an
affair with Beverly D'Angelo's well-heeled widow, who knows what
she wants and refuses to write any checks until he sleeps with her.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo as the empowered hedonist is drolly funny in this film,
where women, perhaps not surprisingly, have the best of it while
the guys concentrate on trying to jump-start their stalled careers.
While the men slouch toward oblivion, the women not only rise to
the occasion but surpass it. Rosanna Arquette, as Clive's wife, is
an actress and former scream queen depressed at being offered a
role as Christina Ricci's mother. But she pleasantly surprises
herself and us when she develops maternal feelings for a preteen
dumped on their doorstep on the grounds that Clive is the father.
Taylor is amusingly flustered, but Arquette persuades us that being
called upon to focus on the needs of the boy called Nerve, played
with oodles of attitude by Vincent Berry, is good for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Janney as a studio musician's pregnant wife and the
film's surrogate earth mother, keeps her homestead together with
wisdom and grace, making light of a pass by her brother-in-law
while her husband is away. As a woman who thinks she's being
stalked by a rapist, Ally Sheedy delicately handles a farcical
element that could have soured the film. Sheedy throughout wrings
sympathy and freshness from what could have been a cliched
career-woman-too-uptight-to-have-a-sex-life cutout. And Jade Gordon
never looks back as a ruthless young climber quite ready to devour
the vulnerable older set with piranha-like reflexes that make ``All
About Eve'' seem like ``Mary Poppins.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``Sugar Town'' was thrown together in weeks doubtless
contributes to its spontaneity and frequent tensile strength. But
there also are times when you wish it were prepared to dig a little
deeper into the characters and develop more of a point of view
toward them. ``Sugar Town'' has about it the flavor of a project
that was made on the fly and it owes a lot of its appeal to the
actors. As its name perhaps implies, ``Sugar Town'' is to be taken
lightly. As a smiling and benevolent confection of neuroses, it's
tasty enough. But you do find yourself wishing that Anders and Voss
had worked on the script some more. ``Sugar Town'' is likable, but
at times it's also inescapably sketchy and ramshackle.

`ACID HOUSE' BURNS WITH HOPELESSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE ACID HOUSE 
Directed by: Paul McGuigan 
Written and adapted by: Irvine Welsh 
Ewen Bremner, Kevin McKidd, Maurice Roeves, Martin Clunes and Jemma
Redgrave 
Running time: 112 minutes. With subtitles. 
Unrated (relentless profanity, brief nudity, violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Trainspotting,'' the Irvine Welsh novel of criminal high
jinks, loser-fueled hilarity, and heroin addiction, turned into a
surprise indie smash hit film in 1996. Many people found it too
upbeat and, somehow, pro-drug abuse. (I disagree; the high might be
intoxicating but consequences are dire.) Now there's a vicious
little semi-sequel called ``The Acid House,'' culled from three
1994 short stories by Welsh, adapted by him, and directed by Paul
McGuigan. The unrelated, oft surreal, vignettes are set in
Scotland, and mostly deal with the same kind of
``Trainspotting''-esque lower-class characters for whom the
possibilities for future success are slim and none. It's no laugh
riot. And yet . . .
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Granton Star Cause,'' soccer player Boab (Stephen
McCole) gets tossed out of his home by his parents, takes his
girlfriend for granted, gets dumped, beats up a phone booth, gets
arrested, and is beaten in jail. Downsized at work, he retreats to
a pub to drown his sorrows and meets God (Maurice Roeves), a surly
but wise old bloke in the guise of a Scottish kinsmen. God tells
him he's lazy and apathetic, claims vengeance is his, and reasons
since he can't punish himself (``being immortal''), he's going to
take it out on Boab for his many failures. Why me? Boab complains.
God allows there may be other more deserving losers, but God is
here now. Boab is turned into a fly.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Boab the fly starts his new life and realizes he can
wreak havoc upon his ex (who's shacking up with Boab's best soccer
buddy, Kevin), his parents, and his former boss. It's Kafka's
Gregor Samsa pumped up in a retaliatory mode. Quite nasty and
clever, and, at points, grimly fiendish and curiously funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Soft Touch,'' the second segment, is definitely not funny.
Here, a bad wedding turns into a worse marriage. The segment
focuses on Catriona's (Michelle Gomez) boozing and betrayal and the
pathetic, albeit empathetic, attempts of Johnny (Kevin McKidd) to
care for their baby, right the marital wrongs, and confront the
scum-like new upstairs neighbor, Larry (Gary McCormack of the long
running punk/Oi! band, the Exploited) whom Catriona has taken as a
disgusting sex partner. When Catriona becomes pregnant, Larry
bolts, indulging in more drink and new, younger women/victims. Will
Catriona try to get back with Johnny, who labors as a supermarket
stockboy, and/or will he forgive her? Says Catriona, sitting next
to him in the poolroom in which they met, ``We're good together,
Johnny.'' The implied answer is heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Acid House,'' the third installment, introduces Coco Bryce
(Ewen Bremner, one of the gawky louts of ``Trainspotting''), a
simple lad who tries to avoid overtures of marriage by his
girlfriend Kirsty (Arlene Cockburn). Coco drops a strong tab of
acid, rides a children's merry-go-round, and is forever changed by
an assaultive electrical storm, reverting to a pre-natal state. As
this is happening, a boring, self-righteous middle-class,
middle-aged couple is en route to the hospital via ambulance as
Jenny (Jemma Redgrave) is about to give birth. Lightning strikes
there, too. Magically and tragically, Coco's brain, such as it is,
is taken over by the newborn boy Tom. So, Coco wants nothing more
than suckle a breast and try to tell his new ``mum'' that all is
not normal. She, however, believes her wise-beyond-his-years son is
gifted, if profane. This is one black journey out of the birth
canal. Hilarity, such as it is, happens when the adult Coco meets
the child Tom/Coco's brain in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with this triptych? The Scottish accents, troubling in
``Trainspotting,'' are even more impenetrable here. (I saw the film
in Montreal without subtitles; the US version does have subtitles,
so you may learn more than I did.) Some of the colloquialisms will
pass you by. And, let's face it, this is no joy ride. ``The Acid
House'' manages to indulge in squalor, depravity, immoral behavior,
and dead-end dreams, while giving us a glint of trenchant dark
humor, if not redemption.

   Dive into this farrago at Chapter Five, the one that begins:
``Nothing in my life could have prepared me for my love affair with
Elizabeth Taylor.'' Work your way through a miasma of freewheeling
sex, pain, heartache, drugs, and alcoholic debauchery until Taylor,
who was making the movie ``Cleopatra'' with Richard Burton in Rome,
has exchanged her has-been pop singer husband Eddie Fisher for
Burton. Fisher was being paid $1,500 a week by the studio to be
``Mr. Taylor,'' a job which entailed seeing that his wife reported
for work on the set no later than her usual two hours late.
</P>
<P>
   Now go back to the first four chapters, taking Fisher from his
impoverished childhood (he was born in Philadelphia in 1928) up to
and through his success as a pop singer and swinger nonpareil. Read
up to where he's packing his bags to leave his well-appointed
Hollywood home while Debbie Reynolds, whom he's in the process of
divorcing, tells him she's pregnant by him.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to read much of the final three chapters of Eddie
Fisher's ``Been There, Done That'' unless you're curious as to
whether there's any insight, let alone redemption, in what you're
reading. Hint: Fisher, who may be the clinical sex addict case that
experts are looking for, barely has room left for his apparent
escaping from a lifetime drug habit and/or for a seemingly happy
marriage to his fifth wife, a businesswoman with a level head. Of
course, she's ``beautiful,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   This book implies that it tells all, when what it really does is
tell too much about what could be an addict's hallucinations and
not enough about what we really want and need to know, such as, why
is the author taking such peculiar revenge on what seem to be the
scores of women he slept or consorted with?
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who don't know, Fisher became known for his
skewed relationships with two wives-turned-ex-wives, actresses
Reynolds and Taylor. He left Reynolds, his first wife, for the
married Taylor, who left him for the married Richard Burton. It was
the backdrop to Taylor's filming of ``Cleopatra,'' a shoot he
characterizes this way in one of his run-on sentences: ``It changed
the life of just about every person who was associated with it, it
destroyed careers and marriages, even by the most outrageous
Hollywood standards it got completely out of control, and it almost
bankrupted one of the great Hollywood studios.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an X-ray of a superannuated show business ego which was
overwhelmed and cast into the shadows by other even larger egos.
The turmoil and wanton profligacy is so pervasive and constant in
this memoir, ghost-written by David Fisher (no relation), that it's
exhausting. By the time he was 21, Fisher was one of the most
popular entertainers in America, bigger even than Frank Sinatra. He
called himself the ``Jewish Sinatra.'' He had several top 40 hits
in the mid 1950s. Guess what? In this book, all that counts for
little or nothing. What does count, up until the time he leaves
them, is the women he loved too well, if not wisely; all the while,
he boasts, they loved him back. In fact, to hear him tell it, he
had to fight them off.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an excerpt from Fisher's scorecard of women:
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth and Connie Stevens, Debbie Reynolds, Kim Novak,
Mamie Van Doren, Marlene Dietrich, Merle Oberon, Ann-Margret, Angie
Dickinson, Stefanie Powers, Sue Lyon, Abbe Lane, Michelle Phillips,
Dinah Shore, Judith Exner, Pamela Turnure (Jackie Kennedy's press
secretary), models, Playboy Playmates, New York showgirls.'' He
adds: ``I didn't even have to pursue them; gorgeous women were
constantly coming on to me. Men used to hang around with me just to
get my cast-offs.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he ``ran from'' Joan Crawford, Stella Adler and Lucille
Ball and that he had a tryst with Joan Collins during a bacchanal
at Dean Martin's house.
</P>
<P>
   The nastiness of the book is foretold on page 3, when Fisher
says the only time he ever heard his father's family say anything
good about his mother was ``in the limousine on the way to her
funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the sleaze, there are some funny moments and intriguing
character assassinations. Fisher laments to Jeff Chandler that he
can't play cowboy roles in the movies because he's Jewish. Chandler
replies, ``I'm Jewish and I play cowboys.'' Fisher writes that
Arthur Godfrey, whose ``Talent Scouts'' made and broke show
business aspirants, was ``one of the best-known anti-Semites in
show business.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the sentiment boils down to the salacious George
Jessel's toast at the Fisher/Reynolds wedding: ``I only hope you
will be as happy as I might have been on several occasions.''

`MUMFORD' IS AN ENTERTAINING STOP IN THE ROAD  
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Alfre is CQ.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Kasdan's ``Mumford'' makes you realize that he's one of
those directors you don't miss until he's back.
</P>
<P>
   His last film was 1995's ``French Kiss,'' a romantic comedy that
managed to turn Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline into the two most
exasperating people in Paris. It felt longer and more lugubrious
than ``Wyatt Earp,'' the epic Western that Kasdan poured so much of
his soul into that, when it bombed, it looked as if he might
retreat to writing anomalously bad scripts like ``The Bodyguard.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mumford,'' Kasdan's ninth and latest film, is a flyweight,
humongously entertaining ensemble number that is his most confident
and narratively successful film since ``Grand Canyon'' in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Kasdan wrote ``Mumford,'' and it has an in-his-own-back-yard
texture enhanced by occasional visual flourishes. It's graceful and
engrossing in the way its characters move in and out of scenes and
around the fictional small town of the title. (It was shot in
California's Napa Valley, but is allegedly set somewhere in
Virginia.)
</P>
<P>
   The town also shares its name with the amiable, if mysterious
shrink who has a sizable number of residents lying on his sofa.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows where young Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean) came from. No
one's even sure his accreditation is valid. He's such a candid,
well-liked, much-needed presence in the sun-baked, sanguine
community that not even the two rival psychologists (David Paymer
and Jane Adams) can bring themselves to worry about him.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Mumford comes on like a talent agent cutting off his
patients, making an audition of potential sessions, then deciding
who he'll see and who has to go somewhere else. Martin Short plays
one such don't-want whose rejection sends him on a rampage to
discredit the doctor. Even as a comically nasty shark, Short is so
colorfully, buoyantly animated that he seems like a cartoon, which
is the uniquely cool way Kasdan seems to have created these people.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a torpid guy like Henry Follet (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is
a bore because he's given an inner life _ his consists of pulpy sex
fantasies in which he recasts himself as a grease-monkey hunk.
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of the town diner, Alfre Woodard is the jazziest
force in the world, wrapping her brandy-soaked voice around
Kasdan's observant dialogue. (Make what you want of the fact that
the only black person in town is the only person not seeking his
advice. Whatever, she's exciting.)
</P>
<P>
   Nessa Watkins (Zooey Deschanel) is the high school anorexic who
seemingly can't decide whether she wants to be a riot girl or a
fashion victim. William Steinkamp and frequent Kasdan collaborator
Carol Littleton, both displaying an intricate sense of pacing,
dreamed up the great fashion-mag montage Nessa inspires.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the wealthy shopoholic (Mary McDonnell) whose
smarmy husband (Ted Danson, here briefly, but never before as funny
on film) is at the root of her neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie's agenda is to figure what's wrong with these
people, then curing Sofie Crisp (lovely Hope Davis) is Mumford's
biggest headache. Mildly pathetic, frail and tart, Sofie acts her
surname _ her mother (Dana Ivey) personifies it _ and seemingly
suffers from Julianne Moore-in-``Safe'' disease: psychosomatic to
the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   She's instantly the love interest who puts Mumford's
professional ethics in quandary: Can the doc fall for his patient?
For an answer, he need only see ``Grand Canyon,'' in which Steve
Martin's schlock producer would tell him all the solutions to
life's great questions are in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, he can fall for Sofie, but ``Mumford'' itself goes limp
trying to get them together. Kasdan is an idealist whose
romanticism is the only generic thing about him. Love doesn't
simply conquer, it lightning-'n'-thunders and flash-floods.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's screwed up in this fictional town, but all each
character has to do is look up and see that there's someone waiting
to love him or her. Sometimes it's a great notion, but when Bob
Seger's ``Till It Shines'' plays over a series of scenes showing
most of the characters feeling love, you want to reach for the
insulin.

   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big

   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

   Singer David Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell

distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and
Def Leppard recently began new albums with on-line previews
designed to build anticipation before their release dates. As Chuck
D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent interview: ``The
Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the dog, or let the
dog bite your leg.'' Sue Cummings reports.

   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

   &UR; DELUXE DILEMMA: TO SELL GLOBALLY OR SELL HAUGHTILY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,000 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE KAUFMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

   &UR; 3 BROTHERS, 4 MONTHS, 1 FORTUNE IN AN EARLY SUCCESS IN GERMANY &LR;  &QL;

</P>

   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

   Singer David Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell
a full-length recording in a download format providing copyright
protection. He is one of many artists who are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and
Def Leppard recently began new albums with on-line previews
designed to build anticipation before their release dates. As Chuck
D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent interview: ``The
Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the dog, or let the
dog bite your leg.'' Sue Cummings reports.

<P>
   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

 &UR; By LESLIE KAUFMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   E-commerce has revolutionized the selling of books, compact

software _ commodities shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to
get a handle on. But will the on-line bazaar work for everyday
survival? In an attempt to find out, writer Matt Rich sealed
himself into an E-cave. For five days, he ordered all sustenance
and entertainment from the Net. He survived, but will he ever be
the same? Here, he offers his diary.

   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

   There are Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents

programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,'' are among the hottest
new areas of electronic commerce. They hold out the promise of
making shopping on the Internet better not just by finding lower
prices but matching products to the needs and tastes of individual
consumers.

credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

   &UR; DELUXE DILEMMA: TO SELL GLOBALLY OR SELL HAUGHTILY &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; By LESLIE KAUFMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

 &UR; By SAUL HANSELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   E-commerce has revolutionized the selling of books, compact
disks, travel and financial services and computer hardware and
software _ commodities shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to
get a handle on. But will the on-line bazaar work for everyday
survival? In an attempt to find out, writer Matt Rich sealed
himself into an E-cave. For five days, he ordered all sustenance
and entertainment from the Net. He survived, but will he ever be
the same? Here, he offers his diary.

   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

<P>
   Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents, travel
agents _ now meet Internet agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligent agent'' programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,''
are among the hottest new areas of electronic commerce. They hold
out the promise of making shopping on the Internet better not just
by finding lower prices but by matching products to the needs and
tastes of individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While the term ``agent'' suggests a trustworthy representative
dispatched into the wilds of cyberspace bazaars, bot conveys the
image of a combative R2D2 scooting through the marketplace of some
distant planet pricing used space cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind the names is different: Agents and bots are
programs, routines, algorithms _ strings of complicated
mathematical equations that are used to find and compare patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Zillman of Botspot, an agency that tracks software
agents, predicts that in five years, bots will be involved in most
on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic word of mouth,'' is the phrase that Prof. Pattie
Maes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media
Laboratory uses to describe what some software agents bring to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in the field of software agents, Professor Maes has
become one of the most visible and articulate proponents of this
new type of program, which lets users learn by comparing their
preferences with those of what she calls their ``taste mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a real-estate agent or travel agent, a software shopping
agent has responsibility for finding products and prices, Professor
Maes said. One of the agent's responsibilities is to match the
user's preferences. Software agents take initiative, learn from the
habits of their clients and adapt to the market.
</P>
<P>
   At the MIT Media Laboratory, Professor Maes founded and directs
the Software Agents Group and holds the Sony Corporation Career
Development Chair. Two of her many projects have led to commercial
spinoffs that represent the two leading types of shopping bots.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Firefly, introduced in 1995, which helps make
individual recommendations for taste-based products like compact
disks, books and films. The other is Frictionless, which went into
service in August on the Lycos portal and other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless is designed to shop for the best price and service
on less-frequently bought products, like cars or camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly is Professor Maes' best-known spinoff. It was one of the
first shopping bots to use intelligent agents and collaborative
filtering.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the early 1990s, Firefly's software began as a site
called Helpful On-Line Music Recommendations, or HOMR, where users
could receive guidance in finding music recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Users rated a series of CDs to create individual profiles, which
were compared with profiles of other users with similar tastes to
generate suggestions for music the user might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the HOMR project was spun off and incorporated first as
Agents, then under the friendlier name Firefly. Other sites,
including Reel.com, adopted similar techniques to help people
choose films. Some licensed the software from Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1998, Firefly was sold to Microsoft, guaranteeing
its influence across one of the most powerful sets of on-line
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly and other collaborative filtering systems take advantage
of the knowledge and tastes of customers. Sometimes the user fills
in a form on-line. At other times, the agent learns from a person's
buying or browsing patterns, as tracked by software from companies
like Doubleclick.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a college student might be presented only with the
restaurants that fit his or her budget; a diner on a
low-cholesterol diet might get a different list. Such
recommendation options, including those produced by Firefly's
competitor, Net Advantage for Barnesandnoble.com, are probably the
most familiar of the new bots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of recommendation technology only works for domains
where people buy on a regular basis,'' Professor Maes said. ``It's
great for books or music, but not, say, for a car, which you might
buy only every four to eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   For those kinds of products, a different kind of agent
technology, like Frictionless, works better.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless also grew from Professor Maes' work at the MIT
Media Laboratory. It searches on-line shopping sites for products
with specific features at the best price.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Frictionless, someone interested in buying a
laptop computer chooses among a set of user profiles, with names
that include ``road warrior,'' ``budget shopper'' and
``telecommuter.'' Each profile provides a list of product features,
among them weight, speed and memory, as well as information on the
vendor relating to warranty, availability and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To further personalize the search, the user can rely on the
preset profile or edit it, rating factors like screen size and
product warranty on a scale of ``not important'' to ``very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern to users is privacy.
</P>
<P>
   `This is a major issue that deserves public discussion,''
Professor Maes said. The more an agent knows about you, the more
useful it can be.
</P>
<P>
   But while some shopping-bot companies promise not to sell
information to other companies, others give away their software and
plan to make money from selling the information they gather on
shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, an industry tracking
company, suggested that more than 60 percent of shoppers remained
wary of giving information to an on-line site.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly hired an accounting firm to certify its privacy
practices, and Maes was an early backer of proposed industry
standards for privacy. The so-called Platform for Privacy
Preferences protocols are under discussion by the nonprofit World
Wide Web Consortium and enjoy the support of Microsoft, MCI
Worldcom, AT&AMP;T, IBM, Netscape, Oracle and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But even if these standards _ which involve encrypting
information and obtaining permission from consumers to transfer
personal information _ become accepted, on-line shoppers may not
feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, just two days after Frictionless went on-line,
Firefly's site vanished, swallowed by Microsoft's Passport shopping
site, which will begin this fall. Many of Firefly's users were
dismayed despite Microsoft's assurances that privacy and other
policies would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is vital to making software agents work well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Professor Maes' other projects at MIT seeks to bring
together people who have not met but have similar interests. The
program uses a survey of potentially sensitive information, like
people's mail, their personal files or lists of their interests.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how the program might be useful to link
scientists around the world for academic conferences, but its
working name suggests an even more dramatic matchmaking
possibility: It is called Yenta.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is a Sunday night, and I have just sealed myself into an
E-cave. For the next five days, I will order all sustenance and
entertainment from the Net. I will hunker down in a bachelor pad in
Palo Alto, Calif., armed with credit card and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I click my way to the checkout aisle of Webvan, an on-line
grover, to schedule a delivery time. Tomorrow morning would be
great. Then, crisis. I'm told that deliveries are first come, first
served. Webvan can deliver the same day, but the next available
appointment is Wednesday night. By then I could walk to the nearest
market and back _ on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   Will the on-line bazaar work for everyday survival, and as a
means for daily upkeep of heart, soul, body, mind and, foremost,
stomach?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY: LEARNING TO ORDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for food, primitive man faced the woolly mammoth. I
face slothlike delivery schedules. Undaunted by my Webvan
disappointment, I set out on Monday morning to hunt and gather
21st-century style.
</P>
<P>
   A Web search turns up 69 sites offering ``grocery delivery,''
including Groceronline, Netgrocer and Electrolley. I pop into and
register at several sites, then head down the virtual aisles.
</P>
<P>
   But each time I go to check out, I learn delivery is either not
available in my area or will take three to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, I change strategies. I search on ``food delivery, Palo
Alto'' and am led to Waiters.com, a service that takes on-line
orders for local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot I know, the Good Earth, I point and click through
the menu. But I make rookie E-commerce errors, neglecting, for
example, to complete registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later my $32 order arrives. Hungry and having not seen
another human being in nearly 24 hours, I practically hug Louis,
the Waiters.com driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you,'' he says, ``I would have ordered over the
phone. It's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   If he only knew. All day, I have battled not just delivery
schedules but a debilitating injury. I have hurt my left pinkie. I
jammed it in a recent basketball game, and it's swollen and purple,
like a mini-eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   I divine an answer: the cybermedic. A search for ``medical
advice'' returns the names of dozens of doctors who offer virtual
consultations. I even find a specialist, a sports orthopedist named
Stuart Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people dread going to the doctor,'' his site says. ``It
can be expensive, inconvenient and stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zeman's alternative is an E-mail consultation for 10 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he inexpensive, he's also concise. You get one
paragraph to describe your malady, and the virtual physician's
response runs only a few lines. (Somewhere, an HMO executive is
taking copious notes.)
</P>
<P>
   And so by the end of the day, I have scored several small
E-commerce victories, including the fact that late in the
afternoon, I have discovered an on-line grocer called Peapod. I
arrange for a Tuesday delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When I go to bed, I have fed my brain with food, and I have
tended to my corpus with medical advice. Tomorrow, feeling more
seasoned in the ways of E-commerce, I will feed my soul. I will buy
a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUESDAY: LIVING ROOM IS PERFECT FOR SINKING A 9-FOOTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not an entire golf course, but at least an indoor putting
green. This will permit me to test my E-commerce mettle, alleviate
the boredom that accompanies an on-line, in-house lifestyle and
address one of life's pressing concerns, improving my golf game.
</P>
<P>
   My search-engine request on Yahoo spits out nearly 40 possible
merchants, with names like Eagle Putting Greens and Chip-n-Putt.
</P>
<P>
   I settle on a shop called Big Moss Golf. This is partly because
it feels like a local store and partly because it promises to bring
my handicap out of the stratosphere. And partly because it has a
toll-free number for customer service, and I'm starting to get a
little lonely in the E-cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to work that out yourself,'' Tony Terisco says.
He's the owner of Big Moss Golf who sells me on the Big Moss
Original, a $159, nine-foot-long piece of carpet simulated to feel
like grass with a golf hole at one end.
</P>
<P>
   It dawns on me that it may be even more instructive to play
actual golf. But I'm in no mood to quibble. I pay an extra $30 for
overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, I receive a house call from my on-line doctor, Stuart
Zeman. ``You must get an X-ray,'' he prescribes in no uncertain
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the house? Never!
</P>
<P>
   I decide to seek a second opinion. I fire off an E-mail to Dr.
Michele Moore, who runs a site called www.askyour familydoc.com.
She will give me a virtual bedside counsel for $25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEDNESDAY: AN ON-LINE WARRIOR VICTORIOUS IN BATTLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Help. Send Prozac. Otherwise, I may torture and kill my
neighbor, who has been practicing the piano for hours.
</P>
<P>
   But I will combat her, E-commerce style. My weapons are earplugs
and aspirin. My destination is pharmaceutical sites. I settle on
Planetrx.com and Drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   I register at each site and check their delivery schedules. Then
I engage in a bit of hard-core price comparison. I open two browser
windows and compare the sites side by side, checking response time,
prices and product information.
</P>
<P>
   The arrows favor Planetrx. Minutes later, I ``walk out'' with
earplugs and Advil, opting for overnight delivery for an additional
$10. While I'm at it, I check out the stores' aisles of bandage
tape for my injured digit. Drugstore.com offers eight pages of
athletic tape and gauze products.
</P>
<P>
   This is when I realize I've E-volved into a wily E-commerce
veteran. I'm in and out of the drugstores in 10 minutes, far less
than it would have taken to drive to a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with success, I endeavor an E-commerce challenge with an
Olympic degree of difficulty. I'm going to use my modem to get my
cat to stop throwing up. I've tried the normal remedies, like
giving her soft foods and beer, but frankly, I inherited the cat
from an ex-girlfriend and I never could figure her out _ the cat, I
mean.
</P>
<P>
   I find a veterinarian to consult by E-mail. But then I ascend
further, pinpointing a service that in and of itself may illustrate
just how far this new commerce medium has come: Kay Cox, on-line
pet psychiatrist, www.getnet.com/petcouns/.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a self-proclaimed ``pet therapist and talent scout,''
offers on-line consultation for $40 an hour. I send her an
electronic missive and assure the cat it will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my own psychological salve has arrived _ my putting
green. John Tuggle, the UPS deliveryman, takes one look at me and
says, ``I think you need to get out of the house and go to the
shopping mall.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THURSDAY: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH _ SEARCHING FOR LOVE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' say it's hard to meet good people these days. ``They''
say it's tough to find a soul mate amid the cacophony of modern
life.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they've never met Kitten664.
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman I am paired up with by Matchmaker.com. The
on-line service concluded we may constitute a love connection by
comparing our answers to about 50 questions like personal hobbies,
income, height and weight and reading habits. Kitten664 and I
matched on 54 percent of our answers.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, we're both 5 feet 8 inches tall and weigh 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It's true: I soon realize that among the criteria the company
matches are our height and weight, which doesn't seem like a
quality that either sex typically wants in a mate.
</P>
<P>
   In a second attempt at a dating service, I fill out a
questionnaire on a site that promises to help me find my soul mate.
But when I finish, it takes me to an advertisement for free,
on-line pornography.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is a site I'd like to bring home to my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news on my penultimate day in the E-cave. The
swelling in my pinkie has gone down. This is partly thanks to
E-mail from Dr. Moore, who advocates icing and elevating the
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I've ordered lunch with ease from Waiters.com _ without
even needing to register because my registration is already on
file.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the cat has quit vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRIDAY: A LITTLE WISDOM GLEANED FROM LIVING LIFE ON-LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when I am feeling as if I may never need the outside world
again, fate intervenes. My office calls and tells me I must go on
an urgent assignment. My week in the E-cave is cut short.
</P>
<P>
   I reflect on the four days gone by. I have discovered that with
a little practice and experience, the Net can yield some powerful
dividends. Product information and diversity are unparalleled.
Plus, there is extraordinary capacity to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the downside. The on-line experience can be an
isolating one. Some very important sense of community develops from
shopping in the flesh, despite the hassles of driving, parking,
fighting crowds and arguing whether you really have 10 or 11 items
in the express lane.
</P>
<P>
   There are other bugs, too. Like sometimes an E-commerce site
just freezes up. It's like walking up to a sales clerk in a store,
asking a question, then having him glower at you before turning
around and walking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm talking to you,'' I shouted at one point during the
week to a frozen site.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I conclude there are two basic and unassailable
tenets of the E-commerce life: (1) you can order anything under the
sun over the Net _ and in greater selection than in any other
single venue on the planet, and (2) plan ahead, or you'll starve to
death.

 By COREY KILGANNON 
 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Where can an E-business struggling to fend off rising
competition turn for a model of how to make money on the Web? To
the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce pay and
whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of the
Internet: the on-line pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the cyberskin game hold lessons for all sorts of
on-line businesses, experts say, but pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lessons to be had from the on-line porn's
success on the Web,'' said David Zinman, the vice president for
marketing of Adknowledge of Palo Alto, Calif., which charges site
owners to gauge how well their on-line advertisements generate
leads and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tiarra, whose on-line company, the Tiarra Corporation,
creates advertisements and strategies for sex-oriented Web sites,
said that compared with his clients and their competitors, ``the
nonadult side of the Web has always been a year behind the curve in
marketing strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   This innovative streak has been shaped by two realities: Unlike
many other Web businesses, sex sites have a product that people are
willing to pay for but that almost anyone can produce.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no sex sites if sex did not sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike major mainstream companies, sex sites had no off-line
revenue stream,'' said Mr. Tiarra, who is also president of United
Adult Sites, a trade organization of 500 on-line sex companies.
``You have to make it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, visiting sex sites meant long downloads and slow video
clips, but operators found ways to transmit large pictures despite
narrow bandwidths.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet became awash with sex sites, the operators
scrambled to develop a way to use existing on-line technology to
get pictures to Web surfers for the few moments they would land on
a site.
</P>
<P>
   With income essentially based on speed of content flow, Web site
designers began writing programs that tweaked technology to make
pages and photos load more quickly to grab their share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting sites were not always coherent and flowing, but
they delivered the product quickly, and that drew browsers and kept
them from skipping to the next sex site.
</P>
<P>
   Creators of sex sites used tips and tricks in writing Web page
scripts so that sexy selling points loaded onto the screen first
before less appetizing elements, like sign-up fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Web's sex sites make money by charging for entry to
a video gallery, usually by a membership bought with a credit card.
Many also carry paid advertisements for larger sites. Free sites
profit by carrying links to other sites, which pay fractions of a
cent each time a customer clicks through.
</P>
<P>
   With profits tied to traffic on the site, the battle for the
most clicks was on. Some site operators designed tricks to lure
casual surfers to accidentally visit sex sites. Some devised loops
to repeatedly click onto sites, including manipulation of the back
key to keep reloading a page.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth redirection techniques cropped up, including writing
programs to create pop-up browsers that emerged as users left
sites, creating a ``no exit'' barrage of windows and prompts. Web
sites began feeding encoded key words for sites unrelated to sex
into search engines, drawing unsuspecting browsers and causing
pop-up advertisements to appear when certain key words were
entered.
</P>
<P>
   They bought rights to commonly used names of Web sites with
altered suffixes. For example, browsers seeking the Presidential
Web site at www.Whitehouse.gov/ got a sex site if, by mistake, they
typed in www.Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites began requesting credit card information as proof of
age for ``free trials,'' adding in fine print that membership
charges automatically would begin afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Tiarra said, mainstream Web site owners were more
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming into this saying, `Is this going to work?'''
he said. ``We came in saying, `How am I going to make enough money
to quit my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, mainstream companies are hiring designers of sex
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for successful strategies, so they're going to
get the guys who had the most competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Duvall, who assesses sex-oriented sites, said there was a
limit to what mainstream sites could copy from the pornographic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with copying porn sites is that sex is the
compelling content, and you can never really compete with that,''
Duvall said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the field's ferocious rivalry, sex sites offer
lessons in the benefits of cooperation, too, said Duvall, a former
newspaper advertising saleswoman who two years ago used $500 and an
old Power Mac to set up her own Web site, Jane's 'Net Sex Guide,
which reviews and rates sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it co-opetition, and you don't see it much on the
nonadult sites,'' she said. ``Even a link trade is a big deal.
You're only sending away a user that is leaving anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream companies using click-through referrals should
research the sex-site industry to learn how to avoid getting
cheated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller on-line pornography sites formed larger networks
offering comprehensive memberships and then splitting the profits _
resembling America Online's more recent decision to develop an
electronic network that would allow members to shop at many retail
Web sites with one credit account.
</P>
<P>
   They also formed large, free supersites, where each company
would post its own click-through banner.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the strategy of cross-linking or
link-swapping was the formation of referral rings, networks in
which sites refer customers to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated tracking systems were then designed to count the
referrals that became paying customers, so sites could reward one
another with a percentage of the sign-up fee. This practice has
been adopted by many mainstream sites, like Amazon.com and
Beyond.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line porn industry has driven Web technology just as it
has with all new media,'' said Seth Warshavsky, the chief executive
of the Internet Entertainment Group, a sex-oriented on-line company
based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult industry entrepreneurs have been a lot more
aggressive developing marketing strategies because they see a
direct return on everything they put out,'' he said. ``They're all
players willing to take a risk to develop new marketing strategies,
and only now are a lot of the mainstream on-line companies applying
those concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the porn industry, you have a tremendous demand for the
material product,'' Zinman said. ``Nonadult industry has to acquire
the kind of information that consumers will want to pay for to make
a profitable business model. Until then, profitable mainstream Web
sites will continue to be an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>
   ----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: KEEPING IT OUT OF YOUR HOUSE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the United States Supreme Court overturned a 1997 Federal
law that prohibited the dissemination of sexually explicit material
over the Internet in a manner available to children, the market
became flooded with software filters for blocking pornography from
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet service providers and some Web browsers also offer
optional built-in filter services for customers who want to censor
Internet material.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the filters endorsed by the Federal
Communications Commission:
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE _ (www.aol.com) offers as part of its membership
fee optional parental controls that block E-mail messages from
specific senders and confine access to certain sites. (800)
827-6364
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSITTER _ (www.cybersitter .com) blocks sites the customer
chooses and those from a list compiled and updated regularly by the
company. $39.95 (800) 388-2761
</P>
<P>
   CYBER PATROL _ (www.cyber patrol.com) selects objectionable
sites and updates the list daily; software also filters sites with
objectionable words or images. $29.95 (800) 828-2608
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSNOOP _ (www.pearlsw .com) monitors sites visited. $49.95
(800) 832-7596
</P>
<P>
   NET NANNY _ (www.netnanny.com) masks offensive words or shuts
down browser that accesses banned sites. $39.95 (800) 340-7177
</P>
<P>
   SURFWATCH _ (www.surfwatch .com) lists 25,000 banned sites.
$49.95 (800) 458-6600

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BERLIN _ Sitting at a makeshift confer ence table a white table
top supported by cardboard boxes _ in the Spartan Berlin
headquarters of Ebay Germany, the 26-year-old chief executive,
Oliver Samwer, can barely contain his excitement as he outlines his
company's spectacular and, in Germany right now, singular success
story.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long: Last September, he and his 24-year-old
brother, Alexander, finished their respective university degrees
and packed their bags to join their brother, Marc, 28, as interns
in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay, the on-line auction
site, and thought they saw a niche for a similar site in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers talked it over at Christmas, quit their internships
and returned to Germany in January to start their own auction site
on the Ebay model. They moved from their hometown of Cologne to
Berlin, recruited three college friends (their 25-year-old chief
financial officer, Karel Doerner, who worked at the consulting firm
McKinsey &AMP; Company for two months, was the only founder with
corporate job experience) and founded Alando.de in February.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May
17 to say that Ebay was interested. Ebay's founder, Pierre Omidyar,
flew to Berlin on May 21, and on May 30 _ less than a hundred days
after founding the company _ the six 20-somethings sold Alando.de
to Ebay for $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the story has inspired a flock of other young
German entrepreneurs to undertake E-based start-up companies. But
it remains an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, E-commerce is taking place in Germany,'' said
Alexander Artope, a co-author of the European Communication
Council's report on the Internet economy. ``But other than
auctions, nothing's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has more Web users than either Britain or France; it has
one of the best telecommunications infrastructures in the world and
is awaiting the drop in Internet toll charges that should follow
the recent deregulation of its telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   But industry insiders put Germany anywhere from eight months to
five years behind the United States in E-commerce development.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer reluctance to give out financial information over the
Internet and unfamiliarity with credit card payment _ 80 percent of
Germans do not have credit cards _ present significant barriers to
Web browsing and buying.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the conservative business practices of the
traditional media publishing corporations that dominate Internet
business in Germany (only one of the top 10 content providers
offers Internet services exclusively, according to the New Media
Report, based in Munich), and it is no surprise that in Germany,
E-commerce has had a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a shortage of the kind of hard-charging,
baby-faced, overnight millionaires that have produced the dot-com
mania fueling start-ups across America.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Oliver Samwer and his colleagues, Scott Barnum,
Ebay's international general manager and vice president, said: ``In
the German Internet-commerce world, these guys are very atypical.
But they represent a new group of entrepreneurs that is trying to
take hold. They are successful role models for entrepreneurs, and
there haven't been that many success stories.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why this success story has entranced Germans. The
young men have become German media darlings, and with scores of
magazine articles and more than 15 television appearances under
their belts, they have set off a wave of young start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In the auction world alone, more than a hundred sites have
sprung up since Alando, now called Ebay Germany. The founders offer
consulting to fledgling entrepreneurships and have started Silicon
City, a social networking group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alando helped raise the attention for E-commerce ventures on a
large scale'' in Germany, said Christian Bachem, an on-line
strategy consultant based in Berlin. But, he added, Alando's
copycat model ``might be a viable trend in German E-commerce, but
it does not at all represent the German E-commerce market.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Samwer is enthusiastic about the nascent entrepreneurial
community he has helped to create, saying that his own team would
have welcomed the mentoring that it regularly dispenses to young
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But he looks back with nostalgia at the skin-of-their-teeth
route that the founders of Alando took, which included offering up
their own childhood model trains at a fraction of their value to
get the site going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he said, ``is still really sad about the trains.''

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A lot of words have been used to describe David Bowie, but
``conventional'' is not one of them. So it is probably not too
surprising that on Sept. 21 Bowie released his latest album _
``hours ...'' _ not in record stores but on the Internet. Just
download in Liquid Audio or Microsoft Audio 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell _ for about
$18, the list price of a compact disk _ a full-length recording in
a download format providing copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how many people will pay that much for an
unpackaged data file, even if it is the creation of a legendary
rocker, and skeptics have suggested that the album's title refers
to how long the download will take over an average modem.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reaction, Bowie's experiment is a response to
changes throughout the music industry brought on by the popularity
of MP3. Artists of every stripe are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the Internet has seen an explosion of legally
downloadable music by prominent artists. New music is now regularly
appearing on-line from the major labels, which have co-opted the
digital download trend as a direct-marketing gambit.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter of 1999 is expected to see a record number of
famous performers offering free audio samples on-line to entice
holiday purchases. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and Def Leppard
recently began new albums with on-line previews designed to build
anticipation before their release dates.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent
interview: ``The Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the
dog, or let the dog bite your leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, it was not so easy for the artists who early on
made their music available for downloading. At the time, Public
Enemy and the Beastie Boys fought their labels' demands to remove
MP3 files of their music from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Recording Industry Association of America, the
music industry trade group, was tracking down unauthorized MP3
distributors and formed the Secure Digital Music Initiative to
establish standards for protecting copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were this big band endorsing this thing the industry was
trying to be united against,'' Mike D (aka Mike Diamond) of the
Beastie Boys told The Wall Street Journal in December.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D _ Carlton Ridenhour _ put it more bluntly on
Sonicnet.com: ``The execs, lawyers and accountants who lately have
made most of the money in the music biz are now running scared from
the technology that evens out the creative field and makes artists
harder to pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys agreed to remove their MP3 files, live tracks
recorded on tour, in December. But by April, their label, Capitol
Records, had approved release of the group's remixes and video on
its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beastie Boys are a good example of the industry's shifting
mind-set on the Internet,'' said Hillary Rosen, the president and
chief executive of the Recording Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   They started out posting MP3 files on their Web site, ``and
getting a bit of hype out of having this public fight with their
label,'' she said. ``Their contract is up this year; they could
have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they signed a new deal with Capitol for a $30 or $40
million advance,'' Rosen said. ``They found that the existing
system had a lot of advantages for them _ No. 1, that they got a
lot of cash up front.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, on-line proponents were saying that digital
downloads would eliminate the need for record companies by allowing
artists to take music directly to audiences. Instead, the rise of
downloadable audio has spawned new companies like Emusic.com,
Mp3.com and Atomic Pop that are pioneering Internet strategies for
artist development, marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Al Teller, the founder and president of Atomic Pop, an Internet
label, is a former chairman and chief executive of MCA and
president of CBS Records. He speaks for underground and developing
artists when he says, ``There's an enormous frustration with how
many artists get lost in the system and the cost of doing business
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Teller pursued Public Enemy after hearing of the group's
differences with Def Jam Records over offering music for download.
Atomic Pop then put the group's album ``There's a Poison Goin' On''
on sale through download in May, two months before the CD went to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Pop, like other on-line labels, does not require artists
to sign long-term contracts or relinquish ownership of their master
recordings. Rather than offering artists an 8 percent to 12 percent
royalty on sales, as the major labels do, on-line labels give
artists a 50-50 net profit split.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement eliminates exceptions like ``free goods'' (CDs
given away for promotional purposes) that major labels use to
whittle away the base on which royalties are applied. Business
expenses for artist and label come off the top and must be
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it's much more favorable to the artists,'' said
Richard Grabel, a music lawyer with Grubman, Indursky &AMP; Schindler
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another frustrated performer was Greta Gaines. A former champion
professional snowboarder and an aspiring singer-songwriter, Gaines
signed with Giant Records in 1995. Soon afterward, Giant was
reorganized and renamed Revolution Records. New executives replaced
those who had promised to support Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the faith and guidance of people who loved my
music,'' she said. ``They said, `If you don't sell 250,000 units on
your first single, you're out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gaines completed an album for Giant/Revolution that was never
released and asked to cancel her contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so damaging to me for so many years,'' she said.
``Nobody would touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued to write and perform music, however. Three months
ago, while preparing to release a debut CD on her own label, she
posted three songs to Mp3.com as an experiment. The site, which
does not charge for the service, also enables artists to get E-mail
directly from visitors who download their music.
</P>
<P>
   Gratified and surprised by listeners' responses, Gaines quickly
revamped her postings to better represent the new album.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Mp3.com called to tell her that Alanis Morissette and
Tori Amos had selected her to open on their tour, sponsored by the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Now her single, ``FireFly,'' is getting limited airplay at adult
album alternative radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start selling records and my song starts doing well,''
she said, ``it will be a complete revolution in the odds an artist
has'' of hitting it big.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines says she will not sign with a major label.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go on to have a major rock career, it will largely be
based on the Internet,'' she said.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler.
He had never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a
magazine advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he
was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, he found the Web site, keyed in his credit card,
played a few hands and won a couple of dollars. That was three
years ago. Now Mr. Lacey is more than $60,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maxed out seven credit cards,'' said Lacey, who recently
entered a gambling addiction program. ``I've got to get this
monster under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have come on line since 1995,
giving almost anyone with a computer and a credit card the chance
to gamble. Americans last year wagered an estimated $1 billion on
line in a form that thrives in a legal twilight zone as advances in
technology have outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   These cybercasinos are based offshore, many of them on Caribbean
islands, because gambling in the United States requires specific
legal permission. On-line casinos blur those legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Is it illegal for a woman in Ohio, for instance, to place a bet
with a cybercasino in Antigua? Does the betting occur in Ohio or in
Antigua?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that
would prohibit on-line gambling by giving judges the power to shut
down Internet providers who give Web sites to cybercasinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure last year 90 to 9, but it did
not come to a vote in the House of Representatives before Congress
adjourned. The bill is expected to come to the Senate floor again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on technology, said he thought that Internet gambling
already violated the law against sports betting, which, although
permitted in Las Vegas, was banned under the Federal Wire Act of
1961. But the law does not address nonsports betting.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1961 measure could eventually be irrelevant if satellite
transmission or radio waves replace telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, some states have taken separate approaches, none of
them altogether effective. Illinois and Louisiana have banned
Internet gambling. Minnesota is studying whether on-line wagering
could be regulated and licensed. And Missouri has taken court
action against on-line gambling providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, has filed a Federal
suit in Kansas City against the Coeur D'Alene Indian tribe in
Idaho, contending that the tribe's lottery and bingo Web site
violates Missouri's consumer laws, which prohibit the sale of
illegal goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meanwhile, contends that the wagering is legal
because it is based in a sovereign American Indian nation, where
wagering is permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also filed suit against a Pennsylvania man for running
an Internet gambling site. The man pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge last year and was fined $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutions of Internet gambling remain rarer than a poker
hand of four aces. Sue Schneider, who publishes an on-line magazine
on computer gambling, Interactive Gaming News, said it would be
impossible to stop people from wagering over the Internet. She said
that more than 500 sites offered gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, states and the Federal Government should
regulate the industry. Australia, she noted, has recently started
to license on-line casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could regulate them just like you regulate any land-based
gambling operation,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Meyer, the publisher of Rolling Good Times On-Line,
another Internet magazine that reports about on-line gambling, said
a prohibition would drive the industry underground. That would
leave consumers with no protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unregulated industry that desperately needs to be
regulated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line gambling has relatively few defenders. In June, the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, created by Congress,
called for a ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional sports leagues, as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, have called for the prohibition of
on-line wagering. The Las Vegas casino industry has called for a
ban as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming
Association, which represents the casino industry, said he scoffed
at the notion that his group's opposition to on-line gambling was
rooted in a fear of competition. He said the industry's chief
concern was that Internet gambling would tarnish all operators of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the ban, however, acknowledge that
enforcement could be difficult. And the Internet providers have
chafed at being forced to act as a sheriff expected to keep outlaws
out of a virtual Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, the Kyl measure would relieve
Internet providers of the responsibility to block on-line casinos
in two instances: if it was technologically impossible to block
access or if it was prohibitively burdensome to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While operators tend to be mysterious, surveys have gathered
some information about users. On-line gamblers tend to be white men
ages 20 to 40, often wagering on sports, said Kevin O'Neill, a
spokesman for the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sports betting is popular on the Internet, he said, ``because
everybody knows the outcome of a game _ you can't cheat on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line casinos typically set up accounts with customers that
debit a credit card. Losses are charged to the card, while winnings
are tallied as a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been relatively easy for on-line casinos to
open for business. Nearly two dozen of them are based in Antigua,
where a license can be bought for $100,000 or less, and there are
no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on gambling say on-line wagering removes most of the
social barriers that inhibit gambling. There is no travel. And it
can be done in private at home, so no one else has to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, the architect who lost $60,000 to Internet gambling, said
he started wagering on his computer as a way to forget off-line
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it as a means of escaping life's problems,'' he said.
``I was in a bad marriage. And I had the early stages of
Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling problem, he said, is a much fiercer foe than his
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkinson's, I can control that with medication,'' he
said. ``That gambling, that's a harder thing to control.''

<P>
   Click on Gucci.com and what do you get? A Web site under
construction. Point that browser toward Prada.com? There is a
picture of a smoldering model, but no handbags are available for
purchase. Perhaps, you think, a dress from Christian Dior.com? Oh,
you crazy fool-for-fashion you.
</P>
<P>
   While bookshops blossom and drugstores multiply, luxury vendors
have only tiptoed into the on-line space, which they perceive as a
little too low rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web works well for standardized products, but with fashion
you reinvent the product every six months, with new cuts and new
fabrics that look different in different lights,'' says Godo
Kraemer, the director of international public relations for Hugo
Boss, summing up the Zeitgeist of the elite houses.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek suit maker whose creations cost as much as $1,200 at
stores like Saks Fifth Avenue has plans for an informational site
only.
</P>
<P>
   And although merchants certainly will not acknowledge it, there
is also the Wichita (as in Kansas) problem. A large part of the
cost of any luxury item is its exclusive image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perceived lack of demand drives supply,'' said Mike May, who
follows the sector for Jupiter Communications, the Web research
company. ``The reason a Prada bag costs $450 is that you can only
get it at a very few exclusive shops. If anybody in the world could
buy a Prada bag, the name would lose some of its cachet.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the pashmina shawl set should not despair. The
lures for luxury's prime-time players to join the Web rush are
great. For one thing, counterfeit merchandise being sold on the Web
is a growing problem, and what better way to frustrate virtual
swindlers than to offer the merchandise through an official site.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also improving. Pictures of clothing on the Web
can lack texture and true color, but software advances will make it
possible this fall to see the weave of the Irish cable sweater
undulate in its full sumptuousness.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the alluring fact that the average Web user has
twice the income of the average American. Top style houses are
watching closely and have noticed that there are customers blithely
willing to plunk down $30,000 for diamond stud earrings or $15,000
for a Queen Anne dresser at an auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Many are now investigating how to exploit the medium without
angering the traditional retailers that are their biggest buyers.
One option may be to design clothing lines to be sold only on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Gucci and Hugo Boss dally, the Web is
beginning to fill with lesser-known, but not lesser-cost, purveyors
of couture, art and jewelry. People who want to shop for luxury
goods now will probably end up at a site that is category specific.
Everything from diamonds to antique automobiles has its own
peddler.
</P>
<P>
   Nextmonet.com, for example, hopes to lead well-compensated
professionals to their inner art collector. Most of its portfolio
is from mid-career artists who are ``underexposed,'' with works
costing $2,000 to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Nickelsen, the site's chief executive and co-founder,
describes her customers as ``people who drive BMWs and are ready to
graduate from posters but know nothing about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are not only introduced to artists and
their works but are offered art history lessons and industry
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of luxury site is a loosely knit front for a
dozen or more upscale retailers. Bestselections.com is essentially
a mall with a store roster that reads like a shopping diary for the
international jet set.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at this site can browse by antique jewelry selected by
Catherine Prevost, proprietor of a chic shop in the Knightsbridge
section of London, or order million-thread count sheets from
Roberta East Linens in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Styleclick.com offers a similar conglomeration-of-brands
approach, but instead of retailers it features wares from
manufacturers like Kenneth Cole, Anne Klein II and Trussardi
Leather.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning: such mix-and-match sites offer a limited
amount of merchandise from their vendors, and often the poorer
selection at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of our purchases are $500 or more,'' brags
Maurizio Vecchione, Styleclick's chief executive. Maybe, but plenty
of embroidered T-shirts for $32 can be had at his site as well.
Similarly, at Bagley Home, a farm antiques shop on
Bestselections.com, it is easier to find chenille bunnies and
beeswax candles than 18th-century armoires.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuryfinder.com, which is being introduced by the New York
social fixtures James Finkelstein and Pamela Gross this fall, aims
at a more ambitious model: a luxury portal that is the equivalent
of a social secretary for the wired billionaire set.
</P>
<P>
   The site will, of course, offer necessities like a Ghurka laptop
carrying case for $1,295 and a bottle of Chateau Lafite at $10,000.
Luxuryfinder.com, by the way, will eschew more common brands like
Coach Leather, which Gross called ``too low end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Luxuryfinder will provide services like a calendar of
society events and tips by Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, a
grandson of Consuela Vanderbilt, on how to behave like a British
aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambitious competitors have already shaken a few of luxury's
big names out of their ennui. The luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which owns couture houses like
Christian Dior and Givenchy, plans to test the Web waters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Sephora.com, the international cosmetics and beauty
retailer, which is 80 percent owned by LVMH, will go live. The rest
of the company's brands will follow. LVMH, which once saw the Web
as a threat, now sees it as a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone knows for sure how big the market is,
but the demographics are clear, the young affluent and aspiring
affluent customer are already there,'' said Myron Ullman, LVMH's
group managing director. ``So we will be, too.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's hard not to look at all the money being made on Internet
stocks and wonder, ``How do I get my share?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you could bet your life savings on a company started by
teen-agers that has never had a dime of profit, with a stock that
seems to follow the course of the Coney Island Cyclone.
</P>
<P>
   Or take that recipe that was always such a big hit at the bake
sale, open SuperFudgeBrownies.com, and then sell stock to all your
friends on the PTA.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could plan to do all your Christmas shopping on
the Internet. Many Internet companies, and their investors, are so
desperate to get big fast that they are almost willing to bribe
people to shop with them. So the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items at or below cost, or with free shipping
or all sorts of other giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has already driven prices for digital video disks
on-line to as much as 40 percent below the suggested retail level.
In many cases that means the price is well below the wholesale
cost.
</P>
<P>
   And enough $15 coupons and free shipping deals have been fired
in the bitter war between Drugstore.com and Planetrx.com that
customers could well hoard a year's worth of free shampoo or
toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   You name it and someone has started a Web site to sell it:
Autoweb, Furniture.com, Ebags, Pets.com, even Partyjunk.com,
scheduled to be introduced this fall, for children's party favors.
There are thousands more, and nearly all of them are planning to
lose money for years.
</P>
<P>
   For on-line buyers, these good deals are still mixed with a lot
of frustration. It's often hard to find a site that sells what you
want. When you do, the sites can be slow and hard to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   If you place an order, too often the merchandise is not shipped
correctly, intact and on time. And there is nothing that Silicon
Valley has invented to let you tell by looking at a computer screen
whether the sweater will be scratchy or what the color really is.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm,
found that the portion of buyers who said they were very satisfied
with their on-line shopping dropped to 43 percent this year from 63
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the qualms, more people are spending much more
money on-line every month. On America Online, only 37 percent of
its members had made an on-line purchase as of June of last year.
Today, it is up to 62 percent, or nearly 11 million shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter estimates that consumers will spend $15 billion in 1999.
Of that, $6 billion will be spent this Christmas, double what was
spent last year.
</P>
<P>
   For both business and Wall Street, the question now is: How big
can this get?
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs recently told clients it estimated that
ultimately 15 percent to 20 percent of the nation's retail sales
could flow over the Internet. And in many ways,
business-to-business electronic commerce is having an even bigger
effect and doing it faster, as everything from cattle farms to
steel mills use the Web to link to suppliers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder investors are backing companies that look like they
are growing fast, rather than those that are making a profit. To be
sure, there may be a touch of irrational exuberance causing the
stock market to value Etoys at $5.2 billion, far more than the $3.4
billion value of Toys ``R'' Us. Never mind that Toys ``R'' Us sells
400 times more toys than its upstart rival.
</P>
<P>
   Look behind all the technical wizardry of the sites, however,
and you'll see a lot of businesses that are staying together on
little more than packing tape and a prayer. After all, it's much
easier to make a pretty Web site, and advertise it on America
Online, than to make sure you have the goods the site is offering
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a wake-up call for everybody,'' said Katherine
Borsecnik, the senior vice president in charge of America Online's
shopping area. ``People weren't prepared for the volumes that
peaked about a week before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Wainright, now the chief executive of Pets.com, said she
learned her lesson when she spent a year running Reel.com, an
on-line video store that was having trouble keeping track of its
inventory and shipping orders on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there, we had 50,000 customers, and 50,000 were mad
at us,'' she said. Reel has since been sold to Hollywood Video.
</P>
<P>
   Starting over at Pets.com early this year, Ms. Wainright
replaced the company's computer system with one that can handle 30
times its current volume. She leased a 120,000-square-foot
warehouse to stock everything and she is hiring three shifts of
people to staff it around the clock this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, people were really excited to try something
new,'' she said. ``But this year, the customers are completely
unforgiving. They are not going to give you a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall will also mark the debut of services known as
electronic wallets that are meant to speed on-line shopping by
automatically sending previously entered information about the
shopper _ like credit-card numbers and shipping address _ to the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, many people who tried to shop on-line found an
even more basic problem: They couldn't find anyone selling what
they wanted to buy. In some cases that was because they didn't know
where to look.
</P>
<P>
   But by this year, the big Internet guides, including America
Online and Yahoo, will introduce new services that allow shoppers
to search for a specific item at hundreds of on-line stores and see
on one screen who carries it and what their prices are.
</P>
<P>
   Security is another main concern that, according to surveys of
Internet users, is keeping people from shopping on-line. With so
many sites appearing every day, it is hard to know the reliable
merchants from the fly-by-nights, so many people are wary of
sending their credit card numbers to anyone on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But a healthy suspicion, said David Medine, the associate
director of the Federal Trade Commission, should make people more
willing to use credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should always use their credit cards when they buy
on-line because of the strong consumer protection laws that let you
dispute charges on a credit card bill,'' Medine said. The most
consumers will pay in case of fraud is $50.
</P>
<P>
   That said, shoppers should have a field day.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents, travel
agents _ now meet Internet agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligent agent'' programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,''
are among the hottest new areas of electronic commerce. They hold
out the promise of making shopping on the Internet better not just
by finding lower prices but by matching products to the needs and
tastes of individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While the term ``agent'' suggests a trustworthy representative
dispatched into the wilds of cyberspace bazaars, bot conveys the
image of a combative R2D2 scooting through the marketplace of some
distant planet pricing used space cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind the names is different: Agents and bots are
programs, routines, algorithms _ strings of complicated
mathematical equations that are used to find and compare patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Zillman of Botspot, an agency that tracks software
agents, predicts that in five years, bots will be involved in most
on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic word of mouth,'' is the phrase that Prof. Pattie
Maes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media
Laboratory uses to describe what some software agents bring to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in the field of software agents, Professor Maes has
become one of the most visible and articulate proponents of this
new type of program, which lets users learn by comparing their
preferences with those of what she calls their ``taste mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a real-estate agent or travel agent, a software shopping
agent has responsibility for finding products and prices, Professor
Maes said. One of the agent's responsibilities is to match the
user's preferences. Software agents take initiative, learn from the
habits of their clients and adapt to the market.
</P>
<P>
   At the MIT Media Laboratory, Professor Maes founded and directs
the Software Agents Group and holds the Sony Corporation Career
Development Chair. Two of her many projects have led to commercial
spinoffs that represent the two leading types of shopping bots.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Firefly, introduced in 1995, which helps make
individual recommendations for taste-based products like compact
disks, books and films. The other is Frictionless, which went into
service in August on the Lycos portal and other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless is designed to shop for the best price and service
on less-frequently bought products, like cars or camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly is Professor Maes' best-known spinoff. It was one of the
first shopping bots to use intelligent agents and collaborative
filtering.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the early 1990s, Firefly's software began as a site
called Helpful On-Line Music Recommendations, or HOMR, where users
could receive guidance in finding music recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Users rated a series of CDs to create individual profiles, which
were compared with profiles of other users with similar tastes to
generate suggestions for music the user might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the HOMR project was spun off and incorporated first as
Agents, then under the friendlier name Firefly. Other sites,
including Reel.com, adopted similar techniques to help people
choose films. Some licensed the software from Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1998, Firefly was sold to Microsoft, guaranteeing
its influence across one of the most powerful sets of on-line
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly and other collaborative filtering systems take advantage
of the knowledge and tastes of customers. Sometimes the user fills
in a form on-line. At other times, the agent learns from a person's
buying or browsing patterns, as tracked by software from companies
like Doubleclick.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a college student might be presented only with the
restaurants that fit his or her budget; a diner on a
low-cholesterol diet might get a different list. Such
recommendation options, including those produced by Firefly's
competitor, Net Advantage for Barnesandnoble.com, are probably the
most familiar of the new bots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of recommendation technology only works for domains
where people buy on a regular basis,'' Professor Maes said. ``It's
great for books or music, but not, say, for a car, which you might
buy only every four to eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   For those kinds of products, a different kind of agent
technology, like Frictionless, works better.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless also grew from Professor Maes' work at the MIT
Media Laboratory. It searches on-line shopping sites for products
with specific features at the best price.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Frictionless, someone interested in buying a
laptop computer chooses among a set of user profiles, with names
that include ``road warrior,'' ``budget shopper'' and
``telecommuter.'' Each profile provides a list of product features,
among them weight, speed and memory, as well as information on the
vendor relating to warranty, availability and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To further personalize the search, the user can rely on the
preset profile or edit it, rating factors like screen size and
product warranty on a scale of ``not important'' to ``very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern to users is privacy.
</P>
<P>
   `This is a major issue that deserves public discussion,''
Professor Maes said. The more an agent knows about you, the more
useful it can be.
</P>
<P>
   But while some shopping-bot companies promise not to sell
information to other companies, others give away their software and
plan to make money from selling the information they gather on
shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, an industry tracking
company, suggested that more than 60 percent of shoppers remained
wary of giving information to an on-line site.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly hired an accounting firm to certify its privacy
practices, and Maes was an early backer of proposed industry
standards for privacy. The so-called Platform for Privacy
Preferences protocols are under discussion by the nonprofit World
Wide Web Consortium and enjoy the support of Microsoft, MCI
Worldcom, AT&AMP;T, IBM, Netscape, Oracle and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But even if these standards _ which involve encrypting
information and obtaining permission from consumers to transfer
personal information _ become accepted, on-line shoppers may not
feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, just two days after Frictionless went on-line,
Firefly's site vanished, swallowed by Microsoft's Passport shopping
site, which will begin this fall. Many of Firefly's users were
dismayed despite Microsoft's assurances that privacy and other
policies would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is vital to making software agents work well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Professor Maes' other projects at MIT seeks to bring
together people who have not met but have similar interests. The
program uses a survey of potentially sensitive information, like
people's mail, their personal files or lists of their interests.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how the program might be useful to link
scientists around the world for academic conferences, but its
working name suggests an even more dramatic matchmaking
possibility: It is called Yenta.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is a Sunday night, and I have just sealed myself into an
E-cave. For the next five days, I will order all sustenance and
entertainment from the Net. I will hunker down in a bachelor pad in
Palo Alto, Calif., armed with credit card and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I click my way to the checkout aisle of Webvan, an on-line
grover, to schedule a delivery time. Tomorrow morning would be
great. Then, crisis. I'm told that deliveries are first come, first
served. Webvan can deliver the same day, but the next available
appointment is Wednesday night. By then I could walk to the nearest
market and back _ on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   Will the on-line bazaar work for everyday survival, and as a
means for daily upkeep of heart, soul, body, mind and, foremost,
stomach?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY: LEARNING TO ORDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for food, primitive man faced the woolly mammoth. I
face slothlike delivery schedules. Undaunted by my Webvan
disappointment, I set out on Monday morning to hunt and gather
21st-century style.
</P>
<P>
   A Web search turns up 69 sites offering ``grocery delivery,''
including Groceronline, Netgrocer and Electrolley. I pop into and
register at several sites, then head down the virtual aisles.
</P>
<P>
   But each time I go to check out, I learn delivery is either not
available in my area or will take three to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, I change strategies. I search on ``food delivery, Palo
Alto'' and am led to Waiters.com, a service that takes on-line
orders for local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot I know, the Good Earth, I point and click through
the menu. But I make rookie E-commerce errors, neglecting, for
example, to complete registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later my $32 order arrives. Hungry and having not seen
another human being in nearly 24 hours, I practically hug Louis,
the Waiters.com driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you,'' he says, ``I would have ordered over the
phone. It's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   If he only knew. All day, I have battled not just delivery
schedules but a debilitating injury. I have hurt my left pinkie. I
jammed it in a recent basketball game, and it's swollen and purple,
like a mini-eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   I divine an answer: the cybermedic. A search for ``medical
advice'' returns the names of dozens of doctors who offer virtual
consultations. I even find a specialist, a sports orthopedist named
Stuart Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people dread going to the doctor,'' his site says. ``It
can be expensive, inconvenient and stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zeman's alternative is an E-mail consultation for 10 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he inexpensive, he's also concise. You get one
paragraph to describe your malady, and the virtual physician's
response runs only a few lines. (Somewhere, an HMO executive is
taking copious notes.)
</P>
<P>
   And so by the end of the day, I have scored several small
E-commerce victories, including the fact that late in the
afternoon, I have discovered an on-line grocer called Peapod. I
arrange for a Tuesday delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When I go to bed, I have fed my brain with food, and I have
tended to my corpus with medical advice. Tomorrow, feeling more
seasoned in the ways of E-commerce, I will feed my soul. I will buy
a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUESDAY: LIVING ROOM IS PERFECT FOR SINKING A 9-FOOTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not an entire golf course, but at least an indoor putting
green. This will permit me to test my E-commerce mettle, alleviate
the boredom that accompanies an on-line, in-house lifestyle and
address one of life's pressing concerns, improving my golf game.
</P>
<P>
   My search-engine request on Yahoo spits out nearly 40 possible
merchants, with names like Eagle Putting Greens and Chip-n-Putt.
</P>
<P>
   I settle on a shop called Big Moss Golf. This is partly because
it feels like a local store and partly because it promises to bring
my handicap out of the stratosphere. And partly because it has a
toll-free number for customer service, and I'm starting to get a
little lonely in the E-cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to work that out yourself,'' Tony Terisco says.
He's the owner of Big Moss Golf who sells me on the Big Moss
Original, a $159, nine-foot-long piece of carpet simulated to feel
like grass with a golf hole at one end.
</P>
<P>
   It dawns on me that it may be even more instructive to play
actual golf. But I'm in no mood to quibble. I pay an extra $30 for
overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, I receive a house call from my on-line doctor, Stuart
Zeman. ``You must get an X-ray,'' he prescribes in no uncertain
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the house? Never!
</P>
<P>
   I decide to seek a second opinion. I fire off an E-mail to Dr.
Michele Moore, who runs a site called www.askyour familydoc.com.
She will give me a virtual bedside counsel for $25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEDNESDAY: AN ON-LINE WARRIOR VICTORIOUS IN BATTLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Help. Send Prozac. Otherwise, I may torture and kill my
neighbor, who has been practicing the piano for hours.
</P>
<P>
   But I will combat her, E-commerce style. My weapons are earplugs
and aspirin. My destination is pharmaceutical sites. I settle on
Planetrx.com and Drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   I register at each site and check their delivery schedules. Then
I engage in a bit of hard-core price comparison. I open two browser
windows and compare the sites side by side, checking response time,
prices and product information.
</P>
<P>
   The arrows favor Planetrx. Minutes later, I ``walk out'' with
earplugs and Advil, opting for overnight delivery for an additional
$10. While I'm at it, I check out the stores' aisles of bandage
tape for my injured digit. Drugstore.com offers eight pages of
athletic tape and gauze products.
</P>
<P>
   This is when I realize I've E-volved into a wily E-commerce
veteran. I'm in and out of the drugstores in 10 minutes, far less
than it would have taken to drive to a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with success, I endeavor an E-commerce challenge with an
Olympic degree of difficulty. I'm going to use my modem to get my
cat to stop throwing up. I've tried the normal remedies, like
giving her soft foods and beer, but frankly, I inherited the cat
from an ex-girlfriend and I never could figure her out _ the cat, I
mean.
</P>
<P>
   I find a veterinarian to consult by E-mail. But then I ascend
further, pinpointing a service that in and of itself may illustrate
just how far this new commerce medium has come: Kay Cox, on-line
pet psychiatrist, www.getnet.com/petcouns/.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a self-proclaimed ``pet therapist and talent scout,''
offers on-line consultation for $40 an hour. I send her an
electronic missive and assure the cat it will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my own psychological salve has arrived _ my putting
green. John Tuggle, the UPS deliveryman, takes one look at me and
says, ``I think you need to get out of the house and go to the
shopping mall.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THURSDAY: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH _ SEARCHING FOR LOVE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' say it's hard to meet good people these days. ``They''
say it's tough to find a soul mate amid the cacophony of modern
life.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they've never met Kitten664.
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman I am paired up with by Matchmaker.com. The
on-line service concluded we may constitute a love connection by
comparing our answers to about 50 questions like personal hobbies,
income, height and weight and reading habits. Kitten664 and I
matched on 54 percent of our answers.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, we're both 5 feet 8 inches tall and weigh 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It's true: I soon realize that among the criteria the company
matches are our height and weight, which doesn't seem like a
quality that either sex typically wants in a mate.
</P>
<P>
   In a second attempt at a dating service, I fill out a
questionnaire on a site that promises to help me find my soul mate.
But when I finish, it takes me to an advertisement for free,
on-line pornography.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is a site I'd like to bring home to my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news on my penultimate day in the E-cave. The
swelling in my pinkie has gone down. This is partly thanks to
E-mail from Dr. Moore, who advocates icing and elevating the
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I've ordered lunch with ease from Waiters.com _ without
even needing to register because my registration is already on
file.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the cat has quit vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRIDAY: A LITTLE WISDOM GLEANED FROM LIVING LIFE ON-LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when I am feeling as if I may never need the outside world
again, fate intervenes. My office calls and tells me I must go on
an urgent assignment. My week in the E-cave is cut short.
</P>
<P>
   I reflect on the four days gone by. I have discovered that with
a little practice and experience, the Net can yield some powerful
dividends. Product information and diversity are unparalleled.
Plus, there is extraordinary capacity to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the downside. The on-line experience can be an
isolating one. Some very important sense of community develops from
shopping in the flesh, despite the hassles of driving, parking,
fighting crowds and arguing whether you really have 10 or 11 items
in the express lane.
</P>
<P>
   There are other bugs, too. Like sometimes an E-commerce site
just freezes up. It's like walking up to a sales clerk in a store,
asking a question, then having him glower at you before turning
around and walking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm talking to you,'' I shouted at one point during the
week to a frozen site.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I conclude there are two basic and unassailable
tenets of the E-commerce life: (1) you can order anything under the
sun over the Net _ and in greater selection than in any other
single venue on the planet, and (2) plan ahead, or you'll starve to
death.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Where can an E-business struggling to fend off rising
competition turn for a model of how to make money on the Web? To
the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce pay and
whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of the
Internet: the on-line pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the cyberskin game hold lessons for all sorts of
on-line businesses, experts say, but pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lessons to be had from the on-line porn's
success on the Web,'' said David Zinman, the vice president for
marketing of Adknowledge of Palo Alto, Calif., which charges site
owners to gauge how well their on-line advertisements generate
leads and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tiarra, whose on-line company, the Tiarra Corporation,
creates advertisements and strategies for sex-oriented Web sites,
said that compared with his clients and their competitors, ``the
nonadult side of the Web has always been a year behind the curve in
marketing strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   This innovative streak has been shaped by two realities: Unlike
many other Web businesses, sex sites have a product that people are
willing to pay for but that almost anyone can produce.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no sex sites if sex did not sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike major mainstream companies, sex sites had no off-line
revenue stream,'' said Mr. Tiarra, who is also president of United
Adult Sites, a trade organization of 500 on-line sex companies.
``You have to make it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, visiting sex sites meant long downloads and slow video
clips, but operators found ways to transmit large pictures despite
narrow bandwidths.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet became awash with sex sites, the operators
scrambled to develop a way to use existing on-line technology to
get pictures to Web surfers for the few moments they would land on
a site.
</P>
<P>
   With income essentially based on speed of content flow, Web site
designers began writing programs that tweaked technology to make
pages and photos load more quickly to grab their share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting sites were not always coherent and flowing, but
they delivered the product quickly, and that drew browsers and kept
them from skipping to the next sex site.
</P>
<P>
   Creators of sex sites used tips and tricks in writing Web page
scripts so that sexy selling points loaded ontothe screen first
before less appetizing elements, like sign-up fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Web's sex sites make money by charging for entry to
a video gallery, usually by a membership bought with a credit card.
Many also carry paid advertisements for larger sites. Free sites
profit by carrying links to other sites, which pay fractions of a
cent each time a customer clicks through.
</P>
<P>
   With profits tied to traffic on the site, the battle for the
most clicks was on. Some site operators designed tricks to lure
casual surfers to accidentally visit sex sites. Some devised loops
to repeatedly click onto sites, including manipulation of the back
key to keep reloading a page.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth redirection techniques cropped up, including writing
programs to create pop-up browsers that emerged as users left
sites, creating a ``no exit'' barrage of windows and prompts. Web
sites began feeding encoded key words for sites unrelated to sex
into search engines, drawing unsuspecting browsers and causing
pop-up advertisements to appear when certain key words were
entered.
</P>
<P>
   They bought rights to commonly used names of Web sites with
altered suffixes. For example, browsers seeking the Presidential
Web site at www.Whitehouse.gov/ got a sex site if, by mistake, they
typed in www.Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites began requesting credit card information as proof of
age for ``free trials,'' adding in fine print that membership
charges automatically would begin afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Tiarra said, mainstream Web site owners were more
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming into this saying, `Is this going to work?'''
he said. ``We came in saying, `How am I going to make enough money
to quit my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, mainstream companies are hiring designers of sex
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for successful strategies, so they're going to
get the guys who had the most competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Duvall, who assesses sex-oriented sites, said there was a
limit to what mainstream sites could copy from the pornographic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with copying porn sites is that sex is the
compelling content, and you can never really compete with that,''
Duvall said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the field's ferocious rivalry, sex sites offer
lessons in the benefits of cooperation, too, said Duvall, a former
newspaper advertising saleswoman who two years ago used $500 and an
old Power Mac to set up her own Web site, Jane's 'Net Sex Guide,
which reviews and rates sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it co-opetition, and you don't see it much on the
nonadult sites,'' she said. ``Even a link trade is a big deal.
You're only sending away a user that is leaving anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream companies using click-through referrals should
research the sex-site industry to learn how to avoid getting
cheated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller on-line pornography sites formed larger networks
offering comprehensive memberships and then splitting the profits _
resembling America Online's more recent decision to develop an
electronic network that would allow members to shop at many retail
Web sites with one credit account.
</P>
<P>
   They also formed large, free supersites, where each company
would post its own click-through banner.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the strategy of cross-linking or
link-swapping was the formation of referral rings, networks in
which sites refer customers to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated tracking systems were then designed to count the
referrals that became paying customers, so sites could reward one
another with a percentage of the sign-up fee. This practice has
been adopted by many mainstream sites, like Amazon.com and
Beyond.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line porn industry has driven Web technology just as it
has with all new media,'' said Seth Warshavsky, the chief executive
of the Internet Entertainment Group, a sex-oriented on-line company
based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult industry entrepreneurs have been a lot more
aggressive developing marketing strategies because they see a
direct return on everything they put out,'' he said. ``They're all
players willing to take a risk to develop new marketing strategies,
and only now are a lot of the mainstream on-line companies applying
those concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the porn industry, you have a tremendous demand for the
material product,'' Zinman said. ``Nonadult industry has to acquire
the kind of information that consumers will want to pay for to make
a profitable business model. Until then, profitable mainstream Web
sites will continue to be an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: KEEPING IT OUT OF YOUR HOUSE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the United States Supreme Court overturned a 1997 Federal
law that prohibited the dissemination of sexually explicit material
over the Internet in a manner available to children, the market
became flooded with software filters for blocking pornography from
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet service providers and some Web browsers also offer
optional built-in filter services for customers who want to censor
Internet material.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the filters endorsed by the Federal
Communications Commission:
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE _ (www.aol.com) offers as part of its membership
fee optional parental controls that block E-mail messages from
specific senders and confine access to certain sites. (800)
827-6364
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSITTER _ (www.cybersitter .com) blocks sites the customer
chooses and those from a list compiled and updated regularly by the
company. $39.95 (800) 388-2761
</P>
<P>
   CYBER PATROL _ (www.cyber patrol.com) selects objectionable
sites and updates the list daily; software also filters sites with
objectionable words or images. $29.95 (800) 828-2608

<P>
   BERLIN _ Sitting at a makeshift confer ence table a white table
top supported by cardboard boxes _ in the Spartan Berlin
headquarters of Ebay Germany, the 26-year-old chief executive,
Oliver Samwer, can barely contain his excitement as he outlines his
company's spectacular and, in Germany right now, singular success
story.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long: Last September, he and his 24-year-old
brother, Alexander, finished their respective university degrees
and packed their bags to join their brother, Marc, 28, as interns
in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay, the on-line auction
site, and thought they saw a niche for a similar site in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers talked it over at Christmas, quit their internships
and returned to Germany in January to start their own auction site
on the Ebay model. They moved from their hometown of Cologne to
Berlin, recruited three college friends (their 25-year-old chief
financial officer, Karel Doerner, who worked at the consulting firm
McKinsey &AMP; Company for two months, was the only founder with
corporate job experience) and founded Alando.de in February.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May
17 to say that Ebay was interested. Ebay's founder, Pierre Omidyar,
flew to Berlin on May 21, and on May 30 _ less than a hundred days
after founding the company _ the six 20-somethings sold Alando.de
to Ebay for $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the story has inspired a flock of other young
German entrepreneurs to undertake E-based start-up companies. But
it remains an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, E-commerce is taking place in Germany,'' said
Alexander Artope, a co-author of the European Communication
Council's report on the Internet economy. ``But other than
auctions, nothing's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has more Web users than either Britain or France; it has
one of the best telecommunications infrastructures in the world and
is awaiting the drop in Internet toll charges that should follow
the recent deregulation of its telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   But industry insiders put Germany anywhere from eight months to
five years behind the United States in E-commerce development.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer reluctance to give out financial information over the
Internet and unfamiliarity with credit card payment _ 80 percent of
Germans do not have credit cards _ present significant barriers to
Web browsing and buying.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the conservative business practices of the
traditional media publishing corporations that dominate Internet
business in Germany (only one of the top 10 content providers
offers Internet services exclusively, according to the New Media
Report, based in Munich), and it is no surprise that in Germany,
E-commerce has had a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a shortage of the kind of hard-charging,
baby-faced, overnight millionaires that have produced the dot-com
mania fueling start-ups across America.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Oliver Samwer and his colleagues, Scott Barnum,
Ebay's international general manager and vice president, said: ``In
the German Internet-commerce world, these guys are very atypical.
But they represent a new group of entrepreneurs that is trying to
take hold. They are successful role models for entrepreneurs, and
there haven't been that many success stories.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why this success story has entranced Germans. The
young men have become German media darlings, and with scores of
magazine articles and more than 15 television appearances under
their belts, they have set off a wave of young start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In the auction world alone, more than a hundred sites have
sprung up since Alando, now called Ebay Germany. The founders offer
consulting to fledgling entrepreneurships and have started Silicon
City, a social networking group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alando helped raise the attention for E-commerce ventures on a
large scale'' in Germany, said Christian Bachem, an on-line
strategy consultant based in Berlin. But, he added, Alando's
copycat model ``might be a viable trend in German E-commerce, but
it does not at all represent the German E-commerce market.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Samwer is enthusiastic about the nascent entrepreneurial
community he has helped to create, saying that his own team would
have welcomed the mentoring that it regularly dispenses to young
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But he looks back with nostalgia at the skin-of-their-teeth
route that the founders of Alando took, which included offering up
their own childhood model trains at a fraction of their value to
get the site going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he said, ``is still really sad about the trains.''

<P>
   A lot of words have been used to describe David Bowie, but
``conventional'' is not one of them. So it is probably not too
surprising that on Sept. 21 Bowie released his latest album _
``hours ...'' _ not in record stores but on the Internet. Just
download in Liquid Audio or Microsoft Audio 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell _ for about
$18, the list price of a compact disk _ a full-length recording in
a download format providing copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how many people will pay that much for an
unpackaged data file, even if it is the creation of a legendary
rocker, and skeptics have suggested that the album's title refers
to how long the download will take over an average modem.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reaction, Bowie's experiment is a response to
changes throughout the music industry brought on by the popularity
of MP3. Artists of every stripe are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the Internet has seen an explosion of legally
downloadable music by prominent artists. New music is now regularly
appearing on-line from the major labels, which have co-opted the
digital download trend as a direct-marketing gambit.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter of 1999 is expected to see a record number of
famous performers offering free audio samples on-line to entice
holiday purchases. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and Def Leppard
recently began new albums with on-line previews designed to build
anticipation before their release dates.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent
interview: ``The Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the
dog, or let the dog bite your leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, it was not so easy for the artists who early on
made their music available for downloading. At the time, Public
Enemy and the Beastie Boys fought their labels' demands to remove
MP3 files of their music from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Recording Industry Association of America, the
music industry trade group, was tracking down unauthorized MP3
distributors and formed the Secure Digital Music Initiative to
establish standards for protecting copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were this big band endorsing this thing the industry was
trying to be united against,'' Mike D (aka Mike Diamond) of the
Beastie Boys told The Wall Street Journal in December.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D _ Carlton Ridenhour _ put it more bluntly on
Sonicnet.com: ``The execs, lawyers and accountants who lately have
made most of the money in the music biz are now running scared from
the technology that evens out the creative field and makes artists
harder to pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys agreed to remove their MP3 files, live tracks
recorded on tour, in December. But by April, their label, Capitol
Records, had approved release of the group's remixes and video on
its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beastie Boys are a good example of the industry's shifting
mind-set on the Internet,'' said Hillary Rosen, the president and
chief executive of the Recording Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   They started out posting MP3 files on their Web site, ``and
getting a bit of hype out of having this public fight with their
label,'' she said. ``Their contract is up this year; they could
have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they signed a new deal with Capitol for a $30 or $40
million advance,'' Rosen said. ``They found that the existing
system had a lot of advantages for them _ No. 1, that they got a
lot of cash up front.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, on-line proponents were saying that digital
downloads would eliminate the need for record companies by allowing
artists to take music directly to audiences. Instead, the rise of
downloadable audio has spawned new companies like Emusic.com,
Mp3.com and Atomic Pop that are pioneering Internet strategies for
artist development, marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Al Teller, the founder and president of Atomic Pop, an Internet
label, is a former chairman and chief executive of MCA and
president of CBS Records. He speaks for underground and developing
artists when he says, ``There's an enormous frustration with how
many artists get lost in the system and the cost of doing business
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Teller pursued Public Enemy after hearing of the group's
differences with Def Jam Records over offering music for download.
Atomic Pop then put the group's album ``There's a Poison Goin' On''
on sale through download in May, two months before the CD went to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Pop, like other on-line labels, does not require artists
to sign long-term contracts or relinquish ownership of their master
recordings. Rather than offering artists an 8 percent to 12 percent
royalty on sales, as the major labels do, on-line labels give
artists a 50-50 net profit split.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement eliminates exceptions like ``free goods'' (CDs
given away for promotional purposes) that major labels use to
whittle away the base on which royalties are applied. Business
expenses for artist and label come off the top and must be
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it's much more favorable to the artists,'' said
Richard Grabel, a music lawyer with Grubman, Indursky &AMP; Schindler
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another frustrated performer was Greta Gaines. A former champion
professional snowboarder and an aspiring singer-songwriter, Gaines
signed with Giant Records in 1995. Soon afterward, Giant was
reorganized and renamed Revolution Records. New executives replaced
those who had promised to support Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the faith and guidance of people who loved my
music,'' she said. ``They said, `If you don't sell 250,000 units on
your first single, you're out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gaines completed an album for Giant/Revolution that was never
released and asked to cancel her contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so damaging to me for so many years,'' she said.
``Nobody would touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued to write and perform music, however. Three months
ago, while preparing to release a debut CD on her own label, she
posted three songs to Mp3.com as an experiment. The site, which
does not charge for the service, also enables artists to get E-mail
directly from visitors who download their music.
</P>
<P>
   Gratified and surprised by listeners' responses, Gaines quickly
revamped her postings to better represent the new album.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Mp3.com called to tell her that Alanis Morissette and
Tori Amos had selected her to open on their tour, sponsored by the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Now her single, ``FireFly,'' is getting limited airplay at adult
album alternative radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start selling records and my song starts doing well,''
she said, ``it will be a complete revolution in the odds an artist
has'' of hitting it big.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines says she will not sign with a major label.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go on to have a major rock career, it will largely be
based on the Internet,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler.
He had never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a
magazine advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he
was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, he found the Web site, keyed in his credit card,
played a few hands and won a couple of dollars. That was three
years ago. Now Mr. Lacey is more than $60,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maxed out seven credit cards,'' said Lacey, who recently
entered a gambling addiction program. ``I've got to get this
monster under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have come on line since 1995,
giving almost anyone with a computer and a credit card the chance
to gamble. Americans last year wagered an estimated $1 billion on
line in a form that thrives in a legal twilight zone as advances in
technology have outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   These cybercasinos are based offshore, many of them on Caribbean
islands, because gambling in the United States requires specific
legal permission. On-line casinos blur those legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Is it illegal for a woman in Ohio, for instance, to place a bet
with a cybercasino in Antigua? Does the betting occur in Ohio or in
Antigua?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that
would prohibit on-line gambling by giving judges the power to shut
down Internet providers who give Web sites to cybercasinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure last year 90 to 9, but it did
not come to a vote in the House of Representatives before Congress
adjourned. The bill is expected to come to the Senate floor again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on technology, said he thought that Internet gambling
already violated the law against sports betting, which, although
permitted in Las Vegas, was banned under the Federal Wire Act of
1961. But the law does not address nonsports betting.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1961 measure could eventually be irrelevant if satellite
transmission or radio waves replace telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, some states have taken separate approaches, none of
them altogether effective. Illinois and Louisiana have banned
Internet gambling. Minnesota is studying whether on-line wagering
could be regulated and licensed. And Missouri has taken court
action against on-line gambling providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, has filed a Federal
suit in Kansas City against the Coeur D'Alene Indian tribe in
Idaho, contending that the tribe's lottery and bingo Web site
violates Missouri's consumer laws, which prohibit the sale of
illegal goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meanwhile, contends that the wagering is legal
because it is based in a sovereign American Indian nation, where
wagering is permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also filed suit against a Pennsylvania man for running
an Internet gambling site. The man pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge last year and was fined $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutions of Internet gambling remain rarer than a poker
hand of four aces. Sue Schneider, who publishes an on-line magazine
on computer gambling, Interactive Gaming News, said it would be
impossible to stop people from wagering over the Internet. She said
that more than 500 sites offered gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, states and the Federal Government should
regulate the industry. Australia, she noted, has recently started
to license on-line casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could regulate them just like you regulate any land-based
gambling operation,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Meyer, the publisher of Rolling Good Times On-Line,
another Internet magazine that reports about on-line gambling, said
a prohibition would drive the industry underground. That would
leave consumers with no protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unregulated industry that desperately needs to be
regulated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line gambling has relatively few defenders. In June, the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, created by Congress,
called for a ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional sports leagues, as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, have called for the prohibition of
on-line wagering. The Las Vegas casino industry has called for a
ban as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming
Association, which represents the casino industry, said he scoffed
at the notion that his group's opposition to on-line gambling was
rooted in a fear of competition. He said the industry's chief
concern was that Internet gambling would tarnish all operators of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the ban, however, acknowledge that
enforcement could be difficult. And the Internet providers have
chafed at being forced to act as a sheriff expected to keep outlaws
out of a virtual Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, the Kyl measure would relieve
Internet providers of the responsibility to block on-line casinos
in two instances: if it was technologically impossible to block
access or if it was prohibitively burdensome to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While operators tend to be mysterious, surveys have gathered
some information about users. On-line gamblers tend to be white men
ages 20 to 40, often wagering on sports, said Kevin O'Neill, a
spokesman for the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sports betting is popular on the Internet, he said, ``because
everybody knows the outcome of a game _ you can't cheat on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line casinos typically set up accounts with customers that
debit a credit card. Losses are charged to the card, while winnings
are tallied as a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been relatively easy for on-line casinos to
open for business. Nearly two dozen of them are based in Antigua,
where a license can be bought for $100,000 or less, and there are
no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on gambling say on-line wagering removes most of the
social barriers that inhibit gambling. There is no travel. And it
can be done in private at home, so no one else has to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, the architect who lost $60,000 to Internet gambling, said
he started wagering on his computer as a way to forget off-line
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it as a means of escaping life's problems,'' he said.
``I was in a bad marriage. And I had the early stages of
Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling problem, he said, is a much fiercer foe than his
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkinson's, I can control that with medication,'' he
said. ``That gambling, that's a harder thing to control.''

<P>
   Click on Gucci.com and what do you get? A Web site under
construction. Point that browser toward Prada.com? There is a
picture of a smoldering model, but no handbags are available for
purchase. Perhaps, you think, a dress from Christian Dior.com? Oh,
you crazy fool-for-fashion you.
</P>
<P>
   While bookshops blossom and drugstores multiply, luxury vendors
have only tiptoed into the on-line space, which they perceive as a
little too low rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web works well for standardized products, but with fashion
you reinvent the product every six months, with new cuts and new
fabrics that look different in different lights,'' says Godo
Kraemer, the director of international public relations for Hugo
Boss, summing up the Zeitgeist of the elite houses.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek suit maker whose creations cost as much as $1,200 at
stores like Saks Fifth Avenue has plans for an informational site
only.
</P>
<P>
   And although merchants certainly will not acknowledge it, there
is also the Wichita (as in Kansas) problem. A large part of the
cost of any luxury item is its exclusive image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perceived lack of demand drives supply,'' said Mike May, who
follows the sector for Jupiter Communications, the Web research
company. ``The reason a Prada bag costs $450 is that you can only
get it at a very few exclusive shops. If anybody in the world could
buy a Prada bag, the name would lose some of its cachet.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the pashmina shawl set should not despair. The
lures for luxury's prime-time players to join the Web rush are
great. For one thing, counterfeit merchandise being sold on the Web
is a growing problem, and what better way to frustrate virtual
swindlers than to offer the merchandise through an official site.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also improving. Pictures of clothing on the Web
can lack texture and true color, but software advances will make it
possible this fall to see the weave of the Irish cable sweater
undulate in its full sumptuousness.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the alluring fact that the average Web user has
twice the income of the average American. Top style houses are
watching closely and have noticed that there are customers blithely
willing to plunk down $30,000 for diamond stud earrings or $15,000
for a Queen Anne dresser at an auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Many are now investigating how to exploit the medium without
angering the traditional retailers that are their biggest buyers.
One option may be to design clothing lines to be sold only on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Gucci and Hugo Boss dally, the Web is
beginning to fill with lesser-known, but not lesser-cost, purveyors
of couture, art and jewelry. People who want to shop for luxury
goods now will probably end up at a site that is category specific.
Everything from diamonds to antique automobiles has its own
peddler.
</P>
<P>
   Nextmonet.com, for example, hopes to lead well-compensated
professionals to their inner art collector. Most of its portfolio
is from mid-career artists who are ``underexposed,'' with works
costing $2,000 to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Nickelsen, the site's chief executive and co-founder,
describes her customers as ``people who drive BMWs and are ready to
graduate from posters but know nothing about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are not only introduced to artists and
their works but are offered art history lessons and industry
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of luxury site is a loosely knit front for a
dozen or more upscale retailers. Bestselections.com is essentially
a mall with a store roster that reads like a shopping diary for the
international jet set.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at this site can browse by antique jewelry selected by
Catherine Prevost, proprietor of a chic shop in the Knightsbridge
section of London, or order million-thread count sheets from
Roberta East Linens in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Styleclick.com offers a similar conglomeration-of-brands
approach, but instead of retailers it features wares from
manufacturers like Kenneth Cole, Anne Klein II and Trussardi
Leather.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning: such mix-and-match sites offer a limited
amount of merchandise from their vendors, and often the poorer
selection at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of our purchases are $500 or more,'' brags
Maurizio Vecchione, Styleclick's chief executive. Maybe, but plenty
of embroidered T-shirts for $32 can be had at his site as well.
Similarly, at Bagley Home, a farm antiques shop on
Bestselections.com, it is easier to find chenille bunnies and
beeswax candles than 18th-century armoires.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuryfinder.com, which is being introduced by the New York
social fixtures James Finkelstein and Pamela Gross this fall, aims
at a more ambitious model: a luxury portal that is the equivalent
of a social secretary for the wired billionaire set.
</P>
<P>
   The site will, of course, offer necessities like a Ghurka laptop
carrying case for $1,295 and a bottle of Chateau Lafite at $10,000.
Luxuryfinder.com, by the way, will eschew more common brands like
Coach Leather, which Gross called ``too low end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Luxuryfinder will provide services like a calendar of
society events and tips by Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, a
grandson of Consuela Vanderbilt, on how to behave like a British
aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambitious competitors have already shaken a few of luxury's
big names out of their ennui. The luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which owns couture houses like
Christian Dior and Givenchy, plans to test the Web waters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Sephora.com, the international cosmetics and beauty
retailer, which is 80 percent owned by LVMH, will go live. The rest
of the company's brands will follow. LVMH, which once saw the Web
as a threat, now sees it as a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone knows for sure how big the market is,
but the demographics are clear, the young affluent and aspiring
affluent customer are already there,'' said Myron Ullman, LVMH's
group managing director. ``So we will be, too.''

   BRAZIL-COFFEE (Alfenas, Brazil) _ Lured by a growing market for
high-end coffees, many Brazilian coffee producers are investing in
technology and changing their strategy to focus on quality instead
of quantity. Since Brazil produces roughly a third of the world's
estimated coffee output of 106.8 million bags _ each bag weighs 132
pounds _ the shift in priority to better-quality coffee could be
savored by consumers around the globe. And together with a parallel
quest to increase efficiency, which is resulting in higher yields
on Brazilian farms, better coffee could also mean cheaper coffee in
coming years. ``The stage where Brazilian coffee is at is similar
to where the California wine industry was in the 1970s,'' said
Michael Nugent, head of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.'s coffee desk in Napa,
Calif. By Simon Romero.

TOO MUCH OF THE VAUDEVILLE WILLIAMS IN `JAKOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The taming of Robin Williams has been an odd process. Movies try
to tamp down his ``Mork and Mindy'' unruliness, and his ad-libbing
and sweaty improv are relegated to the ``Tonight Show'' and
protracted Oscar stints.
</P>
<P>
   But his incidental allegiance to vaudeville casts a
discomforting pall over the Polish ghettos in Williams' latest
foray into unmitigated, but redemptive, tear-jerking.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1944, ``Jakob the Liar'' casts Williams as an interned
Jew who's lost his wife and his cafe at the hands of the Nazi
invasion. In the first scene of the film, Williams' Jakob Heym
chases a wind-blown newspaper through the dank, unpaved streets of
his camp.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the sequence, Williams' futile attempts to grab it
are freeze- framed, and you can see the constipated
half-frolicsome/half-righteous expression that Williams will make
again and again to convey the urgency of the film. He runs after
the floating paper until it wouldn't be at all surprising if he
wound up leaping over Forrest Gump's bench. Instead, Jakob comes
upon a row of bodies hanging from the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Directed with appropriate gravitas by Peter Kassovitz, who
adapted the film with Didier Decoin from Jurek Becker's novel,
``Jakob the Liar'' uses the Holocaust to tear you up, not make you
think. The two need not be mutually exclusive, but from the moment
Jakob overhears a radio news brief declaring that the Russians will
defeat the Germans and starts fabricating follow-up briefs to allay
his friends' fears, the film's heart is bleeding on its tattered
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Jakob the Liar'' is not the syrupy ``Life Is
Beautiful'' redux television spots and print ads make it look like
_ although there is an orphan girl (Hannah Taylor-Gordon) Jakob
hides in his attic and for whom he fakes BBC bulletins to cheer up.
Where Roberto Benigni's character used fibs to get his family
through the Holocaust, ``Jakob the Liar'' is a more conventional,
infinitely less ambitious story whose last act does seem ripped
from its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   When you find yourself thinking, ``I've already seen this
Holocaust story,'' something clearly has gone wrong with our
entertainment priorities. (In this case, the film also is a remake
of the 1974 German film of the same name.)
</P>
<P>
   There's such a rich trove of Holocaust stories that new ones
need the perspective of a personal account or an understanding of
its signs, images and circumstances to do more than make us cry _
without exploiting the tragedy in order to do so. ``Jakob the
Liar'' doesn't have the enveloping scope to be rousing or
provocative.
</P>
<P>
   At some point Jakob wonders, ``Why didn't God make us a race of
mice?'' It sounds like an incidental plug for ``Maus,'' Art
Speigelman's intrepid, shattering, two-part Holocaust graphic
novel, in which interned Jews are depicted as a race of mice. It's
a considerably more challenging, entertaining work whose lived-in
vision makes ``Jakob the Liar'' look like a collection of stock
characters and stick figures.
</P>
<P>
   The film is an ensemble production with one big wobbly accent
but with quiet and moving moments despite of their affectations.
Bob Balaban plays Jakob's barber friend, Liev Schreiber is an
aspiring boxer who tells everyone that Jakob has access to a radio,
and Alan Arkin is on hand to hear someone utter the line ``The
Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!''
</P>
<P>
   Armin Mueller-Stahl gives the best performance as a doctor who
refuses to tell the Nazis who owns the radio that has restored hope
to the ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   There's something decidedly allegorically Christian about most
Hollywood attempts to tell Holocaust stories. Jakob's radio
broadcasts get him labeled a ``prophet,'' and the Nazis' capture of
Jakob in their rabid search to find the nonexistent radio threatens
to make him a martyr. And though Kassovitz provides numerous fine
scenes with the supporting characters, it's Jakob's messianic
dignity, his ability to remain unwaveringly sacrificial even
through Nazi torture that the film finds heroic.
</P>
<P>
   More altruistic would be if Williams stopped torturing us with
weepy endearments so he could look for that complex clown who used
to mug just for laughs.

   FLOOD-FEMA _ PINETOPS, N.C. _ This crossroads town may bear the
worst scars of Hurricane Floyd's flooding. But the mayor hopes to
convince FEMA to set up a help center here. He believes that the
loss of a car will prevent residents from turning to the government
for help (apply for low interest loans and grants) since the
closest FEMA center is 15 miles away. The mayor is offering space
in town hall and a town employee to set up a center. A look at how
the federal and state governments and relief agencies are
responding. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH MAP AND

deposition that will shed light on details of her alleged affair
with Newt Gingrich during his five years as U.S. Hosue speaker. In
a sweeping subpoena reminiscent of that served to Monica Lewinsky
during the investigation into President Clintong, attorney John
Mayoue has asked for bank accounts, photographs, video and audio
recordings, day planners, all correspondence and any records
showing any financial connections between Newt Gingrich and Bisek.

   INTERNATIONALMEXICO-CARDENAS _ MEXICO CITY _ He ran for the
presidency twice and lost. Many Mexicans believe at least one
election may have been stolen from him. Then, a little more than
two years ago, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas became the first democratically
elected mayor of Mexico City, a powerful position. Cardenas was
hailed as the spiritual leader of Mexico's rising center-left
movement, which has gained ground by attacking Mexico's failed
ventures in free-market reforms and the ruling party's corrupt
record. The mayor's job was viewed as a springboard to Mexico's
presidential election in July 2000. But over the last two years,
Cardenas' popularity has dropped in polls. His problem, some
analysts say, is not so much his record as mayor; it's his persona
and his inability to communicate in Mexico's newly competitive
electoral culture. Cardenas is stepping down soon and starting his
presidential campaign in earnest. But most speculation now centers
not on his chances of winning, but rather on how he feels about a
united opposition front -- from right to left -- and whether he'd
be willing to step aside for another nominee should an alliance be
formed. (FERRIS, Cox News Service).

INCUMBENT PROSECUTOR GETS PLENTY OF HELP FROM OWN EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ District Attorney Terence Hallinan has raised
more than $130,000 in his re-election bid, including at least
$14,000 from his own employees, according to spending reports filed
with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bill Fazio, a former prosecutor who is challenging
Hallinan, has raised more than $60,000 and drawn considerable
support from San Francisco police officers who have ponied up more
than $3,500 for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Castleman, another former San Francisco prosecutor seeking
Hallinan's job, has raised very little money in contributions, only
$2,175. But Castleman has loaned his campaign $85,000, saying that
he needs to spend that kind of money to be competitive and gain
name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan collected $30,953 between July 1 and Sept. 18,
according to his campaign disclosure statement.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 151 people who contributed to the Hallinan campaign
during that time, 56 identified themselves as employees of the
prosecutor's office _ including dozens of assistant district
attorneys, a receptionist and a legal intern. Their contributions
for that period totaled more than $5,000. Hallinan's employees had
already doled out more than $9,000 to get him re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio, who worked for the district attorney's office for 20
years and lost in a close race to Hallinan four years ago, was able
to use his longstanding ties to law enforcement personnel to gain
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   A partial list of contributions to Fazio shows $3,650 from 20
present or former San Francisco Police Department personnel, plus
$500 more from the San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs Association.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio received contributions from more than 250 people or
organizations, totaling $60,872.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio was fired in 1995 by Hallinan's predecessor, Arlo Smith,
several hours after announcing his plan to run for election against
his boss. A year ago, Fazio settled a wrongful termination lawsuit
against the city for $45,000 and an apology from Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Financial disclosure forms for the remaining candidates, Matthew
Gonzalez and Mike Schaefer, were not immediately available. In
earlier interviews, Gonzalez said he collected less than $20,000
and Schaefer said he has loaned himself $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan, Fazio and Gonzalez had agreed to abide by voluntary
campaign spending limits that would limit their expenditures to
$175,000 in the general election. But Castleman declined to abide
by the limits, saying the spending cap was artificially low and
unfairly hampered challengers.

A Y2K TEST OF BANK ACCOUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a question about an e-mail forwarded to
me on testing my PC for Y2K compliance. It says to test whether
Microsoft has missed setting the ``Short Date Sample'' to a
four-digit year (mm/dd/yyyy). I found that my system was set for
two y's, causing application software to roll over to the year 00
instead of 2000. Is this a problem, or is this hype to get a
consultant to come in and earn his pay?
</P>
<P>
   _ Double-Digit Dilemma
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DOUBLE: I'm deeply troubled by your cynicism. Do you really
think that anybody would take advantage of all the confused and
undereducated computer owners all over the world already inundated
with apocalyptic Y2K drivel? Hmmmm. I wonder if it's too late to
become a Y2K con man. Uh, I meant ``consultant,'' of course.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail you received is completely bogus. I've seen about a
hundred copies of it so far, and it generally starts with ``Every
copy of Windows will fail on January 1st unless you fix it now.''
Big deal. Millions of copies of Windows fail every day anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail tells you how to set the Short Date Style so that it
displays a four-digit year, and nothing about the instructions will
actually harm anything. It's a waste of time, though, since Windows
already stores and processes all dates in a four-digit format.
Short Date is a display setting only. As long as you've been
keeping up-to-date on Windows service releases and patches, the
only thing you have to worry about on New Year's Day is where you
left your car keys.
</P>
<P>
   What's disturbing is how gullible people can be when it comes to
these e-mail hoaxes. Sprinkle a smattering of meaningless
technobabble and a few phony quotes into a letter, and pretty soon
there's a Net-wide panic about some imaginary new software bug or
virus. As a general rule of thumb, never believe anything you read
in an unsolicited e-mail, unless it's that one from me describing
my inexpensive Y2K services.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4100C scanner.
I would like to know how to e-mail scanned items. These scanners do
not come with any written directions, and the CD doesn't give any
information. I called HP support, and they want $25 an hour to talk
to you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scan Scam
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SCAM: You seemed to have forgotten to include your $50
check or money order for my consultation fee. You can owe me,
because I bought the 4200 and was appalled to find _ instead of a
manual _ a single sheet of pictographs obviously intended to
instruct some distant alien race how to phone home. The
accompanying text was borrowed, I believe, from my first-grade
primer. See scanner. See scanner run.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned, easy-to-use books just aren't cost-efficient.
Manufacturers would rather distribute manuals in electronic form,
leaving it up to you to print them. A classy company like HP puts
just about everything you need to know about your scanner on its
Web site. I suppose it just assumes everybody has Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   I found most of what you need to know in a couple of minutes at
www.hp.com (go into the Support section), but you can probably do
just as well by trial and error. Basically, scan a picture, save it
somewhere, and use your e-mail program's attachment option to stick
it in a letter. If you're starting with a printed page, your
scanner software has an option to convert the scan into editable
text. But, you know, the printed word is highly overrated. I think
next week's column will be done with stick figures instead.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay's editors prefer to think that only his
printed words are overrated. Reach him at
drbombay(at)star-telegram.com or via snail-mail at Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX 76101. Fax: (817) 390-7257.

 UNDATED: two (Maslin). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
( Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age
mush (think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIGMATA,' starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne and
Jonathan Pryce. Directed by Rupert Wainwright (R, 102 minutes).
When Frankie Paige (Ms. Arquette), a vapid Pittsburgh hairdresser,
receives the present of a rosary lifted from the dead body of a
Brazilian priest, her life becomes a supernatural horror show.
Byrne is the Vatican cleric who investigates the case and Pryce the
evil cardinal who wants to cover up evidence that could damage the
church. The seizures in this poorly acted melange of shock effects
and religious imagery are bargain-basement ``Exorcist.'' Instead of
pea soup and spinning heads, we get breaking glass, dripping blood
and flurries of feathers from agitated doves (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STIR OF ECHOES,' starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
Directed by David Koepp (R, 99 minutes). Another little boy talks
to a ghost at the start of this thriller, but it isn't an instant
``Sixth Sense'' sequel. Instead it shows what happens when the
boy's closed-minded father lets himself be hypnotized and awakens
to find himself receiving otherworldly stimuli. Bacon gives a
grippingly intense performance as a man terrified by his new
extrasensory powers. And Koepp conveys a potent sense of what it
means to unravel. Despite its strong, spooky start and early
momentum, the film winds up with too earthbound an explanation for
the havoc it unleashes (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SUGAR TOWN,' starring Rosanna Arquette, Ally Sheedy, Beverly
D'Angelo, Jade Gordon, John Taylor and John Doe. Directed by
Allison Anders and Kurt Voss (R, 92 minutes). An Altmanesque
cross-section of California show-biz strivers, and a film with an
inordinate supply of strong, funny female characters. Made so
quickly that its actors' obvious enthusiasm never has a chance to
flag, it illuminates such subjects as power dating and the travails
of a has-been rock band. Ms. Sheedy is especially memorable as the
walking embodiment of every self-help fad and Type A trait. But
it's not easy to pick a favorite character in this warm, knowing
ensemble comedy (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE 13TH WARRIOR,' starring Antonio Banderas and Omar Sharif.
Directed by John McTiernan (R, 103 minutes). Set in the 10th
century and adapted from a novel by Michael Crichton, this
grunting, sweating, blood-gushing medieval answer to professional
wrestling is inspired by Ahmed Ibn Fadhlan's historical account of
his adventures in Central Asia. Banderas plays an exiled Persian
poet who hooks up with a group of Norse warriors to do battle with
an evil tribe of flesh eaters. The screenplay is monosyllabic, but
the action scenes, which take you into the thick of battle, are
excitingly photographed. A charging score by Jerry Goldsmith helps
ennoble the grisly derring-do (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CHAOS AND COMEDY: THE FILMS OF BLAKE EDWARDS.' A 12-film
retrospective devoted to Blake Edwards winds up this weekend at the
American Museum of the Moving Image with a four-film outburst of
comedy, romance, satire and farce highlighted by a dialogue with
the filmmaker himself at 2 p.m. Saturday. The appearance by
Edwards, the director of more than 50 films and the creator of the
Pink Panther series, follows a 2 p.m. screening of his 1979 hit,
``10,'' which starred Dudley Moore and Bo Derek as the object of
his midlife desires. At 5:30 p.m., the attraction is ``S.O.B.,''
the 1981 satire in which Edwards vented his spleen on Hollywood.
Sunday's attractions include a 2 p.m. screening of ``Darling Lili''
(1970), with Julie Andrews (Mrs. Edwards) as a World War I German
spy, and a 5 p.m. screening of ``Victor/Victoria'' (1982), the
musical farce starring Ms. Andrews that later became a Broadway
musical (Van Gelder).

GIANTS' CANDLESTICK ERA NEARS AN END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN SHEA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If the San Francisco Giants had to keep playing
at Candlestick Park, they would no longer be playing at
Candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from Peter Magowan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team would've been put up for sale and sold,'' Magowan
said, ``and the buyer would've been from out of the area and
National League baseball would've disappeared forever.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Candlestick's farewells would have happened long ago,
not in the next week when the Giants conclude a 40-year run with
games against the Arizona Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Magowan is the managing general partner of the ownership group
that saved the Giants by buying the team from Bob Lurie, who saved
the Giants by buying the team from Horace Stoneham, who stuck the
Giants at Candlestick in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   What Lurie couldn't do, and Stoneham wouldn't do, Magowan did.
He is building a replacement for the 'Stick near downtown,
alongside a stretch of water, with sweeping views of the San
Francisco Bay, sailboats and a bridge _ and, the team is confident,
fewer weather problems.
</P>
<P>
   Magowan believes that Pacific Bell Park, scheduled to open in
April, will be more comfortable than its predecessor, which he
called ``a stadium of concrete on a cul-de-sac with symmetrical
dimensions and chain-link fences.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubbing it in further, he said, ``The only thing that gave it
any character was the weather and the elements. What was special
about Candlestick other than the wind? From an architectural point
of view, there's nothing to characterize it as unique.''
</P>
<P>
   In any conversation, Magowan plugs the $300-million Pac Bell
Park, so he added, ``Uniqueness is what makes a great ballpark, and
our new ballpark will have a lot of things that will be very
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Candlestick Park has been Magowan's home for seven years, since
his group bought the team after the 1992 season, but he has been
around the Giants much longer. His first big-league game was at New
York's Polo Grounds in 1950, a year before Willie Mays came along,
and his family moved to San Francisco in 1957, a year before the
Giants moved west.
</P>
<P>
   He vividly recalls the Candlestick opening in 1960, after the
Giants played two seasons at Seals Stadium, and remembers the
infamous line of Vice President Richard Nixon, who attended the
opener: ``San Francisco can say this is the finest ballpark in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Magowan said he ``never felt when Candlestick was built that it
was what it was described by Nixon and other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was new and state of the art. Just as Pac Bell will
be. Which leads to this thought: Will Pac Bell stand the test of
time? Will owners be lobbying for a new facility in 2040 to replace
antiquated Pac Bell Park?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it'll be a ballpark people will want o come to in 30, 40
years,'' Magowan said. ``It'll provide security that the Giants
never really enjoyed since the Bay Area became a two-team market.
We almost moved twice, in 1976 and 1992, and the (Oakland) A's
almost moved at least twice. People can now fall in love with the
Giants because they're going to be here for the long term, and
that's a statement we couldn't make in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell Park has put Magowan and Co. in extreme debt. The
ballpark's privately financed effort required a $170 million bank
loan. The team still owes $25 million on the 1992 purchase and the
new debt-service obligation is $20 million per year for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for the $300-million ballpark, the team will receive
$115 million from charter seats and corporate sponsorships,
including naming rights, and $15 million in tax increment financing
from the city's Redevelopment Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Considering their $20 million annual payment, how can the Giants
continue competing in a division of big-time spenders, including
Los Angeles, Arizona and Colorado? Two of the teams _ the
Diamondbacks and Denver Rockies _ received sweetheart, publicly
financed ballpark deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can compete at Candlestick, how the hell can we not
compete at the new ballpark?'' Magowan said.

 &HT;    AMERICAN GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS FACING DISDAIN, DERISION IN
EUROPE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 26 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COBHAM, England _ Phoebe Eubanks parks her shopping cart on the
canned vegetable aisle in this affluent village's Waitrose
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   She picks up a can of ``American-style'' sweet corn and rolls it
in her hand to study the back of the label. ``Nothing here,'' she
says. ``It doesn't say whether there is any GM in it, does it? But
then it's from America.''
</P>
<P>
   She places the can back on the shelf. ``It may not be logical,
and maybe some people would call me hysterical, but I don't want to
feed my family food that's been mucked around with,'' Eubanks says
as she rolls on down the aisle. ``They can sell it, but I won't buy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her feelings are understandable in a country where GM, or
genetically modified, food routinely is associated with
``Frankenstein,'' the quintessential parable of man's misguided
faith in science.
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings are becoming a real-life horror story for U.S.
trade and agriculture. If European consumers such as Eubanks can't
be convinced to buy genetically engineered food, then U.S. farmers
will have no market here.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Eizenstat, the future deputy treasury secretary,
recognized this grim reality when he told Congress a few weeks ago
that the GM issue is ``the single greatest trade threat that we
face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 100 percent of our agricultural exports in the next
five years will be genetically modified or combined with bulk
commodities that are genetically modified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Europe bans GM products, it bans U.S. farm
products.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the GM debate has been escalating into a nasty
dispute between the United States and Europe. Responding to
consumer sentiment, European officials have been anything but eager
to open the continent to either GM crops or products. Last summer,
European environment ministers imposed what amounts to a moratorium
on GM products, making an already messy struggle between the United
States and Europe over food policy even messier.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy also is making life complicated for Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who has been in favor of GM testing at the
expense of his dwindling support among his Labor Party greens. The
GM issue threatens to overshadow the party's annual conference,
which opens Monday(9/27) in the seaside resort of Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's government, which has been sharply criticized for its
position, six weeks ago formed a multi-agency emergency group to
deal with the public animus. Thus far, its success is hard to
measure.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey shows that GM food has become Britain's No. 1 food
safety issue, with 50 percent of the public rating it their most
pressing concern.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, as the British press savaged the GM
industry, public opposition has steadily risen, according to the
research firm Mintel. Now nearly a fifth of the 1,000 adults
surveyed said they would never knowingly eat or feed their family
anything containing GM ingredients. Women, who tend to make most
decisions here about food purchases, expressed the strongest
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to show solidarity with consumers, grocery store chains,
pubs and restaurants have reacted by jumping to proclaim themselves
``GM-free.''
</P>
<P>
   And celebrities of the stature of Prince Charles and Sir Paul
McCartney have come out against GM food.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, McCartney, the former Beatle, recalled millions of
dollars worth of frozen vegetarian dinners marketed by the company
he started with his late wife Linda after traces of GM food were
discovered in the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is enough evidence about the problems
which might arise through GM food,'' McCartney said at a news
conference. ``I don't think people are worrying unnecessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, consumers probably couldn't buy GM foods in Britain
if they wanted them. No GM crops are being commercially grown in
Britain, and a fury of opposition has driven the products from
market shelves. Moreover, the only two GM products legal for sale
in Britain are corn and soybean products, a far cry from the 50 or
so available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even the idea of testing GM crops has been unwelcome. In recent
weeks, eco-warriors have been descending upon farms in the
hinterlands, defiantly yanking up test crops of GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials now want testing to be done clandestinely to
avoid such sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sober reassurances of government officials and
scientists, the public's distaste for GM products has only
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Many people _ particularly Americans _ have a hard time
understanding the vehemence of the European response. Certainly
nobody has been more surprised than Monsanto, the American
life-sciences company that owns patents on several GM crops.
Monsanto has been demonized in the British press as the evil force
behind the GM invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction here to the technology has been in stark contrast
to the mild reaction in the United States, the largest producer of
GM foods. In 1998, 40 percent of America's corn crop and 45 percent
of its soybeans were genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, with its long accepted federal
monitoring over agriculture and food safety, there is no central
food protection agency in Europe. These roles are divided between
the 15 countries in the European Union and the EU bureaucracy, but
the public has shown little faith in these institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is launching a food safety agency, consolidating the
responsibilities of a half-dozen bureaucracies. However, it will be
years before it can gain credibility. Also, its power is limited by
the EU's primacy in food and agriculture, a reality that provides
suspicious Britons little comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in Britain is generally thought to be rooted in the
country's experience in 1996 with ``mad cow disease,'' when it was
discovered that British cattle had developed a brain-killing
ailment. Despite government denials and reassurances, the disease,
known as BSE, was determined to pose a direct threat to humans.
This led to a costly ban on British beef and the slaughter of
thousands of animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, the hysteria in Britain was partly fueled by our
whole experience with . . . mad cow disease,'' David Cove, a
professor of genetics at the University of Leeds, said in a recent
interview. ``Although this has absolutely nothing to do with
genetic engineering, the public doesn't really realize that, and
they see it as the application of technology without first
assessing the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to GM food rest their objections on three main claims.
The first is that genetic manipulation is unnatural and therefore
evil. They argue that the food it produces is dangerous, and the
technology is bad for the environment because of the potential for
unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates note that no crops are truly natural because farmers
have been tampering with genetic makeup for thousands of years.
Also, no scientifically reputable test has shown GM foods to have
any ill effects on humans.
</P>
<P>
   The third objection is thornier because less is known about the
consequences of what happens when genetically modified plants mix
in the natural environment. Will they also change the plants around
them, leading to super chemical resistant weeds or some other
unintended and perhaps toxic by-product? No one seems to know for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   As these issues have been debated on this side of the Atlantic,
Washington has begun to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department recently announced its first
long-term study of GM foods and the environment. There also is
fresh talk in the United States of labeling GM foods, already a
requirement in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman acknowledged recently
that there may be no option: ''With all that biotechnology has to
offer, it is nothing if it's not accepted by consumers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 49-yar-old single mother. I have a profit-sharing plan
in which there is approximately $6,000, and I must decide what to
do with the money soon or the company will send it to me and I will
have to pay taxes on it. A friend of mine suggested I put the money
in a money market fund with Vanguard until I decide what to do with
it. My friend suggested these Vanguard funds: Growth and Income,
Growth Index, Balanced Index, Asset Allocation, and LifeStrategy
Growth. Which one of these would you suggest, or which of the many
others they have do you think I should be in?
</P>
<P>
   I also have a 401(k) plan at work where there is another $6,000,
with 10 percent in Scudder U. S. Treasury money market fund, 30
percent in Scudder Income fund, 20 percent each in Scudder
Balanced, Scudder Growth and Income, and Scudder Value funds. There
are a number of other options, and my friend suggests I should be
in Scudder Growth and Income, Scudder International, and Invesco
Dynamics funds. I told him this is all the money I will have for my
retirement and know I need to be more aggressive, but I will really
need this money when I retire. I can only afford to put $15 a week
in the account at this time, although when my son finishes college
next year I may be able to put in a little more. My friend told me
to ask you.
</P>
<P>
   K.K., Norwood &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think your friend basically knows what he is doing, but has
overlooked one major factor. That is that the best hint you can get
about a person's appetite for risk is to look at their existing
investments. With 40 percent of your 401(k) savings in money market
and bond funds, youve given a clear hint that youre nervous about
committing a lot of your money to the inevitable slings and arrows
of the stock markets. Even when you have looked to the stock
markets you have hedged your bets, choosing a balanced fund which
keeps a big part of its portfolio in fixed-income investments,
selecting a growth and income fund rather than a pure growth fund,
and selecting a value fund rather than a blend or growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   Your current 401(k) portfolio works out to about 50 percent
stocks and 50 percent fixed-income holdings. That is indeed a
pretty conservative portfolio for a person who is 16 years away
from a typical retirement age. I, too, think you should be more
aggressive, but I'm not going to suggest that you change your
entire investment style.
</P>
<P>
   How about moving from 50 percent on the fixed-income side to 33
percent, in both the 401(k) account and in the money which you will
be moving from the profit-sharing plan, presumably into a rollover
IRA?
</P>
<P>
   For the account at Vanguard, I am going to follow the hints you
have given me through the makeup of your 401(k) portfolio. I
suggest 30 percent in Vanguard Windsor II, which is a large-cap,
value-oriented fund, and the rest in Vanguards LifeStrategy
Conservative Growth fund. The latter is a hybrid of sorts,
investing its assets in shares of other Vanguard funds. On the
stock side, which represents 45 percent of the portfolio, it holds
Vanguard Asset Allocation, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, and
(a small position) in Star Total International fund. The larger
fixed-income portfolio holds Vanguard Total Bond Market Index and
Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 401(k), I suggest you trim the Scudder Income fund
position to 20 percent of the portfolio, eliminate the money market
holding altogether, and build the Scudder Balanced fund position to
25 percent of the portfolio. Those moves build the fixed-income
side to roughly a third, while eliminating the holding with the
least growth potential -- that money market fund. These moves would
leave you with 15 percent of your money to be reinvested. My
suggestion is that all of this go into the Scudder Growth and
Income fund, building that position to 35 percent of the total
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I suggest you align your ongoing contributions
similarly, and once a year realign the portfolio so that you
maintain these percentages. Only about five years before you
anticipate retiring should you begin to make changes, at that point
beginning to move the money toward a less aggressive portfolio. I
think it would be reasonable to expect such a portfolio to deliver
average annual returns of 8 percent over the long haul. With
contributions at current levels, you would thus build a pool of
$65,444 by age 65 -- and of course more if you increase
contributions after your sons graduation from college.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 30-year-old making just over $100,000 a year and with
very little debt -- approximately $1,000 on my Visa card. I have
these investments in my companys 401(k) plan: $12,885 in American
Century Twentieth Century International Growth, $5,922 in American
Century Twentieth Century Ultra fund, and $15,561 in Invesco Growth
fund. I invest the maximum each year, and my employer matches 50
percent of my contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Other investments include $5,900 in AIM Value fund class B
shares, $4,100 in Alliance Quasar class B shares, and $3,000 in
Janus Global Technology. I also have approximately $17,000 in a
money market account.
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking of dumping the Quasar fund because of poor
performance. The AIM fund has performed well, but has high
management fees and a back-end load of 5 percent. I hope to be
married in the next couple of years, and to purchase a house two
years after that. I have $15,000 to invest per year, not including
my IRA. Should I add an IRA, either Roth or traditional? What can I
do to strengthen or balance this portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   C.V., Boston &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Given your quite long investment time frame, I wouldnt make a
lot of changes in the 401(k) fund. Perhaps you might want to reduce
the International Growth position by about half, dividing the
proceeds between the two other funds and limiting additional
contributions to International Growth to about 20 percent. But your
aggressive all-stock stance is correct in your situation.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about the three taxable accounts raises a number of
questions. If you view these as supplemental retirement accounts, I
would make no change except the first one you suggest --
eliminating Alliance Quasar. If these are retirement accounts, I
would substitute Fidelity Select Health Care for that position. I
see no reason to abandon AIM Value simply because of its fee
structure. The bottom line shows the fund to be a top performer,
and given the rear-end load you would face if you quit, you have an
extra incentive to stay on board.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you view these accounts simply as generic
savings, and probably funds to be called upon when you buy a house
in four or five years, I would make dramatic changes in the taxable
fund portfolio -- selling all of it and putting half in a
short-term bond fund and the rest in a balanced fund such as
Fidelity Puritan or Vanguard Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, yes, you do want to establish a Roth IRA right away.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: If you contribute $10,000 a year to your 401(k)
and your employer adds $5,000 a year in matching funds, you would
accumulate $3,180,456 in that tax-deferred account over the course
of 30 years, presuming 10 percent average annual portfolio growth.
That is all tax-deferred money, and when you reach the age of
mandatory withdrawals, it will represent significant tax
liabilities. So money invested in a Roth IRA, where withdrawals can
be taken on a tax-free basis, will give you a lot of much-needed
financial flexibility in your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. With all the hoopla about Y2K, do you think we will be in for
a big selloff at years end?
</P>
<P>
   I am age 72 and am heavily invested in Janus Fund, Strongs Blue
Chip fund, and Vanguards Index 500. I am also in Vanguards Growth
and Income and Wellington funds.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   G.M., Easton, Pa. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you consider yourself a long-term investor, my suggestion
would be to ignore the Y2K brouhaha. My guess is that there will be
selling pressure on the markets surrounding the big date --
followed by even greater buying power after the date passes and the
sky doesnt fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I think the markets are high in general, and
especially for a person of your age, I would look to move toward a
more conservative portfolio -- leaning more toward holdings such as
Vanguard Wellington and similar funds, and relying less on the
large-cap growth funds which dominate your current portfolio.

AT 77, KURT VONNEGUT RETAINS IMPISH WIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Vonnegut's face is lined like fine leather now, his flyaway
hair is styled by the breeze and his cough, from decades of three
daily packs of Pall Malls, is downright frightful. But 76 years of
life have not dimmed in the slightest his devilish wit or his
mischievous nature.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a cosmic giggle bubbling just below the
surface of Vonnegut's whole being, maybe an eighth of a inch below
the epidermis, and usually unleashed with a conspiratorial wink of
an eye. He is willing to provide a serious answer to a serious
question for a few minutes, but then the Indianapolis native grows
impatient and can't stop himself from cracking wise or sardonic or
just plain silly.
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut may be one of America's most acclaimed and most popular
writers, a most unusual mix of literary artist and public
celebrity, and why that is is no great mystery to the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my big boobs,'' Vonnegut cracked in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the twin cornerstones of his fame, at
least in his own humble estimation. There is his three-minute cameo
in a 1986 Rodney Dangerfield movie (``Back to School''), in which
Vonnegut played Vonnegut and was enlisted by Dangerfield to write a
school paper on none other than Kurt Vonnegut. That prompted the
teacher to proclaim that the author of the school paper ``did not
know the first thing about Kurt Vonnegut.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is mock graduation speech, mistakenly attributed
to Vonnegut, that was spread across the Internet in 1997 and is
still a cause of frequent comment to Vonnegut himself. Its instant
distribution only confirmed his virulent bias against new
technology, but he remains sweet-natured about the speech, actually
written by a Chicago Tribune columnist.
</P>
<P>
   So when Vonnegut stepped to the Town Hall podium Wednesday
evening, one of the things he did before the assembled multitude
(900-plus Vonnegut fans) was make reference to the prime advice of
that graduation speech: ``I hope you're all wearing sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut's appearance was occasioned by a new book of old
stories, ``Bagombo Snuff Box'' (Putnam, 295 pages, $24.95). These
23 short stories, dating from the early 1950s, were the work of a
novice free-lance writer for the general interest magazines of the
day, a recent escapee from the public relations mill at General
Electric in Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   These are amiable, bittersweet stories, often with O. Henry-like
twists and turns, stories that are accomplished but decidedly
1950s, with their junior execs and homemakers and high school band
hijinks. These stories display only slight hints of the writer that
fellow writer Jay McInerney has aptly described as ``a satirist
with a heart, a moralist with a whoopee cushion, a cynic who wants
to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bagombo Snuff Box'' is, in essence, a Vonnegut archeological
dig that is mainly interesting for the answer it provides to the
question of ``where did this wacked-out writer come from?'' That
answer seems to be: ``Up from near-normalcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut had kept no trace of these early works because, as he
admits in his introduction, ``I didn't think I'd amount to a hill
of beans.'' But his friend, professor Peter Reed of the University
of Minnesota, unearthed the stories that had appeared in such
publications as the Saturday Evening Post and Collier's and
Cosmopolitan and they are now being published in book form for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Some writers might prefer that their raw-boned early works would
R.I.P., but Vonnegut is not among them. All of his 19 past books
remain in print, a rare thing these days and a cause of pride for
him, and having his early short stories join the collection between
covers seems perfectly appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as Vonnegut stressed, ``I'm in the business, for
godsakes. People hate to hear artists are in it for the money, too.
They like think we're like priests or something. But this new book
was partly for the money and partly because I like to be read. It's
what I do for a living and I never want to hide that from people.''
</P>
<P>
   This comment is typical Vonnegut. Anything high-falutin' is
poison to this socialist, atheist and Hoosier at heart. ``I never
felt,'' he readily admitted, ``I had a sacred calling to be an
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Vonnegut has penned some truly remarkable books, many
written decades ago and still widely read, especially by succeeding
generations of students. They continue to write him with what has
become a kind of mantra from readers: ``I never really read anybody
until I read you.''
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut's remarkable books include what is widely hailed as his
masterpiece, ``Slaughterhouse Five,'' his 1969 novel inspired by
his survival as a German prisoner of war during the Allied
firebombing of Dresden that claimed 135,000 lives and obliterated
one of Europe's cultural treasures. These books also include
``Cat's Cradle'' (1963), which Vonnegut terms ``the flagship of my
fleet'' since it brought him his first public acclaim, ``Breakfast
of Champions'' (1973) and ``Jailbird'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut demurred when pressed about what explains his
long-standing success with both critics and the public. ``That's
for somebody else to explain _ you're asking me to be vain,'' he
insisted. ``I'm just a writer who wrote what he was born to write
and was fortunate to break the bank at Monte Carlo.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vonnegut did finally provide telling analysis of his
success, under further questioning: ``It's because I'm a very
sociable writer who is cordial to the reader. I never appeared to
be putting myself forward as a star.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Vonnegut's pointed humor often seemed aimed at himself
almost as much as such favorite targets as politicos, warmakers and
stuffed shirts of any stripe.
</P>
<P>
   So in ``Fates Worse Than Death,'' a 1991 collection of his
essays and commentaries, Vonnegut made brief mention of his failed
suicide attempt with this description: ``I went briefly apesh _ in
the 1980s in an effort to get out of life entirely, but wound up
playing Eightball in a locked ward for 30 days instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Depression still shadows Vonnegut, in his words, ``coming and
going like the tides.'' But as he nears 77, Vonnegut is a person at
peace with himself and what his life has produced, so much so that
he has no plans to write any more novels. He has had his say and it
has been heard.
</P>
<P>
   Some might expect Vonnegut's epitaph to be the sardonic phrase
heard repeatedly in ``Slaughterhouse Five'' _ ``So it goes.'' But
Vonnegut has decided upon another phrase for his tombstone:
``Everything was wonderful, and nothing hurt.''

IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT MONEY: CO-FOUNDER WANTS COMPANY TO BE DRIVEN BY
VALUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to be a good company?
</P>
<P>
   That may depend on your definition of good.
</P>
<P>
   Does it mean hefty profits at the end of each quarter? Or happy,
productive employees? Or environmentally sensitive products?
</P>
<P>
   Or can it be all three?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Chappell, co-founder of Tom's of Maine, tells us that it not
only can, but should be all three. And connecting all three can
make a successful, good company.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it building value with values.
</P>
<P>
   Before you dismiss this concept as something developed by a
Harvard Divinity School graduate, consider that it's also written
by the chief executive of a thriving $30 million company in the
fiercely competitive world of personal care products.
</P>
<P>
   If you need further proof that the values-driven business can
have an effect on the marketplace, consider what the competition
said in a ``New York Times'' article about Tom's of Maine. Ralph
Larsen, chairman of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, told the newspaper that
Chappell's company is ``charting a new course.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chappell is more than adamant about putting your deepest
values into your business _ he's talking revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in business, even those who in their personal
lives are sensitive to social and environmental concerns, believe
that such values have no place in the marketplace,'' he writes.
``They do. And every one of us has a moral obligation to serve our
communities and protect our environment. We do not give up that
obligation, that `stewardship,' when we go into business.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand him; Chappell says he's out to make a buck
just as much as the next guy. And he's finding the stronger his
commitment to his values, the more profitable his company is
becoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have transformed my own company, Tom's of Maine, into a
successful, well-known counterexample to the 350-year-old premise
of capitalism that the self-interested pursuit of profit is king,''
he writes. ``Don't get me wrong. The marketplace is not church.
Business is definitely about making money. But it is not ``only''
about making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking that business philosophy and turning it into reality
takes work, however. In training his managers, Chappell came up
with a seven-step program to help what he calls ``managing upside
down.'' The program is now written down in a book by Chappell
titled ``Managing Upside Down: The Seven Intentions of
Values-Centered Leadership'' (William Morrow and Co., 220 pages,
$).
</P>
<P>
   It no doubt will get the same attention from the business
community that made his last book, ``The Soul of a Business'' a
bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   The intentions show managers how to focus on the overriding
philosophy of the company when making day-to-day decisions. Among
the intentions are to seek advice _ from everyone who'll talk to
you about your company; connect to the power of goodness;
constantly assess your accountability; and pass on anything you
receive to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Managing Upside Down, power flows in the opposite direction
_ from the market, customers and employees,'' he writes. ``In a
values-driven company, innovation can come from anywhere; indeed,
the main responsibility of a values-oriented leader is to encourage
new ideas to come from everywhere. ... The muses of creativity do
not care about job titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Chappell started his company in 1982 with a baking
soda toothpaste, his business philosophy didn't solidify until
1989, after what he terms a mid-life crisis and a desire to get out
of business altogether. After incorporating what he learned at
Harvard, suddenly, Tom's was able to come up with 70 new products
within two years. The company won all sorts of business awards and
received extensive media coverage, with no public relations firm on
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along the way, Tom's of Maine has become a kind of laboratory
for what I believe will be a new paradigm for corporate America
that will replace inflexible autocracies with a partnership between
managers and their employees, building value by values,'' Chappell
writes.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how far the experiment goes.

   ``Wake Me When It's Time to Work: Surviving Meetings, Office
Games, and the People Who Love Them''
</P>
<P>
   By T.R. Edel
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Publishing Co., $16.95
</P>
<P>
   Written by a retired senior programmer in the computer industry,
this book tries to put some reality into how large corporations
really work. Author T.R. Edel doesn't name company names, but he
does provide insight from his 35 years of working for a large
corporation and concentrates on the darker side of corporate life
to enlighten the idealist. Simply put, he argues to get what you
can out of a company and, if necessary, move on. Don't bring
emotions such as loyalty into your career.

   ``How to Be A Value Investor: Essential Guides to Today's Most
Popular Investment Strategies''
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Holton
</P>
<P>
   McGraw Hill, $16.95
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy looking for tarnished jewels, value investing may
be your most profitable stock-buying strategy, business writer Lisa
Holton says. Value investing means concentrate on the basic
financials and management of a company to find if it is ripe for a
buyout, or if its competitor's success is starting to fall off or
some other piece of news that you can obtain, act on and watch the
stock price ride up. Of course, the level of risk is higher, too.
This book covers the basics on how to look at this strategy touted
by the likes of Warren Buffett.

   Author Anthony Parinello has been successfully hitting the

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been covering religion for years, and have dealt with some
unbelievable scandals, emotional events such as the visits of the
pope and upheavals in major denominations.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing prepared me for what happened last week when a
gunman burst into Wedgwood Baptist Church and killed seven people
and wounded seven others before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, I happened to be the one to call the Rev.
Al Meredith, pastor of the neighborhood church, to ask him about
police reports of shootings at his church. He had not heard.
</P>
<P>
   He was at home, rather that at his church, because he had just
returned from his native Michigan, where he had attended the
funeral of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   His time of sorrow was to be extended.
</P>
<P>
   I have known Meredith for years. We are fellow tennis
enthusiasts. He plays serious advanced doubles. His seniors team
has made it to the national finals for two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no thought of that on that warm late-summer night.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith lives near the church and was there before I could
arrive from my downtown office. He was there to pray over the
wounded and, later, to identify those in the county morgue.
</P>
<P>
   Like other reporters, I was on the outside looking in. I could
never truly know the ordeal Meredith went through, even though we
had long conversations later.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith, a relatively unknown Baptist preacher before the
tragedy, became known to millions as he talked of his faith on
local and national television.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at multiple funerals and at a mass community gathering
at Texas Christian University's Amon Carter Stadium. It was always
an upbeat message.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed tireless and impressed even local and national news
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you find the strength to deal with this?'' a local
television reporter asked him last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith takes care of himself physically and even managed to
get in a brief tennis game during the terrible week. But he doesn't
know how to explain his stamina, either, except in divine terms.
</P>
<P>
   Finally he said, ``It's just God.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times he said of his church members: ``We are just
ordinary people with an extraordinary God.''
</P>
<P>
   I was never more impressed by Meredith, and his entire
congregation, than when I was assigned to cover their first worship
service inside their church after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Being inside the church where innocent people had died and in a
sanctuary that still bore bullet holes and shrapnel marks from a
pipe bomb did not seem to faze the worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Many sat in folding chairs where at least a dozen pews had been
removed because they bore marks of the violence. Many knelt in
prayer on bare concrete floors, where bloodstained carpets had been
ripped out.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't seem to notice. They were too busy exorcizing
the evil that had befallen their beloved church. They sang joyfully
and prayed fervently.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there were few tears.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who were dabbing away tears were in the choir,
where there were poignant reminders of the loss of two faithful
choir members. Choir robes that belonged to two of the dead, Sydney
Browning and Susan ``Kim'' Jones, were draped across empty chairs
in the choir loft.
</P>
<P>
   The focus was on the future.
</P>
<P>
   But Meredith recalled briefly the words of Larry Gene Ashbrook,
the mentally disturbed man who burst into the church on the night
of Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told he was railing against Christianity,'' Meredith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the man shouted, ``You Baptists think you know
everything!'' and then began methodically shooting down people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Baptists don't know everything,'' Meredith said. ``But we
do know God is in control and that we have hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he and his congregation began singing:
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is built on nothing less
</P>
<P>
   than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
</P>
<P>
   When darkness hides his lovely face,
</P>
<P>
   I rest on his unchanging grace ...
</P>
<P>
   On Christ the solid rock I stand.
</P>
<P>
   All other ground is sinking sand.
</P>
<P>
   All other ground is sinking sand.''

   I've been covering religion for years, and have dealt with some
unbelievable scandals, emotional events such as the visits of the
pope and upheavals in major denominations.
</P>
<P>

and wounded seven others before killing himself.

AMERICA'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH THINGS LATIN EXTENDS TO FASHION

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Twenty-year-old Monalisa Adams twirls for
the camera, her braided blond hair dripping onto her lipstick-red
dress.
</P>
<P>
   A look for a night on the town, an upscale dance club, dinner at
a fancy restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   Try the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to dress down, even if I'm just going to the
movies,'' says Adams, a student at Tarrant County College's South
Campus.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of the fashion spectrum is Angelica Lara, a
15-year-old sophomore at North Side High School in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Her look is far more subdued: trendy flare jeans, clunky
Sketchers tennis shoes, a white peasant top dotted with cute,
purple flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Lara may be worlds apart when it comes to fashion
statements, but the two Latina girls do share a common trait: Their
clothes not only reflect their personalities, they also reflect
their Latin heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And reflecting Latin heritage is way hot these days.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Latin pop culture icons _ from singers Ricky
Martin and Jennifer Lopez to screen star Salma Hayek to comedian
Paul Rodriguez _ has led to a Latin culture revolution. New
all-Spanish publications such as People en Espanol have been born;
Martin and Lopez have crossed over onto the pop charts, attracting
fans of all races and ethnicities; and a general awareness of
Latins and Latin society has risen dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they're in the national spotlight, young Latin
Americans have the perfect opportunity to show off what's important
to them while paying homage to their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eye-catching,'' Lara says of her outfit. ``The top's a
little low-cut, but it's fringe-y and sprinkled with flowers. To
me, it looks like an old Mexican village shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams says her vivid dress pays an equal amount of homage to her
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red's always been a popular color'' with Latins, she says. ``I
like it, and it represents our culture's own style.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that young Latin Americans are donning
different wardrobes than non-Hispanics. If anything, they've
embraced Tommy Hilfiger and Polo as much as any other youth
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear Polo shirts with American Eagle shorts and sandals. If
you go to the mall, you'll see other (Latins) dressed just like
me,'' says Sergio Gonzalez, a 21-year-old technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way a lot of us usually dress,'' he says. ``Some of
my other friends, all they wear is Armani. Whatever's in style,
we'll wear.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that helps Gonzalez and his friends express their
Latin roots while they're wearing such nontraditional Latin
clothing: color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red has a lot of meaning, a lot of history with Latins,'' says
Gonzalez, who
</P>
<P>
   is sporting a Mustang-red Polo shirt. ``That's one way (our
culture) influences us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way, says Erica Gutierrez, is through little details _
the way a Latina does her hair or fixes her makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear light makeup. I like wearing dark makeup around
my eyes. A lot of Latin girls do that,'' says Gutierrez, a
16-year-old sophomore at North Side High School. ``And I like my
hair down and curly. A lot of Latin girls have either, but mine's
both.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost impossible, though, not to find fashion similarities
among youths of different races and ethnicities. Hip-hop culture,
for instance, has slowly seeped into pop culture, influencing a
generation of MTV watchers of all races to dress in a kindred way.
Their uniform: baggy clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The droopy shirts, the jeans that sag and expose undergarment
labels, the jackets that nearly touch the ground _ all have become
staples of young America, and in turn, young Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Baggy clothes connoisseur Joseph Pulido says he wears a
loose-fitting Tommy shirt and baggy Tommy carpenter jeans for
comfort and trendiness. Baggy garments are so popular, he says,
because they really do look as cool as they feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much like I have to wear baggy clothes,'' says the
16-year-old junior at Nolan High School in Arlington, Texas. ``I
just like the way they fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all young Latins keep up with clothing crazes, though.
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Gallegos, a 19-year-old law firm receptionist and single
mom, says she is pretty much oblivious to style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so out of it,'' she says. ``I know a lot of Latins wear
baggy clothes, but where I grew up, we didn't care about what was
popular. Didn't matter where they came from, clothes still
reflected our personalities and heritage. They can bring out our
inner selves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos' inner self could be described as conservatively
classy. Her outfit: sleek black slacks and a fuzzy nylon lavender
top.
</P>
<P>
   Angelica Lara says it's this mishmash of styles that separates
young, fashion-conscious Latins from other youths while recalling
Latin culture's edgy roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid to try different things,'' she says. ``We've
always been like that, sort of experimental, sort of open to new
ideas. And we're not afraid to bring back styles either, and turn
them into new ones. Like flare jeans. I mean, those look like
bellbottoms.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the aftermath of last week's shootings at
Wedgwood Baptist Church, Christian-music artists are responding
with a renewed sense of purpose and urgency as they assess how
their art and their message affect fans.
</P>
<P>
   Christian artists have always seen their music as being an
important part of ministering to young followers, but several say
they now take their role as Christian pied pipers even more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are superstar Steven Curtis Chapman and the members
of Forty Days, the Garland band that was onstage when Larry Gene
Ashbrook walked into the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids were gathered because they believed the gospel of
Jesus Christ is true and they had hope in that,'' says Chapman, who
has sold millions of CDs and participated in memorials after the
December 1997 shootings at Heath High School in Paducah, Ky., his
hometown. ``It affected me to think that it could have been me
doing that concert, a church gathering. I've played a lot of this
type of show.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effect was that Chapman and his band prayed
together the morning after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to consider now that everyone who gathers in the
Christian faith has to consider that this is a reality of our
culture _ that this could happen again,'' he added. ``More than
ever before, with this tour, I need to know that what we do is so
much more than entertainment and fun. I have to know what might
happen. It forces us to consider what we believe and what we gather
for. Is it worth dying for?''
</P>
<P>
   The members of Forty Days were having the same thoughts last
weekend. Formed four years ago, the quintet is led by twin brothers
Mark and Joel Warren, both 26; the band has released two CDs, the
latest being this year's ``The Nature of Praise.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Warren a video screen behind the band was showing the
lyrics of a song, which were ``So shall I be saved from my
enemies,'' when Ashbrook began firing.
</P>
<P>
   Warren thought it was malfunctioning equipment, and the band
members ducked behind a pew; a few days later, talking after a show
at the Deep Ellum (Dallas) Christian club The Door, he said the
incident has changed his outlook completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our calling is not what it was a week before this happened,''
he says. ``It's totally changed. Before we thought our music was
ministry, our calling. Now it's message before music. In hindsight,
it's a huge victory for God: Kids wanna be in church praying now.
People are getting saved because of this. On MTV, they were doing
something on this, and they showed people praying, which I thought
would never happen. It's obvious God wants to use this for good.''
</P>
<P>
   This idea is echoed by two area youth ministers: Steve Herring
of Watauga's Harvest Baptist Church and Jeff Schwarzentraub of
Euless' Metroplex Chapel agree that the shootings might make some
young Christian's faith stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths last week hit especially close to home for Herring:
The previous Saturday, Harvest had hosted a concert by major
Christian band Third Day, and 2,600 young people had shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Herring couldn't help but think what if, especially since he'd
briefly met the members of Forty Days backstage at the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big similarity,'' he says. ``I can imagine how many
bullets would have found a home if it'd happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the argument could be made that ``God is asking of
teen-agers, `Are you will to take a bullet for me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-agers think they will live forever and this will wake 'em
up,'' he says. ``This kind of thing separates the real believers.
Logically, you might think that some people will stop coming, but
for the true believers it has the opposite effect _ you catch a
little more fire. This will bring some people together _
Christianity has always thrived under persecution. Look at China _
the underground churches over there are on fire for God.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzentraub agrees, saying that, for him, the incident
``changes the emphasis and intensity with which we minister to
teen-agers. Time is short. When persecution has been rampant, it
made those who really want it go for it. When you see something
like this you realize there's an urgency to giving people hope.''
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, the effects of the shootings ``remain to
be seen,'' says Frank Breeden, president of the Gospel Music
Association. But he also says that it re-emphasizes that ``a
(Christian music) show like this could be a life-changing event. I
hope it'll work its way through the Christian music community in
the sense that we're singing to real people with real problems and
we should be more involved with the people we're singing to and our
music could actually make a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as benefit shows, or a memorial/charity CD from various
Christian artists, Breeden says he has heard ``scattered reports''
that something may be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian artists are very good about responding to something
like this,'' he says. ``I wouldn't be surprised if we heard
something in the next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, though, Joel Warren says he feels a sense of being
spared to go on and do greater things for God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back on Friday and saw bullet holes all over the
stage,'' he says. ``He had shot at us while we were playing. I
can't believe that none of us got hurt or hit. We were the only
thing he could see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to last week, I haven't had to think about being persecuted
for believing what I believe. It's given a wake-up call to all of
us. It's definitely a call for us to wake up and share our faith.
We haven't thought about the dangers of doing that, but we have a
responsibility to share what we believe. He protected us for a
reason. What gives me peace is that those who died are in heaven.
I'm envious. They're in heaven, and we're stuck here in a very evil
place.''

   Warren thought it was malfunctioning equipment, and the band
members ducked behind a pew; a few days later, talking after a show
at the Deep Ellum (Dallas) Christian club The Door, he said the
incident has changed his outlook completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our calling is not what it was a week before this happened,''
he says. ``It's totally changed. Before we thought our music was
ministry, our calling. Now it's message before music. In hindsight,
it's a huge victory for God: Kids wanna be in church praying now.
People are getting saved because of this. On MTV, they were doing
something on this, and they showed people praying, which I thought
would never happen. It's obvious God wants to use this for good.''
</P>
<P>
   This idea is echoed by two area youth ministers: Steve Herring
of Watauga's Harvest Baptist Church and Jeff Schwarzentraub of
Euless' Metroplex Chapel agree that the shootings might make some
young Christian's faith stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths last week hit especially close to home for Herring:
The previous Saturday, Harvest had hosted a concert by major
Christian band Third Day, and 2,600 young people had shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Herring couldn't help but think what if, especially since he'd
briefly met the members of Forty Days backstage at the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big similarity,'' he says. ``I can imagine how many
bullets would have found a home if it'd happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the argument could be made that ``God is asking of
teen-agers, `Are you will to take a bullet for me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-agers think they will live forever and this will wake 'em
up,'' he says. ``This kind of thing separates the real believers.
Logically, you might think that some people will stop coming, but
for the true believers it has the opposite effect _ you catch a
little more fire. This will bring some people together _
Christianity has always thrived under persecution. Look at China _
the underground churches over there are on fire for God.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzentraub agrees, saying that, for him, the incident
``changes the emphasis and intensity with which we minister to
teen-agers. Time is short. When persecution has been rampant, it
made those who really want it go for it. When you see something
like this you realize there's an urgency to giving people hope.''
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, the effects of the shootings ``remain to
be seen,'' says Frank Breeden, president of the Gospel Music
Association. But he also says that it re-emphasizes that ``a
(Christian music) show like this could be a life-changing event. I
hope it'll work its way through the Christian music community in
the sense that we're singing to real people with real problems and
we should be more involved with the people we're singing to and our
music could actually make a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as benefit shows, or a memorial/charity CD from various
Christian artists, Breeden says he has heard ``scattered reports''
that something may be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian artists are very good about responding to something
like this,'' he says. ``I wouldn't be surprised if we heard
something in the next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, though, Joel Warren says he feels a sense of being
spared to go on and do greater things for God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back on Friday and saw bullet holes all over the
stage,'' he says. ``He had shot at us while we were playing. I
can't believe that none of us got hurt or hit. We were the only
thing he could see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to last week, I haven't had to think about being persecuted
for believing what I believe. It's given a wake-up call to all of
us. It's definitely a call for us to wake up and share our faith.
We haven't thought about the dangers of doing that, but we have a
responsibility to share what we believe. He protected us for a
reason. What gives me peace is that those who died are in heaven.
I'm envious. They're in heaven, and we're stuck here in a very evil
place.''

   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

   Singer David Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell
a full-length recording in a download format providing copyright

distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a

D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent interview: ``The

<P>
   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

   &UR; A FEEDING FRENZY MADE FOR CONSUMERS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,100 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By SAUL HANSELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   E-commerce has revolutionized the selling of books, compact
disks, travel and financial services and computer hardware and
software _ commodities shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to
get a handle on. But will the on-line bazaar work for everyday
survival? In an attempt to find out, writer Matt Rich sealed
himself into an E-cave. For five days, he ordered all sustenance
and entertainment from the Net. He survived, but will he ever be
the same? Here, he offers his diary.

   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

   There are Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents
and travel agents. Now meet Internet agents. ``Intelligent agent''
programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,'' are among the hottest
new areas of electronic commerce. They hold out the promise of
making shopping on the Internet better not just by finding lower
prices but matching products to the needs and tastes of individual
consumers.

 &UR; By SALLY McGRANE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

   Singer David Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell
a full-length recording in a download format providing copyright
protection. He is one of many artists who are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and
Def Leppard recently began new albums with on-line previews
designed to build anticipation before their release dates. As Chuck
D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent interview: ``The
Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the dog, or let the
dog bite your leg.'' Sue Cummings reports.

   &UR; IN A LEGAL GRAY AREA, BLACKJACK IS A CLICK AWAY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,100 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK JOHNSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

   &UR; DELUXE DILEMMA: TO SELL GLOBALLY OR SELL HAUGHTILY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,000 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE KAUFMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

   &UR; A FEEDING FRENZY MADE FOR CONSUMERS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,100 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By SAUL HANSELL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies and their investors are desperate to get big
fast _ so much so that they are almost willing to bribe people to
shop with them. As a result, the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items. You name it, someone has started a Web
site to sell it: Autoweb, Furniture.com, Pets.com, and the list
goes on. What's the allure? Which Internet retailers are making
money? And which aren't?

   E-commerce has revolutionized the selling of books, compact
disks, travel and financial services and computer hardware and
software _ commodities shoppers don't need to squeeze and prod to
get a handle on. But will the on-line bazaar work for everyday
survival? In an attempt to find out, writer Matt Rich sealed
himself into an E-cave. For five days, he ordered all sustenance
and entertainment from the Net. He survived, but will he ever be
the same? Here, he offers his diary.

   Where can an E-business turn for a model of how to make money on
the Web? To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce
pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of
the Internet: the on-line pornographers. Pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server. In a sidebar titled ``Keeping It
Out of Your House,'' Kilgannon lists the software filters for
blocking pornography from personal computers.

<P>
   Last September, Oliver Samwer, 26, and his 24-year-old brother
Alexander, packed their bags to join their 28-year-old brother,
Marc, as interns in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay,
the on-line auction site, and thought they saw a niche for a
similar site in Germany. They quit their internships, recruited
three college pals and headed to Germany in January to start their
own auction site on the Ebay model, which they called Alando.de. On
March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May 17 to
say that Ebay was interested. On May 30, the six 20-somethings sold
Alando.de to Ebay for $43 million. This is their story.

career or promoting new work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and
Def Leppard recently began new albums with on-line previews
designed to build anticipation before their release dates. As Chuck
D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent interview: ``The
Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the dog, or let the

   Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler. He had
never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a magazine
advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he was
intrigued. That was three years ago. Now Lacey is more than $60,000
in debt. And he is not alone. Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have
come on-line since 1995, giving almost anyone with a computer and
credit card the chance to gamble. In this feature, writer Dirk
Johnson reports on the murky world of cybergambling.

   &UR; DELUXE DILEMMA: TO SELL GLOBALLY OR SELL HAUGHTILY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,000 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE KAUFMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, luxury vendors _ the Guccis and Pradas of the
world _ have only tiptoed into cyberspace. Why? On-line selling is
seen as a little too low rent, and a large part of the cost of any
luxury item is its exclusive image. (A Prada bag costs $450 because
one can get it in only a few stores. The bag would lose some of its
cachet if it were made available on-line.) But big-spenders
shouldn't despair: The lures for luxury's prime-time players to the
join the Web are too great to ignore. For example, technology is
quickly improving, and the average Web user has twice the income of
the average American.

<P>
   Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents, travel
agents _ now meet Internet agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligent agent'' programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,''
are among the hottest new areas of electronic commerce. They hold
out the promise of making shopping on the Internet better not just
by finding lower prices but by matching products to the needs and
tastes of individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While the term ``agent'' suggests a trustworthy representative
dispatched into the wilds of cyberspace bazaars, bot conveys the
image of a combative R2D2 scooting through the marketplace of some
distant planet pricing used space cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind the names is different: Agents and bots are
programs, routines, algorithms _ strings of complicated
mathematical equations that are used to find and compare patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Zillman of Botspot, an agency that tracks software
agents, predicts that in five years, bots will be involved in most
on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic word of mouth,'' is the phrase that Prof. Pattie
Maes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media
Laboratory uses to describe what some software agents bring to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in the field of software agents, Professor Maes has
become one of the most visible and articulate proponents of this
new type of program, which lets users learn by comparing their
preferences with those of what she calls their ``taste mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a real-estate agent or travel agent, a software shopping
agent has responsibility for finding products and prices, Professor
Maes said. One of the agent's responsibilities is to match the
user's preferences. Software agents take initiative, learn from the
habits of their clients and adapt to the market.
</P>
<P>
   At the MIT Media Laboratory, Professor Maes founded and directs
the Software Agents Group and holds the Sony Corporation Career
Development Chair. Two of her many projects have led to commercial
spinoffs that represent the two leading types of shopping bots.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Firefly, introduced in 1995, which helps make
individual recommendations for taste-based products like compact
disks, books and films. The other is Frictionless, which went into
service in August on the Lycos portal and other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless is designed to shop for the best price and service
on less-frequently bought products, like cars or camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly is Professor Maes' best-known spinoff. It was one of the
first shopping bots to use intelligent agents and collaborative
filtering.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the early 1990s, Firefly's software began as a site
called Helpful On-Line Music Recommendations, or HOMR, where users
could receive guidance in finding music recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Users rated a series of CDs to create individual profiles, which
were compared with profiles of other users with similar tastes to
generate suggestions for music the user might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the HOMR project was spun off and incorporated first as
Agents, then under the friendlier name Firefly. Other sites,
including Reel.com, adopted similar techniques to help people
choose films. Some licensed the software from Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1998, Firefly was sold to Microsoft, guaranteeing
its influence across one of the most powerful sets of on-line
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly and other collaborative filtering systems take advantage
of the knowledge and tastes of customers. Sometimes the user fills
in a form on-line. At other times, the agent learns from a person's
buying or browsing patterns, as tracked by software from companies
like Doubleclick.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a college student might be presented only with the
restaurants that fit his or her budget; a diner on a
low-cholesterol diet might get a different list. Such
recommendation options, including those produced by Firefly's
competitor, Net Advantage for Barnesandnoble.com, are probably the
most familiar of the new bots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of recommendation technology only works for domains
where people buy on a regular basis,'' Professor Maes said. ``It's
great for books or music, but not, say, for a car, which you might
buy only every four to eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   For those kinds of products, a different kind of agent
technology, like Frictionless, works better.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless also grew from Professor Maes' work at the MIT
Media Laboratory. It searches on-line shopping sites for products
with specific features at the best price.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Frictionless, someone interested in buying a
laptop computer chooses among a set of user profiles, with names
that include ``road warrior,'' ``budget shopper'' and
``telecommuter.'' Each profile provides a list of product features,
among them weight, speed and memory, as well as information on the
vendor relating to warranty, availability and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To further personalize the search, the user can rely on the
preset profile or edit it, rating factors like screen size and
product warranty on a scale of ``not important'' to ``very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern to users is privacy.
</P>
<P>
   `This is a major issue that deserves public discussion,''
Professor Maes said. The more an agent knows about you, the more
useful it can be.
</P>
<P>
   But while some shopping-bot companies promise not to sell
information to other companies, others give away their software and
plan to make money from selling the information they gather on
shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, an industry tracking
company, suggested that more than 60 percent of shoppers remained
wary of giving information to an on-line site.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly hired an accounting firm to certify its privacy
practices, and Maes was an early backer of proposed industry
standards for privacy. The so-called Platform for Privacy
Preferences protocols are under discussion by the nonprofit World
Wide Web Consortium and enjoy the support of Microsoft, MCI
Worldcom, AT&AMP;T, IBM, Netscape, Oracle and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But even if these standards _ which involve encrypting
information and obtaining permission from consumers to transfer
personal information _ become accepted, on-line shoppers may not
feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, just two days after Frictionless went on-line,
Firefly's site vanished, swallowed by Microsoft's Passport shopping
site, which will begin this fall. Many of Firefly's users were
dismayed despite Microsoft's assurances that privacy and other
policies would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is vital to making software agents work well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Professor Maes' other projects at MIT seeks to bring
together people who have not met but have similar interests. The
program uses a survey of potentially sensitive information, like
people's mail, their personal files or lists of their interests.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how the program might be useful to link
scientists around the world for academic conferences, but its
working name suggests an even more dramatic matchmaking
possibility: It is called Yenta.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is a Sunday night, and I have just sealed myself into an
E-cave. For the next five days, I will order all sustenance and
entertainment from the Net. I will hunker down in a bachelor pad in
Palo Alto, Calif., armed with credit card and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I click my way to the checkout aisle of Webvan, an on-line
grover, to schedule a delivery time. Tomorrow morning would be
great. Then, crisis. I'm told that deliveries are first come, first
served. Webvan can deliver the same day, but the next available
appointment is Wednesday night. By then I could walk to the nearest
market and back _ on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   Will the on-line bazaar work for everyday survival, and as a
means for daily upkeep of heart, soul, body, mind and, foremost,
stomach?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY: LEARNING TO ORDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for food, primitive man faced the woolly mammoth. I
face slothlike delivery schedules. Undaunted by my Webvan
disappointment, I set out on Monday morning to hunt and gather
21st-century style.
</P>
<P>
   A Web search turns up 69 sites offering ``grocery delivery,''
including Groceronline, Netgrocer and Electrolley. I pop into and
register at several sites, then head down the virtual aisles.
</P>
<P>
   But each time I go to check out, I learn delivery is either not
available in my area or will take three to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, I change strategies. I search on ``food delivery, Palo
Alto'' and am led to Waiters.com, a service that takes on-line
orders for local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot I know, the Good Earth, I point and click through
the menu. But I make rookie E-commerce errors, neglecting, for
example, to complete registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later my $32 order arrives. Hungry and having not seen
another human being in nearly 24 hours, I practically hug Louis,
the Waiters.com driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you,'' he says, ``I would have ordered over the
phone. It's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   If he only knew. All day, I have battled not just delivery
schedules but a debilitating injury. I have hurt my left pinkie. I
jammed it in a recent basketball game, and it's swollen and purple,
like a mini-eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   I divine an answer: the cybermedic. A search for ``medical
advice'' returns the names of dozens of doctors who offer virtual
consultations. I even find a specialist, a sports orthopedist named
Stuart Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people dread going to the doctor,'' his site says. ``It
can be expensive, inconvenient and stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zeman's alternative is an E-mail consultation for 10 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he inexpensive, he's also concise. You get one
paragraph to describe your malady, and the virtual physician's
response runs only a few lines. (Somewhere, an HMO executive is
taking copious notes.)
</P>
<P>
   And so by the end of the day, I have scored several small
E-commerce victories, including the fact that late in the
afternoon, I have discovered an on-line grocer called Peapod. I
arrange for a Tuesday delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When I go to bed, I have fed my brain with food, and I have
tended to my corpus with medical advice. Tomorrow, feeling more
seasoned in the ways of E-commerce, I will feed my soul. I will buy
a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUESDAY: LIVING ROOM IS PERFECT FOR SINKING A 9-FOOTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not an entire golf course, but at least an indoor putting
green. This will permit me to test my E-commerce mettle, alleviate
the boredom that accompanies an on-line, in-house lifestyle and
address one of life's pressing concerns, improving my golf game.
</P>
<P>
   My search-engine request on Yahoo spits out nearly 40 possible
merchants, with names like Eagle Putting Greens and Chip-n-Putt.
</P>
<P>
   I settle on a shop called Big Moss Golf. This is partly because
it feels like a local store and partly because it promises to bring
my handicap out of the stratosphere. And partly because it has a
toll-free number for customer service, and I'm starting to get a
little lonely in the E-cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to work that out yourself,'' Tony Terisco says.
He's the owner of Big Moss Golf who sells me on the Big Moss
Original, a $159, nine-foot-long piece of carpet simulated to feel
like grass with a golf hole at one end.
</P>
<P>
   It dawns on me that it may be even more instructive to play
actual golf. But I'm in no mood to quibble. I pay an extra $30 for
overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, I receive a house call from my on-line doctor, Stuart
Zeman. ``You must get an X-ray,'' he prescribes in no uncertain
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the house? Never!
</P>
<P>
   I decide to seek a second opinion. I fire off an E-mail to Dr.
Michele Moore, who runs a site called www.askyour familydoc.com.
She will give me a virtual bedside counsel for $25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEDNESDAY: AN ON-LINE WARRIOR VICTORIOUS IN BATTLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Help. Send Prozac. Otherwise, I may torture and kill my
neighbor, who has been practicing the piano for hours.
</P>
<P>
   But I will combat her, E-commerce style. My weapons are earplugs
and aspirin. My destination is pharmaceutical sites. I settle on
Planetrx.com and Drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   I register at each site and check their delivery schedules. Then
I engage in a bit of hard-core price comparison. I open two browser
windows and compare the sites side by side, checking response time,
prices and product information.
</P>
<P>
   The arrows favor Planetrx. Minutes later, I ``walk out'' with
earplugs and Advil, opting for overnight delivery for an additional
$10. While I'm at it, I check out the stores' aisles of bandage
tape for my injured digit. Drugstore.com offers eight pages of
athletic tape and gauze products.
</P>
<P>
   This is when I realize I've E-volved into a wily E-commerce
veteran. I'm in and out of the drugstores in 10 minutes, far less
than it would have taken to drive to a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with success, I endeavor an E-commerce challenge with an
Olympic degree of difficulty. I'm going to use my modem to get my
cat to stop throwing up. I've tried the normal remedies, like
giving her soft foods and beer, but frankly, I inherited the cat
from an ex-girlfriend and I never could figure her out _ the cat, I
mean.
</P>
<P>
   I find a veterinarian to consult by E-mail. But then I ascend
further, pinpointing a service that in and of itself may illustrate
just how far this new commerce medium has come: Kay Cox, on-line
pet psychiatrist, www.getnet.com/petcouns/.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a self-proclaimed ``pet therapist and talent scout,''
offers on-line consultation for $40 an hour. I send her an
electronic missive and assure the cat it will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my own psychological salve has arrived _ my putting
green. John Tuggle, the UPS deliveryman, takes one look at me and
says, ``I think you need to get out of the house and go to the
shopping mall.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THURSDAY: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH _ SEARCHING FOR LOVE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' say it's hard to meet good people these days. ``They''
say it's tough to find a soul mate amid the cacophony of modern
life.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they've never met Kitten664.
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman I am paired up with by Matchmaker.com. The
on-line service concluded we may constitute a love connection by
comparing our answers to about 50 questions like personal hobbies,
income, height and weight and reading habits. Kitten664 and I
matched on 54 percent of our answers.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, we're both 5 feet 8 inches tall and weigh 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It's true: I soon realize that among the criteria the company
matches are our height and weight, which doesn't seem like a
quality that either sex typically wants in a mate.
</P>
<P>
   In a second attempt at a dating service, I fill out a
questionnaire on a site that promises to help me find my soul mate.
But when I finish, it takes me to an advertisement for free,
on-line pornography.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is a site I'd like to bring home to my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news on my penultimate day in the E-cave. The
swelling in my pinkie has gone down. This is partly thanks to
E-mail from Dr. Moore, who advocates icing and elevating the
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I've ordered lunch with ease from Waiters.com _ without
even needing to register because my registration is already on
file.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the cat has quit vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRIDAY: A LITTLE WISDOM GLEANED FROM LIVING LIFE ON-LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when I am feeling as if I may never need the outside world
again, fate intervenes. My office calls and tells me I must go on
an urgent assignment. My week in the E-cave is cut short.
</P>
<P>
   I reflect on the four days gone by. I have discovered that with
a little practice and experience, the Net can yield some powerful
dividends. Product information and diversity are unparalleled.
Plus, there is extraordinary capacity to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the downside. The on-line experience can be an
isolating one. Some very important sense of community develops from
shopping in the flesh, despite the hassles of driving, parking,
fighting crowds and arguing whether you really have 10 or 11 items
in the express lane.
</P>
<P>
   There are other bugs, too. Like sometimes an E-commerce site
just freezes up. It's like walking up to a sales clerk in a store,
asking a question, then having him glower at you before turning
around and walking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm talking to you,'' I shouted at one point during the
week to a frozen site.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I conclude there are two basic and unassailable
tenets of the E-commerce life: (1) you can order anything under the
sun over the Net _ and in greater selection than in any other
single venue on the planet, and (2) plan ahead, or you'll starve to
death.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Where can an E-business struggling to fend off rising
competition turn for a model of how to make money on the Web? To
the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce pay and
whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of the
Internet: the on-line pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the cyberskin game hold lessons for all sorts of
on-line businesses, experts say, but pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lessons to be had from the on-line porn's
success on the Web,'' said David Zinman, the vice president for
marketing of Adknowledge of Palo Alto, Calif., which charges site
owners to gauge how well their on-line advertisements generate
leads and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tiarra, whose on-line company, the Tiarra Corporation,
creates advertisements and strategies for sex-oriented Web sites,
said that compared with his clients and their competitors, ``the
nonadult side of the Web has always been a year behind the curve in
marketing strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   This innovative streak has been shaped by two realities: Unlike
many other Web businesses, sex sites have a product that people are
willing to pay for but that almost anyone can produce.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no sex sites if sex did not sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike major mainstream companies, sex sites had no off-line
revenue stream,'' said Mr. Tiarra, who is also president of United
Adult Sites, a trade organization of 500 on-line sex companies.
``You have to make it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, visiting sex sites meant long downloads and slow video
clips, but operators found ways to transmit large pictures despite
narrow bandwidths.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet became awash with sex sites, the operators
scrambled to develop a way to use existing on-line technology to
get pictures to Web surfers for the few moments they would land on
a site.
</P>
<P>
   With income essentially based on speed of content flow, Web site
designers began writing programs that tweaked technology to make
pages and photos load more quickly to grab their share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting sites were not always coherent and flowing, but
they delivered the product quickly, and that drew browsers and kept
them from skipping to the next sex site.
</P>
<P>
   Creators of sex sites used tips and tricks in writing Web page
scripts so that sexy selling points loaded onto the screen first
before less appetizing elements, like sign-up fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Web's sex sites make money by charging for entry to
a video gallery, usually by a membership bought with a credit card.
Many also carry paid advertisements for larger sites. Free sites
profit by carrying links to other sites, which pay fractions of a
cent each time a customer clicks through.
</P>
<P>
   With profits tied to traffic on the site, the battle for the
most clicks was on. Some site operators designed tricks to lure
casual surfers to accidentally visit sex sites. Some devised loops
to repeatedly click onto sites, including manipulation of the back
key to keep reloading a page.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth redirection techniques cropped up, including writing
programs to create pop-up browsers that emerged as users left
sites, creating a ``no exit'' barrage of windows and prompts. Web
sites began feeding encoded key words for sites unrelated to sex
into search engines, drawing unsuspecting browsers and causing
pop-up advertisements to appear when certain key words were
entered.
</P>
<P>
   They bought rights to commonly used names of Web sites with
altered suffixes. For example, browsers seeking the Presidential
Web site at www.Whitehouse.gov/ got a sex site if, by mistake, they
typed in www.Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites began requesting credit card information as proof of
age for ``free trials,'' adding in fine print that membership
charges automatically would begin afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Tiarra said, mainstream Web site owners were more
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming into this saying, `Is this going to work?'''
he said. ``We came in saying, `How am I going to make enough money
to quit my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, mainstream companies are hiring designers of sex
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for successful strategies, so they're going to
get the guys who had the most competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Duvall, who assesses sex-oriented sites, said there was a
limit to what mainstream sites could copy from the pornographic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with copying porn sites is that sex is the
compelling content, and you can never really compete with that,''
Duvall said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the field's ferocious rivalry, sex sites offer
lessons in the benefits of cooperation, too, said Duvall, a former
newspaper advertising saleswoman who two years ago used $500 and an
old Power Mac to set up her own Web site, Jane's 'Net Sex Guide,
which reviews and rates sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it co-opetition, and you don't see it much on the
nonadult sites,'' she said. ``Even a link trade is a big deal.
You're only sending away a user that is leaving anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream companies using click-through referrals should
research the sex-site industry to learn how to avoid getting
cheated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller on-line pornography sites formed larger networks
offering comprehensive memberships and then splitting the profits _
resembling America Online's more recent decision to develop an
electronic network that would allow members to shop at many retail
Web sites with one credit account.
</P>
<P>
   They also formed large, free supersites, where each company
would post its own click-through banner.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the strategy of cross-linking or
link-swapping was the formation of referral rings, networks in
which sites refer customers to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated tracking systems were then designed to count the
referrals that became paying customers, so sites could reward one
another with a percentage of the sign-up fee. This practice has
been adopted by many mainstream sites, like Amazon.com and
Beyond.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line porn industry has driven Web technology just as it
has with all new media,'' said Seth Warshavsky, the chief executive
of the Internet Entertainment Group, a sex-oriented on-line company
based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult industry entrepreneurs have been a lot more
aggressive developing marketing strategies because they see a
direct return on everything they put out,'' he said. ``They're all
players willing to take a risk to develop new marketing strategies,
and only now are a lot of the mainstream on-line companies applying
those concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the porn industry, you have a tremendous demand for the
material product,'' Zinman said. ``Nonadult industry has to acquire
the kind of information that consumers will want to pay for to make
a profitable business model. Until then, profitable mainstream Web
sites will continue to be an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: KEEPING IT OUT OF YOUR HOUSE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the United States Supreme Court overturned a 1997 Federal
law that prohibited the dissemination of sexually explicit material
over the Internet in a manner available to children, the market
became flooded with software filters for blocking pornography from
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet service providers and some Web browsers also offer
optional built-in filter services for customers who want to censor
Internet material.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the filters endorsed by the Federal
Communications Commission:
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE _ (www.aol.com) offers as part of its membership
fee optional parental controls that block E-mail messages from
specific senders and confine access to certain sites. (800)
827-6364
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSITTER _ (www.cybersitter .com) blocks sites the customer
chooses and those from a list compiled and updated regularly by the
company. $39.95 (800) 388-2761
</P>
<P>
   CYBER PATROL _ (www.cyber patrol.com) selects objectionable
sites and updates the list daily; software also filters sites with
objectionable words or images. $29.95 (800) 828-2608
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSNOOP _ (www.pearlsw .com) monitors sites visited. $49.95
(800) 832-7596
</P>
<P>
   NET NANNY _ (www.netnanny.com) masks offensive words or shuts
down browser that accesses banned sites. $39.95 (800) 340-7177
</P>
<P>
   SURFWATCH _ (www.surfwatch .com) lists 25,000 banned sites.
$49.95 (800) 458-6600

<P>
   BERLIN _ Sitting at a makeshift confer ence table a white table
top supported by cardboard boxes _ in the Spartan Berlin
headquarters of Ebay Germany, the 26-year-old chief executive,
Oliver Samwer, can barely contain his excitement as he outlines his
company's spectacular and, in Germany right now, singular success
story.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long: Last September, he and his 24-year-old
brother, Alexander, finished their respective university degrees
and packed their bags to join their brother, Marc, 28, as interns
in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay, the on-line auction
site, and thought they saw a niche for a similar site in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers talked it over at Christmas, quit their internships
and returned to Germany in January to start their own auction site
on the Ebay model. They moved from their hometown of Cologne to
Berlin, recruited three college friends (their 25-year-old chief
financial officer, Karel Doerner, who worked at the consulting firm
McKinsey &AMP; Company for two months, was the only founder with
corporate job experience) and founded Alando.de in February.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May
17 to say that Ebay was interested. Ebay's founder, Pierre Omidyar,
flew to Berlin on May 21, and on May 30 _ less than a hundred days
after founding the company _ the six 20-somethings sold Alando.de
to Ebay for $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the story has inspired a flock of other young
German entrepreneurs to undertake E-based start-up companies. But
it remains an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, E-commerce is taking place in Germany,'' said
Alexander Artope, a co-author of the European Communication
Council's report on the Internet economy. ``But other than
auctions, nothing's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has more Web users than either Britain or France; it has
one of the best telecommunications infrastructures in the world and
is awaiting the drop in Internet toll charges that should follow
the recent deregulation of its telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   But industry insiders put Germany anywhere from eight months to
five years behind the United States in E-commerce development.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer reluctance to give out financial information over the
Internet and unfamiliarity with credit card payment _ 80 percent of
Germans do not have credit cards _ present significant barriers to
Web browsing and buying.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the conservative business practices of the
traditional media publishing corporations that dominate Internet
business in Germany (only one of the top 10 content providers
offers Internet services exclusively, according to the New Media
Report, based in Munich), and it is no surprise that in Germany,
E-commerce has had a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a shortage of the kind of hard-charging,
baby-faced, overnight millionaires that have produced the dot-com
mania fueling start-ups across America.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Oliver Samwer and his colleagues, Scott Barnum,
Ebay's international general manager and vice president, said: ``In
the German Internet-commerce world, these guys are very atypical.
But they represent a new group of entrepreneurs that is trying to
take hold. They are successful role models for entrepreneurs, and
there haven't been that many success stories.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why this success story has entranced Germans. The
young men have become German media darlings, and with scores of
magazine articles and more than 15 television appearances under
their belts, they have set off a wave of young start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In the auction world alone, more than a hundred sites have
sprung up since Alando, now called Ebay Germany. The founders offer
consulting to fledgling entrepreneurships and have started Silicon
City, a social networking group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alando helped raise the attention for E-commerce ventures on a
large scale'' in Germany, said Christian Bachem, an on-line
strategy consultant based in Berlin. But, he added, Alando's
copycat model ``might be a viable trend in German E-commerce, but
it does not at all represent the German E-commerce market.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Samwer is enthusiastic about the nascent entrepreneurial
community he has helped to create, saying that his own team would
have welcomed the mentoring that it regularly dispenses to young
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But he looks back with nostalgia at the skin-of-their-teeth
route that the founders of Alando took, which included offering up
their own childhood model trains at a fraction of their value to
get the site going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he said, ``is still really sad about the trains.''

<P>
   A lot of words have been used to describe David Bowie, but
``conventional'' is not one of them. So it is probably not too
surprising that on Sept. 21 Bowie released his latest album _
``hours ...'' _ not in record stores but on the Internet. Just
download in Liquid Audio or Microsoft Audio 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell _ for about
$18, the list price of a compact disk _ a full-length recording in
a download format providing copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how many people will pay that much for an
unpackaged data file, even if it is the creation of a legendary
rocker, and skeptics have suggested that the album's title refers
to how long the download will take over an average modem.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reaction, Bowie's experiment is a response to
changes throughout the music industry brought on by the popularity
of MP3. Artists of every stripe are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the Internet has seen an explosion of legally
downloadable music by prominent artists. New music is now regularly
appearing on-line from the major labels, which have co-opted the
digital download trend as a direct-marketing gambit.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter of 1999 is expected to see a record number of
famous performers offering free audio samples on-line to entice
holiday purchases. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and Def Leppard
recently began new albums with on-line previews designed to build
anticipation before their release dates.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent
interview: ``The Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the
dog, or let the dog bite your leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, it was not so easy for the artists who early on
made their music available for downloading. At the time, Public
Enemy and the Beastie Boys fought their labels' demands to remove
MP3 files of their music from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Recording Industry Association of America, the
music industry trade group, was tracking down unauthorized MP3
distributors and formed the Secure Digital Music Initiative to
establish standards for protecting copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were this big band endorsing this thing the industry was
trying to be united against,'' Mike D (aka Mike Diamond) of the
Beastie Boys told The Wall Street Journal in December.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D _ Carlton Ridenhour _ put it more bluntly on
Sonicnet.com: ``The execs, lawyers and accountants who lately have
made most of the money in the music biz are now running scared from
the technology that evens out the creative field and makes artists
harder to pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys agreed to remove their MP3 files, live tracks
recorded on tour, in December. But by April, their label, Capitol
Records, had approved release of the group's remixes and video on
its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beastie Boys are a good example of the industry's shifting
mind-set on the Internet,'' said Hillary Rosen, the president and
chief executive of the Recording Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   They started out posting MP3 files on their Web site, ``and
getting a bit of hype out of having this public fight with their
label,'' she said. ``Their contract is up this year; they could
have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they signed a new deal with Capitol for a $30 or $40
million advance,'' Rosen said. ``They found that the existing
system had a lot of advantages for them _ No. 1, that they got a
lot of cash up front.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, on-line proponents were saying that digital
downloads would eliminate the need for record companies by allowing
artists to take music directly to audiences. Instead, the rise of
downloadable audio has spawned new companies like Emusic.com,
Mp3.com and Atomic Pop that are pioneering Internet strategies for
artist development, marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Al Teller, the founder and president of Atomic Pop, an Internet
label, is a former chairman and chief executive of MCA and
president of CBS Records. He speaks for underground and developing
artists when he says, ``There's an enormous frustration with how
many artists get lost in the system and the cost of doing business
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Teller pursued Public Enemy after hearing of the group's
differences with Def Jam Records over offering music for download.
Atomic Pop then put the group's album ``There's a Poison Goin' On''
on sale through download in May, two months before the CD went to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Pop, like other on-line labels, does not require artists
to sign long-term contracts or relinquish ownership of their master
recordings. Rather than offering artists an 8 percent to 12 percent
royalty on sales, as the major labels do, on-line labels give
artists a 50-50 net profit split.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement eliminates exceptions like ``free goods'' (CDs
given away for promotional purposes) that major labels use to
whittle away the base on which royalties are applied. Business
expenses for artist and label come off the top and must be
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it's much more favorable to the artists,'' said
Richard Grabel, a music lawyer with Grubman, Indursky &AMP; Schindler
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another frustrated performer was Greta Gaines. A former champion
professional snowboarder and an aspiring singer-songwriter, Gaines
signed with Giant Records in 1995. Soon afterward, Giant was
reorganized and renamed Revolution Records. New executives replaced
those who had promised to support Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the faith and guidance of people who loved my
music,'' she said. ``They said, `If you don't sell 250,000 units on
your first single, you're out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gaines completed an album for Giant/Revolution that was never
released and asked to cancel her contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so damaging to me for so many years,'' she said.
``Nobody would touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued to write and perform music, however. Three months
ago, while preparing to release a debut CD on her own label, she
posted three songs to Mp3.com as an experiment. The site, which
does not charge for the service, also enables artists to get E-mail
directly from visitors who download their music.
</P>
<P>
   Gratified and surprised by listeners' responses, Gaines quickly
revamped her postings to better represent the new album.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Mp3.com called to tell her that Alanis Morissette and
Tori Amos had selected her to open on their tour, sponsored by the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Now her single, ``FireFly,'' is getting limited airplay at adult
album alternative radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start selling records and my song starts doing well,''
she said, ``it will be a complete revolution in the odds an artist
has'' of hitting it big.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines says she will not sign with a major label.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go on to have a major rock career, it will largely be
based on the Internet,'' she said.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler.
He had never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a
magazine advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he
was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, he found the Web site, keyed in his credit card,
played a few hands and won a couple of dollars. That was three
years ago. Now Mr. Lacey is more than $60,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maxed out seven credit cards,'' said Lacey, who recently
entered a gambling addiction program. ``I've got to get this
monster under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have come on line since 1995,
giving almost anyone with a computer and a credit card the chance
to gamble. Americans last year wagered an estimated $1 billion on
line in a form that thrives in a legal twilight zone as advances in
technology have outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   These cybercasinos are based offshore, many of them on Caribbean
islands, because gambling in the United States requires specific
legal permission. On-line casinos blur those legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Is it illegal for a woman in Ohio, for instance, to place a bet
with a cybercasino in Antigua? Does the betting occur in Ohio or in
Antigua?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that
would prohibit on-line gambling by giving judges the power to shut
down Internet providers who give Web sites to cybercasinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure last year 90 to 9, but it did
not come to a vote in the House of Representatives before Congress
adjourned. The bill is expected to come to the Senate floor again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on technology, said he thought that Internet gambling
already violated the law against sports betting, which, although
permitted in Las Vegas, was banned under the Federal Wire Act of
1961. But the law does not address nonsports betting.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1961 measure could eventually be irrelevant if satellite
transmission or radio waves replace telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, some states have taken separate approaches, none of
them altogether effective. Illinois and Louisiana have banned
Internet gambling. Minnesota is studying whether on-line wagering
could be regulated and licensed. And Missouri has taken court
action against on-line gambling providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, has filed a Federal
suit in Kansas City against the Coeur D'Alene Indian tribe in
Idaho, contending that the tribe's lottery and bingo Web site
violates Missouri's consumer laws, which prohibit the sale of
illegal goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meanwhile, contends that the wagering is legal
because it is based in a sovereign American Indian nation, where
wagering is permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also filed suit against a Pennsylvania man for running
an Internet gambling site. The man pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge last year and was fined $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutions of Internet gambling remain rarer than a poker
hand of four aces. Sue Schneider, who publishes an on-line magazine
on computer gambling, Interactive Gaming News, said it would be
impossible to stop people from wagering over the Internet. She said
that more than 500 sites offered gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, states and the Federal Government should
regulate the industry. Australia, she noted, has recently started
to license on-line casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could regulate them just like you regulate any land-based
gambling operation,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Meyer, the publisher of Rolling Good Times On-Line,
another Internet magazine that reports about on-line gambling, said
a prohibition would drive the industry underground. That would
leave consumers with no protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unregulated industry that desperately needs to be
regulated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line gambling has relatively few defenders. In June, the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, created by Congress,
called for a ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional sports leagues, as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, have called for the prohibition of
on-line wagering. The Las Vegas casino industry has called for a
ban as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming
Association, which represents the casino industry, said he scoffed
at the notion that his group's opposition to on-line gambling was
rooted in a fear of competition. He said the industry's chief
concern was that Internet gambling would tarnish all operators of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the ban, however, acknowledge that
enforcement could be difficult. And the Internet providers have
chafed at being forced to act as a sheriff expected to keep outlaws
out of a virtual Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, the Kyl measure would relieve
Internet providers of the responsibility to block on-line casinos
in two instances: if it was technologically impossible to block
access or if it was prohibitively burdensome to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While operators tend to be mysterious, surveys have gathered
some information about users. On-line gamblers tend to be white men
ages 20 to 40, often wagering on sports, said Kevin O'Neill, a
spokesman for the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sports betting is popular on the Internet, he said, ``because
everybody knows the outcome of a game _ you can't cheat on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line casinos typically set up accounts with customers that
debit a credit card. Losses are charged to the card, while winnings
are tallied as a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been relatively easy for on-line casinos to
open for business. Nearly two dozen of them are based in Antigua,
where a license can be bought for $100,000 or less, and there are
no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on gambling say on-line wagering removes most of the
social barriers that inhibit gambling. There is no travel. And it
can be done in private at home, so no one else has to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, the architect who lost $60,000 to Internet gambling, said
he started wagering on his computer as a way to forget off-line
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it as a means of escaping life's problems,'' he said.
``I was in a bad marriage. And I had the early stages of
Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling problem, he said, is a much fiercer foe than his
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkinson's, I can control that with medication,'' he
said. ``That gambling, that's a harder thing to control.''

<P>
   Click on Gucci.com and what do you get? A Web site under
construction. Point that browser toward Prada.com? There is a
picture of a smoldering model, but no handbags are available for
purchase. Perhaps, you think, a dress from Christian Dior.com? Oh,
you crazy fool-for-fashion you.
</P>
<P>
   While bookshops blossom and drugstores multiply, luxury vendors
have only tiptoed into the on-line space, which they perceive as a
little too low rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web works well for standardized products, but with fashion
you reinvent the product every six months, with new cuts and new
fabrics that look different in different lights,'' says Godo
Kraemer, the director of international public relations for Hugo
Boss, summing up the Zeitgeist of the elite houses.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek suit maker whose creations cost as much as $1,200 at
stores like Saks Fifth Avenue has plans for an informational site
only.
</P>
<P>
   And although merchants certainly will not acknowledge it, there
is also the Wichita (as in Kansas) problem. A large part of the
cost of any luxury item is its exclusive image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perceived lack of demand drives supply,'' said Mike May, who
follows the sector for Jupiter Communications, the Web research
company. ``The reason a Prada bag costs $450 is that you can only
get it at a very few exclusive shops. If anybody in the world could
buy a Prada bag, the name would lose some of its cachet.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the pashmina shawl set should not despair. The
lures for luxury's prime-time players to join the Web rush are
great. For one thing, counterfeit merchandise being sold on the Web
is a growing problem, and what better way to frustrate virtual
swindlers than to offer the merchandise through an official site.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also improving. Pictures of clothing on the Web
can lack texture and true color, but software advances will make it
possible this fall to see the weave of the Irish cable sweater
undulate in its full sumptuousness.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the alluring fact that the average Web user has
twice the income of the average American. Top style houses are
watching closely and have noticed that there are customers blithely
willing to plunk down $30,000 for diamond stud earrings or $15,000
for a Queen Anne dresser at an auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Many are now investigating how to exploit the medium without
angering the traditional retailers that are their biggest buyers.
One option may be to design clothing lines to be sold only on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Gucci and Hugo Boss dally, the Web is
beginning to fill with lesser-known, but not lesser-cost, purveyors
of couture, art and jewelry. People who want to shop for luxury
goods now will probably end up at a site that is category specific.
Everything from diamonds to antique automobiles has its own
peddler.
</P>
<P>
   Nextmonet.com, for example, hopes to lead well-compensated
professionals to their inner art collector. Most of its portfolio
is from mid-career artists who are ``underexposed,'' with works
costing $2,000 to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Nickelsen, the site's chief executive and co-founder,
describes her customers as ``people who drive BMWs and are ready to
graduate from posters but know nothing about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are not only introduced to artists and
their works but are offered art history lessons and industry
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of luxury site is a loosely knit front for a
dozen or more upscale retailers. Bestselections.com is essentially
a mall with a store roster that reads like a shopping diary for the
international jet set.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at this site can browse by antique jewelry selected by
Catherine Prevost, proprietor of a chic shop in the Knightsbridge
section of London, or order million-thread count sheets from
Roberta East Linens in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Styleclick.com offers a similar conglomeration-of-brands
approach, but instead of retailers it features wares from
manufacturers like Kenneth Cole, Anne Klein II and Trussardi
Leather.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning: such mix-and-match sites offer a limited
amount of merchandise from their vendors, and often the poorer
selection at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of our purchases are $500 or more,'' brags
Maurizio Vecchione, Styleclick's chief executive. Maybe, but plenty
of embroidered T-shirts for $32 can be had at his site as well.
Similarly, at Bagley Home, a farm antiques shop on
Bestselections.com, it is easier to find chenille bunnies and
beeswax candles than 18th-century armoires.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuryfinder.com, which is being introduced by the New York
social fixtures James Finkelstein and Pamela Gross this fall, aims
at a more ambitious model: a luxury portal that is the equivalent
of a social secretary for the wired billionaire set.
</P>
<P>
   The site will, of course, offer necessities like a Ghurka laptop
carrying case for $1,295 and a bottle of Chateau Lafite at $10,000.
Luxuryfinder.com, by the way, will eschew more common brands like
Coach Leather, which Gross called ``too low end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Luxuryfinder will provide services like a calendar of
society events and tips by Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, a
grandson of Consuela Vanderbilt, on how to behave like a British
aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambitious competitors have already shaken a few of luxury's
big names out of their ennui. The luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which owns couture houses like
Christian Dior and Givenchy, plans to test the Web waters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Sephora.com, the international cosmetics and beauty
retailer, which is 80 percent owned by LVMH, will go live. The rest
of the company's brands will follow. LVMH, which once saw the Web
as a threat, now sees it as a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone knows for sure how big the market is,
but the demographics are clear, the young affluent and aspiring
affluent customer are already there,'' said Myron Ullman, LVMH's
group managing director. ``So we will be, too.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's hard not to look at all the money being made on Internet
stocks and wonder, ``How do I get my share?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you could bet your life savings on a company started by
teen-agers that has never had a dime of profit, with a stock that
seems to follow the course of the Coney Island Cyclone.
</P>
<P>
   Or take that recipe that was always such a big hit at the bake
sale, open SuperFudgeBrownies.com, and then sell stock to all your
friends on the PTA.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could plan to do all your Christmas shopping on
the Internet. Many Internet companies, and their investors, are so
desperate to get big fast that they are almost willing to bribe
people to shop with them. So the savvy cyberconsumer can find sites
selling all sorts of items at or below cost, or with free shipping
or all sorts of other giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has already driven prices for digital video disks
on-line to as much as 40 percent below the suggested retail level.
In many cases that means the price is well below the wholesale
cost.
</P>
<P>
   And enough $15 coupons and free shipping deals have been fired
in the bitter war between Drugstore.com and Planetrx.com that
customers could well hoard a year's worth of free shampoo or
toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   You name it and someone has started a Web site to sell it:
Autoweb, Furniture.com, Ebags, Pets.com, even Partyjunk.com,
scheduled to be introduced this fall, for children's party favors.
There are thousands more, and nearly all of them are planning to
lose money for years.
</P>
<P>
   For on-line buyers, these good deals are still mixed with a lot
of frustration. It's often hard to find a site that sells what you
want. When you do, the sites can be slow and hard to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   If you place an order, too often the merchandise is not shipped
correctly, intact and on time. And there is nothing that Silicon
Valley has invented to let you tell by looking at a computer screen
whether the sweater will be scratchy or what the color really is.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm,
found that the portion of buyers who said they were very satisfied
with their on-line shopping dropped to 43 percent this year from 63
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the qualms, more people are spending much more
money on-line every month. On America Online, only 37 percent of
its members had made an on-line purchase as of June of last year.
Today, it is up to 62 percent, or nearly 11 million shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter estimates that consumers will spend $15 billion in 1999.
Of that, $6 billion will be spent this Christmas, double what was
spent last year.
</P>
<P>
   For both business and Wall Street, the question now is: How big
can this get?
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs recently told clients it estimated that
ultimately 15 percent to 20 percent of the nation's retail sales
could flow over the Internet. And in many ways,
business-to-business electronic commerce is having an even bigger
effect and doing it faster, as everything from cattle farms to
steel mills use the Web to link to suppliers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder investors are backing companies that look like they
are growing fast, rather than those that are making a profit. To be
sure, there may be a touch of irrational exuberance causing the
stock market to value Etoys at $5.2 billion, far more than the $3.4
billion value of Toys ``R'' Us. Never mind that Toys ``R'' Us sells
400 times more toys than its upstart rival.
</P>
<P>
   Look behind all the technical wizardry of the sites, however,
and you'll see a lot of businesses that are staying together on
little more than packing tape and a prayer. After all, it's much
easier to make a pretty Web site, and advertise it on America
Online, than to make sure you have the goods the site is offering
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a wake-up call for everybody,'' said Katherine
Borsecnik, the senior vice president in charge of America Online's
shopping area. ``People weren't prepared for the volumes that
peaked about a week before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Wainright, now the chief executive of Pets.com, said she
learned her lesson when she spent a year running Reel.com, an
on-line video store that was having trouble keeping track of its
inventory and shipping orders on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there, we had 50,000 customers, and 50,000 were mad
at us,'' she said. Reel has since been sold to Hollywood Video.
</P>
<P>
   Starting over at Pets.com early this year, Ms. Wainright
replaced the company's computer system with one that can handle 30
times its current volume. She leased a 120,000-square-foot
warehouse to stock everything and she is hiring three shifts of
people to staff it around the clock this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, people were really excited to try something
new,'' she said. ``But this year, the customers are completely
unforgiving. They are not going to give you a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall will also mark the debut of services known as
electronic wallets that are meant to speed on-line shopping by
automatically sending previously entered information about the
shopper _ like credit-card numbers and shipping address _ to the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, many people who tried to shop on-line found an
even more basic problem: They couldn't find anyone selling what
they wanted to buy. In some cases that was because they didn't know
where to look.
</P>
<P>
   But by this year, the big Internet guides, including America
Online and Yahoo, will introduce new services that allow shoppers
to search for a specific item at hundreds of on-line stores and see
on one screen who carries it and what their prices are.
</P>
<P>
   Security is another main concern that, according to surveys of
Internet users, is keeping people from shopping on-line. With so
many sites appearing every day, it is hard to know the reliable
merchants from the fly-by-nights, so many people are wary of
sending their credit card numbers to anyone on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But a healthy suspicion, said David Medine, the associate
director of the Federal Trade Commission, should make people more
willing to use credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should always use their credit cards when they buy
on-line because of the strong consumer protection laws that let you
dispute charges on a credit card bill,'' Medine said. The most
consumers will pay in case of fraud is $50.
</P>
<P>
   That said, shoppers should have a field day.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Hollywood agents, literary agents, real-estate agents, travel
agents _ now meet Internet agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligent agent'' programs and their kin, ``shopping bots,''
are among the hottest new areas of electronic commerce. They hold
out the promise of making shopping on the Internet better not just
by finding lower prices but by matching products to the needs and
tastes of individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While the term ``agent'' suggests a trustworthy representative
dispatched into the wilds of cyberspace bazaars, bot conveys the
image of a combative R2D2 scooting through the marketplace of some
distant planet pricing used space cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind the names is different: Agents and bots are
programs, routines, algorithms _ strings of complicated
mathematical equations that are used to find and compare patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Zillman of Botspot, an agency that tracks software
agents, predicts that in five years, bots will be involved in most
on-line shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic word of mouth,'' is the phrase that Prof. Pattie
Maes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media
Laboratory uses to describe what some software agents bring to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneer in the field of software agents, Professor Maes has
become one of the most visible and articulate proponents of this
new type of program, which lets users learn by comparing their
preferences with those of what she calls their ``taste mates.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a real-estate agent or travel agent, a software shopping
agent has responsibility for finding products and prices, Professor
Maes said. One of the agent's responsibilities is to match the
user's preferences. Software agents take initiative, learn from the
habits of their clients and adapt to the market.
</P>
<P>
   At the MIT Media Laboratory, Professor Maes founded and directs
the Software Agents Group and holds the Sony Corporation Career
Development Chair. Two of her many projects have led to commercial
spinoffs that represent the two leading types of shopping bots.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Firefly, introduced in 1995, which helps make
individual recommendations for taste-based products like compact
disks, books and films. The other is Frictionless, which went into
service in August on the Lycos portal and other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless is designed to shop for the best price and service
on less-frequently bought products, like cars or camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly is Professor Maes' best-known spinoff. It was one of the
first shopping bots to use intelligent agents and collaborative
filtering.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the early 1990s, Firefly's software began as a site
called Helpful On-Line Music Recommendations, or HOMR, where users
could receive guidance in finding music recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Users rated a series of CDs to create individual profiles, which
were compared with profiles of other users with similar tastes to
generate suggestions for music the user might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the HOMR project was spun off and incorporated first as
Agents, then under the friendlier name Firefly. Other sites,
including Reel.com, adopted similar techniques to help people
choose films. Some licensed the software from Firefly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1998, Firefly was sold to Microsoft, guaranteeing
its influence across one of the most powerful sets of on-line
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly and other collaborative filtering systems take advantage
of the knowledge and tastes of customers. Sometimes the user fills
in a form on-line. At other times, the agent learns from a person's
buying or browsing patterns, as tracked by software from companies
like Doubleclick.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a college student might be presented only with the
restaurants that fit his or her budget; a diner on a
low-cholesterol diet might get a different list. Such
recommendation options, including those produced by Firefly's
competitor, Net Advantage for Barnesandnoble.com, are probably the
most familiar of the new bots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of recommendation technology only works for domains
where people buy on a regular basis,'' Professor Maes said. ``It's
great for books or music, but not, say, for a car, which you might
buy only every four to eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   For those kinds of products, a different kind of agent
technology, like Frictionless, works better.
</P>
<P>
   Frictionless also grew from Professor Maes' work at the MIT
Media Laboratory. It searches on-line shopping sites for products
with specific features at the best price.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Frictionless, someone interested in buying a
laptop computer chooses among a set of user profiles, with names
that include ``road warrior,'' ``budget shopper'' and
``telecommuter.'' Each profile provides a list of product features,
among them weight, speed and memory, as well as information on the
vendor relating to warranty, availability and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To further personalize the search, the user can rely on the
preset profile or edit it, rating factors like screen size and
product warranty on a scale of ``not important'' to ``very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern to users is privacy.
</P>
<P>
   `This is a major issue that deserves public discussion,''
Professor Maes said. The more an agent knows about you, the more
useful it can be.
</P>
<P>
   But while some shopping-bot companies promise not to sell
information to other companies, others give away their software and
plan to make money from selling the information they gather on
shopping patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Jupiter Communications, an industry tracking
company, suggested that more than 60 percent of shoppers remained
wary of giving information to an on-line site.
</P>
<P>
   Firefly hired an accounting firm to certify its privacy
practices, and Maes was an early backer of proposed industry
standards for privacy. The so-called Platform for Privacy
Preferences protocols are under discussion by the nonprofit World
Wide Web Consortium and enjoy the support of Microsoft, MCI
Worldcom, AT&AMP;T, IBM, Netscape, Oracle and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But even if these standards _ which involve encrypting
information and obtaining permission from consumers to transfer
personal information _ become accepted, on-line shoppers may not
feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 18, just two days after Frictionless went on-line,
Firefly's site vanished, swallowed by Microsoft's Passport shopping
site, which will begin this fall. Many of Firefly's users were
dismayed despite Microsoft's assurances that privacy and other
policies would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is vital to making software agents work well.
</P>
<P>
   One of Professor Maes' other projects at MIT seeks to bring
together people who have not met but have similar interests. The
program uses a survey of potentially sensitive information, like
people's mail, their personal files or lists of their interests.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how the program might be useful to link
scientists around the world for academic conferences, but its
working name suggests an even more dramatic matchmaking
possibility: It is called Yenta.

 c.1999 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is a Sunday night, and I have just sealed myself into an
E-cave. For the next five days, I will order all sustenance and
entertainment from the Net. I will hunker down in a bachelor pad in
Palo Alto, Calif., armed with credit card and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I click my way to the checkout aisle of Webvan, an on-line
grover, to schedule a delivery time. Tomorrow morning would be
great. Then, crisis. I'm told that deliveries are first come, first
served. Webvan can deliver the same day, but the next available
appointment is Wednesday night. By then I could walk to the nearest
market and back _ on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   Will the on-line bazaar work for everyday survival, and as a
means for daily upkeep of heart, soul, body, mind and, foremost,
stomach?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY: LEARNING TO ORDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for food, primitive man faced the woolly mammoth. I
face slothlike delivery schedules. Undaunted by my Webvan
disappointment, I set out on Monday morning to hunt and gather
21st-century style.
</P>
<P>
   A Web search turns up 69 sites offering ``grocery delivery,''
including Groceronline, Netgrocer and Electrolley. I pop into and
register at several sites, then head down the virtual aisles.
</P>
<P>
   But each time I go to check out, I learn delivery is either not
available in my area or will take three to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, I change strategies. I search on ``food delivery, Palo
Alto'' and am led to Waiters.com, a service that takes on-line
orders for local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot I know, the Good Earth, I point and click through
the menu. But I make rookie E-commerce errors, neglecting, for
example, to complete registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later my $32 order arrives. Hungry and having not seen
another human being in nearly 24 hours, I practically hug Louis,
the Waiters.com driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you,'' he says, ``I would have ordered over the
phone. It's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   If he only knew. All day, I have battled not just delivery
schedules but a debilitating injury. I have hurt my left pinkie. I
jammed it in a recent basketball game, and it's swollen and purple,
like a mini-eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   I divine an answer: the cybermedic. A search for ``medical
advice'' returns the names of dozens of doctors who offer virtual
consultations. I even find a specialist, a sports orthopedist named
Stuart Zeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people dread going to the doctor,'' his site says. ``It
can be expensive, inconvenient and stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zeman's alternative is an E-mail consultation for 10 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he inexpensive, he's also concise. You get one
paragraph to describe your malady, and the virtual physician's
response runs only a few lines. (Somewhere, an HMO executive is
taking copious notes.)
</P>
<P>
   And so by the end of the day, I have scored several small
E-commerce victories, including the fact that late in the
afternoon, I have discovered an on-line grocer called Peapod. I
arrange for a Tuesday delivery.
</P>
<P>
   When I go to bed, I have fed my brain with food, and I have
tended to my corpus with medical advice. Tomorrow, feeling more
seasoned in the ways of E-commerce, I will feed my soul. I will buy
a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUESDAY: LIVING ROOM IS PERFECT FOR SINKING A 9-FOOTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, not an entire golf course, but at least an indoor putting
green. This will permit me to test my E-commerce mettle, alleviate
the boredom that accompanies an on-line, in-house lifestyle and
address one of life's pressing concerns, improving my golf game.
</P>
<P>
   My search-engine request on Yahoo spits out nearly 40 possible
merchants, with names like Eagle Putting Greens and Chip-n-Putt.
</P>
<P>
   I settle on a shop called Big Moss Golf. This is partly because
it feels like a local store and partly because it promises to bring
my handicap out of the stratosphere. And partly because it has a
toll-free number for customer service, and I'm starting to get a
little lonely in the E-cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to work that out yourself,'' Tony Terisco says.
He's the owner of Big Moss Golf who sells me on the Big Moss
Original, a $159, nine-foot-long piece of carpet simulated to feel
like grass with a golf hole at one end.
</P>
<P>
   It dawns on me that it may be even more instructive to play
actual golf. But I'm in no mood to quibble. I pay an extra $30 for
overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, I receive a house call from my on-line doctor, Stuart
Zeman. ``You must get an X-ray,'' he prescribes in no uncertain
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the house? Never!
</P>
<P>
   I decide to seek a second opinion. I fire off an E-mail to Dr.
Michele Moore, who runs a site called www.askyour familydoc.com.
She will give me a virtual bedside counsel for $25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEDNESDAY: AN ON-LINE WARRIOR VICTORIOUS IN BATTLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Help. Send Prozac. Otherwise, I may torture and kill my
neighbor, who has been practicing the piano for hours.
</P>
<P>
   But I will combat her, E-commerce style. My weapons are earplugs
and aspirin. My destination is pharmaceutical sites. I settle on
Planetrx.com and Drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   I register at each site and check their delivery schedules. Then
I engage in a bit of hard-core price comparison. I open two browser
windows and compare the sites side by side, checking response time,
prices and product information.
</P>
<P>
   The arrows favor Planetrx. Minutes later, I ``walk out'' with
earplugs and Advil, opting for overnight delivery for an additional
$10. While I'm at it, I check out the stores' aisles of bandage
tape for my injured digit. Drugstore.com offers eight pages of
athletic tape and gauze products.
</P>
<P>
   This is when I realize I've E-volved into a wily E-commerce
veteran. I'm in and out of the drugstores in 10 minutes, far less
than it would have taken to drive to a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with success, I endeavor an E-commerce challenge with an
Olympic degree of difficulty. I'm going to use my modem to get my
cat to stop throwing up. I've tried the normal remedies, like
giving her soft foods and beer, but frankly, I inherited the cat
from an ex-girlfriend and I never could figure her out _ the cat, I
mean.
</P>
<P>
   I find a veterinarian to consult by E-mail. But then I ascend
further, pinpointing a service that in and of itself may illustrate
just how far this new commerce medium has come: Kay Cox, on-line
pet psychiatrist, www.getnet.com/petcouns/.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a self-proclaimed ``pet therapist and talent scout,''
offers on-line consultation for $40 an hour. I send her an
electronic missive and assure the cat it will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my own psychological salve has arrived _ my putting
green. John Tuggle, the UPS deliveryman, takes one look at me and
says, ``I think you need to get out of the house and go to the
shopping mall.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THURSDAY: THE MOMENT OF TRUTH _ SEARCHING FOR LOVE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They'' say it's hard to meet good people these days. ``They''
say it's tough to find a soul mate amid the cacophony of modern
life.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they've never met Kitten664.
</P>
<P>
   This is the woman I am paired up with by Matchmaker.com. The
on-line service concluded we may constitute a love connection by
comparing our answers to about 50 questions like personal hobbies,
income, height and weight and reading habits. Kitten664 and I
matched on 54 percent of our answers.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, we're both 5 feet 8 inches tall and weigh 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It's true: I soon realize that among the criteria the company
matches are our height and weight, which doesn't seem like a
quality that either sex typically wants in a mate.
</P>
<P>
   In a second attempt at a dating service, I fill out a
questionnaire on a site that promises to help me find my soul mate.
But when I finish, it takes me to an advertisement for free,
on-line pornography.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this is a site I'd like to bring home to my
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news on my penultimate day in the E-cave. The
swelling in my pinkie has gone down. This is partly thanks to
E-mail from Dr. Moore, who advocates icing and elevating the
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I've ordered lunch with ease from Waiters.com _ without
even needing to register because my registration is already on
file.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the cat has quit vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRIDAY: A LITTLE WISDOM GLEANED FROM LIVING LIFE ON-LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when I am feeling as if I may never need the outside world
again, fate intervenes. My office calls and tells me I must go on
an urgent assignment. My week in the E-cave is cut short.
</P>
<P>
   I reflect on the four days gone by. I have discovered that with
a little practice and experience, the Net can yield some powerful
dividends. Product information and diversity are unparalleled.
Plus, there is extraordinary capacity to compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the downside. The on-line experience can be an
isolating one. Some very important sense of community develops from
shopping in the flesh, despite the hassles of driving, parking,
fighting crowds and arguing whether you really have 10 or 11 items
in the express lane.
</P>
<P>
   There are other bugs, too. Like sometimes an E-commerce site
just freezes up. It's like walking up to a sales clerk in a store,
asking a question, then having him glower at you before turning
around and walking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm talking to you,'' I shouted at one point during the
week to a frozen site.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I conclude there are two basic and unassailable
tenets of the E-commerce life: (1) you can order anything under the
sun over the Net _ and in greater selection than in any other
single venue on the planet, and (2) plan ahead, or you'll starve to
death.

<TEXT>

<P>
   Where can an E-business struggling to fend off rising
competition turn for a model of how to make money on the Web? To
the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce pay and
whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of the
Internet: the on-line pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the cyberskin game hold lessons for all sorts of
on-line businesses, experts say, but pornography sites have
pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the
heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be
caught dead on the same server.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lessons to be had from the on-line porn's
success on the Web,'' said David Zinman, the vice president for
marketing of Adknowledge of Palo Alto, Calif., which charges site
owners to gauge how well their on-line advertisements generate
leads and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tiarra, whose on-line company, the Tiarra Corporation,
creates advertisements and strategies for sex-oriented Web sites,
said that compared with his clients and their competitors, ``the
nonadult side of the Web has always been a year behind the curve in
marketing strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   This innovative streak has been shaped by two realities: Unlike
many other Web businesses, sex sites have a product that people are
willing to pay for but that almost anyone can produce.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no sex sites if sex did not sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike major mainstream companies, sex sites had no off-line
revenue stream,'' said Mr. Tiarra, who is also president of United
Adult Sites, a trade organization of 500 on-line sex companies.
``You have to make it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, visiting sex sites meant long downloads and slow video
clips, but operators found ways to transmit large pictures despite
narrow bandwidths.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet became awash with sex sites, the operators
scrambled to develop a way to use existing on-line technology to
get pictures to Web surfers for the few moments they would land on
a site.
</P>
<P>
   With income essentially based on speed of content flow, Web site
designers began writing programs that tweaked technology to make
pages and photos load more quickly to grab their share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting sites were not always coherent and flowing, but
they delivered the product quickly, and that drew browsers and kept
them from skipping to the next sex site.
</P>
<P>
   Creators of sex sites used tips and tricks in writing Web page
scripts so that sexy selling points loaded onto the screen first
before less appetizing elements, like sign-up fees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Web's sex sites make money by charging for entry to
a video gallery, usually by a membership bought with a credit card.
Many also carry paid advertisements for larger sites. Free sites
profit by carrying links to other sites, which pay fractions of a
cent each time a customer clicks through.
</P>
<P>
   With profits tied to traffic on the site, the battle for the
most clicks was on. Some site operators designed tricks to lure
casual surfers to accidentally visit sex sites. Some devised loops
to repeatedly click onto sites, including manipulation of the back
key to keep reloading a page.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth redirection techniques cropped up, including writing
programs to create pop-up browsers that emerged as users left
sites, creating a ``no exit'' barrage of windows and prompts. Web
sites began feeding encoded key words for sites unrelated to sex
into search engines, drawing unsuspecting browsers and causing
pop-up advertisements to appear when certain key words were
entered.
</P>
<P>
   They bought rights to commonly used names of Web sites with
altered suffixes. For example, browsers seeking the Presidential
Web site at www.Whitehouse.gov/ got a sex site if, by mistake, they
typed in www.Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites began requesting credit card information as proof of
age for ``free trials,'' adding in fine print that membership
charges automatically would begin afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Tiarra said, mainstream Web site owners were more
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming into this saying, `Is this going to work?'''
he said. ``We came in saying, `How am I going to make enough money
to quit my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, mainstream companies are hiring designers of sex
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for successful strategies, so they're going to
get the guys who had the most competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Duvall, who assesses sex-oriented sites, said there was a
limit to what mainstream sites could copy from the pornographic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with copying porn sites is that sex is the
compelling content, and you can never really compete with that,''
Duvall said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the field's ferocious rivalry, sex sites offer
lessons in the benefits of cooperation, too, said Duvall, a former
newspaper advertising saleswoman who two years ago used $500 and an
old Power Mac to set up her own Web site, Jane's 'Net Sex Guide,
which reviews and rates sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it co-opetition, and you don't see it much on the
nonadult sites,'' she said. ``Even a link trade is a big deal.
You're only sending away a user that is leaving anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream companies using click-through referrals should
research the sex-site industry to learn how to avoid getting
cheated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller on-line pornography sites formed larger networks
offering comprehensive memberships and then splitting the profits _
resembling America Online's more recent decision to develop an
electronic network that would allow members to shop at many retail
Web sites with one credit account.
</P>
<P>
   They also formed large, free supersites, where each company
would post its own click-through banner.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the strategy of cross-linking or
link-swapping was the formation of referral rings, networks in
which sites refer customers to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated tracking systems were then designed to count the
referrals that became paying customers, so sites could reward one
another with a percentage of the sign-up fee. This practice has
been adopted by many mainstream sites, like Amazon.com and
Beyond.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The on-line porn industry has driven Web technology just as it
has with all new media,'' said Seth Warshavsky, the chief executive
of the Internet Entertainment Group, a sex-oriented on-line company
based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult industry entrepreneurs have been a lot more
aggressive developing marketing strategies because they see a
direct return on everything they put out,'' he said. ``They're all
players willing to take a risk to develop new marketing strategies,
and only now are a lot of the mainstream on-line companies applying
those concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the porn industry, you have a tremendous demand for the
material product,'' Zinman said. ``Nonadult industry has to acquire
the kind of information that consumers will want to pay for to make
a profitable business model. Until then, profitable mainstream Web
sites will continue to be an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: KEEPING IT OUT OF YOUR HOUSE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the United States Supreme Court overturned a 1997 Federal
law that prohibited the dissemination of sexually explicit material
over the Internet in a manner available to children, the market
became flooded with software filters for blocking pornography from
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet service providers and some Web browsers also offer
optional built-in filter services for customers who want to censor
Internet material.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the filters endorsed by the Federal
Communications Commission:
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE _ (www.aol.com) offers as part of its membership
fee optional parental controls that block E-mail messages from
specific senders and confine access to certain sites. (800)
827-6364
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSITTER _ (www.cybersitter .com) blocks sites the customer
chooses and those from a list compiled and updated regularly by the
company. $39.95 (800) 388-2761
</P>
<P>
   CYBER PATROL _ (www.cyber patrol.com) selects objectionable

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BERLIN _ Sitting at a makeshift confer ence table a white table
top supported by cardboard boxes _ in the Spartan Berlin
headquarters of Ebay Germany, the 26-year-old chief executive,
Oliver Samwer, can barely contain his excitement as he outlines his
company's spectacular and, in Germany right now, singular success
story.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long: Last September, he and his 24-year-old
brother, Alexander, finished their respective university degrees
and packed their bags to join their brother, Marc, 28, as interns
in Silicon Valley. There they came across Ebay, the on-line auction
site, and thought they saw a niche for a similar site in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers talked it over at Christmas, quit their internships
and returned to Germany in January to start their own auction site
on the Ebay model. They moved from their hometown of Cologne to
Berlin, recruited three college friends (their 25-year-old chief
financial officer, Karel Doerner, who worked at the consulting firm
McKinsey &AMP; Company for two months, was the only founder with
corporate job experience) and founded Alando.de in February.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, the site went on-line. Goldman, Sachs called on May
17 to say that Ebay was interested. Ebay's founder, Pierre Omidyar,
flew to Berlin on May 21, and on May 30 _ less than a hundred days
after founding the company _ the six 20-somethings sold Alando.de
to Ebay for $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the story has inspired a flock of other young
German entrepreneurs to undertake E-based start-up companies. But
it remains an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, E-commerce is taking place in Germany,'' said
Alexander Artope, a co-author of the European Communication
Council's report on the Internet economy. ``But other than
auctions, nothing's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany has more Web users than either Britain or France; it has
one of the best telecommunications infrastructures in the world and
is awaiting the drop in Internet toll charges that should follow
the recent deregulation of its telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   But industry insiders put Germany anywhere from eight months to
five years behind the United States in E-commerce development.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer reluctance to give out financial information over the
Internet and unfamiliarity with credit card payment _ 80 percent of
Germans do not have credit cards _ present significant barriers to
Web browsing and buying.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the conservative business practices of the
traditional media publishing corporations that dominate Internet
business in Germany (only one of the top 10 content providers
offers Internet services exclusively, according to the New Media
Report, based in Munich), and it is no surprise that in Germany,
E-commerce has had a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a shortage of the kind of hard-charging,
baby-faced, overnight millionaires that have produced the dot-com
mania fueling start-ups across America.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Oliver Samwer and his colleagues, Scott Barnum,
Ebay's international general manager and vice president, said: ``In
the German Internet-commerce world, these guys are very atypical.
But they represent a new group of entrepreneurs that is trying to
take hold. They are successful role models for entrepreneurs, and
there haven't been that many success stories.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why this success story has entranced Germans. The
young men have become German media darlings, and with scores of
magazine articles and more than 15 television appearances under
their belts, they have set off a wave of young start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In the auction world alone, more than a hundred sites have
sprung up since Alando, now called Ebay Germany. The founders offer
consulting to fledgling entrepreneurships and have started Silicon
City, a social networking group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alando helped raise the attention for E-commerce ventures on a
large scale'' in Germany, said Christian Bachem, an on-line
strategy consultant based in Berlin. But, he added, Alando's
copycat model ``might be a viable trend in German E-commerce, but
it does not at all represent the German E-commerce market.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Samwer is enthusiastic about the nascent entrepreneurial
community he has helped to create, saying that his own team would
have welcomed the mentoring that it regularly dispenses to young
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But he looks back with nostalgia at the skin-of-their-teeth
route that the founders of Alando took, which included offering up
their own childhood model trains at a fraction of their value to
get the site going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he said, ``is still really sad about the trains.''

<P>
   A lot of words have been used to describe David Bowie, but
``conventional'' is not one of them. So it is probably not too
surprising that on Sept. 21 Bowie released his latest album _
``hours ...'' _ not in record stores but on the Internet. Just
download in Liquid Audio or Microsoft Audio 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie is the most well-known artist trying to sell _ for about
$18, the list price of a compact disk _ a full-length recording in
a download format providing copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how many people will pay that much for an
unpackaged data file, even if it is the creation of a legendary
rocker, and skeptics have suggested that the album's title refers
to how long the download will take over an average modem.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reaction, Bowie's experiment is a response to
changes throughout the music industry brought on by the popularity
of MP3. Artists of every stripe are using the Internet to
distribute audio in hopes of establishing a following, reviving a
career or promoting new work.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the Internet has seen an explosion of legally
downloadable music by prominent artists. New music is now regularly
appearing on-line from the major labels, which have co-opted the
digital download trend as a direct-marketing gambit.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter of 1999 is expected to see a record number of
famous performers offering free audio samples on-line to entice
holiday purchases. The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Creed and Def Leppard
recently began new albums with on-line previews designed to build
anticipation before their release dates.
</P>
<P>
   As Chuck D of the rap group Public Enemy said in a recent
interview: ``The Internet happened to be a dog. You either pet the
dog, or let the dog bite your leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, it was not so easy for the artists who early on
made their music available for downloading. At the time, Public
Enemy and the Beastie Boys fought their labels' demands to remove
MP3 files of their music from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Recording Industry Association of America, the
music industry trade group, was tracking down unauthorized MP3
distributors and formed the Secure Digital Music Initiative to
establish standards for protecting copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were this big band endorsing this thing the industry was
trying to be united against,'' Mike D (aka Mike Diamond) of the
Beastie Boys told The Wall Street Journal in December.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck D _ Carlton Ridenhour _ put it more bluntly on
Sonicnet.com: ``The execs, lawyers and accountants who lately have
made most of the money in the music biz are now running scared from
the technology that evens out the creative field and makes artists
harder to pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys agreed to remove their MP3 files, live tracks
recorded on tour, in December. But by April, their label, Capitol
Records, had approved release of the group's remixes and video on
its site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beastie Boys are a good example of the industry's shifting
mind-set on the Internet,'' said Hillary Rosen, the president and
chief executive of the Recording Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   They started out posting MP3 files on their Web site, ``and
getting a bit of hype out of having this public fight with their
label,'' she said. ``Their contract is up this year; they could
have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they signed a new deal with Capitol for a $30 or $40
million advance,'' Rosen said. ``They found that the existing
system had a lot of advantages for them _ No. 1, that they got a
lot of cash up front.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, on-line proponents were saying that digital
downloads would eliminate the need for record companies by allowing
artists to take music directly to audiences. Instead, the rise of
downloadable audio has spawned new companies like Emusic.com,
Mp3.com and Atomic Pop that are pioneering Internet strategies for
artist development, marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Al Teller, the founder and president of Atomic Pop, an Internet
label, is a former chairman and chief executive of MCA and
president of CBS Records. He speaks for underground and developing
artists when he says, ``There's an enormous frustration with how
many artists get lost in the system and the cost of doing business
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Teller pursued Public Enemy after hearing of the group's
differences with Def Jam Records over offering music for download.
Atomic Pop then put the group's album ``There's a Poison Goin' On''
on sale through download in May, two months before the CD went to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Atomic Pop, like other on-line labels, does not require artists
to sign long-term contracts or relinquish ownership of their master
recordings. Rather than offering artists an 8 percent to 12 percent
royalty on sales, as the major labels do, on-line labels give
artists a 50-50 net profit split.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement eliminates exceptions like ``free goods'' (CDs
given away for promotional purposes) that major labels use to
whittle away the base on which royalties are applied. Business
expenses for artist and label come off the top and must be
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it's much more favorable to the artists,'' said
Richard Grabel, a music lawyer with Grubman, Indursky &AMP; Schindler
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another frustrated performer was Greta Gaines. A former champion
professional snowboarder and an aspiring singer-songwriter, Gaines
signed with Giant Records in 1995. Soon afterward, Giant was
reorganized and renamed Revolution Records. New executives replaced
those who had promised to support Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the faith and guidance of people who loved my
music,'' she said. ``They said, `If you don't sell 250,000 units on
your first single, you're out of here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gaines completed an album for Giant/Revolution that was never
released and asked to cancel her contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so damaging to me for so many years,'' she said.
``Nobody would touch me.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued to write and perform music, however. Three months
ago, while preparing to release a debut CD on her own label, she
posted three songs to Mp3.com as an experiment. The site, which
does not charge for the service, also enables artists to get E-mail
directly from visitors who download their music.
</P>
<P>
   Gratified and surprised by listeners' responses, Gaines quickly
revamped her postings to better represent the new album.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Mp3.com called to tell her that Alanis Morissette and
Tori Amos had selected her to open on their tour, sponsored by the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Now her single, ``FireFly,'' is getting limited airplay at adult
album alternative radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start selling records and my song starts doing well,''
she said, ``it will be a complete revolution in the odds an artist
has'' of hitting it big.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines says she will not sign with a major label.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go on to have a major rock career, it will largely be
based on the Internet,'' she said.

   CHICAGO _ Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler.
He had never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a
magazine advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he
was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, he found the Web site, keyed in his credit card,
played a few hands and won a couple of dollars. That was three
years ago. Now Mr. Lacey is more than $60,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maxed out seven credit cards,'' said Lacey, who recently
entered a gambling addiction program. ``I've got to get this
monster under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have come on line since 1995,
giving almost anyone with a computer and a credit card the chance
to gamble. Americans last year wagered an estimated $1 billion on
line in a form that thrives in a legal twilight zone as advances in
technology have outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   These cybercasinos are based offshore, many of them on Caribbean
islands, because gambling in the United States requires specific
legal permission. On-line casinos blur those legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Is it illegal for a woman in Ohio, for instance, to place a bet
with a cybercasino in Antigua? Does the betting occur in Ohio or in
Antigua?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that
would prohibit on-line gambling by giving judges the power to shut
down Internet providers who give Web sites to cybercasinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure last year 90 to 9, but it did
not come to a vote in the House of Representatives before Congress
adjourned. The bill is expected to come to the Senate floor again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on technology, said he thought that Internet gambling
already violated the law against sports betting, which, although
permitted in Las Vegas, was banned under the Federal Wire Act of
1961. But the law does not address nonsports betting.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1961 measure could eventually be irrelevant if satellite
transmission or radio waves replace telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, some states have taken separate approaches, none of
them altogether effective. Illinois and Louisiana have banned
Internet gambling. Minnesota is studying whether on-line wagering
could be regulated and licensed. And Missouri has taken court
action against on-line gambling providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, has filed a Federal
suit in Kansas City against the Coeur D'Alene Indian tribe in
Idaho, contending that the tribe's lottery and bingo Web site
violates Missouri's consumer laws, which prohibit the sale of
illegal goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meanwhile, contends that the wagering is legal
because it is based in a sovereign American Indian nation, where
wagering is permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also filed suit against a Pennsylvania man for running
an Internet gambling site. The man pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge last year and was fined $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutions of Internet gambling remain rarer than a poker
hand of four aces. Sue Schneider, who publishes an on-line magazine
on computer gambling, Interactive Gaming News, said it would be
impossible to stop people from wagering over the Internet. She said
that more than 500 sites offered gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, states and the Federal Government should
regulate the industry. Australia, she noted, has recently started
to license on-line casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could regulate them just like you regulate any land-based
gambling operation,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Meyer, the publisher of Rolling Good Times On-Line,
another Internet magazine that reports about on-line gambling, said
a prohibition would drive the industry underground. That would
leave consumers with no protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unregulated industry that desperately needs to be
regulated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line gambling has relatively few defenders. In June, the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, created by Congress,
called for a ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional sports leagues, as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, have called for the prohibition of
on-line wagering. The Las Vegas casino industry has called for a
ban as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming
Association, which represents the casino industry, said he scoffed
at the notion that his group's opposition to on-line gambling was
rooted in a fear of competition. He said the industry's chief
concern was that Internet gambling would tarnish all operators of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the ban, however, acknowledge that
enforcement could be difficult. And the Internet providers have
chafed at being forced to act as a sheriff expected to keep outlaws
out of a virtual Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, the Kyl measure would relieve
Internet providers of the responsibility to block on-line casinos
in two instances: if it was technologically impossible to block
access or if it was prohibitively burdensome to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While operators tend to be mysterious, surveys have gathered
some information about users. On-line gamblers tend to be white men
ages 20 to 40, often wagering on sports, said Kevin O'Neill, a
spokesman for the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sports betting is popular on the Internet, he said, ``because
everybody knows the outcome of a game _ you can't cheat on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line casinos typically set up accounts with customers that
debit a credit card. Losses are charged to the card, while winnings
are tallied as a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been relatively easy for on-line casinos to
open for business. Nearly two dozen of them are based in Antigua,
where a license can be bought for $100,000 or less, and there are
no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on gambling say on-line wagering removes most of the
social barriers that inhibit gambling. There is no travel. And it
can be done in private at home, so no one else has to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, the architect who lost $60,000 to Internet gambling, said
he started wagering on his computer as a way to forget off-line
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it as a means of escaping life's problems,'' he said.
``I was in a bad marriage. And I had the early stages of
Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling problem, he said, is a much fiercer foe than his
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkinson's, I can control that with medication,'' he
said. ``That gambling, that's a harder thing to control.''

<P>
   Click on Gucci.com and what do you get? A Web site under
construction. Point that browser toward Prada.com? There is a
picture of a smoldering model, but no handbags are available for
purchase. Perhaps, you think, a dress from Christian Dior.com? Oh,
you crazy fool-for-fashion you.
</P>
<P>
   While bookshops blossom and drugstores multiply, luxury vendors
have only tiptoed into the on-line space, which they perceive as a
little too low rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web works well for standardized products, but with fashion
you reinvent the product every six months, with new cuts and new
fabrics that look different in different lights,'' says Godo
Kraemer, the director of international public relations for Hugo
Boss, summing up the Zeitgeist of the elite houses.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek suit maker whose creations cost as much as $1,200 at
stores like Saks Fifth Avenue has plans for an informational site
only.
</P>
<P>
   And although merchants certainly will not acknowledge it, there
is also the Wichita (as in Kansas) problem. A large part of the
cost of any luxury item is its exclusive image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perceived lack of demand drives supply,'' said Mike May, who
follows the sector for Jupiter Communications, the Web research
company. ``The reason a Prada bag costs $450 is that you can only
get it at a very few exclusive shops. If anybody in the world could
buy a Prada bag, the name would lose some of its cachet.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the pashmina shawl set should not despair. The
lures for luxury's prime-time players to join the Web rush are
great. For one thing, counterfeit merchandise being sold on the Web
is a growing problem, and what better way to frustrate virtual
swindlers than to offer the merchandise through an official site.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also improving. Pictures of clothing on the Web
can lack texture and true color, but software advances will make it
possible this fall to see the weave of the Irish cable sweater
undulate in its full sumptuousness.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the alluring fact that the average Web user has
twice the income of the average American. Top style houses are
watching closely and have noticed that there are customers blithely
willing to plunk down $30,000 for diamond stud earrings or $15,000
for a Queen Anne dresser at an auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Many are now investigating how to exploit the medium without
angering the traditional retailers that are their biggest buyers.
One option may be to design clothing lines to be sold only on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Gucci and Hugo Boss dally, the Web is
beginning to fill with lesser-known, but not lesser-cost, purveyors
of couture, art and jewelry. People who want to shop for luxury
goods now will probably end up at a site that is category specific.
Everything from diamonds to antique automobiles has its own
peddler.
</P>
<P>
   Nextmonet.com, for example, hopes to lead well-compensated
professionals to their inner art collector. Most of its portfolio
is from mid-career artists who are ``underexposed,'' with works
costing $2,000 to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Myrna Nickelsen, the site's chief executive and co-founder,
describes her customers as ``people who drive BMWs and are ready to
graduate from posters but know nothing about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are not only introduced to artists and
their works but are offered art history lessons and industry
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of luxury site is a loosely knit front for a
dozen or more upscale retailers. Bestselections.com is essentially
a mall with a store roster that reads like a shopping diary for the
international jet set.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at this site can browse by antique jewelry selected by
Catherine Prevost, proprietor of a chic shop in the Knightsbridge
section of London, or order million-thread count sheets from
Roberta East Linens in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Styleclick.com offers a similar conglomeration-of-brands
approach, but instead of retailers it features wares from
manufacturers like Kenneth Cole, Anne Klein II and Trussardi
Leather.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning: such mix-and-match sites offer a limited
amount of merchandise from their vendors, and often the poorer
selection at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of our purchases are $500 or more,'' brags
Maurizio Vecchione, Styleclick's chief executive. Maybe, but plenty
of embroidered T-shirts for $32 can be had at his site as well.
Similarly, at Bagley Home, a farm antiques shop on
Bestselections.com, it is easier to find chenille bunnies and
beeswax candles than 18th-century armoires.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuryfinder.com, which is being introduced by the New York
social fixtures James Finkelstein and Pamela Gross this fall, aims
at a more ambitious model: a luxury portal that is the equivalent
of a social secretary for the wired billionaire set.
</P>
<P>
   The site will, of course, offer necessities like a Ghurka laptop
carrying case for $1,295 and a bottle of Chateau Lafite at $10,000.
Luxuryfinder.com, by the way, will eschew more common brands like
Coach Leather, which Gross called ``too low end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Luxuryfinder will provide services like a calendar of
society events and tips by Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, a
grandson of Consuela Vanderbilt, on how to behave like a British
aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Such ambitious competitors have already shaken a few of luxury's
big names out of their ennui. The luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which owns couture houses like
Christian Dior and Givenchy, plans to test the Web waters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Sephora.com, the international cosmetics and beauty
retailer, which is 80 percent owned by LVMH, will go live. The rest
of the company's brands will follow. LVMH, which once saw the Web
as a threat, now sees it as a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone knows for sure how big the market is,
but the demographics are clear, the young affluent and aspiring
affluent customer are already there,'' said Myron Ullman, LVMH's
group managing director. ``So we will be, too.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following articles
from the Style section for use Sunday, Sept. 26, and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   SOTHEBY'S-FASHION (New York) _ A look at Tiffany Dubin, the head
of Sotheby's fashion department. Her ``Cocktails,'' is the latest
in a series of themed auctions of vintage clothing and kitsch
accessories that have challenged the stodgy, elitist world of Old
Master paintings and rare coins that Sotheby's and Ms. Dubin's own
upper-crust background represent. By Elizabeth Hayt. &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   NY-PARKER-BOWLES (New York) _ Eagerly awaiting the arrival of
Camilla Parker Bowles, guests at a Manhattan cocktail party on
Wednesday night were curious to determine the reason for the
alarming 30-minute delay of the Prince of Wales's longtime
paramour. Reports that she was stranded in traffic caused by the
motorcade of Hillary Rodham Clinton _ another famous 52-year-old
visiting New York City, ostensibly to forge a new identity for
herself _ proved inaccurate. ``It wasn't that,'' said Peter Brown,
a British expatriate who helped to mastermind Mrs. Parker Bowles's
four-day sojourn, which included a visit to friends in East
Hampton, a trip to see ``Cabaret,'' a lunch with Brooke Astor and a
walk through SoHo galleries. ``There was a call from a certain
gentleman in London,'' Brown added wryly, ``so of course she was
late.'' By Christopher Mason.
</P>
<P>
   LESBIAN-WEDDING (New York) _ Surrounded by Colonial red-brick
buildings and bathed in golden afternoon light, the betrothed
proceeded down the aisle, each carrying a single purple iris. Under
a white canopy, festooned with purple, yellow and white
gladioluses, the couple read their vows, professed their love and
embraced. It was undeniably breathtaking, straight out of Martha
Stewart Living Lesbian Weddings. I never thought my sister's
wedding would end so picturesquely. By Michael Colton.
</P>
<P>
   WHITNEY-ARTISTS (New York) _ When the Whitney Museum of American
Art sent out letters three weeks ago to the 293 living artists in
``The American Century: Art and Culture 1900-2000'' two-part
exhibition, inviting them to pose for a commemorative group
portrait, no one quite knew what to expect. The RSVP process
quickly dissolved into chaos. So on Thursday morning, there was
little to do but just throw open the museum's front doors and watch
the parade as some of the greatest artists of the last half-century
marched or, in the cases of the wheelchair-bound Chuck Close and
Nam June Paik, rolled in. By Jean Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   AUSSIES-FASHION-WEEK (New York) _ They were mates on a lark: the
actress, the photographer and the stylist, giddy with car service
and invitations to a week's worth of New York fashion shows and
after-parties. This is not to say that the three ex-pat Australians
were rubes _ the actress had chatted her way from Leno to
Letterman, the photographer had taken pictures for Vogues domestic
and international, and the stylist had dressed everyone from Hugh
Grant to Sigourney Weaver. ``We just thought it would be a laugh,''
said Peta Wilson, our actress-under-glass, otherwise known as USA
television's ``La Femme Nikita.'' By Penelope Greene.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-BOB-MACKIE (New York) _ In his 35-plus years in show
business, Bob Mackie has dressed everyone from Bea Arthur to Pia
Zadora in outfits that always twinkled and winked at the audience
and that won him six Emmys and three Oscar nominations. Also on his
resume are Ethel Merman, Flip Wilson, Barbra Streisand, Madonna,
Sharon Stone and RuPaul. He concocted Whoopi Goldberg's Queen
Elizabeth get-up for last year's Oscars. By David Handelman.
</P>
<P>
   With Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (New York) _ With its ancient Middle Eastern
origins, its fuzzy daffodil-yellow skin and a lemony perfume as
penetrating as musk, quince has been suggested as a candidate for
the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden. By Lee Reich.

`FREAKS AND GEEKS' VOTED MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something jolting about ``Freaks and Geeks,'' although
nothing jolting ever actually occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Based in a high school and set in the '80s, it confidently turns
its gaze away from the ``in'' crowd that's populating every other
teen show this season, focusing instead on the periphery occupied
by those who don't want to belong or couldn't, even if they tried
really, really hard.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's not suicidal enough, consider the casting
decisions. The kid stars populating this comedy/drama series look,
behave and sound like kids trekking through your front lawn, which
is astounding, considering what's all the rage on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   Their range of sizes and shapes, both physical and emotional, is
all over the map, and stands in stark contrast to other teen shows,
in which actors seem to have been plucked from a modeling agency.
These kids had to have been discovered behind a shopping mall, just
standing there, too afraid to go in.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a subtle, affectionate, funny, clever series, and
easily one of the bright spots of a TV season that is leaning more
toward dramas that can make you laugh and think at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of original characters here, but the series
follows brother and sister Sam and Lindsay (John Daley and Linda
Cardellini) as high school misfits struggling to enjoy adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, who is smart, spunky and pretty behind that army coat,
baggy clothes and morbid facial expression, is a disaffected girl
who manages to penetrate the camps of both the freaks and the
geeks, but feels loyalty to neither. She's been withdrawn ever
since her grandmother's death _ in a touching scene, she explains
to her brother how she was the last to see her grandmother alive at
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in the opening episode, she's asked by Daniel (James
Franco), a slacker who seems to have his eye on her, to hang out
``on the smoking deck,'' where the freaks congregate. There she
meets Nick, (Jason Segel) who wants to be a rock 'n' roll drummer,
and Ken (Seth Rogen), an acerbic but rebellious student.
</P>
<P>
   Nick invites Lindsay to his house, vowing to cheer her up. Once
there, he shows her a drum set in his parents' garage. ``Before I
had this, I was lost, too,'' he says, showing Lindsay he's more
insightful than she'd figured. ``You need to find your reason for
living. You got to find your big, gigantic drum kit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny, frail and unsure of himself, Sam, a freshman, looks like
he's about 10. He's pushed around by a bully and spends his time
with other misfits _ Neal (Samm Levine), a sci-fi geek who does a
nice impression of William Shatner's Captain Kirk, and Bill, a
lanky kid who might have been dealt the worst of fates: He's a geek
without the advantage of being smart.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is crazy about a cute, softhearted cheerleader who either
shares his affection or feels awfully sorry for him. With curly
hair and a voice that sounds as though it's changing at this very
minute, he's adorable in a vulnerable, puppy-dog sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he and Lindsay sit at the dinner table with their
parents and talk about their day. Or at least their parents talk.
Becky Ann Baker is the mother and Joe Flaherty the father, an
overbearing man whose anecdotes always end in death. ``I had a
friend who used to smoke,'' he tells Lindsay. ``You know where he
is now? Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   And then: ``There was a girl in my school who had premarital
sex. You know what she did on prom night? Died. An overdose of
heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks'' is an amusing little series that even Has
Something To Say, but I wonder to whom they'll say it. Rather than
revisit the drama of high school life honestly, with all its highs
and lows, maybe we'd rather watch the melodrama of ``Dawson's
Creek,'' certainly a much safer place.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly now. We know that the world of jocks and nerds,
preppies and geeks, artsies and braniacs has been under the
microscope ever since the murderous assault in Colorado shed light
on the harmful fallout of cliques, showing us that teen-age
alienation and anger can come with deadly consequences.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about that while watching Lindsay withdraw into her
shell. Her college plans now seem insignificant, and she's eager to
leave her ``brainy'' clique to join the band of chain-smoking
slackers who spend their days slumped on school benches, cursing
the prom, sports and other high school traditions.
</P>
<P>
   During a party at the end of tonight's episode, Lindsay drops
the army coat to take a spin around the dance floor. She's smiling,
too. But you know adolescence. Something's bound to be wrong with
the world by next week's episode.

   When it comes to youth, prime-time realism is really idealism.
Sure, the ``Dawson's Creek'' kids cope with painfully overanalyzed
angst, and the ``Party of Five'' brood withstands more trauma than
a suitcase in a baggage claim. But they all suffer gloriously and
articulately, with a label on their jeans and enough mousse to
arrest even the most ferocious of cowlicks. And while these
teen-idol hotties navigate the impossible years, they are never
seen straying far from the very coolest cliques.
</P>
<P>
   In its own affectionate way, ``Freaks and Geeks'' puts a pimple
into the TV-ized approach to adolescence. This delightfully
observed 1980s-set dramedy is high school as many of us remember
it, with Twinkie-pounding bullies and Army-jacket wearing druggies
and pale nerds with speech impediments and ``Star Trek'' fixations.
It's high school unplugged, a sort of ``Dazed and Confused'' for
the small screen, and it is one of the fall season's most likable
new shows. That NBC has thrown ``Freaks and Geeks'' into the wilds
of Saturday night is only further evidence of network nitwitness.
</P>
<P>
   The Weir family of suburban Michigan is the show's axis.
Sophomore Lindsay, recovering from the death of her grandmother, is
looking beyond her brainy friends and her role as a school
``mathelete'' for new experience. She finds it with the rebellious
freaks who hang on the smoking patio, including a warm thug named
Daniel and a duh drummer named Nick. Meanwhile, her underdeveloped
freshman brother, Sam, dodges a bully and relives ``Saturday night
Live'' gags with his two nerdy friends _ Neal, a pale sci-fi
fanatic, and Bill, a spaced-out Herman Munster with thick glasses.
The three of them are classic geeks.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this straight description does justice to the magic
of ``Freaks and Geeks,'' which is rooted in its small, canny
moments. There is the great gym sequence, in which Sam, Neal, and
Bill weather a game of dodge ball and the sadistic gym teacher who
yells at them, ``Ladies, put down the mascara and get in there.''
There are a series of powerful attacks on Lindsay, by a brassy
blond named Kim who accuses her of using the freaks, by a retarded
boy whom she tries to help, and by her counselor, who says, ``Let's
just rap, as people.'' There is the touchingly painful fistfight
when Neal and Bill go where no nerd has gone and accost the bully.
And there is the brilliant homecoming dance, in which Sam deals
with his first-ever fast dance. The scene is rich with small
realizations, like Kim's reassessment of Lindsay in a glance, and a
visual wit that extends all the way down to the way each character
dances.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strengths of ``Freaks and Geeks'' is its casting,
which is never less than spot on. Where did they come up with these
kids? Each of them is far outside Hollywood's pretty young thing
mold, and perfect for their role. The geeks are the most amusing,
from Samm Levine's Poindexter-ish Neal to John Daley's sweet Sam.
Daley is a real find, with his big teeth and wide eyes that look
dreamily off into the distance. But Linda Cardellini anchors the
show as Lindsay. She conveys introspection and wisdom, but she
nonetheless acts like a sullen teenager who is tired of meeting
everyone else's expectations. She looks like Janeane Garofalo, but
there's nothing ironic about her.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the laughs in ``Freaks and Geeks'' come courtesy of
well-chosen relics of the early 1980s, including a soundtrack that
peaks with ``Come Sail Away'' by Styx. But clever and hip and
allusive aren't the right adjectives for this poignant show, which
aims for more universal coming-of-age themes. You won't find the
freaks and the geeks and the bully and the bitch shrewdly
dissecting their own behavior, or musing about its parallels in the
cinema. These kids are too much in the moment of high school, over
their heads in their search for self-esteem, identity, and the
pleasures of an unsquashed Twinkie.

WHY IS THIS WEDDING DIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 26) 
(jt) 
 By MICHAEL COLTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surrounded by Colonial red-brick buildings and bathed in golden
afternoon light, the betrothed proceeded down the aisle, each
carrying a single purple iris. Under a white canopy, festooned with
purple, yellow and white gladioluses, the couple read their vows,
professed their love and embraced. It was undeniably breathtaking,
straight out of Martha Stewart Living Lesbian Weddings.
</P>
<P>
   I never thought it would end so picturesquely. In the weeks
leading up to my sister's (lesbian) wedding, I grew increasingly
apprehensive about that parenthetical.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I _ so progressive and urbane _ had any moral problems
with the concept, but others might. Such ceremonies are not new,
but most of the people invited to this one had certainly never seen
anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   Who would show up to support her, I wondered, and who would
decline the invitation, citing scheduling conflicts? Would the
ceremony attract heckling onlookers? Would the caterers remember to
place two miniature brides atop the cake?
</P>
<P>
   My sister, Jill, and her partner, Kriss, had long planned a
marriage ceremony, even though it would not be legally binding. I
supported them completely, but didn't always publicly own up to it.
I would tell friends I was going to my sister's ``wedding,'' where
she would be ``married.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the date crept nearer, I began to understand the depth of
their commitment. To cement their union, they changed their names
to Jill and Kriss Sulka, after our great-great-grandmother's
Yiddish name. Unfortunately, they rejected my suggestion: Jill and
Kriss Kristofferson.
</P>
<P>
   I learned their marriage would have an altruistic element as
well; their invitation suggested that guests, in lieu of giving
gifts, donate to an organization that combats homophobia and
heterosexism. I had never heard the latter term, which I suppose
makes me a heterosexist. (My father thought the organization
combated heterosexuality. Can the human race survive, he wondered,
if heterosexuality is outlawed?) My family was not exactly looking
forward to this affair, although we had made great strides in our
tolerance. I had thought in an era when a (lesbian) wedding has
been the subject of an episode of ``Friends'' that the event had
lost its controversial, exotic edge. I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until college that Jill began to date women, after a
seven-year relationship with a man; understandably, it took a long
time for us to be convinced this was not just a phase, not an
aftereffect of majoring in women's studies at Barnard. But Jill had
been best friends with Kriss for years before becoming romantically
involved, so their engagement two years ago was no surprise, to me
at least.
</P>
<P>
   My parents, though, are of a generation in which the
Gay-Straight Alliance was not an official high-school
extracurricular group. They had had certain hopes and expectations
about the wedding of their only daughter _ namely, that it would
involve a groom. They were in a difficult situation: They loved
their child and would do anything to make her happy; yet, that
meant preparing for an event they weren't entirely looking forward
to.
</P>
<P>
   Even though my sister was planning a full Jewish ceremony,
complete with the traditional huppah canopy, the ketubah contract
and the breaking of the glass, it was not quite what my family had
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Some guests vocalized their disapproval of the wedding. One
woman who had accepted Jill's invitation acknowledged that during
the ceremony she might have to physically turn away. My sister
appreciated the thoughtful sentiment, but told her that her support
would be better expressed by staying home.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was perfect the day of the ceremony, but other signs
were less auspicious. The wedding program contained a typo,
referring to ``gay and ledbian marriages.'' And the reception was
to take place at an arts center, where the caterer placed the
cheese table below a painting entitled ``The Train to Auschwitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the outdoor service was gorgeous. While Jill and Kriss,
dressed in white silk gowns, read their vows, I gazed at the crowd;
both Jill's lesbian friends and her more conservative relatives
were crying. Toward the end of the ceremony, the rabbi addressed
the subtext of the occasion: ``Unfortunately, we still live in a
society that does not recognize gay and lesbian marriages, and we
still live in a world where it is often dangerous emotionally, and
sometimes physically, for Jill and Kriss to be open with their
lives and with their love.'' He added, ``The importance of your
presence as family and friends cannot be underestimated.'' The rest
of the afternoon, we played a guessing game about the rabbi: Was
she gay? Bi? Or just really hip?
</P>
<P>
   At the reception, the awkwardness eased. ``Your love sets a
standard the rest of us would be lucky to reach,'' a guest told
Jill. Even my parents loosened up; my father began his toast with a
killer line: ``Is everybody having a gay time?''
</P>
<P>
   I had agonized over my own toast. Should I avoid talking about
homosexuality? At a heterosexual wedding, I wouldn't raise a glass
to ``this happy heterosexual couple.'' Why should this be
different?
</P>
<P>
   But I decided to go with it. ``We're Michael and Brian, Jill's
brothers,'' I said. ``We're the reason she prefers the company of
women.'' I followed with a comment about Jill managing to lose her
virginity twice. ``I'd like to conclude,'' I said, ``with a song by
Melissa Etheridge. No, I'm just kidding. I hope that wasn't
heterosexist of me. Jill, was that heterosexist?''
</P>
<P>
   In the week after the wedding, while Jill and Kriss were on
their Cape Cod honeymoon, guests called my parents to thank them
for the wonderful afternoon, and their sincerity proved the wedding
was not something to be embarrassed about. On the contrary, my
mother was anxious to watch the wedding video, even to make a copy
for herself.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone can grasp the concept of the lesbian wedding.
Recently, I was flipping through my photos from the wedding while
on the subway, and the burly man next to me couldn't help looking.
``Is that your sister?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Pause. ``Is she _ the groom?''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Did I wear that?'' Carol Burnett asked, pointing at a
mannequin wearing an outlandish yellow sequined jump suit topped
off by a sequin daisy and with a long slit up the leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's Mitzi Gaynor,'' replied Bob Mackie, the designer of
the daisy outfit _ as well as 160 others _ at the opening party
Thursday night for ``Unmistakably Mackie,'' his retrospective at
the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. (The show's
title is also the name of a new tie-in book and a tie-in
fragrance.)
</P>
<P>
   In his 35-plus years in show business, Mackie has dressed
everyone from Bea Arthur to Pia Zadora in outfits that always
twinkled and winked at the audience and that won him six Emmys and
three Oscar nominations. Also on his resume are Ethel Merman, Flip
Wilson, Barbra Streisand, Madonna, Sharon Stone and RuPaul. He
concocted Whoopi Goldberg's Queen Elizabeth get-up for last year's
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   But most famously, he collaborated with Ms. Burnett and Cher,
and they dominate the FIT exhibition. Though Cher was in Florida on
her ``Believe'' tour (wearing more Mackies), Ms. Burnett and Liza
Minnelli were on hand to accompany Mackie down his distinctive
memory lane, mobbed by fashionistas, fashion students and fashion
victims.
</P>
<P>
   As Mackie ushered Ms. Burnett past costumes from her
long-running variety show, she said, ``I didn't know what I'd do
with a character until he did the outfit.'' The most memorable one
was upstairs: her Scarlett O'Hara parody, made out of drapery and
upholstery fabric, with a curtain rod still stuck through the top.
``Probably on my tombstone it'll say, `He designed the curtain-rod
dress,''' Mackie mused.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many other contenders on display through Dec. 31,
including his ``Vegas Bride,'' whose feather-trimmed cape is
decorated with a roulette wheel illuminated by moving Christmas
lights, and Cher's ``Snake'' outfit with sequined sleeves that drag
on the floor. ``I always try to get a laugh,'' Mackie said.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie himself wore a black velvet blazer and a tie with
multicolored polka dots. ``I got it from one of those catalogs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included luminaries like Pauline Trigere and Kenneth
Jay Lane; the fashion illustrator Kenneth Paul Block; the actress
Teri Hatcher, looking smashing in a minuscule silver beaded Mackie,
and flashy unknowns like a decorator in leather pants and a shirt
he'd had custom tailored out of three $49 Bob Mackie
``Kaleidoscope'' scarves he had bought on QVC.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Minnelli arrived, the room was warm with body heat. She
clasped Mackie's hand, warning, ``My hand is sweaty, sweetheart.''
</P>
<P>
   He replied, ``At least I know whose it is!'' Indeed, Ms.
Minnelli has known Mackie since she was 17 and he was the assistant
designer on Judy Garland's television show. She recalled, ``Bob
cared about me and what I looked like when everybody else just
cared about my mom.'' She announced that she had just enlisted
Mackie for her next show, ``Minnelli on Minnelli,'' opening in New
York on Dec. 2. Staring at an emerald gown, she gushed: ``That
color is fabulous! It's staggering! You changed the whole world!''
</P>
<P>
   Mackie at least changed the Emmy Awards: he received the first
one ever awarded for costume design, for a 1967 production of
``Alice Through the Looking Glass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, they thought everybody just brought their clothes
from home, or shopped at Saks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the crowd had thinned out, and before he headed to dinner,
Mackie took one last look at Ms. Burnett's washerwoman character's
raggedy shmatte. ``The most beautiful thing I ever designed!'' he
said.

A TREASURE FOR BOTH EYE AND PALATE: QUINCE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LEE REICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its ancient Middle Eastern origins, its fuzzy
daffodil-yellow skin and a lemony perfume as penetrating as musk,
quince has been suggested as a candidate for the forbidden fruit of
the Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take a bite: a fresh quince is tart, slightly
astringent and dry. Only after cooking _ spicing up an apple pie or
a batch of applesauce, or on its own as jelly _ is quince most
enticing.
</P>
<P>
   With one or more main stems or trunks, the common quince might
be described as either a shrubby tree or a treelike shrub. The
plant rarely grows more than 15 feet high and is adaptable from
subtropical climates to those where temperatures plummet to 25
below in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Besides good eating, the common quince offers two seasons of
beauty. One is now, when the stems are festooned with bright fruits
shaped like muscular apples. In spring, the beauty is a bit more
subdued, as blossoms unfold in white, or sometimes pink.
</P>
<P>
   The single blossoms are rarely nipped by frost because they
appear relatively late in spring at the tips of new shoots. Growth
beyond these shoots is from stems that angle off just behind the
flowers to give an old tree a craggy, picturesque appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse this quince with the more commonly planted
flowering quince, Chaenomeles speciosa, which bursts with blooms,
usually salmon-pink, earlier in spring. The green, rock-hard fruits
of flowering quince are edible, but barely so and then only after
extensive doctoring up with heat and sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   Although edible quince is not widely planted these days, you can
still come across trees planted decades ago in dank corners of old
lots, often the only relics of gardens past.
</P>
<P>
   Don't judge quince by the knobby, woody fruit on these neglected
plants. Plant quince yourself in rich, well-drained soil bathed in
sunlight, and you will be rewarded with quinces that ripen to
succulent perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The soil shouldn't be too rich, though, because, like the
related apple and pear, quince is susceptible to fire blight, a
disease that typically attacks overly vigorous shoots. Blighted
leaves blacken and remain attached to shoots while the shoot tips
curl over in a characteristic shepherd's crook, as if singed by
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Decrease the chance of disease by keeping shoot growth in check
_ avoid fertilization or heavy pruning, which can stimulate
excessive growth. If the disease does appear, it can be controlled
by diligently pruning out branches with blight. Make cuts six
inches back, into healthy wood, and sterilize shears between cuts
by dipping them in alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the possibility of fire blight scare you away from
growing this tasty fruit, though. Trees surviving in abandoned
gardens are testimony to the ease with which quinces can be grown.
Generally, few pests, if any, cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much the only regular care a quince plant needs is light
pruning in late winter. When the plant is young, train it either as
a small tree with one or a few trunks, or as a many-stemmed
spreading bush.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, after that, shorten some stems each year and
totally remove some others, enough to keep the plant open to light
and air and to stimulate the foot or two of new growth needed
annually to keep the plant fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   Because quince doesn't need cross-pollination, only a single
plant is needed for fruiting. The first fruit comes a couple of
years after planting, and a mature plant yields two to five bushels
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides turning fully yellow, fruits indicate their ripeness by
readily detaching from the plant when given a slight upward twist.
Although relatively hard, the fruits bruise easily, so handle them
with care.
</P>
<P>
   Quince is an ancient fruit that long ago made its way west from
its original home. The Greeks grew the fruit and dedicated it to
Aphrodite, their goddess of love. Columella, a Roman writer in the
first century, said, ``Quinces not only yield pleasure, but
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultivation of the fruit spread throughout Europe, and plants
crossed the Atlantic with the colonists. In America, quinces were
stewed into compote, fermented into wine and cooked down into a
``butter'' or into a syrup that once flavored soda fountain drinks.
</P>
<P>
   As cultivation of quince spread, new varieties originated. Among
the more popular varieties is Orange, which does best in cool
summer areas and yields golden yellow fruit whose orangy flesh
turns red upon cooking. Pineapple, bred in 1899 by Luther Burbank,
is similar to Orange, but with a tender white flesh that is only
slightly astringent.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank also bred the variety Van Deman, whose fruit is large
and almost pear-shaped. Van Deman is among the hardier varieties.
Another American variety is Champion, very large and pear-shaped,
with greenish yellow flesh. Champion ripens very late, but keeps
well.
</P>
<P>
   Smyrna is an old variety that entered this country in 1897. The
fruits are large, with white flesh and lemon-yellow skin. A recent
introduction from the Black Sea region is Aromatnaya, which,
besides being used in cooking, is sweet and soft enough to be eaten
raw. Fruits newly picked from a well-tended tree are best for
eating fresh.
</P>
<P>
   If you enjoy tart fruit, you might try the raw fruits of any
quince variety _ fresh-picked from the tree and well grown, of
course. They look mighty enticing.
</P>
<P>

SPEED OPENS UP NEW USES FOR NET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt about it: Life is different in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, I wrote a column describing what it's like to
have high-speed Internet access at home. After about a month of
living with a cable modem connection, I'm finding that the way I
use the Net is changing, and that applications I once didn't
consider _ or considered impractical _ are suddenly useful.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also finding that it remains a technology with some bugs to
work out.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, fast online connections come in two flavors _ one
from cable TV providers and the other from telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Net junkies have to decide which one they want. In some cases,
they may have no choice, because availability is spotty for both
technologies. For example, I can get cable modem service at my
house, but I'm too far away from my phone company's central office
to get ADSL. (I tested ADSL, or Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber
Lines, via a connection at work.)
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion I made was this: When high-speed access works,
it's heavenly. When it doesn't, it's hellish. I found Southwestern
Bell's version of ADSL, dubbed FasTrak, generally more reliable
than Time Warner Communications' cable modem service, RoadRunner.
That was largely due to a mysterious problem that has since been
solved.
</P>
<P>
   I was getting a rhythmic lagging, or latency, with RoadRunner.
Every five to 30 seconds or so, my connection would suddenly stop
responding, then pick up again. It took Time Warner more than 10
days to get a technician to my house to check it out. After seeing
everything was OK on my end, he discovered that a device called a
sweep, which checks cable TV signals for problems, had been
improperly installed, interfering with the frequencies used to
deliver Internet service. He changed some settings, and my problem
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm a much happier camper. RoadRunner also has tweaked its
Houston network and added another connection to the outside world.
Things are much zippier, though there are still small network
outages of various types that happen too frequently, and the system
still slows down noticeably during the evening, prime-time hours.
It's frustrating having your online experience swing rapidly from
exhilarating to depressing and back again.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when I turned on my computer this morning,
RoadRunner was down _ I was unable to get e-mail or access to the
Web. But a half-hour later, I downloaded a 46-megabyte file in just
a few minutes at a speed of 150 kilobytes a second. That's more
than 11 times faster than my old ISDN connection, and 30 times
faster than most 56K modems. Yowza!
</P>
<P>
   Despite these ups and downs, I am discovering that high-speed
Internet access is indeed a very different beast than the dial-up
species. When you have a fast, always-on connection, you tend to
think differently about it and use it in ways that you would have
avoided in the past.
</P>
<P>
   I am becoming more interested in being able to view streaming
video on my PC. I've been checking out music videos, online
interviews and small movies that have been created just for the
Web. The other night, I was fascinated by a 30-minute filmed
conversation with actor Peter Falk, best known for his role as the
rumpled detective Colombo. I would never have watched something
like that with my slower ISDN connection, and certainly not via
dial-up.
</P>
<P>
   I also have been playing around with more programs that work
best when a PC is connected to the Internet on a full-time basis.
These same programs are irritating with a phone-line connection
because _ depending on your system's configuration _ a dial-up box
appears when they want to access the Net and the PC is not online.
</P>
<P>
   _ SocketWatch 3.2, $10, Locutus Codeware: I've long had a
version of SocketWatch on my computer, and used it only
occasionally to reset my PC's internal clock. Now, I leave it
running all the time, and it keeps me continuously on time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that personal computers are fairly
sophisticated devices, they have one interesting flaw that harkens
back to the time of mechanical timepieces _ their built-in clocks
tend to lose a few seconds or even minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   SocketWatch fixes this problem by connecting to atomic clocks
linked to the Internet, grabbing the correct time and resetting
your PC's clock accordingly. The shareware version you can download
at www.locutuscodeware.com will automatically update your PC's
clock a few times, and then you must do it manually. Once you
register, it will update regularly at intervals you set.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a dial-up connection, you have to be connected
when it wants to access an atomic clock. With an always-on
connection, your PC's time is always right.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guru.Net, free, Guru International: This is one of the most
intriguing uses of the Web I've ever seen. The folks I've shown
this combination program and Web site are usually astounded _ and,
of course, they must have it.
</P>
<P>
   First, you download a small program from www.guru.net that
places an icon in your Windows 95/98/NT system tray. Then, when you
hold down the ALT key and click on any word, you get a dictionary
definition of that word in a small pop-up window.
</P>
<P>
   That's cool enough by itself, but there's more. If the word has
some specialized meaning, it might draw the definition from a
technical dictionary. If there's an encyclopedia entry for it,
you'll get that, too. You also get Web site links for some words.
</P>
<P>
   And if you alt-click on the name of a public company, you get
the latest stock quote, a stock chart and other financial details.
</P>
<P>
   This works in any Windows application that has standard text _ a
browser, a word processor, e-mail, a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it's most useful with an always-on Internet connection.
If you have to dial in to a provider just to check the meaning of a
word, it's almost a nuisance.
</P>

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Aloft with an angel
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ The readers write . . .
</P>
<P>
   This letter comes from a longtime friend, Susie Blair of
Alexandria, La., in response to a recent column on a scary plane
ride I experienced. Hers is a better story than mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on a plane in Atlanta to come home and was pleased to
find a friend already on board, the beloved Catholic bishop of
Louisiana. We became seat mates and I was looking forward to
talking with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had flown for about 30 minutes and were well away from
Atlanta when the plane started flip-flopping wildly, so much so
that we all were falling off our seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine the panic. I soon saw that everyone was
looking at the bishop as if they thought he could do something, and
should do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old gentleman leaned back on his seat, raised his hands
and quietly spoke in a resounding, yet soothing voice:
</P>
<P>
   `` `I had a dear friend, the bishop who served Louisiana before
I did. He slipped and fell in his kitchen and hit his head on the
table.' There was a pause as everyone became very quiet. `He died
from the blow.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The quiet remained. A calm settled over the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot told us we would have to head back to Atlanta, and
we all were in doubt the plane could make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the panic did not return. Needless to say, we made it. I
think all of the people on board were doing a lot of deep
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's an e-mail from Tom and Jayn Meinhardt,
cincivegan(AT)juno.com, asking for an update on Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Regular readers may recall that Beauty is our Catahoula cow dog,
one of eight canines that make their home with us, all of which
came from either the side of the road or the animal shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty, hardly bigger than your hand when we took her in, was
blind and deaf as the result of what turned out to be a treatable
virus. She's all cured, fully grown (they're called cow dogs
because they get to be about the size of a cow) and is quite a
handful.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, she managed to get up under the house and rip out
a significant quantity of insulation, dragging great chunks of it
into the back yard. Good thing we were able to stop her before she
got to the plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has itthat Lewis and Clark selected a Catahoula to take
with them on their expedition into the Louisiana Purchase, mainly
because it required no extra food supplies, being able to forage on
its own, even living off bark from a tree, if necessary. For a
fact, I think Beauty could eat the boards off the house.
</P>
<P>
   From Carl Milliken, West Alexander, Pa.:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if you are still doing the `Free Books for Kids'
program, but if you are I would appreciate it if you would send me
some books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am 14 years old, and I read around the tenth-grade reading
level. I enjoy science fiction and fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly. Free Books for Kids is an ongoing project. Any child
can write in and receive a free book by return mail. If possible,
enclose four first-class stamps for postage. If you don't have the
stamps, that's OK. You'll still get a book.
</P>
<P>
   The above letter is a good example of the information to
include: age, reading level and types of books that interest you.
</P>
<P>
   Also, make sure the return address is correct and legible. I get
any number of books returned by the post office because of the
address being incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Write to Free Books for Kids, c/o Joe Murray, P.O. Box 151108,
Lufkin, Texas, 75915.

FOR 82 ARTISTS, IMMORTALITY IS WORTH RISING EARLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JEAN NATHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Whitney Museum of American Art sent out
letters three weeks ago to the 293 living artists in ``The American
Century: Art and Culture 1900-2000'' two-part exhibition, inviting
them to pose for a commemorative group portrait, no one quite knew
what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The RSVP process quickly dissolved into chaos. So on Thursday
morning, there was little to do but just throw open the museum's
front doors and watch the parade as some of the greatest artists of
the last half-century marched or, in the cases of the
wheelchair-bound Chuck Close and Nam June Paik, rolled in.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 82 artists who made it, including Jasper Johns, James
Rosenquist, George Segal, Richard Avedon, Jeff Koons, Laurie
Simmons and Philip Pearlstein, all seemed to feel this was a
command appearance, with Part 2 of the show, ``1950-2000,'' opening
Sunday, and running through Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Walker, at 29 the youngest artist in the show, was the
first to arrive, and she also traveled the farthest. Her trip had
begun the day before with a flight from Los Angeles to Providence,
R.I., then continued early on Thursday morning with a hop to
Kennedy International Airport early.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 a.m., she stumbled into the museum bleary-eyed. ``You
know what made me want to be here?'' she said. ``The suspicion that
I'm going to die in obscurity. I thought I'd better show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cadmus, at 94 the oldest in the show, followed soon
afterward, by train from Weston, Conn. ``Six is awfully early for
me to get up,'' he said, ``but this is a very important occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nan Goldin had also arisen at 6 _ to shower before the water in
her Greenwich Village apartment was turned off for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   When Brice Marden, another Villager, was asked if he found the
hour a little early, he said, ``No, but it's a little far uptown.''
</P>
<P>
   For many it was an emotional reunion of comrades-in-arms from
the succession of late-20th-century art movements, including
Abstract Expressionism, Pop and performance art.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenquist blew kisses in all directions, and many exchanged
bearhugs. Jack Pierson, glancing at Cadmus, had awe in his voice
when he said, ``I can remember seeing his work in the Encyclopedia
Brittanica.'' Yoko Ono, in the show as a member of Fluxus, the
avante-garde group, choked back tears as she described a
realization that ``each artist has had long struggles of pain and
creativity and inspiration to come to this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each artist is like an island alone,'' she added, ``but when
we get together we're one body. We make the latter half-century of
the history of American Art. That's pretty heavy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Ligon expressed a similar feeling on a lighter note.
Recalling how he'd awakened at 4 a.m. in Brooklyn in the throes of
``photo anxiety,'' he went on to say he fell back asleep, but that
when the alarm went off he told himself: ``You better get your butt
up there. It's historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolee Schneemann had told the Whitney she would not be able to
attend because she was scheduled to teach at the University of
Maryland. ``I changed my mind,'' she said, a suitcase on wheels
trailing her. ``The photograph is going to endure, and the teaching
we can replicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Oppenheim, who arrived with his daughter Kristin
Oppenheim, also in the show, agreed it was a must-attend. But his
daughter ``was so relaxed she wasn't going to come,'' he said,
until he insisted. ``I told her: `Man, you have to come to this. It
would be a bad career move not to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Smith said she was feeling ``crabby,'' which may have been
because she was hauling 30 pounds of art materials, videos and
other supplies, as she was on her way to teach a class at Bard
College. Or maybe it was because that morning she had squeezed in a
quick burial of her cat, who had died two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:45 a.m., Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, a photographer who has
made a career documenting the art world, began the potentially
dicey business of putting his subjects in their places, grouping
them on and around a granite counter in the lobby. ``My biggest
dread was how to place people because of all the egos,'' he said
later. If egos were bruised, it was not evident. Really, there
wasn't a bad seat _ or orange crate, stool, counter top or ladder _
in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing, just amazing,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson,
the Whitney's director, as he surveyed the group from the
sidelines. ``It kind of looks like an American flag, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Three times Greenfield-Sanders stopped the shoot to fit in
stragglers. Ten minutes, five camera changes and 39 frames later,
it was done. Three artists _ Mark di Suvero, Billy Kluver and Ross
Bleckner _ arrived too late. ``The traffic was beyond,'' said a
cresfallen Bleckner, holding the set of vampire teeth he had
planned to wear in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``History doesn't wait,'' Greenfield-Sanders said in a
mock-chiding tone. ``Even at the Whitney.''

THERE'S MORE TO THE NET THAN THE WEB, LIKE INTERNET RELAY CHAT, FOR
INSTANCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently stopped using America Online and signed up with a
local Internet provider. I like it a lot so far, but there's one
thing I really miss from AOL _ chat rooms. A friend of mine pointed
me to chat Web sites, like www.talkcity.com, but they're just not
the same. He also suggested I check out IRC. I tried but was
completely bewildered! Can you tell me about IRC and how to use it?
</P>
<P>
   A: What's fascinating about the growth of the World Wide Web is
how it has overshadowed and even consumed other aspects of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a lot of newcomers to the online world think the Web is
the Net. But many of these other components still exist, and they
are just as useful.
</P>
<P>
   IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, and it's very similar in the
way it looks and works to the chat rooms on America Online. But the
trick is that you have to connect to a server somewhere on the
Internet first before you can enter an IRC ``channel,'' the
equivalent of a chat room. This is like plugging into a switchboard
before you can place a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   There's another complicating factor. There are different IRC
networks, and each one has its own set of channels. For example,
there might be a channel called games on EFNet, another on DALnet
and a third on the Undernet. So, if you are trying to find someone,
or arrange a meeting with IRC, you will need to decide which
network to use.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've chosen a network, you'll need to pick a server. You
can find a server via the Web pages of the various networks, and a
good list of the networks is at NewIRCusers.com. (It's an excellent
place to get started if you're new to IRC.)
</P>
<P>
   In order to get online, you'll need software. Just as you needed
to get separate e-mail and Web browser software when you left AOL,
you'll also need a program _ called an IRC client _ to get onto
IRC.
</P>
<P>
   There are several good ones for both Windows and Macintosh
systems. One of the most popular for Windows is mIRC, available at
www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/6000/index.html. Another chat
client, MSN Chat, comes with Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.0.
Macintosh users can try Ircle at www.ircle.com or MacIRC at
www.macirc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've set up this software and pointed it at a server and
a network, it will display a list of channels to join. Most IRC
clients let you either double-click on a channel, or you can join
it by typing /join channelname, where channelname is the name of
the channel you want to join.
</P>
<P>
   If you can to create a channel that doesn't exist, just do a
/join channelname, where channelname is the name of a channel that
does not exist, and it will be created for you.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that there is no global moderating service for IRC
channels, as there is for AOL's chat rooms. If someone does or says
something offensive online, you can complain to a channel's
operator _ if he or she is present. Some channel operators have set
up software-based moderators, called 'bots, that may watch for
offensive language or online behavior, but that's usually not the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've got Windows 98 on my computer and I was wondering if it
comes with any kind of FTP program or utility.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it does, but it's not one you'll want to use _ unless
you like text-based FTP programs, which are dismal.
</P>
<P>
   Bring up an MS-DOS window (there should be an MS-DOS Prompt icon
in your Programs folder off the Start Menu) and enter FTP sitename,
where ``sitename'' is the name of the FTP site you want. You'll see
that it's pretty primitive. Unlike a browser-based FTP connection,
you even have to login on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet, if you'd rather not use a browser, is to grab a
shareware FTP program, such as CuteFTP (www.cuteftp.com) or WS-FTP
Pro (www.ipswitch.com). They are much easier to use.

 &HT;    Gun violence, not Buchanan, is the threat to Republican election
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Irony often runs thick in politics, but never
so thick as this year when we have the remarkable scene of
Republicans trying to keep Pat Buchanan in the party when really
they all just want him to, Go Pat, Go.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this especially rich is that George W. Bush is doing
some of the schmoozing, when it was Buchanan's speech before the
Republican Party that is widely seen as beginning the elder Bush's
downfall against Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It could get even better. Are Republicans so worried about
Buchanan leaving that they would be willing to, say, let him
keynote the convention one night? That would give Buchanan the
chance to torpedo two Bushes, and I'm sure he is salivating at the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I suppose it is a minor point that Buchanan is almost
as far on the fringe of the Republican Party as David Duke. Forget
affliations for a moment and look at the campaign statements of all
the major Republican candidates, plus Buchanan. Do these people
really look like they represent the same party?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans should be gleeful at the prospect that Buchanan
might leave. The sooner he goes the better. They ought to sound
trumpets and tell the world they have rid themselves of a
ne'er-do-well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are fawning over him and missing the real danger
to the election of the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   That is: gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, the Democrats are seen as the party of
welfare give-aways and that has cost them dearly. It probably cost
them control of Congress. Rightly or wrongly, the Republicans are
seen as the party of gun rights. The cost here is yet to be
measured.
</P>
<P>
   We all remember a time when nobody believed the welfare mess
could be fixed, but much has been done to make it better. No one
knows what to do about gun violence, either.
</P>
<P>
   But if Republicans are going to weather this storm, they better
start coming up with some ideas, and quickly. With each multiple
church, school or office shooting, the electorate is going to
become more impatient and more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in some response to the Fort Worth school shooting,
Bush and Attorney General John Cornyn announced a two-year program
that is sure to draw derision, and may deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   What does the $1.6 million do? Most of the money goes to provide
eight new prosecutors _ eight lawyers _ most likely to the large
cities. With apologies to my legal friends, has any problem in
recorded history ever been solved by hiring lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   Another $300,000 will go to a toll-free telephone hotline for
reporting those suspected of illegally using or possessing guns.
</P>
<P>
   Uhhhh, can't I just call the local Crimestoppers line with the
same information?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gov. Bush, listen to this better idea. Take that
$300,000 and dole it out to local Crimestoppers organizations who
would then pay a bonus for those who turned in gun violators.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush/Cornyn program, even if instituted on a nationwide
basis, would not have stopped a single mass shooting that we've
suffered through in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Not one.
</P>
<P>
   We can all be assured that it will not stop the next one or the
one after that, either. The more the sound of gunfire echoes
through the primaries and the general campaign, the more you'll
hear the drumbeat from people of all political persuasions: What
are we going to do about gun violence?
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush, don't believe the people who tell you nothing can be
done without stripping the Second Amendment, that is balderdash. If
we can fix welfare without starving people, we can do something
about gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint: First you have to try.

CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR TAPS PERSONAL WEALTH FOR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE and ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayoral candidate Clint Reilly has spent more
than $2 million of his own money on his campaign, according to
financial reports, and he is on pace to break the spending record
set four years ago by the man he is trying to unseat.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire businessman and former political consultant
still faces tough odds against Mayor Willie Brown, who has raised
$1.7 million from contributors and has stockpiled more cash heading
into the last six weeks of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reports filed with the Ethics Commission on
Thursday also showed former Mayor Frank Jordan plunking down
$150,000 of his own money in hopes he won't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   The vast sums of money raised means that voters will be
inundated with campaign mailings and advertising before the Nov. 2
election, especially with polls showing that four of 10 voters are
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of these campaigns is going to be looking to deliver
their messages, often at great expense, and voters will feel it,''
said political strategist Jim Gonzalez, a former San Francisco
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign reports reflect the high-stakes duel between
Reilly's wallet and Brown's Rolodex of contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who made his fortune as a political consultant and
commercial real estate landlord, had loaned his campaign $902,000
by the end of July. Since then, he has poured another $1,158,000
into the race.
</P>
<P>
   That means that over the last three months Reilly spent an
average $14,662 per day on the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does is it forces Mayor Brown and other candidates to
spend time raising money from thousands of individuals to keep pace
with an individual who can dig deeper in his own pockets,'' Brown
campaign spokesman P.J. Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the Reilly campaign spent $2.259 million,
which is close to a record for spending by a candidate in a San
Francisco mayor's race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Brown set the record by spending about $2.7 million on
his successful campaign, which included a six-week run-off race
against Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clint will spend whatever is necessary to compete with the
special interests that are funding Willie Brown's campaign,''
Reilly spokesman Tom Pier said. But Reilly hurt his own
fund-raising efforts by rejecting the voluntary $600,000 spending
cap that voters approved in 1995. Instead of being able to raise
money in $500 chunks, he can only accept contributions of $150 or
less.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Reilly raised just $31,000 from 200 supporters in
the most recent period.
</P>
<P>
   Brown once again demonstrated his fund-raising prowess by
raising $675,000 in less than three months, bringing his total for
the year to $1,737,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown could get an even bigger boost from independent
expenditures _ payments for advertising and other expenses made
independently from the official campaign _ from groups such as the
Committee on Jobs, a business lobbying group, and the Democratic
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Brown's donors are politicians, real estate
developers and bank executives. The politicians include San
Francisco Supervisors Sue Bierman and Mark Leno; U.S. Rep. Sam
Farr, D-Calif.; state Sen. James Costa, D-Fresno; and San Francisco
District Attorney Terence Hallinan, who is also seeking
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's notable supporters include the lawyer Johnnie Cochran
Jr., the author Terry McMillan, the actor Danny Glover and
presidential confidant Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the spending frenzy of Reilly and Brown, Frank Jordan has
promised to abide by the voluntary $600,000 spending cap. He
criticized Brown and Reilly for ignoring the spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters have spoken clearly and I will respect their
wishes,'' he said. ``City Hall is not for sale by Brown and cannot
be bought by Reilly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his criticism of Reilly, Jordan is also largely
self-financing his campaign. More than half of the $264,000 in his
campaign treasury comes from the $150,000 loan he made to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven other candidates are running for mayor of San Francisco.

NABISCO RETIREES FEEL PLANT'S CLOSING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: N.J.) 
 
By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The members of the Houston Bakery Retirees' Club are
upset. The Nabisco plant to which so many of them gave decades of
their lives is shutting down Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   They can't stand to see Nabisco's nearly 100-year history in
Houston disappear like that. And they feel badly for the workers
who have to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They're also worried about their club. Nabisco provided many of
the door prizes and bingo prizes _ boxes of Chewy Chips Ahoy,
Nabisco Grahams and Ritz Crackers _ and contributed several hundred
dollars a year to help the club with its mailings and copying
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The strain was apparent during a recent monthly meeting as the
members discussed the rental price of meeting rooms around Houston.
Fifty-five dollars seemed like a steep price to pay for a club that
charges only $12 a year in dues, but they've outgrown the free room
the public library provides.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a powerful group with lobbyists and politicians in its
corner.Club members meet for potluck lunches, play bingo and plan
outings to the dog races in nearby La Marque and the Blue Bell
Creamery in Brenham, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the 122-member group, whose members worked the lines making
Ritz Crackers, Chips Ahoy cookies and graham crackers, has written
letters to the mayor and governor, asking them to do something to
keep the plant open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to just lie down and let them close it,'' said
Charlie Traylor, a mixer who worked on the Ritz and Chips Ahoy
lines at the plant for 36 years before he retired in 1984. ``We're
going to fight a little.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RESPONSES FROM BUSH, BROWN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush just received a letter from the club and
will look into the situation, said Linda Edwards, his press
secretary in Austin. The governor, Edwards said, understands their
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Mayor Lee Brown's office is working with political and
union leaders to sell the plant and save the jobs, said spokeswoman
Tracey Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Houston Partnership has asked Nabisco officials to
reconsider the decision to close the plant. But Kent Fuller, vice
president of marketing for the Economic Development Division, said
that appears unlikely, so now the Partnership is shopping the
property to other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sandbach, spokesman for Nabisco in Parsippany, N.J., said
Nabisco is closing its plant here because it has too much capacity
companywide. The Houston plant, while efficient, is smaller and
older than the company's other plants.
</P>
<P>
   The plant had 425 employees until a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   When a plant closes, it's usually the current employees who come
forward and lament the loss of jobs. Retirees aren't typically the
folks who fight to save a plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably won't affect me, my benefits or my pension,'' said
Helen Storey, who retired in 1985 after working at the plant for 43
years. ``But I hate it because of the people who are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Storey joined the plant shortly after she graduated from high
school and earned the princely wage of 35 cents an hour. Lots of
people weren't making more than 25 cents, said Storey, who now
lives in Lufkin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The plant gave Storey a good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for Nabisco, I wouldn't have what I have now,'' said
Storey, who brought a cold vegetable salad for the potluck lunch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CLUB LOSES SOURCE OF MEMBERS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The club has enjoyed steady membership growth since it was
formed 11 years ago. But now with the plant closing, the stream of
retirees will dry up.
</P>
<P>
   To keep going _ the club's motto is ``Friendship Forever'' _ the
club may open membership to any Nabisco worker with vested pension
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In between discussions of a trip to Moody Gardens in Galveston
and reports of the progress of members who have fallen ill, a buzz
settled over the room.
</P>
<P>
   It started in the back and spread to the front until Ruth Hall,
the secretary/treasurer, addressed it head-on: She had heard a
rumor _ just a rumor, she cautioned everyone _ that the retirees
may be invited back for a lunch and one last look around.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't an official invitation or anything. But there was
so much excitement at the news that Hall had to raise her voice to
restore order.
</P>
<P>
   It would be so nice to go back, she lamented later, and get one
last look at where she spent 41 years of her life.

SPARSE LABOR HARD PILL FOR PHARMACIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN BROOKS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Pharmacists these days are moving from
counting pills to counting perks.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of managed care and aging baby boomers, new drugs
and better health care, a nationwide shortage of pharmacists has
recruiters scrambling _ and the objects of their attention are
loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it like this before,'' said Arlington
pharmacist Maurice King, who has been in the business 15 years and
says he constantly gets calls from employers nationwide. ``These
chain stores, especially, are just starving for people, and you can
literally write your own ticket. It's always been good, but now
it's even better. I'm enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chain drugstores nationwide have about 3,500 open positions for
pharmacists. Yet, with attrition, the industry is likely to have
only about 2,500 new practitioners next year, said Ed Webb, vice
president for professional affairs and health policy at the
American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, which represents all
81 pharmacy schools in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general feeling right now is that if you could
wave a wand and double the output of pharmacy schools, that would
be nice,'' Webb said. ``But as an associate professor, while you
can draw down 70, 80, $90,000 a year, the industry can double that
in a heartbeat,'' which strains efforts to expand schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation hit Texas in the past year or two _ sooner than it
did in the rest of the nation _ because the state is growing so
rapidly, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, rural West Texas has had the most difficulty
finding pharmacy staff. But lately, the loudest cry has come from
Fort Worth-Dallas, where chains have aggressively pursued new
markets, said Gay Dodson, executive director of the Texas State
Board of Pharmacy. The board supervises pharmacist licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Walgreens, for example, has opened 75 Fort Worth-Dallas area
stores in the past three years, taking more than 200 pharmacists
off the market with stock-option plans and scholarship/internship
programs, corporate spokesman Michael Polzin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of our fastest-growing new markets in the country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry struggles to answer the pharmacist shortage
with initiatives that include expanding university programs and
research in areas such as robotics to speed up distribution,
pharmacists who look to up the ante are finding a buyer's market.
</P>
<P>
   It includes big pay, hiring bonuses, stock options, extended
vacation packages and quality-of-life initiatives such as
guaranteed lunch hours and relocation pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read that some of them are offering cars,'' Dodson said.
``I get letters at home wanting me to go to work, and I haven't
practiced in 17 years. They're that desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Temporary-employment agencies in Fort Worth-Dallas have seen
increased requests for relief help, and some pharmacies are having
to wait for temporary help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're several thousand short in this area,'' said Michael
Speer, business segment manager for Dallas-based HealthStaf.
``Right now we're staffing probably close to 200 or 250 different
pharmacists a week,'' almost double the usual demand.
</P>
<P>
   Also feeling the heat are independent pharmacies that pay high
wages for relief staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pay the market price, and it's going to go way up
from here,'' said Norvell Moss, the only pharmacist in charge at
Grapevine Drug Mart. ``When I owned a chain 10 years ago, we were
paying maybe $20 an hour. By next year, it'll be $50 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers, however, likely are not seeing major effects
such as longer lines at pharmacies or reduced store hours, industry
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, Dodson and others said they attribute the shortage to a
variety of factors.
</P>
<P>
   The aging of baby boomers and the trend in managed care toward
outpatient services have led to a projected 44 percent increase in
the demand for prescriptions _ 4 billion per year by 2005 _ and
that doesn't include hospitals and nursing homes, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advancements and changes in health-care delivery,
such as the advent of mail-order pharmacies, have opened many
opportunities, Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most significant reasons for the shortage are
increased standards for pharmacy degrees, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in medical science require pharmacists to be more
accountable for the way certain patients respond to newer and more
complex drug therapies. In response, the American Council on
Pharmaceutical Education announced in the early 1990s that it would
only accredit programs that grant six-year doctor of pharmacy
degrees, increasing the former bachelor of science programs by two
years in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The four pharmacology schools in Texas expect to graduate 350 to
400 students next year, not even close to meeting the need, Dodson
said.

 &HT;    Good relations `validate' Alzheimer's patients' lives
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Where are we going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have money?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are we going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going shopping?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have money ... ?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the least of what Alzheimer's disease caregivers have to
put up with all day and into the night: a beloved spouse, a
brilliant man or woman, sinking into quicksands of forgetfulness,
childishness and the queer, irrational dread of shadows at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Four million Americans have the affliction, which occurs when a
subtle protein process breaks down in the body and little
snowflakes of damaging plaque are deposited within the skull. Rita
Hayworth, Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill and the brilliant
19th-century British general Sir Garnet Wolseley, the man who
inspired Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta line, ``I am the very
model of a modern major general!'' _ Alzheimer's touched them all.
</P>
<P>
   As baby boomers approach the end of their lives, they will lapse
into it, by forgetful millions. About 3 percent to 4 percent of the
American population is genetically susceptible to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Ignored, dismissed, categorized as ``senile dementia'' a decade
ago, Alzheimer's is pushing its way into the national consciousness
as more and more people learn about the disease the hard way:
seeing it in their own family. For many, Alzheimer's is the price
you pay for longevity.
</P>
<P>
   New techniques of treatment _ as simple as having the patient
wear a bracelet with identifying information on it, as subtle as
taking a more patient, forgiving approach to coping with
Alzheimer's _ are being put into practice for approximately 45
patients who spend their days at the Alzheimer's Association Center
in Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For their spouses and children, the center is a godsend. While
the afflicted family member is looked after kindly, stimulated,
encouraged to participate in gentle exercises and discussion
groups, the responsible adult gets a welcome break from the
constant, querulous round of questions, the sudden bowel movements,
the ever-present worry that the patient will simply wander off
somewhere, never to be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Hallucinations at sundown
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Florence are watching how-to videos up at the
Alzheimer's Association office this morning. They each have
afflicted spouses. Tom has been married 49 years, Florence 63
years.
</P>
<P>
   Florence weeps when the woman in the video _ a real Alzheimer's
spouse _ says of her afflicted husband: ``He's there. In the
morning, he could roll over and I could get a really noisy kiss on
the cheek. He's a loving husband. He makes me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom, a tall, dignified, white-haired man with broad shoulders,
is more matter-of-fact. He wants solutions, even though he suspects
there aren't any.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning, she's so bright and cheerful. But in the
evening, she's different. She sees men in the room. She wants to
know who I have out in the living room,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sundowning,'' says Mary Ann Theurer, a registered
nurse who directs patient, family and education services at the
association. ``Hallucinations are very real to an Alzheimer's
patient. They may see people sitting on the television set, walking
on the dresser, going up the wall or the closet doors. One solution
is to abolish shadows by increasing the lighting in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real important to get them to bed early and let them
sleep through the night. Also, put things away that are
nonfunctional, that are just pretty, things that cast shadows at
night. Shadowing disturbs. We're not sure what causes it, but it's
a very well-known condition. Limit afternoon napping. You want her
to be in bed and asleep by 9 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom: ``She hallucinates. She sees things I don't see. I accept
it, but I don't want to feed into it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must continue to have good relations with the loved one.
That's called validation,'' Theurer says. ``I don't know if you've
experienced this, but it is also not uncommon for a patient to
suddenly see their partner as an old person. I had a case in New
York where the man suddenly began thinking his wife was his mother.
And whenever she would protest that she was not his mother, but his
wife, he'd answer: `You can't be my wife. You're too old. I've got
to get back to my wife.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So she would answer him: `Let's have dinner, then you can go
see your wife.' And, of course, by the end of dinner he had
forgotten all about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence chips in: ``He thinks there are two of me. I keep
telling him one is enough! He doesn't like to take his medication.
He's losing things and that's a shame, because he was so careful
with things for years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm,'' Theurer nods, understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates pills,'' Florence continues. ``What do I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Use applesauce, use puddings. Crush up the pills _ you can buy
a pill crusher for about $7 _ and put them in the applesauce,''
Theurer advises.
</P>
<P>
   Tom: ``She spends hours with letters. The money situation is
bad. I don't know. I did take it upon myself to have her Social
Security check deposited in her own personal account. Also, she was
keeping $200 in $20 bills rolled up in her purse and taking it out
and counting it all the time. So I substituted $1 bills, and she
doesn't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``She eats very little. All she eats is buttered toast. That's
what she likes. I get her these little chicken potpies and she'll
eat half of one. She also likes Eggos. But I have to call her two
or three times to come and eat.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head: ``She's so plausible and so sane sometimes.
Sometimes she will be laughing and enjoying life so much. Then this
morning she went into a huff. So I took her to the hairdresser and
that seemed to please her. She loves to hear me play the piano.
Yesterday I played for her three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   New approach: Forgiving
</P>
<P>
   What emerges from these videos and from a visit to the Boynton
Beach center is a new, more forgiving approach to Alzheimer's.
Practicality is mixed with love and forgiveness. ``Keep a sense of
humor,'' caregivers are told. ``Manage, do not try to change,
behavior.'' When Alzheimer's patients grow angry and abusive, the
cause is often that the task posed, no matter how simple it may
seem to you, is too much for them. They feel frustrated. The
solution: Break down the task into easy stages.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $42 a day to send someone to this adult day care
center. Subsidies are available from Veterans' Affairs, Medicaid
and a Florida program known as ADI, the Alzheimer's Disease
Initiative. But a good many of the people here need no financial
assistance. They led brilliant, successful lives, amassed means and
money. They can pay their own way.
</P>
<P>
   And in a way, that makes their decline all the more poignant.
Brains that once lectured students authoritatively, or struck bold
deals on the stock market, or mastered pediatrics and helped
hundreds of children _ those same brains have now collapsed
inwardly upon themselves, and all the fine-webbed harmony of
thought and recollection has begun to sag and give way to a twilit,
minute-by-minute amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   Now the patients, some as young as 60, sit in two circles,
roughly classified into semi-capable and incapable, playing ball,
playing miniature golf, singing tried-and-true songs like:
</P>
<P>
   Let me call you sweetheart,
</P>
<P>
   I'm in love with you;
</P>
<P>
   Let me hear you whisper,
</P>
<P>
   That you love me too. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortis ut Mors Dilectio'' was a common epitaph on tombs in the
19th century: ``Love, Strong as Death.'' What emerges from a visit
to the center, from the reactions of caregivers like Tom and
Florence, is a two-sided view of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the disease spells the death of the mind, its
strength, its wisdom, its knowledge, its former brilliant capacity.
On the other, this self-same failure elicits extraordinary, heroic
displays of love and devotion on the part of spouses, families and
the caregivers at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about dollars,'' says Denise Parsons, the center's
assistant director. ``This is about love.''
</P>
<P>
   `Clinton really sets them off'
</P>
<P>
   What strikes you, looking at the patients, is how well-dressed
most of them are and how handsome they still look. There are faces
that grow more beautiful and defined with age; sometimes a few
wrinkles can ennoble a brow, define a countenance, make it more
beautiful and reverend. These people's wits may have wandered off,
but their outward facades are still intact and undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their minds are overthrown, and they will never improve
or recover. Alzheimer's is a one-way street. All the center can do
is keep stimulating the flagging intellect, keep revving up a
failing engine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes little miracles occur, and odd stimuli can excite
wonderfully. In the run-up to Hurricane Floyd, the patients here
became extraordinarily excited and communicative. The specter of
screaming winds excited them, wakened them from dreamy stillness.
Pacers paced more, others kept up with the minute-by-minute weather
bulletins alertly.
</P>
<P>
   Another galvanizing force is President Clinton, Parsons says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever our current-events discussion turns to President
Clinton, they all spark up somehow. He really sets them off.
Whatever you think about President Clinton, he certainly awakens
strong opinions.'' So it isn't just Rush Limbaugh: One of the minor
monuments to Bill Clinton's presidency may be that he was so
brilliant and controversial he pierced even the veil of Alzheimer's
disease.

 &HT;    KEY ISSUES RAISED OVER GOVERNING CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Computer scientists, academic experts and digital
entrepreneurs Friday explored the thorny technical and policy
issues surrounding the system that enables users to be seen and
heard on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day forum, sponsored by Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, came at a time when business and government
have come to a crossroads over the need to manage more than 35
million numerical Internet addresses in the United States and
another 15 million around the world. Many of these address are
linked to heavily promoted and increasingly valuable mnemonic names
_ the so-called ``dot-com'' universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last year in which the majority of newly formed
Web sites will be in English,'' said Jean Camp, the group's New
England regional director and an assistant professor at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Camp noted that the Internet's explosive growth had caused its
administrative structure to move from ``a self-organized
meritocracy'' to one ``that involves powerful interests that have
put lots of money on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anyone can screw it up, but by only so much,'' she
noted, speaking of the Internet's inherently decentralized
structure.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to maintain order, foster growth and, hopefully, retain
a some measure of democracy in cyberspace, the Clinton
administration last November put its weight behind a new non-profit
worldwide private body which is charged with creating competition
in registering Internet addresses in the top-level domains of .com,
.net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   That new administrative unit is known as ICANN, for the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. While the organizers of
the forum have yet to take a policy position on ICANN, some
participants clearly fear that its current structure and
orientation favors big business and government interests at the
expense of nonprofit groups and free-speech advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perceived lack of due process and a lack of
consensus,'' said
</P>
<P>
   Hans Klein, who said he personally remains neutral on ICANN.
Klein chairs the sponsoring computer professionals watchdog group
while also serving as an assistant professor in the School of
Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Added Klein: ``We've gone from a situation where practically no
one understood these issues or cared about them to one where the
stakes have become very high.''
</P>
<P>
   One of ICANN's first self-assigned tasks is to break the
government-sanctioned monopoly that Network Solutions Inc., a
private Virginia-based company, has held on top-level Internet
domain name registrations since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to break a nearly year-long stalemate, the U.S. Commerce
Department has set a target date of Sept. 30 to open the Virginia
company's domain name registration business to full competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the consent of the governed in managing the
Internet?'' Camp asked. ``ICANN will supposedly decide how the
decisions of who determines the rules will be made. Will that lead
to a domain name server Bill of Rights? And, if so, for whom? Will
it protect property owners or end users?''

 &HT;    Drug to treat Alzheimer's may hit market by 2004
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Groundbreaking research into the
chemical breakdowns that cause Alzheimer's disease promises
dramatic new remedies that will slow, stall or even ward off the
disorder within the next decade or so, a researcher at the Mayo
Clinic in Jacksonville predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work over the past 10 years has shown that all forms of
Alzheimer's disease are accompanied by an increase in the amyloid
beta protein. That seems to be the key,'' said Dr. Steven Younkin,
who heads a nine-member team at Mayo specializing in Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us, all normal people, secrete this amyloid beta
protein. It floats around in our blood and cerebral spinal fluid
all the time. But what happens with people who have a genetic
predisposition for Alzheimer's is that the concentrations of the AB
protein get larger and larger, and finally precipitate out of
solution and deposit themselves on the brain, causing lesions that
provoke the symptoms of Alzheimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesions are called ``senile plaque'' and ``neurofibrillatory
tangles.'' They corrode the electrical connections within the
brain, causing memory loss and other common symptoms of
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The solution _ easier said than done _ is to reduce the levels
of the AB protein within the brain. Yet the Mayo group may be close
to doing just that. A chemical formula for a drug that would
curtail excessive levels of AB proteins in the bloodstream is
already in preliminary trials at a pharmaceutical company, Younkin
said, without naming the company.
</P>
<P>
   He's merely being prudent. Younkin doesn't want to present the
trial drug as a magic elixir. In any case, the doctor said, the
chances of its actually reversing the disease in those who've
already contracted it is ``very remote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the trials are completed successfully, it would still
be five to 10 years before any drug would be on the market,''
Younkin cautioned. ``I don't rule out the possibility of getting it
to certain patients sooner, for test purposes, but at this point
we're several years away from any drug that would combat
Alzheimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the clock is ticking, and Younkin knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something about this disease. Four million
people have it in the U.S., and when you get to be 85 your chances
of getting it are something like 50 percent. We've got to get a
handle on this thing, and fortunately we've got some very good
promising avenues of approach.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224. PLEASE
NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 93-5, a $289 billion spending
bill to fund the Department of Defense. The bill provides for a
military pay raise, increased funding for defense readiness and
money for a new agency to oversee nuclear weapons programs.
Supporters said the new agency would more adequately protect U.S.
security information. Opponents said nuclear weapons laboratories
need more security, not new autonomy. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OIL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 51-47, an amendment to the
Interior Department spending bill that would prevent the Clinton
administration from using market prices in establishing royalties
for oil drilled on public land. Supporters of the amendment said
the administration should not require oil companies to pay
market-based royalties because it would only end up hurting the
consumer. Opponents said the administration should be able to
charge oil companies more money because they are now paying much
less than they owe. A ``yes'' vote favors blocking the
administration's ability to increase royalties.

   The House on Wednesday approved, 285-140, a bill that would
dismantle scheduled reforms of the federal milk pricing system. The
bill would replace the Clinton administration's plan to make the
system more market-oriented with an alternative that is closer to
the existing system. Supporters said the proposed reforms would
only help dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest and could cause
farmers elsewhere to go out of business. Opponents said the current
system needs to be revamped because it is fundamentally unfair to
dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

BRINGING THE PARTY TO SOTHEBY'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 26) 
(jt) 
 By ELIZABETH HAYT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was nearly 11 p.m., and Tiffany Dubin was seated
at a vanity table on a hot-pink velvet chair in the dressing room
of her Upper East Side apartment, wearing a baby-doll nightgown.
Her day had begun with meetings at Sotheby's, where she is the head
of the fashion department, continued with an afternoon trip to
Chinatown to buy bar stools and after a quick change into a 1960s
Norman Norell dress, wound down at a business dinner at Fressen in
the meatpacking district.
</P>
<P>
   But even though her makeup had long since worn off and the flip
of her brunette bob had gone limp, Ms. Dubin seemed to be getting
her second wind. ``I'm a workaholic,'' she said perkily. ``I have
to hide it from my husband. It's a problem. I'll put him to sleep
at 11:30 and then go on the Internet to buy plexiglass display
cases for my sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sale'' is ``Cocktails,'' the latest in a series of themed
auctions of vintage clothing and kitsch accessories that have
challenged the stodgy, elitist world of Old Master paintings and
rare coins that Sotheby's and Ms. Dubin's own upper-crust
background represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making fun of that whole world _ I'm having fun with
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it's OK to say that?'' she asked, letting out a
nervous, high-pitched laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, to be held on Thursday, Sept. 30 includes 1960s Pucci
hot pants, Hugh Hefner's silk pajamas and all kinds of lounge
accessories _ corkscrews, openers, matchbooks _ more typically
found at flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin is well aware that her esthetic, as well as her
position at Sotheby's, raises eyebrows. Because her stepfather is
A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping-mall tycoon who bought Sotheby's in
1982, took it public four years later and reigns as chairman today,
her professional qualifications are often questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her stepfather must have something to do with Tiffany getting
the job,'' said Keni Valenti, an antique clothing dealer in New
York, expressing a view shared by many. ``A lot of these kids at
Sotheby's are well-to-do children who have been handed something to
make something of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Dubin, 33, shrugs off charges of nepotism and the
spoiled-rich-girl image. As a teen-ager, she started at the bottom
at Sotheby's, filling in for receptionists. In 1984, she entered
Georgetown University (where she met her future husband, Louis
Dubin, a real estate developer), but she took seven years to
complete her bachelor's degree because she took time off for
secretarial school and a job as a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to New York, she worked at Sotheby's as a personal
shopper for major clients, handling everything from phone bidding
to jewelry repairs. In 1997, after she handled the fashion end of
the sale of the estate of Martha Phillips, the owner of Martha, the
high-end Park Avenue women's clothing store, she was allowed to
create the fashion department.
</P>
<P>
   To mount her first big sale that year _ of vintage haute couture
from France _ she relied on family connections. Ms. Dubin's mother,
Judy Taubman, is a statuesque blonde and former Miss Israel who
resembles Britt Ekland and is well known at the Paris couture
houses. Ms. Dubin called on her mother's friends, couture customers
like Sao Schlumberger, Catherine Deneuve and Empress Farah of Iran
_ to consign their one-of-a-kind dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her high-society breeding, Ms. Dubin distances herself
from her mother in terms of taste. ``My mother is a safe dresser
who wears classics and doesn't experiment,'' Ms. Dubin said. ``She
has very definite ideas about what is right and what is wrong in
terms of clothes. I'm wrong. She doesn't like trendiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin may have put herself on the map by raiding the closets
of her mother's friends, but her promotion of used (even expensive
used) clothing was a detour into flea-market chic that her mother's
set would never appreciate. Her seven fashion sales to date _ given
witty titles like ``To Have and to Hold'' (for handbags) and ``Pulp
Fashion'' (for paper products) _ have exploited the recent interest
in midcentury design, attracting a much hipper crowd than normally
found at the auction house at York Avenue and 72d Street. A Dubin
sale brings out deejays, East Village clothing vendors in vintage
Nikes, downtown designers like Pixie Yates and models like Chandra
North who, between sneaking cigarettes outside the building, mingle
with suited corporate types from Hermes and the Metropolitan
Museum's Costume Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her sales are fun, inventive and sexier than most anything
else you'll see at auction,'' said Bruce Wolmer, the editor in
chief of Art and Auction magazine. ``Her sales get a range of
people, not just the traditional collectors of vintage couture but
a whole crowd of style tribes in New York.''

</P>
<P>
   Trendiness is what Ms. Dubin is all about. She recently sold off
an apartmentful of antiques, including a 19th-century English
commode and her Piranesi prints, to redecorate with 1960s and '70s
furniture, much of it bought on Ebay. Posing for the January cover
of Town &AMP; Country magazine, she wore a $75 vintage dress. Her
mother's response, as Ms. Dubin recounted it: ``It would be so much
better if you wore simple clothes, not those silly trendy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Mrs. Taubman was traveling in England and could not be
reached for comment, but Ms. Dubin's brother, Christopher Rounick,
confirmed that his mother is not the staunchest admirer of his
sister's taste. ``My view of my mother and sister is that growing
up, my mother instilled in my sister her fashion taste, but my
sister wanted to try out different things,'' he said. ``My mother's
style is impeccable, but modern taste isn't her era, and she's not
doing anything to understand it. I don't think my mother is wild
about my sister selling vintage clothes. She doesn't really
understand the nostalgia. She's from Israel, and `vintage' is more
an American thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin said the other day: ``My mother thinks I'm crass. She
doesn't like it. I got that from my father. It's amazing how genes
split themselves up.'' Ms. Dubin's parents divorced when she was
12; her father, Herbert Rounick, died in 1991. An owner of several
clothing companies, Rounick was the son of a Lithuanian immigrant
who peddled socks on the streets of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ms. Dubin's identification with her father, others are
not so quick to see the connection. ``Tiffany is very refined and
elegant,'' said Valenti, the antique clothing dealer, who recalled
his surprise at learning she was Rounick's daughter. ``I knew her
father, and he was a short, husky guy who smoked cigars, a real
go-getter. He was in the rag business, but I guess Tiffany is now
in the rag business, too.'' Far richer rags, however.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin's 10021 ZIP code and her ties to the pashmina pack
have certainly helped advance her career. ``What Tiffany has done,
which is brilliant, is to target her circle of well-heeled Upper
East Side girls who have fairly honed fashion sensibilities and are
sophisticated shoppers,'' said Hamish Bowles, Vogue's European
editor at large and a vintage clothing collector himself. ``She has
made vintage clothes acceptable to a certain set of people who have
been squeamish about buying old clothes.'' People like Jennifer
Creel, Milly de Cabrol, Nadja Swarovski and Marina Rust.
</P>
<P>
   That set may also have deeper pockets than the ordinary couture
collector. ``Tiffany Dubin pulls in clients that bring in bigger
bucks,'' noted Valenti, who sold a Christian Dior suit at Sotheby's
for $44,000. ``She can sell a Courreges dress for $6,000 to $7,000.
Can Doyle do that?'' He was referring to William Doyle Galleries,
the only other auction house in New York with an independent
fashion department. (Christie's includes clothing in its celebrity
and entertainment sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin's auctions are more like publicity events for In Style
magazine than high-brow sales with a roomful of silent bidders. In
December 1998, for an auction of celebrity-owned designer and
vintage handbags, Kevin Krier, a fashion show producer, helped Ms.
Dubin recruit Tom Ford of Gucci as a sponsor. The auction room was
transformed, with waiters dressed in black Gucci outfits passing
trays of fruit-flavored sodas in psychedelic colors.
</P>
<P>
   E! Entertainment Television covered the event.
</P>
<P>
   Those with more conventional expectations of an auction house
say Ms. Dubin's sales lack substance. ``Sotheby's fashion
department is all about publicity, parties, presentation and
image,'' said Linda Donahue, the director of couture and textiles
at Doyle, where fashion auctions have been held since 1983. ``We're
a whole different ball game. We're about buying the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism is that Ms. Dubin's sales, despite their high
profile, do not generate much income _ grossing less than one-half
of 1 percent of Sotheby's $2 billion revenues in 1998. Wolmer of
Art and Auction estimated that individual sales have brought in
$300,000 to $400,000. ``The events are more spectacular than the
price results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Her last show, ``Pulp Fashion,'' in May, was an out-and-out
flop: about 30 percent of the items _ 1960s paper dresses and a
duct-tape copy of the Kelly bag _ went unsold.
</P>
<P>
   But Sotheby's defends Ms. Dubin, saying that she has attracted
new customers. ``So much of what the fashion department does is to
bring in new clients and collectors,'' said David Redden, an
executive vice president. ``I would guess most of her customers are
new to Sotheby's, and they're young, too. We have to keep renewing
the collectors.'' Ms. Dubin says that she has added 6,000 new
clients to Sotheby's mailing list and that about 40 percent of them
now cross over to other sales categories, like photography and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Dubin has gradually built up the prices for
vintage fashion. The items in her first show of Paris couture three
years ago brought an average of $500 each. For ``Cocktails,'' there
are many lots estimated at more than $3,000, and Ms. Dubin expects
a profit of at least $100,000. Helene Verin, a housewares and shoe
designer, sold a pair of Norma Kamali sneakers for $1,100 at a
Dubin sale last year. ``Nobody else can get that kind of price
except her,'' said Ms. Verin, who bought the shoes in the '70s for
less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin's budget is small _ not enough to pay for her splashy
color catalogs or the sales themselves, and so she has taken the
somewhat controversial step of selling ads in the catalogs and
seeking corporate sponsors for the sales. After ``Pulp Fashion,''
she received an angry letter from a client. ``She was very
disappointed that Sotheby's was demeaning itself by relying on
advertising,'' Ms. Dubin said. ``But I said: `Great! We're another
form of retailing, so what's the difference?'''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Cocktails,'' Ms. Dubin again is pushing the boundaries of
what customers expect at Sotheby's. With the economy bubbling and
the taste for luxury sweeter than ever, the sale is a timely
acknowledgment of the role of cocktail culture in New York social
life. The sale includes a Playboy Bunny costume (estimated to sell
for $8,000 to $10,000), the first ever offered at auction, and the
proceeds for this and several other lots will benefit the Community
Research Initiative on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Christie Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy
Enterprises, was the host for a dinner to stir interest in the
auction, drawing a stylish crowd to Playboy's penthouse on Fifth
Avenue. Playmates in Bunny suits greeted guests like the junior
jet-setters Sloan Lindemann and Ghislaine Maxwell, the artists Ross
Bleckner and Tom Sachs, and Jack Kliger, the president of Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines. The entertainment featured a drag queen who
belted out a song. The decor, including a Playboy bunny ice
sculpture and fake fur runners on the tables, was pure '60s kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   The tables glowed with Lava lamps, which Barbara Cirkva, the
fashion director of Chanel in the United States, confessed she had
never seen before. But another guest recognized the lamps right
away as part and parcel of the recycled esthetic Ms. Dubin
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she has done is take the buying and selling and
collecting of vintage clothing from an obsessive, arcane club into
the wider public arena,'' said one guest, Amy Fine Collins, a
fashion writer and special correspondent for Vanity Fair. ``She has
people buying vintage clothes, boasting about wearing vintage
clothes. People used to be ashamed, or at least secretive, about
wearing these clothes. Now it's a badge of honor and chic. Tiffany
legitimated all that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A series of fast-moving fronts with limited moisture will move
across the northern tier of states during the next couple of days.
Progressively cooler air will reach the northern part of the
Rockies and Plains in the wake of these disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   The fronts will weaken as they move into the East as they
encounter strengthening high pressure off the Atlantic Seaboard.
Meanwhile, a stalled front will be the focus for showers in south
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A few light showers will accompany a dissipating cold front in
extreme northern New England. Otherwise, the Northeastern and
Middle Atlantic states will have ample sunshine. Slightly cooler
air will follow the front over the interior Northeast, but coastal
areas will have another day with afternoon temperatures several
degrees above normal.
</P>
<P>
   After a cool dawn, abundant sunshine will lead to a warm
afternoon over most of the Southeastern States. Humidity will be
comfortable in most areas. A wavering front separating the dry air
to the north from moist tropical air will support locally heavy
showers and thunderstorms over central and southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly humid air will interact with a weak high-level
disturbance to produce an expanding cluster of clouds and showers
from the western Gulf Coast to eastern Oklahoma. Farther north, a
cold front will be accompanied by a broken band of showers in the
northern Mississippi Valley. Breezy and chilly conditions with
mountain showers will occur in cooler air over the Northwestern
States. The Southwest will be warm and dry.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FOLIAGE SEASON
</P>
<P>
   The waning hours of daylight insure the arrival of the colorful
foliage season each autumn. However, weather patterns modulate the
timing and the brilliance of the crimsons and yellows of the dying
leaves. A dry summer in parts of the Northeastern States this year
has stressed trees and may lead to early arrival of vivid hues in
some areas. Now that the season has arrived, the most vivid
pigments will be revealed if dry, cool weather hastens the
hibernation of the trees. Frequent rain would defoliate trees too
soon, and dilute the delicate color from the remaining leaves.

 &HT;    Living with juvenile diabetes
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ben Newell was only 4 when he went on his first
Walk to Cure Diabetes two years ago. As he and his parents reached
their car afterward, Ben had a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is my diabetes cured now?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we told him,'' says his mother, June. ``This is
the Walk to Cure Diabetes.'' As Ben goes door-to-door rasing money
this week for this year's walk today, the disease shared by 16
million Americans remains incurable, but the prospects are looking
more hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring saw a vaccine that prevented the development of Type
I, juvenile diabetes, in mice. Summer brought news of possible
genetic manipulation that would enable people to grow the
insulin-producing cells that are missing in juvenile diabetics.
Research continues on transplanting pancreatic islet cells for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Ben, who has learned that scientists need lots and lots of
money, is racing the calendar. He was diagnosed with juvenile
diabetes at 10 months, and complications can surface as early as
five to six years later. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney
failure, adult blindness and amputations that don't result from
injuries. Diabetics are at least twice as likely as the rest of us
to have a heart attack or stroke, and their average lifespan is 15
years shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ben is a 6-year-old boy who loves playing football,
soccer and golf and is excited by Pokemon and dinosaurs. He's like
other sixth-graders, aside from the insulin shots and the finger
prickings and the tightly regulated snack regimen that sometimes
requires eating when he's not hungry or going without when he is.
</P>
<P>
   Most 6-year-olds' parents, for example, have never said, ``You
can't have any fruit now but you can have a pickle.'' Nor do they
have such a thorough knowledge of food labels. ``It sure changes
your view of a grocery store,'' Ben's mother says.
</P>
<P>
   Ben's day always begins with a blood test from a prick in his
finger. ``There's no sleeping in on the weekends,'' Newell says.
Then he gets an insulin shot as soon as the blood-sugar test
results show how much he needs. It's the shots that really hurt,
Ben says.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile diabetics produce no insulin, and Type II or
adult-onset diabetics either produce not enough or don't use it
efficiently. But diabetics lack the ability to regulate their blood
sugar in either direction, so the insulin shots for lowering sugar
levels in Type I are only part of the treatment. Frequent food is
also essential, to keep the sugar levels from going too low.
</P>
<P>
   So Ben always has breakfast, and he always has a snack at around
9:30 a.m. He needs to prick his finger again before lunch to see
whether he needs another insulin shot or a heavier meal. He's doing
that himself this year at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets frustrated now that he's older,'' Newell says. ``He
doesn't want to be the last one to eat at lunch.'' But the people
at Southdale Elementary School and the Wee Haven Children's Center
for day care are both accommodating and interested in learning more
about diabetes, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ben eats another snack at 3 p.m. at day care, then has another
blood test and shot before dinner at 6. He needs another test and
snack later in the evening, and if his blood sugar is low then, his
mom or dad tests him again at 2 a.m. Either way, they check on him
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a seizure last April at night, and he was afraid to go
to bed unless we promised to do that,'' Newell says.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure, from very low blood sugar, illustrated how complex
the chemistry of diabetes can be. That was one of the first nice
spring days, and Ben had done a lot of running around. Exercise
brings down blood sugar. ``I guess we didn't give him a big enough
snack before bed,'' Newell says.
</P>
<P>
   But another time, when Ben played with a group of friends and
his parents figured he'd need extra food, it turned out he needed
insulin instead. The excitement and stimulation had driven his
sugar up more than the activity brought it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any stress. How active you are. All that influences his
blood-sugar levels,'' Newell says.
</P>
<P>
   He's old enough now to recognize when his blood sugar is
fluctuating. ``He's really picked up on the snack part,'' Newell
says, and knows to eat his cake without frosting, say, when his
school class is having a party. On days when a field trip changes
his routine, Ben brings up his schedule so his parents can adjust
his snacking and sticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll tell us, `I'm low. I need some food,''' his mom says.
His 4-year-old sister, Danielle also has learned the words ``I'm
low'' mean ``snack time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So sometimes she'll tell us she's low,'' Newell says with a
laugh. ``That usually doesn't get her too far.''

IN THE BELLY OF THE FASHION PUBLICITY BEAST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PENELOPE GREENE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were mates on a lark: the actress, the
photographer and the stylist, giddy with car service and
invitations to a week's worth of New York fashion shows and
after-parties.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the three ex-pat Australians were rubes
_ the actress had chatted her way from Leno to Letterman, the
photographer had taken pictures for Vogues domestic and
international, and the stylist had dressed everyone from Hugh Grant
to Sigourney Weaver. ``We just thought it would be a laugh,'' said
Peta Wilson, our actress-under-glass, otherwise known as USA
television's ``Femme Nikita.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson, who has lived in Toronto and Los Angeles for the
last few years, was in town to be vetted by a co-op board; she
thought she might like to see some shows, take a fashion tour of
New York with her pals Mark Vassallo, a fashion stylist, and Tony
Notarberardino, a photographer, to shop for trends for her
character, the sartorially aggressive Nikita, a darling of cable
television _ and many television viewers' current guilty pleasure.
It seemed an innocent enough endeavor. Fashion Week, what fun!
</P>
<P>
   ``Pe-ta. Hey, Peta! Turn around! (italics)Peta, Peta, La Femme
Nikita!''(end italics) It was the first show, Versus by Donatella
Versace, and the photographers were loaded for bear and
(italics)howling.(end italics) ``Gawd, I thought, what's the
hoopla, where's the king?'' recalled Ms. Wilson, who, tanned and
husky-voiced, was cheerfully conducting a post-mortem last week in
a friend's Brooklyn loft. ``To be honest, we didn't know, we didn't
realize the whole celebrity/fashion show thing. I guess we were a
bit naive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterwards,'' she continued, her hands flying around her head
like birds, ``after the Versus show, Mark said we had to go
backstage to thank the designer _ he said it's what you do at these
things _ so we traipsed up there with all these close personal
friends of Donatella Versace, who doesn't know me from a bar of
soap, and there was Madonna with her baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson had practiced a greeting: ``Hi, Donatella, my name's
Peta, and I've enjoyed your show.''
</P>
<P>
   But the three turned tail and retreated to the car for a huddle.
``We realized,'' Ms. Wilson said, ``that we had better rethink the
whole thing. We decided after that first night we had better make
more of an effort, that I had better dress the part, if I was going
to be observed, instead of being the observer.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that Ms. Wilson, who is an amiable and agreeable
sort of person, amiably allowed herself to become the latest
Hollywood delicacy to be gobbled up by the Fashion Week publicity
monster. Yum, yum!
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a great move on her part,'' said Lizzie
Grubman, a publicity agent who is ``in the business to supply
celebrities to people,'' as Ms. Grubman herself explained it. ``How
much have we all read about her in the past week?''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Betts, the new editor of Harper's Bazaar, said: ``Everybody
says, `Oh, celebrities in the front row, that's so old, that's so
over,' but everybody looks at them and wants to know what they're
wearing. It's this fascination, and I don't see it going away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson's weeklong experience was a neat digest of life in
the belly of fashion publicity. Most celebrities are old hands at
it. Here's how it works: You are a celebrity, and you have a
relationship with a publicity agent, maybe not a direct one, but
you know each other because the agent has made it his or her
business to know you.
</P>
<P>
   That agent is then hired by a designer to place celebrities like
you at his or her show. The agent knows that you are in town for
something or other, as Ms. Wilson was, and invites you to a few
shows. You accept, and the designer is delighted and sends you his
or her clothes, a quid pro quo for attending the show, and you try
to wear some of them.
</P>
<P>
   You take the car that the designer has arranged for you, and you
ham it up for the photographers when you arrive at the show, where
the photographers are delighted to take your picture and send it
off to In Style or the local news, which is in turn delighted to
run what ends up being a free advertisement for you and the
designer.
</P>
<P>
   This is good for your next movie, as well as a terrific way to
sell clothes. It's also a terrific way to sell magazines; In
Style's circulation is currently 1.3 million, up 18 percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems obvious, it's just commerce,'' Ms. Wilson said. ``I
just hadn't thought about it much.''
</P>
<P>
   The game is bread-and-butter to publicity agents like Lizzie
Grubman, at Lizzie Grubman Public Relations, and Gregory Link, at
Stylefile. ``What's the impetus?'' Link asked. ``It's the need to
get celebrities to events to get the extra press.'' A no-brainer,
really.
</P>
<P>
   For designers, the number of celebrities required in an audience
to ``make'' the show is quite low, said Ruth Voorhies, an associate
at Kevin Krier, a company that produces fashion shows. ``Two to
three in a roomful of 100 people is considered good,'' she said.
``Tommy had 8 or more, which is quite a lot.'' Though Tommy
Hilfiger got blistering press coverage anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As restaurants keep tables open for friends of the house,
designers keep seats open until the last minute for potential
VIP's. ``It'll be 10 seats, maybe, for the Donna Karan
Collection,'' said Patti Cohen, the director of public relations at
Donna Karan. ``Because that's small, we hold it in the showroom.
For DKNY, for something in the tents, we might set aside 30 to 50
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Ms. Wilson found herself in attendance at eight
fashion shows and five or six after-parties. Vassallo, who was,
after all, the fashion professional in the group, and who viewed
Ms. Wilson as a walking resume for his talents, took the situation
in hand.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Ms. Wilson changed clothes four times. There were
Tommy Hilfiger blue jeans, courtesy of the designer, and a red tank
top for the Hilfiger show. There were Roberto Cavalli jeans and a
wrap top with a fur collar for an Hermes fragrance party. There was
a sleek leather skirt sent by Michael Kors (whose show Ms. Wilson
planned to attend but didn't) worn for a Harper's Bazaar party for
its new editor, Ms. Betts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavalli jeans reappeared for a party for Visionaire
magazine. There were costume changes in the car, at the Essex House
on Central Park South, and down at the Chelsea Hotel, where Ms.
Wilson, Vassallo and Notarberardino are working on a book of
portraits on the hotel's denizens.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many costume changes, and so many weird moments,
like when Ms. Wilson, Samuel L. Jackson and others politely headed
backstage at Madison Square Garden _ Madison Square Garden! _ after
the Tommy Hilfiger show to pay their respects to the designer, only
to find an empty room, and so many quick chats with fashion editors
whose names slid quickly from the brain that Ms. Wilson began to
feel a little sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really depressed,'' she said. ``I thought, this isn't
my world, and I don't belong, and I don't want to do this
anymore.'' Ms. Wilson's fashion debut followed a typical trajectory
from the giddy heights of those first, ardorous exchanges to the
depths of repugnance, until finally the epiphany _ at an Alexander
McQueen show.
</P>
<P>
   Only Vassallo had a ticket, so Ms. Wilson, Notarberardino and
another buddy had to sneak in, and (italics)nobody noticed.(end
italics) This was refreshing, because it showed that McQueen didn't
give a hoot for celebrities. Models flew through the air _ pop!
swoosh! _ and even Ms. Wilson felt inspired to finish the week with
a flourish: four shows and what were to have been four clothing
changes, except that the DKNY pants she hoped to wear at the DKNY
show split right up the middle. Yikes!
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson said she's been invited to Milan, Italy, by the
designers at Costume National, who provide clothes for her show.
And then, she said, lighting a cigarette and waving it
dismissively: ``That's it, I've done it. I don't ever, ever have to
see another fashion show again.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she wouldn't seem as delicious the second time around.
Fashion has an appetite for new blood. &QL;

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224. PLEASE
NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 93-5, a $289 billion spending
bill to fund the Department of Defense. The bill provides for a
military pay raise, increased funding for defense readiness and
money for a new agency to oversee nuclear weapons programs.
Supporters said the new agency would more adequately protect U.S.
security information. Opponents said nuclear weapons laboratories
need more security, not new autonomy. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OIL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 51-47, an amendment to the
Interior Department spending bill that would prevent the Clinton
administration from using market prices in establishing royalties
for oil drilled on public land. Supporters of the amendment said
the administration should not require oil companies to pay
market-based royalties because it would only end up hurting the
consumer. Opponents said the administration should be able to
charge oil companies more money because they are now paying much
less than they owe. A ``yes'' vote favors blocking the
administration's ability to increase royalties.

   HOUSE VOTES:

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DAIRY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 285-140, a bill that would
dismantle scheduled reforms of the federal milk pricing system. The
bill would replace the Clinton administration's plan to make the
system more market-oriented with an alternative that is closer to
the existing system. Supporters said the proposed reforms would
only help dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest and could cause
farmers elsewhere to go out of business. Opponents said the current
system needs to be revamped because it is fundamentally unfair to
dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 &HT;    AMERICAN GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS FACING DISDAIN, DERISION IN

<TEXT>
<P>
   COBHAM, England _ Phoebe Eubanks parks her shopping cart on the
canned vegetable aisle in this affluent village's Waitrose
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   She picks up a can of ``American-style'' sweet corn and rolls it
in her hand to study the back of the label. ``Nothing here,'' she
says. ``It doesn't say whether there is any GM in it, does it? But
then it's from America.''
</P>
<P>
   She places the can back on the shelf. ``It may not be logical,
and maybe some people would call me hysterical, but I don't want to
feed my family food that's been mucked around with,'' Eubanks says
as she rolls on down the aisle. ``They can sell it, but I won't buy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her feelings are understandable in a country where GM, or
genetically modified, food routinely is associated with
``Frankenstein,'' the quintessential parable of man's misguided
faith in science.
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings are becoming a real-life horror story for U.S.
trade and agriculture. If European consumers such as Eubanks can't
be convinced to buy genetically engineered food, then U.S. farmers
will have no market here.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Eizenstat, the future deputy treasury secretary,
recognized this grim reality when he told Congress a few weeks ago
that the GM issue is ``the single greatest trade threat that we
face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 100 percent of our agricultural exports in the next
five years will be genetically modified or combined with bulk
commodities that are genetically modified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Europe bans GM products, it bans U.S. farm
products.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the GM debate has been escalating into a nasty
dispute between the United States and Europe. Responding to
consumer sentiment, European officials have been anything but eager
to open the continent to either GM crops or products. Last summer,
European environment ministers imposed what amounts to a moratorium
on GM products, making an already messy struggle between the United
States and Europe over food policy even messier.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy also is making life complicated for Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who has been in favor of GM testing at the
expense of his dwindling support among his Labor Party greens. The
GM issue threatens to overshadow the party's annual conference,
which opens Monday(9/27) in the seaside resort of Bournemouth.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's government, which has been sharply criticized for its
position, six weeks ago formed a multi-agency emergency group to
deal with the public animus. Thus far, its success is hard to
measure.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey shows that GM food has become Britain's No. 1 food
safety issue, with 50 percent of the public rating it their most
pressing concern.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, as the British press savaged the GM
industry, public opposition has steadily risen, according to the
research firm Mintel. Now nearly a fifth of the 1,000 adults
surveyed said they would never knowingly eat or feed their family
anything containing GM ingredients. Women, who tend to make most
decisions here about food purchases, expressed the strongest
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to show solidarity with consumers, grocery store chains,
pubs and restaurants have reacted by jumping to proclaim themselves
``GM-free.''
</P>
<P>
   And celebrities of the stature of Prince Charles and Sir Paul
McCartney have come out against GM food.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, McCartney, the former Beatle, recalled millions of
dollars worth of frozen vegetarian dinners marketed by the company
he started with his late wife Linda after traces of GM food were
discovered in the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is enough evidence about the problems
which might arise through GM food,'' McCartney said at a news
conference. ``I don't think people are worrying unnecessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, consumers probably couldn't buy GM foods in Britain
if they wanted them. No GM crops are being commercially grown in
Britain, and a fury of opposition has driven the products from
market shelves. Moreover, the only two GM products legal for sale
in Britain are corn and soybean products, a far cry from the 50 or
so available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even the idea of testing GM crops has been unwelcome. In recent
weeks, eco-warriors have been descending upon farms in the
hinterlands, defiantly yanking up test crops of GM corn.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials now want testing to be done clandestinely to
avoid such sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sober reassurances of government officials and
scientists, the public's distaste for GM products has only
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Many people _ particularly Americans _ have a hard time
understanding the vehemence of the European response. Certainly
nobody has been more surprised than Monsanto, the American
life-sciences company that owns patents on several GM crops.
Monsanto has been demonized in the British press as the evil force
behind the GM invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction here to the technology has been in stark contrast
to the mild reaction in the United States, the largest producer of
GM foods. In 1998, 40 percent of America's corn crop and 45 percent
of its soybeans were genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, with its long accepted federal
monitoring over agriculture and food safety, there is no central
food protection agency in Europe. These roles are divided between
the 15 countries in the European Union and the EU bureaucracy, but
the public has shown little faith in these institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is launching a food safety agency, consolidating the
responsibilities of a half-dozen bureaucracies. However, it will be
years before it can gain credibility. Also, its power is limited by
the EU's primacy in food and agriculture, a reality that provides
suspicious Britons little comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in Britain is generally thought to be rooted in the
country's experience in 1996 with ``mad cow disease,'' when it was
discovered that British cattle had developed a brain-killing
ailment. Despite government denials and reassurances, the disease,
known as BSE, was determined to pose a direct threat to humans.
This led to a costly ban on British beef and the slaughter of
thousands of animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, the hysteria in Britain was partly fueled by our
whole experience with . . . mad cow disease,'' David Cove, a
professor of genetics at the University of Leeds, said in a recent
interview. ``Although this has absolutely nothing to do with
genetic engineering, the public doesn't really realize that, and
they see it as the application of technology without first
assessing the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to GM food rest their objections on three main claims.
The first is that genetic manipulation is unnatural and therefore
evil. They argue that the food it produces is dangerous, and the
technology is bad for the environment because of the potential for
unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates note that no crops are truly natural because farmers
have been tampering with genetic makeup for thousands of years.
Also, no scientifically reputable test has shown GM foods to have
any ill effects on humans.
</P>
<P>
   The third objection is thornier because less is known about the
consequences of what happens when genetically modified plants mix
in the natural environment. Will they also change the plants around
them, leading to super chemical resistant weeds or some other
unintended and perhaps toxic by-product? No one seems to know for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   As these issues have been debated on this side of the Atlantic,
Washington has begun to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department recently announced its first
long-term study of GM foods and the environment. There also is
fresh talk in the United States of labeling GM foods, already a
requirement in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman acknowledged recently
that there may be no option: ''With all that biotechnology has to
offer, it is nothing if it's not accepted by consumers.''

NEW YORK HAILS NOT-QUITE ROYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 26) 
(jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER MASON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eagerly awaiting the arrival of Camilla Parker Bowles, guests at
a Manhattan cocktail party on Wednesday night were curious to
determine the reason for the alarming 30-minute delay of the prince
of Wales' longtime paramour.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that she was stranded in traffic caused by the motorcade
of Hillary Rodham Clinton _ another famous 50-something consort
visiting New York City, ostensibly to forge a new identity for
herself _ proved inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that,'' said Peter Brown, a British expatriate who
helped to mastermind Mrs. Parker Bowles' four-day sojourn, which
included a visit to friends in East Hampton, a trip to see
``Cabaret,'' a lunch with Brooke Astor and a walk through SoHo
galleries. ``There was a call from a certain gentleman in London,''
Brown added wryly, ``so of course she was late.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a partner in a London-based public relations firm the
prince hired to revamp his image after the death of Diana, princess
of Wales, largely orchestrated Mrs. Parker Bowles' New York visit,
including selecting the guest list for the much-publicized
Wednesday luncheon given by Mrs. Astor, which included Oscar de la
Renta, Michael R. Bloomberg and Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Success in conquering New York by charm has long been regarded
as a crucible for establishing the popularity of England's royals
in their native land. In her curious and still evolving role as the
mistress _ if not queen _ of the future king, Mrs. Parker Bowles
must inevitably feel daunted by the example of Diana, who dazzled
Americans from her first official solo trip to New York in 1989
until her last visit in June 1997, just weeks before her death.
</P>
<P>
   All this year the prince, with the advice of public relations
experts, has eased Mrs. Parker Bowles into the spotlight. In
January he allowed himself to be photographed with her for the
first time. She regularly visits with Diana's sons, Prince William
and Prince Harry. And this week there was the New York visit _
purported to be a private visit, but remarkably reminiscent of a
royal tour. It was occasionally a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to meet Camilla, but I only caught a
glimpse,'' said Dominick Dunne, the writer, who left Wednesday's
cocktail party to attend another party. ``If it had been Princess
Diana I might have stood in line for an hour,'' he added. ``Because
no matter how crazy she was, she was a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana may have been more glamorous and vivacious a presence, but
many New York swells attending the Wednesday party _ promoting a
new line of fabrics by Robert Kime, the prince of Wales' good
friend and decorator, at the Third Avenue showroom of John
Rosselli, an antiques dealer, seemed perfectly enchanted to
converse with the woman whom the late princess famously derided as
``the Rottweiler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She and I chatted for 10 minutes _ much to the chagrin of
several ladies,'' Kenneth J. Lane, the jeweler, noted gleefully.
``Camilla's a very nice, normal, attractive English woman,'' Lane
added. ``She smiles, giggles, laughs _ all the things we like.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker Bowles seemed equally popular with other New Yorkers
on hand, including Susan Gutfreund and Audrey Gruss, and the
decorators Albert Hadley, Mica Ertegun and Mario Buatta, who was
flattered that Mrs. Parker Bowles remembered him from her stint as
a receptionist at the London decorating firm of Colefax &AMP; Fowler
before her marriage to Andrew Parker Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `You look familiar _ why do I know you?''' Buatta
recalled. ``I reminded her, and she said, `My god! That was back in
the 70's!' She couldn't have been more fun or gracious.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Kennedy airport by Concorde last Sunday, Mrs. Parker
Bowles was accompanied by Mark Bolland, the prince's deputy private
secretary for communications, who has been identified in the
British press as the spin doctor in charge of Mrs. Parker Bowles'
image.
</P>
<P>
   His stateside counterpart for the visit, Brown, is an impeccably
connected public relations expert, whose clients include Sir Andrew
Lloyd-Webber and the BBC. A naturalized American from Liverpool,
Brown is also a close friend and frequent New York host of the
prince's youngest brother, Edward, now the Earl of Wessex. Although
Brown acknowledged that he had played a role in Mrs. Parker Bowles'
visit, he insisted that his involvement was not professional, but
personal as a friend of hers and Prince Charles'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it as a friend,'' he said. ``I got involved because I
know them very well and they asked me to help. Camilla hadn't been
here for many years and she thought she'd like to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain amount of concern about how easily it
could be achieved, and I said, `New York's a wonderful place,''' he
went on. ```People are very open minded and hospitable.' The real
point was that it could be done easily and without a fuss, and she
clearly had a relaxed, wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who met with Mrs. Parker Bowles on her whirlwind visit
seemed equally keen to stress their personal, not professional,
links. Asked if she had requested an interview with the famous
visitor when they lunched at Mrs. Astor's, Barbara Walters replied:
``No. Mrs. Astor asked Camilla if she was going to write a book,
but I don't think she's going to. It was a strictly social lunch.''
Ms. Walters added: ``I've never asked her for an interview. I try
very hard not to mix social with business.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta, who sat next to Mrs. Parker Bowles at lunch, was
clearly amused by press reports that he is giving her a fashion
make over. ``I wish I could tell you I was designing 100 dresses
for her, but sadly it's not true,'' he said. ``I find her
absolutely charming, but we never talked about clothes. She's very
natural, with wonderful manners. She told me she hasn't been to New
York in 25 years, and I told her she should come back.''
</P>
<P>
   With new friends like these, she probably will.

WITH KENTUCKY LOOMING, FLORIDA COACH CAN'T RELAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBBIE ANDREU   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ During the season, coaches rarely relax or
take time to reflect on accomplishments. They're always looking
ahead, planning for the next challenge, worrying about the next
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   After a big victory over an archrival, though, an unwritten rule
among college coaches is that Saturday nights are all right for
reveling. But Florida defensive coordinator Jon Hoke didn't have an
opportunity to do that after Florida's huge win _ and tremendous
defensive performance _ over second-ranked Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended at 12:06 a.m. last Sunday. A few hours later,
Hoke's mind was already on coming up with a game plan for Saturday
to stop Kentucky's complex offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun. It was a big win,'' Hoke said. ``I don't know if
it ever impacts you the way you think it will. You move right away
to the next game. Now, we need to worry about this one.''
</P>
<P>
   From a defensive perspective, there is much to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Wildcats move the football through the air and
score points. It doesn't seem to matter who they're playing. They
put 35 points on the scoreboard against UF last season, and five
players on that defense are now in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, quarterback Tim Couch also is in the NFL. But his
departure does not appear to have substantially diminished the UK
offense. Through three games, the Wildcats are averaging 473.7
yards _ including 363 through the air _ and 39 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Dusty Bonner has moved in at quarterback _ and moved
the offense, just like Couch. ``Dusty has done about as good as
anybody could have done following Couch,'' UK coach Hal Mumme said.
``The best thing about him is his demeanor and attitude. He's
really a leader. For a sophomore, we're real proud of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of done what we expect of our quarterback in this
offense. We're happy he's playing as well as he has, but we
expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's offense is not remotely similar to Tennessee's. The
Vols were a big, strong running team that challenged the Gators up
front. UK has a finesse offense that will put a great deal of
stress on the outside linebackers and secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, it's mostly mental,'' UF strong safety Marquand
Manuel said. ``They're going to do a lot of funny stuff. It's going
to be a mental game. You've got to know their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   UT's offense was basic; UK's is complicated and features myriad
formations. It is predicated on the short passing game _ quick
passes and screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard offense to defend,'' Hoke said. ``You've got to be
right all the time. They do so many things, and they do it out of
so many different formations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure you're lined up right and the kids
understand what they're going to see and how they're going to
defense it. We're going to have our hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   UF's secondary, which gave up more than 300 yards in each of the
first two games, will face its most severe test of the season.
Cornerbacks Robert Cromartie and Bennie Alexander and free safety
Lester Norwood played well last week and gained confidence, but
this should be a much tougher challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge because of what Kentucky does offensively,''
Hoke said. ``They know they have to stay focused and play well
because they know what that offense can do. Kentucky is tough to
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll throw the ball three yards on those quick screens, and
those are like their running plays. Our players know what kind of
challenge this is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida leads the SEC in sacks with 16. The Gators sacked UT
quarterback Tee Martin seven times last week. Although Bonner has
been sacked 13 times this season, he is a good scrambler who has
made some big plays avoiding the rush and finding open receivers
downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a ton of big plays when he's running around,'' Hoke
said. ``Sometimes he's more dangerous when he's scrambling than
when he's in the pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a different offense _ far different from the one UF faced a
week ago. But the Gators' approach won't change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stay focused on what we're doing and play hard,''
linebacker Keith Kelsey said. ``It's another great test, and it's
going to take another great team effort.''`

PRINTMASTER PLATINUM, PREMIER AND GOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   PrintMaster is a do-it-all printing program that's been around
since the days when computer programs were sold on 5 1/4-inch
floppy disks. That was a while back. In PrintMaster time, it was
many versions ago.
</P>
<P>
   PrintMaster Platinum Version 8.0 is long removed from those
floppy disks, too. It takes 11 CD-ROMs to hold the program and its
overwhelming collection of fonts, graphics and photo-editing
utilities. If those old floppy disks were still in use, it would
literally take tens of thousands of them to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the 11 CD-ROMs could simply be contained on one DVD, which
Broderbund is also offering (Windows; about $50 to $60).
</P>
<P>
   More than a million copies of PrintMaster were sold over the
past year, a company spokeswoman said. The program is available in
three grades. Each grade (Platinum, Premier and Gold) offers the
same features, the difference being the number of project styles
included in each set. Platinum, for instance, offers 303 varieties
of banners and 233 letterheads; Premier, 273 banners and 206
letterheads; Gold, 256 banners and 169 letterheads.
</P>
<P>
   All three grades offer 15 new features. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Homework Helpers: Children can make timelines showing the life
cycle of a volcano or the evolution of dinosaurs. Timelines can be
customized, too, for individual school projects. Other homework
helpers include dioramas, educational games and models.
</P>
<P>
   _ Puppets, four of them, have been added to a ``fun for kids''
section, which also includes masks, mobiles, stickers and
bookmarks.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kitchen Crafts section now offers accordion folders,
bottle labels, stencils and switchplate covers.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are 50 animated 3-D greetings that can be mailed to
anyone with an e-mail address and a Windows operating system.

TOGETHERNESS IN SOLITUDE: A FERTILE CHEMISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETERBOROUGH, N.H. _ Eric Moe, in T-shirt, baggy pants and
running shoes, stood before the baby grand piano in the MacDowell
Colony's well-worn library, ready to play his work-in-progress,
``Dance of the Honey Monkey.'' But first he wanted insight from the
audience, two dozen or so writers, poets and visual artists who
were also in residence at the famed colony here in the pine groves
of southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it too long, or not long enough?'' he asked. ``Does the
ending work?''
</P>
<P>
   He ran through the jazzy, five-minute piece, and followed it,
after short introductions, with two recordings and a final stint at
the piano for a piece he wrote in 1991. When he had finished, a few
people approached him.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity, in popular conception, is a solitary act. And at
colonies like MacDowell, where a studio, a bed and meals are
provided, no visitors are allowed and life's distractions
disappear, the notes, words, brush strokes and ideas do seem to
flow more freely. Productivity surges.
</P>
<P>
   But serene solitude is not the only raison d'etre for these
retreats. If you cocoon artists from several disciplines in
pleasant surroundings for several weeks, the theory goes, they
will, through outright solicitations like Moe's or casual
discussions at communal dinners, cross-fertilize one another's
work. Some will try something new, some will change what they are
doing and some will collaborate on works that would otherwise never
have happened.
</P>
<P>
   The idea takes some artists aback. ``I'm sure some people are
not serious, but most come for the total quiet,'' said Hans Koning,
a novelist. ``It's pleasant at dinner to talk, but I don't think
it's essential. There's very little contact, actually, among
artists. It's dangerous. Think what would have happened to Van Gogh
if he had listened to people. You're really headed for middlebrow
kitsch.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to judge by more than two dozen interviews with current and
past colonists, and several experts, most believe that interaction
often influences what they create.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solitude and the ability to work in a supportive
environment is primary,'' said Moe, a music professor at the
University of Pittsburgh who goes to colonies every summer. ``But
an important secondary benefit is being in the company of other
artists _ for feedback on my work, for collaborations that happen
and for feeling part of a larger community of artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Moe reels off plenty of evidence. At the library, two writers
and a visual artist told him that the ending of ``Honey Monkey''
was a surprise, that they expected and wanted a longer piece. And
now? ``I have a few possibilities,'' he said. ``Leave it as it is,
add another piece with a resolution or revise it so it's a little
more satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   He has listened to such feedback before. On the 1991 piece he
played, he said, he ``substantially rewrote the ending based on
comments I received here.'' Moe said that he had collaborated with
artists he met at colonies, including Abigail Child, a filmmaker
with whom he made three videos, and that he had been inspired to
write ``Siren Songs'' after Paula McLain showed him a draft of her
poem ``Beauty That Lying Bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold the QED, however. ``No one has done research on this,''
said Howard E. Gardner, the Harvard professor who has written
extensively about creativity. ``There's no control group, so you
can't prove it.'' Gardner, who has had residencies at two colonies,
agrees that interaction among colonists often influences their
creativity, but adds, ``This is wisdom rather than science.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the ages, artists have gathered in enclaves to exchange
ideas and to encourage one another. But artists of different
disciplines have met far less frequently, said Mihaly
Csikszentmihaly, the author of ``Creativity: Flow and the
Psychology of Discovery and Invention'' (HarperCollins).
</P>
<P>
   That is where organized colonies come in, with MacDowell and
Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., being the oldest and best known of
the many that increasingly dot the United States and the world.
``To the extent that you create a chance for artists to rub
shoulders with people of other disciplines, that helps,''
Csikszentmihaly said.
</P>
<P>
   When Edward MacDowell, a composer, and his wife, Marian, created
the United States' first artists colony here in 1907, they drew
inspiration from the American Academy in Rome, which was founded in
1894 to give artists a chance to study Rome's classical traditions.
MacDowell, a trustee, sensed that discussions among the artists,
architects and composers there enriched their work.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the 58-member Alliance of Artists Communities says
there are about 80 American colonies. In 1995, about 3,600 visual
artists, writers, composers, filmmakers, performance artists,
choreographers, architects and scholars were residents at them.
</P>
<P>
   More colonies are in the offing. In the United States alone,
partly to make up for curtailment of federal grants to individual
artists, ``another 40 to 50 are seriously endeavoring to start,''
said Tricia Snell, the Alliance's executive director. Most have
wealthy patrons, though money also comes from foundations and
fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   MacDowell accepts up to 32 artists at a time, and over the years
its residents have included Willa Cather, Milton Avery, Edward
Arlington Robinson, Virgil Thomson and, more recently, Oscar
Hijuelos, Glenn Ligon and Alice Walker. Together, they have won 52
Pulitzer prizes, seven MacArthur genius awards and hundreds of Rome
Prizes, Guggenheim fellowships, National Book Awards, Academy
Awards and other trophies.
</P>
<P>
   MacDowell's annual mix of disciplines is slightly less than 50
percent writers, 25 percent visual artists, 10 percent composers,
10 percent interdisciplinary artists, 5 percent filmmakers and less
than 1 percent architects.

</P>
<P>
   In the public's mind, artists colonies are commonly viewed as
hotbeds of sex as much as hotbeds of creativity. Many artists have
indeed started romances or found marriage partners at them. In one
fruitful example, DuBose Heyward, the author of the novel
``Porgy,'' met his wife, the playwright Dorothy Kuhns Heyward at
MacDowell, and it was she who quietly wrote the first draft of the
play ``Porgy and Bess,'' after he put aside her suggestion that his
book had stage potential.
</P>
<P>
   Lifelong friendships are a matter of course among colonists,
too, frequently forging a chain of influence. The poet Stanley
Kunitz has described how several painters he met at MacDowell in
the 1950s introduced him to an artist named Elise Asher. She became
his wife and ``led to my intimate association with the master
generation of American abstract expressionist painters.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative collaborations also seem to abound. In the 1950s,
Thornton Wilder asked Louise Talma to write the opera ``Alcestiad''
with him after they had met at MacDowell; they later exchanged
hundreds of letters. More recently, ``Elegies,'' a piece written by
Richard Danielpour, the composer, and Kim Vaeth, the poet, came
together here. The two had met once, but got to know each other
here in 1989 and '90, conceiving the piece here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Danielpour returned with most of Ms. Vaeth's text; the
rest came by faxes. ``I would go to the pay phone in the evening
and we'd edit the movements down,'' he said. Finally, he said, Ms.
Vaeth joined him for a finale. While he went to have dinner and
play table tennis one evening, she worked in his studio. ``I came
back around 8 p.m.,'' he said, ``and we sat in the studio until
midnight, and she finished it that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielpour said he was getting ``addicted to this process,''
citing projects with Toni Morrison, Stephen Mitchell, Erica Jong
and Maya Angelou.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Jenkins, a video maker, credits colony life with expanding
her horizons. ``My first residency was at Yaddo, and there was
something chemical about being put in with other artists not of my
discipline,'' she said. She met a composer, Jeff Talman, who agreed
to work with her there. ``I had the idea for a soundtrack, but
didn't have the knowledge or the technology to do it completely,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That showed me what a residency can do, throwing the
unexpected into the mix,'' she said. ``I spend a lot of time alone,
and work can sometimes be in a bit of a vacuum.'' Still, she guards
against too much exposure, saying, ``You have to be careful about
how much you allow other things to influence your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Levitsky, a photographer, said that David Del Tredici, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning composer who returns regularly to Yaddo and
MacDowell, had influenced her work. Last year, she recalled: ``He
said it's OK to create beautiful, romantic, decadent work. Atonal
composers may be mad at him, but I wrote it down because it
reinforced me and gave me courage.''.
</P>
<P>
   Evening readings and performances are not required at MacDowell
or Yaddo, but they are traditional and central to the interaction.
Sometimes the feedback is affirming or helpful, but not always. Ms.
Levitsky remembered that last summer one composer did not present
his work, because of a scathing remark another had made.
</P>
<P>
   Yet creativity can be greased as much by abrasive comments as by
compliments. The question for some colonists is whether they are
hearing genuine feelings. David Means, a writer, said he would
distrust comments made at readings as ``fundamentally dishonest.''
Many artists said they relied more on one-to-one consultations with
others here.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the artists go home is also a matter of
opinion, not science. Csikszentmihaly said: ``Six to eight weeks
can have a lasting effect if you see things from a different point
of view. It can open up a whole new way of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gardner, leaving aside continued contact, is a little more
skeptical. ``It is possible for one person to say something that
will influence the work,'' he said, ``but let's just say _ I will
quote Pasteur _ `Chance favors the prepared mind.'''

PAT AND ALAN AND JOHN AND GARY AND ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on assorted candidates for president:
</P>
<P>
   PAT BUCHANAN: What is this guy _ nuts? One minute he's trying to
blackmail his fellow Republicans by threatening to bolt to the
Reform Party, and the next he's all over television futilely trying
to defend his opinion that Adolf Hitler posed no threat to the
United States back in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's anti-interventionist views regarding recent U.S.
military adventures are worthy of discussion, but his isolationist
attitudes regarding World War II are preposterous. Hitler posed a
threat to the entire world _ and someone who doesn't understand
that simply cannot be taken seriously as a potential commander in
chief of the lone remaining superpower.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN MCCAIN: You don't have to be a supporter of McCain's
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, or even agree
with his positions on the issues, to appreciate the Arizona
senator's penchant for speaking his mind. While other leading
Republicans were pleading with Buchanan to stay in the party,
McCain stepped up to the plate and invited the controversial
commentator/candidate to take a hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just reached the conclusion that anyone who repudiates
our involvement against Nazi Germany obviously does not reflect the
views of America, much less the Republican Party,'' said McCain, a
former prisoner of war in Vietnam. ``There's no place in the
Republican Party for that kind of rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else he may or may not be, McCain is no fence-sitter.
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH DOLE: Did I say something about fence-sitting? Here's
a comment about Buchanan offered by Dole on ``Good Morning
America'' and quoted by The Associated Press:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has to make up his mind whether or not he's going
to stay within the party. If he stays within the party, then the
party will determine whether or not they want him as their
nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Buchanan's views on Hitler, Dole said: ``I certainly do
not understand those comments. I was amazed by that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much, but it was better than nothing _ which is what
we heard from most of the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ALAN KEYES: Alan who, you ask? Keyes is hardly a household name,
but he has the gung-ho support of religious conservatives who love
his outspoken views on issues such as abortion and Bill Clinton's
morals _ or lack of same. Keyes is a no-chance candidate for the
presidential nomination, but give him credit: He's urging
Republicans to spurn ship-jumpers like Buchanan and ex-GOP Sen. Bob
Smith of New Hampshire and stick with the Grand Old Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time for us to abandon the decent heart of the
Republican majority,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him.
</P>
<P>
   GARY BAUER: Gary who, you ask? Bauer is another crusader of the
religious right. He came up with a new twist the other day when he
proposed to overhaul the U.S. tax code by instituting a 16 percent
flat tax. That put him in league with Buchanan and longtime
flat-tax proponent Steve Forbes _ and in conflict with Keyes, who
wants to do away with income taxes altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is going nowhere in the presidential race, but at least
he's showing some resourcefulness and creativity, which is more
than we can say for some other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   DAN QUAYLE: The longest-running one-line joke in the history of
American politics. Jay Leno will miss Danny Boy when he finally
throws in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   BILL BRADLEY: When he played basketball, the ex-senator from New
Jersey was renowned for his ability to ``move without the ball,''
which basically meant that he had a talent for eluding defenders
and setting himself up for an open shot. If Al Gore doesn't figure
out a way to block Bradley's path to the basket, Gore just might
become the first sitting vice president to be denied his party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: He's been a bit elusive in his own right. What do you
suppose the VP is up to these days?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: Still the front-runner. Still the fund-raising
champion of the world. Still the best man for the job.

TWO WOMEN HOSPITALIZED WITH BOTULISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN G. REED   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Two women who ate a home-canned dressing made
of garlic and oil are recovering from botulism, a potentially fatal
form of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The women have been partially paralyzed by the toxins produced
by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria. Sarasota County Health
Department officials would not identify them, but Barbara Franzan
contacted reporters and said her mother, Dorothy Lollis, and
grandmother, Thea Govaars, had contracted botulism.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lollis and Ms. Govaars are listed in stable condition in the
Intensive care unit at Sarasota Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Food-borne botulism is rare in the United States, largely
because of careful canning techniques that discourage the growth of
the organism, said Homer Rice of the county Health Department. But
in this case, the oil-and-garlic mixture created just the right
conditions for the deadly toxins to accumulate _ an airless
environment with low acidity.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said no others are believed to be at risk from the
dressing. The person who made and canned the dressing had stored 50
jars and planned to give them out as Christmas presents. She gave
them instead to authorities, who destroyed them, as well as a few
jars she had already distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said not all of the dressing caused illness. Some people
had eaten the garlicky mixture and apparently felt no ill effects.
``There were only a couple of the cloves that were contaminated,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The organism that leads to botulism is common and lives in soil
and on fresh foods, where it is harmless. It is hardy under certain
circumstances _ it can survive hours of boiling, for example, by
producing cells called spores.
</P>
<P>
   In improperly canned food, the dormant spores become active
bacteria after the food cools. The bacteria, which grow best in a
low-oxygen environment, proliferate in the can or jar and produce
toxins that seep into the food.
</P>
<P>
   When eaten, the toxins interfere with the body's ability to
transmit nerve impulses. That leads to gradual paralysis, often
beginning with droopiness in the eyes and blurred vision. The
paralysis moves down the body over time, and can ultimately
suffocate the patient by interfering with breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Food-borne botulism affects about 20 people in the United States
each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, about half of botulism cases resulted in death;
that proportion has dropped to about 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   If diagnosed early, botulism can be treated with an antitoxin.
But if it progresses, patients may need breathing assistance and
may remain hospitalized for months while their bodies repair
damaged nerves.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sarasota cases, which were reported to the Health
Department Sept. 9, the women ``are going to be there for a
while,'' Rice said.

GERMANY'S PROBLEM IS EUROPE'S PROBLEM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The classic ``German problem'' has been how to tether the
country's economic and military interests within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is wrestling with a different
German problem: the government is running out of money. To deal
with that, Schroeder has proposed big cuts in spending coupled with
less generous pension benefits and welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are not sitting well with the citizenry of what
has been the continent's most important, vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   How it turns out is a matter of some import to investors,
because in many respects Germany represents a test case of how
other countries in the European Union, facing the same problems,
may address the rising costs of social democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from London, Michael J. Browne, head of
European equities for Chase Global Asset Management Inc., took some
time last week to discuss the problem and the outlook for Europe.
Here are excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What are the stakes of the outcome of this budget
struggle in Germany?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The problem that Schroeder has is that if these reforms don't
go through, Germany's competitiveness comes under question, and its
social security system will come under attack. Right now, three to
three and a half people are working to pay for each pensioner. In
the next few years, that ratio will fall to two to one. It is a
problem we are seeing all over Europe, which is aging rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Germans come to grips with this, corporations are
going to move to where they are the most competitive, which will
take them out of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   That takes us to Europe's central, core issue: while governments
have created a single market, currency and interest rate, they have
lost control of macroeconomic policy. Now, spurred by a massive
program of deregulation, which still has a long way to go, Europe
is unleashing competition, and the levers to growth through that
process have been handed to private companies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What is your worst-case scenario for German
reform?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The danger scenario, one I would not subscribe to, is that
the reform process fails. The government falls, and is replaced by
a much harder left-of-center government which enacts a number of
pump-priming policies to fight unemployment. That causes the
European Central Bank to raise interest rates, slowing the growth
of all economies. If a country like Germany went on a big fiscal
push, the same thing could happen in any of the other big
countries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What do you think is more likely?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the Germans will muddle through this, leaving them
one step further down the road. At the end of the day, companies
are making their own decisions and doing what they want. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How has this de-emphasis on sovereign risk
influenced your investing approach?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For a long time now, we have not invested on a
country-by-country basis, but on a sector, stock-selection basis.
We are currently overweight in Finland and France and underweight
in Germany, but that doesn't really tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   In technology, Nokia is a terrific stock and Cap Gemini in
France is a terrific company for the development of the Internet
and E-commerce. In autos, Renault is a great story. Key stocks for
us this year include Vodafone Airtouch and BP Amoco. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)A little over a year ago people were bullish about
European stocks because pension funds and mutual funds on the
continent were relatively underinvested in equities. Has the level
of interest risen since then?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have seen a strong pickup in pension fund demand for
equities this year.
</P>
<P>
   But while pension funds have been active, mutual fund purchases
are down about 50 percent from 1998. The flows are still positive,
but because of the Russian default and the other events that rocked
the world financial system, people backed off. We are just
beginning to see some signs that memories of last fall are
beginning to fade. And the need to save more is still there. People
are worried that their state benefits are not going to be what they
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What is your outlook for Europe in the coming
year?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Barring an exogenous shock, we think 2000 will be one of the
best years for growth in Europe in the last 15 and are relatively
more positive about Europe over the next few years than we are
about the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Next year we are looking for pan-European economic growth to be
on the order of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. Over the last two
decades, the average rate of growth has been about 1.8 percent. And
we think that corporate profits, which will grow about 12 percent
to 14 percent this year, will do about the same next year. This can
be derailed by politicians and external events, but I can see the
pattern continuing into 2001.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Move over Arkansas. There's another state to
beat up on now. With Gov. George W. Bush running for president,
Texas is fast becoming a target of campaign rivals, political
columnists and stand-up comedians. They're picking on Texas' famous
egos, its pollution and its love affair with guns. One hot-selling
political button says it all: ``Read My Lips, No New Texans.'' Get

aging baby boomers, new drugs and better health care, a nationwide
shortage of pharmacists has recruiters scrambling _ and the objects
of their attention are loving every minute of it. ``I've never seen
it like this before,'' said Arlington pharmacist Maurice King, who
has been in the business 15 years and says he constantly gets calls
from employers nationwide. ``These chain stores, especially, are
just starving for people, and you can literally write your own

TOSSING RELIGION IN YOUR FACE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I am a musician, and I supplement my income by
painting and plastering apartments. Recently I took a job for three
months helping to renovate a house; it's very good money and I like
the work. But most of the other crew members are born-again
Christians, and the boss likes to leave religious literature on the
kitchen counter below a sign that says ``Christian propaganda.'' It
makes me uncomfortable _ I'm Jewish, and a lot of the material
talks about how the Jews betrayed and killed Christ. Is there some
law against having this in the workplace?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. As insensitive as this treatment may be, it doesn't sound as
if you have a legal leg to stand on in fighting it. People don't
have to hide their faith in the workplace, explained Lewis Maltby,
director of the employment rights office of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the employer has done is to put some literature on a
table, which you can read or not read as you choose, it's probably
not harassment legally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People have a right to their point of view, but it typically
becomes a legal issue only if they ``throw it in your face,''
Maltby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the co-workers were coming up to you and saying the sort of
things that are apparently in the pamphlets, that may well be
religious harassment,'' he added. ``If there was a poster on the
wall that you couldn't help but see that said those kinds of
things, that might well be harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar dividing lines apply to other forms of possible
discriminatory harassment. ``It's not sexual harassment to bring a
copy of Playboy to work,'' Maltby said. ``It is sexual harassment
to paste the centerfold to a woman's desk'' knowing that she would
be offended.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't mention whether your boss knows that you're Jewish.
If he doesn't, and this situation is bothering you, you might
consider telling him _ nicely _ that disparaging statements about
your religion make you uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more a question of inappropriateness than legality,''
said Steven Freeman, director of legal affairs for the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. There appears to be no
employment discrimination or violation of religious rights at
stake, Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   For such a short-term job, you might just want to grin and bear
it. ``I can see why it feels awkward, but I wouldn't say
anything,'' says Ronna Lichtenberg, author of ``Work Would Be Great
if It Weren't For the People'' (Hyperion, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to look at the situation, Ms. Lichtenberg
said. ``One, they don't know you're Jewish, so they have no idea
they're offending you,'' she said. In this case, you may want to
simply avoid the offending material and try to exhibit the sort of
tolerance that you'd like your employer to show. The second
possibility, she said, is that they do know your religion and
honestly believe that they're trying to help you.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a problem unless you choose to have it be a
problem,'' she added. ``A problem would be if they have the same
beliefs and greeted you in the morning with a coffee cup that said,
`You are going to hell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is not an ideal situation. But if you really like
the job _ which, as you point out, is only a three-month commitment
_ your best move may be, as one religious figure said, to just turn
the other cheek.

   INTERNATIONALMEXICO-CARDENAS _ MEXICO CITY _ He ran for the
presidency twice and lost. Many Mexicans believe at least one
election may have been stolen from him. Then, a little more than
two years ago, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas became the first democratically
elected mayor of Mexico City, a powerful position. Cardenas was
hailed as the spiritual leader of Mexico's rising center-left
movement, which has gained ground by attacking Mexico's failed
ventures in free-market reforms and the ruling party's corrupt
record. The mayor's job was viewed as a springboard to Mexico's
presidential election in July 2000. But over the last two years,
Cardenas' popularity has dropped in polls. His problem, some
analysts say, is not so much his record as mayor; it's his persona
and his inability to communicate in Mexico's newly competitive
electoral culture. Cardenas is stepping down soon and starting his
presidential campaign in earnest. But most speculation now centers
not on his chances of winning, but rather on how he feels about a
united opposition front -- from right to left -- and whether he'd
be willing to step aside for another nominee should an alliance be
formed. (FERRIS, Cox News Service).

STEWART, LOVE SEE EARLY ADVANTAGE EVAPORATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA MATSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Foursomes Match 3 
Miguel Angel Jimenez and Padraig Harrington, Europe, halve with
Davis Love and Payne Stewart, United States. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Payne Stewart's opening drive sailed clear
and straight through the morning air.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and partner Davis Love strode off the first tee at The
Country Club, purposeful and determined. Enough of this losing, the
Ryder Cup veterans said with each firm footstep planted on the
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a pair of Ryder Cup rookies in Miguel Angel Jimenez and
Padraig Harrington, Stewart and Love played with determination and
precision, their resolve to win set in their serious expressions.
</P>
<P>
   But resolve is only the half of it. The chips and putts have to
fall, too.
</P>
<P>
   Birdies at the third and fourth holes gave Stewart and Love a
2-up start, but Jimenez and Harrington scrambled back and it was
all the Americans could do to hold on for a halve in the third
match of the morning foursomes.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's birdie putt of 12 feet on No. 3 was matched by Love's
10-footer on No. 4. At the 432-yard par-4 fifth, Love hit his
approach within 12 feet and the American duo was looking at a third
birdie, while the Europeans were lining up a 24-footer from the
front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the smooth ride ended.
</P>
<P>
   After Jimenez curled his putt 4 feet past the hole, Stewart let
his putt get away, sliding 6 feet past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the chance to stick the dagger in and we didn't,''
Stewart said. ``That hurt a lot. I misread the putt and I obviously
hit it too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them back in the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington didn't take advantage when he lipped out his par
putt, but Love then missed his 6-footer and the hole was halved.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans sensed a momentum shift and they were right. On
the 310-yard sixth, Jimenez splashed out of a greenside bunker to 4
feet to set up a birdie. Stewart's sand shot left Love a 9-footer
and he couldn't convert. The US lead fell to 1 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really get off to a slow start,'' Harrington said.
``We were 2 down but we played on a level key all the way
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans' doggedness and the Americans' inability to hit it
in good positions or hole out began to show. On the par-5 ninth,
Stewart hit a delicate shot out of the bunker behind the green,
landing it 2 feet from the hole and watched, hands on hips in
disgust, as the ball kept on rolling and rolling away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both played well,'' Stewart said. ``We just put ourselves
in tough situations around the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans squared the match at the 10th, Harrington sinking
a 20-footer. On No. 12, with Harrington's drive sitting in the
middle of the fairway and Love's nestled in the left rough, US
captain Ben Crenshaw suddenly appeared next to his players.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart left the ball short of the green and Love chipped to 10
feet, from where Stewart missed. Harrington, meanwhile, nudged a
50-foot downhill putt within 6 feet and Jimenez's putt put the
Europeans 1 up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after this morning some of the new boys will be buoyed
up,'' European captain Mark James said. ``We no longer have
rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez hit his drive on No. 17 into the pines bordering the
right side of the fairway. Harrington, with branches crowding his
backswing and blocking his view, punched out 30 yards short of the
green. Jimenez's weak chip left the team with a two-putt for bogey,
while Stewart, standing awkwardly on the edge of the left bunker,
managed to pop out to 10 feet. Love missed the birdie attempt but
the team managed par to make the match square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough match,'' Jimenez said. ``Having to play 18
holes and to come back from 2 down was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Love were left with what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little bit of pressure out there that I don't
normally feel,'' said Love, ``and I kind of let it get away from
us.''

LONGVIEW ATTORNEY SWORN IN AS EAST TEXAS FEDERAL JUDGE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Longview attorney T. John Ward, a former
Houstonian and a 30-year trial lawyer, was sworn in as an East
Texas federal judge Friday in front of well-wishers, including the
liberal icon he replaces _ senior U.S. District Judge William Wayne
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, 56, partner and lead trial counsel for the Brown McCarroll
&AMP; Oaks Hartline law firm, has been partner in charge of the firm's
Longview office since 1993. His cases have involved medical
malpractice, product liability and other torts.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, 79, formerly of Tyler, left that bench in 1998 to
become a senior judge based in Austin. During his 30-year tenure,
Justice ordered dramatic improvements in the state's treatment of
the mentally retarded and juvenile and adult offenders. He also
hastened slow-moving integration of public schools and is still
hailed as champion of free speech and human and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Following Justice will be no small task, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have one aspiration _ to do justice for all those who
come before me,'' he said. ``That's a tall order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Justice was a man of great courage. He worked hard,''
Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I always remember about Judge Justice was his
demeanor _ particularly toward those younger lawyers who were
coming before him for the first time. He seemed to cut them the
appropriate amount of slack.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior judge, Justice retains oversight of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice. Earlier this year, he ruled that
because prison conditions remain unconstitutional, he should retain
that oversight, but his ruling is being challenged by the state in
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to working in Longview, Ward served the firm's Houston
office. The firm, based in Austin, also has a Dallas office.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's legal expertise is in the area of product liability,
involving tires, vehicles, asbestos, fire protection devices,
industrial equipment, helmets, firearms, ammunition and medical
products.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated for the Eastern District of Texas bench by President
Clinton in January, Ward was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July
13 after a delay blamed on partisan bickering. Sixteen other
federal court nominations were hung up with Ward's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe John Ward is going to be a common sense federal
judge,'' said U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, at a
nomination hearing in June. Supporters said Ward ``brings complete
preparation, a studied atmosphere and a balance'' to the bench,
Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., also lauded Ward, saying he
has ``over 30 years of legal experience, 20 years as a founding and
managing partner of his own law firm. He's conducted 150 full
trials in federal and state courts. He has extensive experience in
civil jury trials and also as a county prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Fannin County, Ward was graduated from the Baylor
School of Law in 1967, after he earned a bachelor's degree in
chemistry from Texas Tech University in 1964. It was in Lubbock
that he met his wife of 35 years, Cissy, and he began his legal
career as an assistant district attorney for Lubbock County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I moved to East Texas with a personal injury plaintiff's
practice, and did that for seven or eight months in Henderson. Then
I moved to Longview and got into what you'd call an insurance
defense practice,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost some big ones, and I won a few, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Longview's Maude Cobb Convention and Activity Center, Ward
was given the oath of office Friday afternoon by U.S. District
Judge W. Royal Ferguson of Midland in ceremonies presided over by
the eastern region's Chief U.S. District Judge Richard A. Schell of
Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Ward is an important addition to our court,'' Schell
said. ``His experience and reputation as a leader in the legal
community adds to the professional strength of the court,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who has a lifetime appointment, will hear civil and
criminal cases from 10 East Texas counties, primarily in the Tyler
courtroom. He also will hear cases in Marshall.

ANCHOR TEAM COMES THROUGH IN MATCH 4 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Foursomes Match 4 
Jeff Maggert and Hal Sutton, United States, def. Lee Westwood and
Darren Clarke, Europe, 3 and 2. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The United States's first point in the 33d
Ryder Cup Matches did not come from a Hollywood pairing, but from
the anchor team of Jeff Maggert and Hal Sutton, a pair of solid
straight shooters from America's heartland who fashioned a 3-and-2
victory over England's Lee Westwood and Northern Ireland's Darren
Clarke in the morning alternate-shot foursome play at The Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   As dawn broke in the first hour of competition, the United
States took early leads in its first three matches. The only team
that had trouble was the Maggert-Sutton tandem, which lost the
first and fourth holes to go 2 down.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, building an early lead is insignificant, and there was
no reason to believe otherwise Friday morning, until there was a
reversal of fortunes for all four early leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Things started off terribly for the US duo. Sutton had a 6-iron
approach shot to the first green into a blinding sunrise. He left
it right. Maggert and Sutton failed to get up-and-down, giving the
Europeans a 1-up lead with a humdrum two-putt par.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only poorly played hole for the Americans. They
didn't lose the fourth hole to go 2 down. Westwood won it with a
birdie 3 because he successfully read a difficult sidehill 15-foot
putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were watching the board a little bit,'' acknowledged
Sutton. ``We got down early, too.'' But being down gave the
Americans a sense of urgency, and they responded. ``We got fired up
and were hitting some good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   They fed off their fire during a three-hole stretch that turned
the match around. Three straight birdies erased the two-hole
deficit, giving the Americans a 1-up advantage, which they never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton nearly reached the 310-yard sixth hole with his drive and
Maggert followed with a superb chip that rolled to gimme distance.
Westwood had an 18-footer to halve the hole, but he pushed his
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert nearly aced the par-3 seventh. His 6-iron hit 3 feet in
front of the flag and rolled 12 feet beyond. Sutton knocked down
the putt to even the match. ``Jeff hit a great shot on the par 3,''
said Sutton. ``That was a critical turnaround right there.''
</P>
<P>
   The shellshocked Europeans were done on the eighth hole when
Maggert's sand wedge stopped 9 feet from the flag and his new best
friend Sutton (``Our games really match up so well together. I feel
really comfortable playing with Hal'' _ Maggert) drained another
birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't blame the Europeans if they felt snakebitten.
``They (Americans) bogeyed the first then made six birdies and all
pars. You can't do much against that,'' said Westwood. ``We made 15
pars and one birdie. We are both playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams battled evenly for the next five holes. ``I just
tried to keep the ball in play and hit solid golf shots,'' said
Maggert. ``Hal did a lot of the same and he made some nice putts to
put us up.'' The duo survived the Primrose Triangle (hole Nos.
11-13), where every other US team faltered. The American pair
essentially put away the match on the par-5 14th with a two-putt
birdie to go 2 up.
</P>
<P>
   After halving the par-4 15th, Sutton stiffed a 7-iron on the
par-3 16th hole. Westwood's tee shot was 35 feet from the flag. It
didn't matter. Maggert tapped it in for a birdie 2, winning the
first point for the Americans.

US NOT UP TO PAR IN MATCH ! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Foursomes Match 1 
Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie, Europe, def. David Duval and
Phil Mickelson, United States, 3 and 2. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ They missed putts they should have made; they
missed fairways they should have hit. And, ultimately, they lost
holes they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   Add them all up, and it was not the way Phil Mickelson and David
Duval expected to begin the 33d Ryder Cup Matches Friday at The
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Add them all up, and it was a 3-and-2 victory for the European
team of Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie in the morning's first
foursome (alternate-shot) competition.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, some credit should be given to Montgomerie and
Lawrie, who played nearly flawless golf, with no bogeys during a
round that ended on the 16th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin and Paul played awfully well,'' said Mickelson, who did
not, especially with his putter, missing three times from 8 feet or
closer. ``I thought to play a US Open golf course without a bogey
in an alternate-shot format was certainly impressive. I thought we
put ourselves in position on a number of holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they did.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson and Duval had a chance to take an early lead on the
par-3, 190-yard second hole, but a 6-foot birdie attempt by
Mickelson rolled just over the left lip.
</P>
<P>
   They did go 1 up on the sixth as Mickelson hit a brilliant
60-degree wedge out of the rough to within 6 inches of the pin for
a gimme birdie.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the high-water mark of their morning. Mickelson and
Duval bogeyed the next hole make the match even, and they never
regained the lead, as Montgomerie and Lawrie played a steadier,
more consistent game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the draw (Duval and Mickelson) _ one of America's
top groups _ we had a tough game, obviously,'' said Montgomerie,
who has been cast into the role of veteran leader of a European
team that consists of seven rookies, including Lawrie. ``But Paul
did well for his first time, and we fit well together, which is
what foursomes is all about. We were good from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans started to unravel on the 10th, a long (447 yards)
par 4.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the overall problem was Duval's errant tee shots, which
put him and Mickelson in a scrambling, rather than challenging,
mode for the rest of the day. Duval hit only two fairways.
</P>
<P>
   But on the 10th, which began with the teams all square, it was
another case of putting woes. Faced with a 4-foot comeback for a
hole-tying par, Mickelson again pushed it just a bit, as the putt
rolled over the left edge of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   On the ever-so-tough 486-yard, par-4 12th, neither side reached
the green in regulation. Duval's pitch stopped 15 feet short, and
when Mickelson's attempt at par rolled 3 feet past the Europeans
had another opportunity, which Lawrie took advantage of by rolling
in a 6-footer for par and a 2-up lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a deficit the Americans could not make up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Duval, who has known mostly
disappointment as a partner with Mickelson (the twosome was 0-2-1
in the Presidents Cup the past few years). ``The match certainly
didn't seem like it should have been a 3-and-2 match.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's what it was, as on this morning the Europeans were
steadier, better, and clearly more comfortable with not only
themselves but their games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played so well together,'' said Lawrie, who made relatively
few mistakes _ and when he did, Montgomerie came up with
hole-saving answers. ``Every time they hit a good shot, we came up
with a good save.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was more than good enough.

PARNEVIK'S STRONG SHOWING OVERWHELMS US IN MATCH 2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Foursomes Match 2 
Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik, Europe, def. Tom Lehman and
Tiger Woods, United States, 2 and 1. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The apocalyptic duel is history, and it can
now be stated without equivocation that the world's greatest golfer
is . . .
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. But the Swedish journeyman was the difference in
Friday morning's foursomes match, a 2-and-1 victory that helped the
Europeans build a 1-point Ryder Cup lead over the United States by
lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik's clutch handiwork upstaged the supposed Summit of the
Centuries _ the climax to the 20th or a preview of the 21st, take
your pick _ between Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder matchups are determined by a blind lottery, and when
it was announced Thursday that Woods and Tom Lehman would face
Garcia and Parnevik, golf fans figured they'd hit the jackpot. Even
if it wasn't one-on-one, this was the head-to-head confrontation
the public had been salivating for: Woods, the 23-year-old reigning
king of golf, vs. 19-year-old Spanish prodigy Garcia, his would-be
usurper.
</P>
<P>
   Both performed admirably, though Woods consistently outdrove
Garcia, who in turned seemed to have the edge in charisma. But
without Parnevik, there may have been no European celebration after
the 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The US drew first blood on the first hole when Lehman holed a
wedge from 30 feet to the right of the green for a birdie 3. Here
Woods showed his most _ and virtually only _ emotional reaction of
the day, pumping his fist repeatedly as the crowd screamed.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, that was about the only shot Lehman could get
to drop, though the Americans went 2 up on the par-4 fifth when
Parnevik scuffed a chip and Woods dropped a 4-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it appeared they were unraveling, the Europeans remained
undaunted. ``I thought we could come back,'' said Garcia. ``And we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they erased the deficit on the next two holes.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-4 sixth, Woods and Lehman crisscrossed galleries as
they twice missed the green. Garcia, chipping from the tip of the
rough, knocked a bump-and-run within 2 feet. Parnevik sank the par,
and Lehman missed the 15-footer Woods had left him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I either misread (the putts),'' said Lehman, ``or read them
correctly and had the wrong speed. Frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration actually was just beginning. Europe never
trailed after Parnevik, who twice changed his club selection,
nearly aced the 197-yard seventh with a 5-iron, setting up Garcia's
4-foot birdie that evened the match.
</P>
<P>
   It remained that way until the pivotal 12th, the toughest hole
at The Country Club. The second shot is blind, but Parnevik,
hitting from the left rough, somehow skimmed the traps on the left
and found safety on the right side, 25 yards from the green. Lehman
pulled the second US shot to the back left fringe, from where the
US three-putted. Meanwhile, Garcia pulled off another virtuoso
bump-and-run within 4 feet, and Parnevik converted, giving Europe
the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking at making bogey and they end up making 4,''
lamented Woods. ``You can't afford to give them a hole like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was Europe _ in the person of Parnevik _ that
refused to give anything away. After referee J.R. Carpenter
requested on the 13th that the players please speed things up a
bit, Parnevik saved a halve on the 14th by running in a 10-foot
uphill par putt. On the 15th, Garcia left him with a 45-footer
across the green, and Parnevik lagged it to 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He then put the Americans out of their misery when he won the
17th, and the match, with a 7-foot birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun,'' said Parnevik. ``It's only the first
round yet, so there's a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant in the Ryder Cup, but he just as easily could have been
referring to Garcia vs. Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it's Europe against the USA, it's not Sergio against
Tiger,'' said Garcia. ``Everyone needs to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik certainly did.

 &HT;    BUSH PRAISES HOME SCHOOLERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas faced an audience of
more than 1,600 home schoolers Friday, offering encouragement but
stopping short of supporting tax credits or vouchers for parents
who choose to bypass public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, we think home schooling is something to respected
and something to be protected,'' the Republican presidential
front-runner told the first national meeting of the Virginia-based
Home School Legal Defense Association. ``Respecting the energy and
commitment of loving mothers and loving fathers. Protecting them
from the interference of government.''
</P>
<P>
   That line got rousing applause from the audience, many of whose
members are fearful that any government help might come with
strings, such as testing and curriculum requirements. The
association supports tax credits, but not vouchers, said Michael
Smith, the group's vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing Bush could say about home schooling is
``nothing,'' said Bob Mann, 42, of New Jersey, who home-schools his
five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of New Jersey has no laws regarding home schooling,
and I would like to keep it that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's home schooling message met with applause Friday, but he
has departed from conservatives on key education points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, he proposed a limited program of vouchers _
giving parents tax money for educational choices other than public
schools _ that some Republicans said doesn't go far enough. And he
has proposed placing the federal Head Start program under the U.S.
Department of Education, expanding a federal agency that is
anathema to many conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush delivered a variation of his stump speech
designed neither to alienate nor appease an audience unsure about
whether his ``compassionate conservative'' message is conservative
enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group of people who have rejected the educational
system as it is,'' an unconvinced Mann said afterwards. ``All he
did was uphold ideals of government sponsored education. ... He's
trying to be all things to all people. ``

DRUG CZAR SAYS BUREAUCRATIC INFIGHTING HURTS NARCOTICS WAR

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bitter turf wars and a lack of coordination among
federal law enforcement agencies have hampered the fight against
illegal drugs along the U.S.-Mexico border, White House drug policy
chief Barry McCaffrey told Congress Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 23 federal agencies dealing with the fight against
drugs, but to be frank, their ability to work together is
completely inadequate,'' McCaffrey admitted to a House panel.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice,
Drug Policy and Human Resources, McCaffrey said valuable
information gathered on drug operations by one agency often fails
to reach other agencies that could use it to stop narcotics
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   State and local law enforcement officers have ``a very difficult
time'' getting intelligence on drug operations from federal
agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major failure of our effort against illegal drug
trafficking that local and state law enforcement officers don't
have one place to go to get information gathered by federal
agencies on drug operations in their districts,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the 23 agencies operating along the border have
five parent departments: Treasury, which is responsible for seizing
illegal drugs and halting money laundering and firearms
trafficking; Justice, which enforces drug and immigration laws and
prosecutes criminal cases under those laws; Transportation, which
helps interdict illegal drugs at border crossings; State, which
runs joint counter-drug programs with Mexico, and Defense, which
provides aircraft and radar to help police catch traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey suggested putting one federal agency in charge of
coordinating anti-narcotics efforts at each of the major points of
trade and drug activity along the U.S.-Mexico border. However, he
would not give the agency unlimited power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that somebody from Washington should be
telling the people at the border what's the best way to fight
drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many panel members argued that the federal agencies
would never voluntarily coordinate their efforts enough to be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee chairman John Mica, R-Fla., suggested that Congress
needs to force the different agencies to work together. ``Do we a
law that give you or some agency the authority to require
coordination?'' Mica asked McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he believed passing a law was unnecessary and
that coordination could be achieved by ``bringing together the
agency heads and letting common sense push policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, who called the drug trade an
``invasion,'' said the United States doesn't have time to wait for
the various federal agencies to learn how to work together against
illegal narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that meetings and joint task forces and all
these other operations will do the job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, a former border patrol section
chief, also pushed McCaffrey on the need for a law, saying, ``It's
important that these coordinators have some clout to force agencies
to use their resources in a way they are expected to.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey bluntly told the subcommittee that he didn't think
Congress could pass a law that would force the different agencies
to work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no possibility of getting the various congressional
committees to get through a bill to put a coordinator in charge of
all these agencies and departments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, noting that the U.S.-Mexico border has become the
major entrance for illegal drugs into the United States, said that
last year the U.S. Customs Service seized almost 32,000 pounds of
cocaine, 850,000 pounds of marijuana and 407 pounds of heroin along
the southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Agency estimates that up to 70 percent of
the cocaine, 50 percent of the marijuana and 20 percent of the
heroin in the United States now comes across that border.

FOURTH HOLE OFFERS EARLY EXCITEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ In a game that has become increasingly
overrun with length (7,000-yard courses, 300-yard drives, 480-yard
par 4s), there is still beauty in some things short.
</P>
<P>
   Such as ``Hospital,'' which is the name they gave this devious
par-4 fourth hole at The Country Club. It measures 335 yards. Every
inch of it is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when you get to the green, which is but 2,800
square feet. ``It used to be 6,000,'' said Rees Jones, whose
efforts brought this course back to life for the 1988 US Open. ``It
was small, then big, but we made it small again.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in doing so, brought excitement back to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed that in foursomes, caution would be the rule
here, which proved to be the case when the first group arrived.
Three-irons were the clubs of choice for both David Duval and Colin
Montgomerie, both of whom left their partners wedges from about
110-115 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the wonderment of this Ryder Cup, which introduces many
spectators to Europeans for the first time. After Phil Mickelson
knocked his wedge to 4 feet and the pro-American crowd cheered,
Montgomerie's partner stood over his shot. ``Paul Lawrie has got to
be nervous,'' said a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he didn't watch Lawrie's closing efforts at the
British Open, a rather nerve-wracking tournament he won two months
ago when he birdied the last two holes of a four-hole playoff. But
the spectator, and those around him, did see the soft wedge that
Lawrie threw in the air, which came to rest inside of Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Birdies for both teams. A rousing start for those die-hard fans
who had gathered in this hard-to-get-to hole at about 7 a.m.,
almost an hour before any sign of action.
</P>
<P>
   The second group threw caution to the wind and gave the fans
what they had whispered for. An attempt at the green.
</P>
<P>
   Woods first, bombing a 3-wood down the left side, trying to cut
it in. Not quite. It landed in gnarly, wet rough, some 295 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia next, launching a driver down the gut, the ball hitting
the down slope over the hill and stopping 282 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly what the fans wanted, but close, though poor wedges
by Lehman and Parnevik left both teams with pars.
</P>
<P>
   There was one more bomber to come through and Davis Love
cooperated. He, too, took a driver down the left side, over a set
of trees, the ball lost against a backdrop of cloudless skies. Then
the sound of branches being clipped and the ball appeared, somehow
bouncing right when it should have bounced left into jail. Instead,
Payne Stewart was left with a soft wedge that he put close for an
easy birdie.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth group came through and played cautiously, lay-up
3-woods by Darren Clarke and Jeff Maggert. Nice shots and a birdie
putt by Westwood closing out the morning action.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd looked around, wondering where to go. There wouldn't
be any more action at the fourth for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do now?'' asked one spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go fight the crowd,'' said his friend, leaving their
comfortable, unobstructed seats.
</P>
<P>
   Even the marshals, the volunteers from nearby Putterham Meadows,
wondered what to do. Should they go eat? Should they stay put? Or
should they stop the woman trying to walk around the green?
</P>
<P>
   Too late, but along came another woman, and they did stop her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to follow her,'' said the woman, pointing to the first
woman. ``That's the captain's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The marshals respectfully let Julie Crenshaw and three players'
wives march on.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Early statues show a young woman with a helmet on her
head and armor over her breast. Later, Marianne looked virginal in
a translucent dress. Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve have
posed for statues of her. Those versions _ replicated in the
workshops of the Louvre _ grace city halls across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now a question of monumental importance is sweeping France: As
the 21st century dawns, does France need a new pretty face in a
skimpy dress as a national symbol? And if so, which one?
</P>
<P>
   ``Marianne'' _ there are different versions of where her name
came from _ is the character embodying La France, a sort of Uncle
Sam with curves. In a 1794 version, she is helmeted like the Greek
goddess Athena and leans on a spear.
</P>
<P>
   In Delacroix's ``Liberty Leading the People,'' she leads the
rabble's charge over the barricades, waving a flag and carrying a
rifle, her hands too full to hold up her drooping bodice.
</P>
<P>
   Every mayor in France gets to pick a Marianne statue, and they
usually end up buying the classic versions, according to Francoise
Pfiffer, who runs the Louvre studio that makes most of them.
</P>
<P>
   But often, she said, they spend a lot of time mulling over the
Bardot, with its artsy wet-T-shirt look. France's city halls would
look quite different if Frenchmen dared to go shopping alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really want the Bardot, but their wives object,'' Ms.
Pfiffer said. ``One mayor came here with his wife and she was quite
shocked when she saw the breasts. I managed to reassure her by
telling her that most of the time, the statue wears a Tricolor sash
that covers all that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises another question: If a new Marianne has to be
chosen, why can't the country that has produced George Sand and
Francoise Sagan pick one on the basis of something other than
looks?
</P>
<P>
   Of the five finalists chosen by the 36,000-member Association of
French Mayors, two are supermodels, one is a game-show host, one a
singer and one a television news anchor. The mayors vote by the end
of this month, and a new statue is to be unveiled in November.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of the small town of Artigues-pres-Bordeaux, Francoise
Cartron, 60, has already fired off a letter to the association
chiding them for their choices _ beautiful women and honorable
ones, she said, but should choosing a new Marianne be a beauty
contest?
</P>
<P>
   ``We must move away from the conventional course of a Marianne
who is uniquely a symbol of feminine beauty,'' Mrs. Cartron said.
``These days women no longer settle for the limitations that were
too often forced on them, and the Marianne of the year 2000 should
really resemble the women of this country who each day create,
innovate and move us forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cartron says her office has been flooded with calls of
support, people agreeing that the choice of a new Marianne should
be more than a beauty pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who made these choices?'' Mrs. Cartron said. ``I think there
is an inner circle of mayors at the association and, being in
politics, they tend to be men of a certain age and they came up
with this list. Because you have to ask yourself _ why would you
choose these women? They do not reflect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cartron has not heard yet from the mayors association. And
it seems unlikely that she will. A spokeswoman for the
organization, Catherine Doumas, said crisply that if Mrs. Cartron
had objections to the candidates, she could simply not vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've had complaints,'' Ms. Doumas said. ``All kinds.
Some people from Brittany said: Why not someone from Brittany?
Others said other things. But we did it the way we did it because
after all, at some point, you have to make a decision or nothing
will ever get done.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, though, Mrs. Cartron might consider herself lucky
to get the silent treatment. While the French may be great admirers
of female beauty, outspoken women in politics often face a barrage
of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, hundreds of fed-up women, and a few dozen men,
announced that they were creating a ``watchdog'' group to defend
women in public life. Career women, they said, are often accused of
earning their success in bed and are labeled according to their
looks as mothers, whores or maids.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which includes several former Cabinet ministers,
issued its manifesto after a trade union circulated a pamphlet
taunting the female head of a state-owned radio station. She was
compared to the spendthrift mistress of King Louis XV and advised
that she could learn some management techniques from brothel
madams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough,'' said the group, calling itself Chiennes de Garde _ a
kind of play on words that means Lady Watchdogs. ``We watchdogs are
displaying our fangs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the French have had a woman as a symbol of the lofty
principles of their constitution, they have only recently turned to
women to represent them in government _ another subject under
discussion here these days.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, France _ which did not give women the vote until
1944 _ had fewer women in its National Assembly than any other
parliament in the European Union, ranking 72nd in the world. Since
then several of the major parties have made it a point to promote
candidates who are women. Just last week, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin unveiled a report proposing that his Socialist Party reserve
40 percent of its seats for women.
</P>
<P>
   In its search for the new Marianne, the mayors association
surveyed about 100 mayors for suggestions, Ms. Doumas said. The
candidates were then chosen to reflect a ``range of professions.''
They also had to agree not to make any money from the enterprise
and to make themselves available to the sculptor, who has not yet
been selected.
</P>
<P>
   To help them choose one of the five candidates, France's mayors
are to receive pictures of the young women: Estelle Hallyday, a
model and sometime television presenter; Patricia Kaas, a waiflike
singer; Laetitia Casta, a model who recently appeared in the film
``Asterix le Gaulois''; Nathalie Simon, a game-show host and
champion wind-surfer; and Daniela Lumbroso, a journalist. They will
also receive statements submitted by the candidates on why they
wanted to be models for Marianne.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hallyday, for example, says that having represented French
goods overseas, she would be glad now to represent France as a
whole, ``modern, dynamic and alive, but without forgetting its
traditions.'' Ms. Casta says she would be ``extremely touched to be
chosen.'' As she recently represented a Gauloise, representing
Marianne ``would help her transcend several centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cartron says that if asked, she would suggest the French
astronaut Claudie Andre-Deshays as a model for Marianne. ``There is
a woman who has succeeded in a man's field,'' she said. ``Now that
is really an advancement, and she is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the association sticks with its five candidates, Ms.
Cartron says, Artigues-pres-Bordeaux will stick with its 1873
version of Marianne.

 &HT;    CLINTON JABS BUSHES, FATHER AND SON, IN PARTY SPEECH
 &HT;    520&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, in two speeches Friday aimed at
cheering up Democratic leaders, questioned the fiscal soundness of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's military proposals and recalled the
economic recession that took place when Bush's father was
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be of good cheer,'' the president told members of the
Democratic National Committee, many of whom are fretting over
Bush's lead in public opinion polls over the Democratic
presidential front-runner, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not mention former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Gore's sole opponent for the Democratic nomination. But his
remarks also seemed designed to head off any stampede of party
officials to Bradley, who has shown unexpected strength against
Gore in early primary states.
</P>
<P>
   The president reminded his fellow Democrats that he was running
third in the polls, behind then-President Bush and independent Ross
Perot, just months before he won the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearly identical speech to a luncheon of the Democratic
National Committee's Business Council, Clinton predicted a
Democratic victory in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what's going to happen next year?'' he said. ``My
gut is we win because we've done a good job for America, because we
had an argument over ideas and we turned out to be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the luncheon speech to raise questions about
how Republicans in Congress could cut taxes by $792 billion and
still pay for a multibillion-dollar military spending increase Gov.
Bush outlined in a speech Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, 'That's a nice speech, but if I sign this
tax bill he's for, there won't be any money for the promise he just
made,''' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also jokingly jabbed at the Texas governor's
unprecedented fund-raising, now more than $52 million. ``My economy
has made it possible for those Republicans to give George Bush all
that money,'' he said. ``Al Gore told me the other day, he said,
'if I'd known this economy was going to make so much money for
Bush, I'd have voted against your economic plan.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Gore, as vice president, cast the tie-breaking vote in the
Senate for Clinton's economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the political setting and partisan tone of his
remarks, the president insisted he is still ready to work with the
Republican leadership of Congress on such major issues as Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe there's the opportunity for us to work
together,'' Clinton said. ``This is not an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the economy has been so strong during his
presidency that many Americans have forgotten how the annual
federal budget deficit grew to $300 million and the national debt
quadrupled during the Reagan and Bush presidencies. He also said
the economy has led to ``collective amnesia'' about the recession
during the Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a poll the other day where people think the economy was
good when President Bush was here,'' he said. ``I think they think
it was good when Herbert Hoover was here.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempt to tie Gov. Bush's presidential candidacy to
his father's presidency is one of the emerging campaign themes at
the fall meeting of the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing DNC General Chairman Roy Romer, in his farewell speech
Friday, recalled some of the cuts in federal aid to education that
occurred during the Bush presidency. ``Why would we ever hand the
White House back to another George Bush?'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Democratic Party Chairman Dave Worley defended the
tactic. ``People have forgotten what the economy was like when
George Bush was president,'' he said. ``And now, you see Governor
Bush ready to bring the same crowd back to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's cheerleading was welcomed by many Democrats, who have
grown weary from the impeachment and Senate trial of the president,
a phenomenon pollsters have labeled ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alicia Wang, the vice chair of the Democratic Party in
California, said, ``It's not Clinton fatigue. It's battle fatigue.
And now we've got to get ready for another tough campaign.''

grown weary from the impeachment and Senate trial of the president,
a phenomenon pollsters have labeled ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alicia Wang, the vice chair of the Democratic Party in
California, said, ``It's not Clinton fatigue. It's battle fatigue.
And now we've got to get ready for another tough campaign.''

NORTH KOREA TO FORGO MISSILE TESTS WHILE TALKS WITH U.S. ARE UNDER
WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a terse announcement that seemed to confirm recent
diplomatic advances, the North Korean government Friday publicly
stated that it would refrain from further missile tests while talks
with the United States are under way.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, carried by the official Korean Central News
Agency, said the halt in missile tests had been decided ``in order
to create a more favorable atmosphere.'' It appeared to bolster
assertions of the Clinton administration that the recently
announced easing of American sanctions against North Korea was
justified by a new North Korean commitment to ease regional
tensions by suspending the country's missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Friday before receiving word of the
North Korean statement, former U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry, who is President Clinton's special adviser on North Korea,
spoke of the missile test moratorium and the easing of American
sanctions as initial gestures in what promises to be a long road
toward ending the Cold War on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's recent gestures have included lifting a ban on
trade between the countries, allowing American airlines to land in
North Korea and promoting higher level diplomatic contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each step of the negotiations ahead of us could be frustrating
and difficult,'' he said. ``But if we are unsuccessful in
persuading North Korea to remove the threat, we must take actions
that are even more difficult. We must take actions to contain that
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of an agreement between the United States and
North Korea to relax sanctions and halt missile testing after talks
in Berlin earlier this month received mixed reaction in Washington,
with some critics maintaining that the North Koreans were being
wrongly rewarded for easing a crisis of their own creation.
</P>
<P>
   In response to those criticisms, Perry said Friday that making
the improvement in the climate between the countries meaningful
would require a ``change in behavior'' by the North. Failing that,
he said, the sanctions being removed by Washington could be
restored ``in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks are scheduled to resume in early October, and are expected
to involve the visit of a senior North Korean official to
Washington for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, with its economy in a shambles, North Korea has
suffered what many experts say may rank as one of the century's
worst famines. According to some estimates, as many as two million
people may have died of starvation and famine-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, economic aid and the remittances of
Koreans living in Japan, and more recently, receipts from a booming
if tightly controlled tourist trade with South Korea have become
vital sources of income for the government of President Kim Jong
Il.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Korea has pressed ahead with a strategy of
engagement, Japan reacted to a missile test last year with a
suspension of most economic aid and a threat to end the lucrative
remittances.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling more threatened perhaps than any other country by North
Korea's missile program, Japan has taken the most cautious approach
to North Korea of any of Washington's regional allies. And Tokyo's
skepticism could be heard even Friday after the North Korean
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to monitor North Korea's statements with keen
interest,'' said one senior Japanese diplomat who, speaking on
condition of anonymity, pronounced his country's support for
Perry's diplomacy. ``But everyone is hopeful there will be more
from North Korea. And so on the basis of just a couple of
sentences, I think I should stop there.''

VIOLENT PROTESTS FORCE INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT TO BACK DOWN ON
SECURITY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Yielding to a wave of protests, President
B.J. Habibie said Friday that he would delay signing a new security
law that was rushed through Parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the law ignited the most violent unrest here
since November. Students objected to the content of the law, which
they said would grant sweeping new powers to the military, and to
the fact that it was approved on the next-to-last day of
Parliament's session.
</P>
<P>
   After clashes between police and students that raged all night,
the mayhem intensified as troops fought thousands of students and
others in the heart of the business district.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were killed and more than 100 injured, according to
officials at hospitals. Of the four dead, three were demonstrators
and one was a police officer who was hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the top military commander, Gen. Wiranto, had
decided to delay enforcing the law after it became clear that the
students were not going to back down. As Defense secretary, Wiranto
had proposed the legislation and led the government lobbying
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people do not understand the contents of the bill,''
a spokesman for the military, Maj. Gen. Sudrajat, said. ``Because
of that, the government has decided to suspend the security law.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the army and the government had been caught off
guard by the size and ferocity of the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in the last two days is very serious,'' said
Umar Juoro, an adviser to Habibie. ``What is the point of the
president's signing the bill if the cost is so high? Indonesia has
too many other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Juoro said the new law was less Draconian than the existing law,
which Habibie invoked to impose martial law in East Timor. But he
acknowledged that the government had miscalculated the symbolism of
passing a new law in a period of deep uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, particularly students, don't understand the bill,''
Juoro said. ``It is still strongly in their minds, especially in
the post-Suharto era, that any law related to security must lead to
repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who governed Indonesia for three decades, was forced
from office last year after widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face on Friday is the latest in a series of government
retreats. Two weeks ago, Habibie agreed to accept a foreign
military force in East Timor, after having declared for weeks that
it was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling under the blows of East Timor, a tough political
campaign, a wounded economy and a festering financial scandal,
Habibie these days seems to be carried along by events rather than
in control of them.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal will be his next test. Friday, Parliament released
its report on what is known as the Bank Bali affair, accusing
several top officials, including one of Habibie's closest advisers,
of having taken part in a scheme to divert nearly $70 million in
public money to the governing Golkar Party.
</P>
<P>
   As Habibie faces an uphill battle for re-election by a national
assembly in November, the last thing he needs is street violence
here in the capital. Burning buses and cars littered a main street,
as the sounds of gunfire echoed off the skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 students battled police at the University of Atma
Jaya in central Jakarta, hurling stones and fire-bombs. Police
responded with volleys of tear gas and rubber-coated bullets.
Hospital officials said the most serious injuries occurred at dawn,
when 500 officers stormed the university, swinging truncheons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep fighting until they revoke this law,''
said Mohammed Rusmadi, a student at the Institute for Islamic
Studies. ``If we don't keep fighting, we will have wasted the lives
of the students who were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   As with many students interviewed Friday, Rusmadi viewed the
security law as a ploy by the military to seize control of
Indonesia. ``The military will have the legal power to declare a
state of emergency,'' he said. ``They will use the trouble in East
Timor as a pretext to take over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Kuornia, 19, a student at the Perbanas banking college,
said Habibie was ``using this as a last-minute way to stay in
power.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday, 5,000 students tried to march to the Parliament to
voice their opposition. The violence began when the students ran
into a wall of police officers and soldiers a mile from the
building and were pushed back by trucks equipped with water cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the students could not pass beyond the campus gates. By
the dozens, they tried to march into the street, facing down
soldiers who bore cocked rifles. In a makeshift clinic, paramedics
treated students who had been beaten by truncheons or hit by
rubber-coated bullets. Bloody footprints led into the room.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports from hospital officials that some
soldiers had shot students with live ammunition. The military
denied those reports, saying it had used only rubber-coated
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   For Wiranto, such accusations raise painful memories of May
1998, when soldiers fired on students at Trisakti University,
killing six. The general had initially denied that his troops had
used live ammunition, but later acknowledged that they had. The
shootings galvanized the students, unleashing a series of riots and
looting that eventually brought down Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest Friday resembled that of May 1998 in that students
were not the only people who were on the streets. Office workers,
unemployed people and even schoolchildren joined. Military
officials complained that some people used the protests as an
excuse for vandalism _ smashing car windows, tearing down street
lamps and uprooting flower pots on a main boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The government's reversal was clearly calculated to defuse the
protest, and it seemed to be working. Television reports Friday
evening said that the police and soldiers had returned to their
barracks and that the students were dispersing.

BUSH BACKS RIGHTS OF PARENTS TO TEACH KIDS AT HOME WITHOUT
GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Courting social conservatives in his party, George
W. Bush told a conference of home schoolers that he endorsed their
right to educate their children without the interference of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas we view home schooling as something to be respected
and protected,'' the Texas governor said in an address to the Home
School Legal Defense Association, a Christian group that has waged
legal battles across the nation to keep home schooling free from
government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   With the address to the home schoolers and a scheduled
appearance next week at a meeting of the Christian Coalition, Bush,
the Republican presidential front-runner, appears to be trying to
pay particular attention to a vocal element of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Since he launched his presidential campaign earlier this year,
Bush has employed a front-runner's centrist strategy, largely
steering clear of hot-button conservative causes such as abortion
and school prayer that could alienate moderate and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   His typical campaign stop includes a visit to an elementary
school followed by a fund-raiser. To broaden his party's support,
he has also made a point of visiting Hispanic groups. And Friday
evening the Texas governor was scheduled to speak at the Republican
National Assembly Dinner and Gala.
</P>
<P>
   But with a number of Republican candidates actively courting the
social conservatives, Bush cannot afford to completely shun those
voters before the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, with commentator Pat Buchanan threatening to bolt
the Republican Party and run as a Reform Party candidate, the
pressure may increase on Bush to keep conservatives in the GOP
fold.
</P>
<P>
   The home-schoolers conference, which was held at the Daughters
of the American Revolution's Constitution Hall, drew five of the
nine GOP presidential candidates, including Buchanan, Steve Forbes,
Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush endorsed the rights of home schoolers, he did not
touch some of controversial social issues broached by other
speakers, such as abortion and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the governor pasted together snippets from his standard
stump speeches, including his pitch to let faith-based groups carry
out welfare functions, the need for a stronger military and defense
of his record as governor.
</P>
<P>
   In reference to President Clinton's veto this week of the GOP's
$792 billion tax cut, Bush said, ``We'll be prosperous if we cut
taxes for the working people.''
</P>
<P>
   After his talk, the governor mingled briefly with the crowd as
he was serenaded by the Joyful Sound, a student choir made up of
home schoolers from the Houston area. He then left the hall without
taking questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say that Bush, as the GOP front-runner, has
to walk a tightrope between appealing to the moderates who decide
the general election and conservatives who are highly influential
in the early primaries, particularly in Iowa and in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has to reach out to those (socially conservative)
voters at the very same time he is reassuring soccer moms and
Northeasterners that he is not a prisoner of the religious right,''
said analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that with Buchanan threatening to leave the party,
Bush may have to step up his courting of social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lambert, a Republican National Committee member from Texas
and president of the Texas Home School Coalition, said that home
schoolers are ``a very active group of primary voters'' in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody that is a serious contender for the Republican
nomination can afford to walk away from these groups that are core
constituency in the primary,'' said Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense Fund,
said that he believed that it was the influence of Lambert and
another home-school advocate and big Bush contributor, San Antonio
businessman Jim Leininger, that convinced the governor to address
the home schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good longtime relationship with home schoolers in
Texas I think that played a role in it,'' said Farris, who added
that he had visited the governor in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition spokesman Mike Freund said it would be risky
for Bush to skip his organization's two-day meeting next week in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush understands that it will be difficult to win without the
religious vote,`` said Freund.
</P>
<P>
   Freund said that coalition members are split on Bush's strategy
of playing to moderate voters by not stressing the issues of
importance to religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   At the home-schoolers conference, Forbes also supported the
right of parents to keep their children out of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``No parent in America should be forced to send their child to a
lousy school,'' said Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters , Forbes also criticized Bush's education
proposals as involving too much government.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has advocated that the federal government withhold funds
from low-performing schools and give the money directly to the
parents to spend at other schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Governor Bush's education proposals, he wants a
big role for the federal government,'' said Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a millionaire magazine mogul, said the presidential
contest ``is going to be a contest between the Republican
establishment, the lobbyists and all the special interests who
rally around the front-runner versus my campaign, an independent
outsider who is not beholden to any of these special interests.'''

CLINTON, DELAY COME TOGETHER ON ADOPTION, FOSTER CARE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the years House Majority Whip Tom DeLay has
leveled many charges of high crimes and misdemeanors at President
Clinton _ lying, adultery, perjury, even cheating at golf.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday the two sworn enemies set aside their differences, if
only temporarily, and DeLay appeared at the White House to champion
efforts by President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
to increase the rates of adoption and foster care.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of DeLay walking through the White House corridors
brought administration aides to a shocked, mouth-gaping stare. ``It
was like an alien dropped into the White House and decided to walk
through,'' said DeLay spokeswoman Emily Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at the event, attended by a group of adopted
children and their parents, that he recently had read a newspaper
profile about DeLay, R-Texas, and began to get steamed because
DeLay ``started grinding on my golf game,'' accusing the president
of not counting all his strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, then I get to the next part of the story, and it talks
about all his experience and his commitment to adoption and to
foster children, and the personal experience that he and his wife
had. And my heart just melted. And all of a sudden, I didn't care
what he said about my golf game,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, through a spokeswoman, was equally magnanimous, despite
spending a full year leading the effort to oust Clinton from the
White House and to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Tom's most personal issues in the Congress is to
encourage adoption and to make foster care a better system and to
make adoption through foster care easier, so he's thrilled that the
president and first lady are as focused on this as he is and have
the same goal. That's why he accepted their invitation to go to the
event,'' said Emily Miller, DeLay's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Miller agreed it was a ``rare occurrence in their
relationship,'' but it was an issue on which they agreed. DeLay
only smiled and nodded as Clinton took notice of his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Before the event, DeLay presented Clinton a foster care business
card and suggested the president was going to have a lot of spare
time after January 2001 so he might consider foster care. Still,
DeLay was unsure if Clinton understood that he was urging him to
take in foster children personally rather than talk about it as a
policy goal, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and his wife, Christine, raised two foster children, an
18-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy. Christine DeLay works with
Court Appointed Special Advocates, a national organization of
volunteers who submit recommendations to judges on foster care
placement.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, however, said the truce between Clinton and DeLay
applied only to this issue. ``This does not mean the budget
negotiations are going to have any kind of breakthrough today.''
Miller called the foster care issue a ``safe harbor'' on which they
both can agree.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the event to announce $20 million in bonus awards
to 35 states that increased their adoption rates. He also announced
$5.5 million in adoption opportunity grants to organizations in 16
states to devise ways to increase interstate adoptions and the
adoptions of minority children.
</P>
<P>
   The president also endorsed a DeLay-backed bill now pending in
the Senate to extend federal support, such as Medicaid and job
training, to foster children after they reach the age of 18.
Currently, all support for foster children ends when they turn 18,
leaving many without health care or job skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, we can help our foster children,'' Clinton said.

 &HT;    BUSH PRAISES HOME SCHOOLERS
 &HT;    Corrects name in 3rd graf to J. Michael Smith.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas faced an audience of
more than 1,600 home schoolers Friday, offering encouragement but
stopping short of supporting tax credits or vouchers for parents
who choose to bypass public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, we think home schooling is something to respected
and something to be protected,'' the Republican presidential
front-runner told the first national meeting of the Virginia-based
Home School Legal Defense Association. ``Respecting the energy and
commitment of loving mothers and loving fathers. Protecting them
from the interference of government.''
</P>
<P>
   That line got rousing applause from the audience, many of whose
members are fearful that any government help might come with
strings, such as testing and curriculum requirements. The
association supports tax credits, but not vouchers, said J. Michael
Smith, the group's vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing Bush could say about home schooling is
``nothing,'' said Bob Mann, 42, of New Jersey, who home-schools his
five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of New Jersey has no laws regarding home schooling,
and I would like to keep it that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's home schooling message met with applause Friday, but he
has departed from conservatives on key education points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, he proposed a limited program of vouchers _
giving parents tax money for educational choices other than public
schools _ that some Republicans said doesn't go far enough. And he
has proposed placing the federal Head Start program under the U.S.
Department of Education, expanding a federal agency that is
anathema to many conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush delivered a variation of his stump speech
designed neither to alienate nor appease an audience unsure about
whether his ``compassionate conservative'' message is conservative
enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group of people who have rejected the educational
system as it is,'' an unconvinced Mann said afterwards. ``All he
did was uphold ideals of government sponsored education. ... He's
trying to be all things to all people. ``

</P>
<P>
   And Adam said, `Lord, when I was in the garden, you walked with
me every day. Now I do not see you anymore. I am lonesome here and
it is difficult for me to remember how much you love me.`
</P>
<P>
   And God said, `Not a problem! I will create a companion for you
that will be a reflection of my love for you. Regardless of how
selfish and childish and unlovable you may be, this new companion
will accept you as you are and will love you as I do, in spite of
yourself.`
</P>
<P>
   And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam. And it
was a good animal. And God was pleased. And the new animal was
pleased to be with Adam and he wagged his tail.
</P>
<P>
   And Adam said, `But Lord, I have already named all the animals
in the Kingdom and all the good names are taken and I cannot think
of a name for this new animal.`
</P>
<P>
   And God said, `Not a problem! Because I have created this new
animal to be a reflection of my love for you, his name will be a
reflection of my own name, and you will call him DOG.`
</P>
<P>
   And Dog lived with Adam and was a companion to him and loved
him.
</P>
<P>
   And Adam was comforted. And God was pleased. And Dog was content
and wagged his tail.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, it came to pass that Adam's guardian angel came
to the Lord and said, `Lord, Adam has become filled with pride. He
struts and preens like a peacock and he believes he is worthy of
adoration. Dog has indeed taught him that he is loved, but no one
has taught him humility.`
</P>
<P>
   And the Lord said, `Not a problem! I will create for him a
companion who will see him as he is, and will remind him of his
limitations.`
</P>
<P>
   And God created Cat to be a companion to Adam. And Cat would not
obey Adam. And when Adam gazed into Cat's eyes, he was reminded
that he was not the supreme being. And Adam learned humility.
</P>
<P>
   And God was pleased...
</P>
<P>
   And Dog was happy and wagged his tail...
</P>
<P>
   And Adam was greatly improved...

   On his next visit the doctor gave him a shot, but that didn't do
any good, either.
</P>
<P>
   On his third visit the doctor told the man to go home and take a
hot bath. As soon as he was finished bathing he was to throw open
all the windows and stand in the draft. `But doc,` protested the
patient, `if I do that, I'll get pneumonia.`

making you a 50-50 partner in my business. All you have to do is go
to the factory every day and learn the operations.`
</P>
<P>
   The son-in-law interrupted. `I hate factories. I can't stand the
noise.`
</P>
<P>
   `I see,` replied the father-in-law. `Well then you'll work in
the office and take charge of some of the operations.`
</P>
<P>
   `I hate office work,` said the son-on-law. `I can't stand being
stuck behind a desk all day.`
</P>
<P>
   `Wait a minute,` said the father-in-law. `I just made you
half-owner of a moneymaking organization, but you don't like
factories and won't work in a office. What am I going to do with
you?`

   Mary Clancy goes up to Father O'Grady after his Sunday morning

CLINTON ASSAILS BUSH'S POSITION ON MILITARY PAY HIKE, TAX CUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton chided Texas Gov. George W. Bush
on Friday for promising a military pay hike while backing big GOP
tax cuts and reassured Democrats to ``be of good cheer'' as the
2000 election cycle blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to the Democratic Party faithful at its autumn
conference just a day after vetoing the Republican's $792 billion
tax cut package. He playfully suggested the veto should net him
thanks from all the Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Though he never mentioned Bush by name, Clinton said, ``every
one of their presidential candidates is out there telling us that
they want to spend more money on defense or pay our servicemen or
women more; you know and they don't want to stop investing in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Thursday announced his defense plan, with more spending
for research projects and pay, just hours after Clinton vetoed the
tax bill. Bush said the Republican Congress should override
Clinton's veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of them (is) for this tax bill that I vetoed, and if
it became law, they'd all be stuck. Every one of their campaign
speeches would be bogus because there'd be no money to pay for all
these things they're out there promising the voters,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they ought to be for what I'm doing, too. I'm saving them
from a red face in 2000,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, serving out the last 16 months of his eight-year
presidency, also urged Democrats to remind Americans of the
economic and social conditions in the United States before he and
Vice President Al Gore were elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his chief rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
will speak to the same group Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a reassuring boost for Gore, who trails Bush in the
national opinion polls, Clinton noted that he finished third in
public surveys just months before the 1992 election, but came from
behind to win.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the Democrats to ``be of good cheer and proud'' because
the United States is a better place than it was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said a ``lot of political rhetorical is premised on the
fact that we were all born yesterday,'' but Democrats ``can't allow
a collective amnesia here.'' He said he recently reviewed a survey
in which the public couldn't remember the bad economic times and
gave all the politicians _ ``Bush, Hoover, the whole crowd'' _ good
ratings on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The president said there was a clash of ideas between
Republicans and Democrats and Democrats were proved right.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1988 election, won by George Bush, the Texas
governor's father, there was wage stagnation, a recession, enormous
deficits and high unemployment rates, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he and Gore promised to attack the deficit while
making more investments in education and making government smaller
and more efficient. The result, he said, is the largest peacetime
economic expansion in U.S. history, rising wages, low jobless rates
and low crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks, this is not an argument anymore; it's a fact, and you
should be proud of it,'' he said. ``The strategy has been
validated. You can get rid of the deficit and still invest in the
things you have to invest in. We've eliminated hundreds of
programs, but nearly doubled investment in education while getting
rid of the deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Clinton, is a $99 billion budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the 2000 campaign, Clinton said, is not whether
there will be a change but what kind of change America wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to change based on all the good things that are
going on in America now, or would we instead take a U-turn and go
back to the stuff that got us in so much trouble before the vice
president and I came here?'' Clinton asked. ``That is the issue.
And you don't have to argue so much anymore, you've got evidence.''

Jones was able to guess so often and well on pitches during the
Braves three-game sweep. Jones, a leading contender for the
National League MVP award, was 4-9 in the series, driving in seven

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Early statues show a young woman with a helmet on her
head and armor over her breast. Later, Marianne looked virginal in
a translucent dress. Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve have
posed for statues of her. Those versions _ replicated in the
workshops of the Louvre _ grace city halls across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now a question of monumental importance is sweeping France: As
the 21st century dawns, does France need a new pretty face in a
skimpy dress as a national symbol? And if so, which one?
</P>
<P>
   ``Marianne'' _ there are different versions of where her name
came from _ is the character embodying La France, a sort of Uncle
Sam with curves. In a 1794 version, she is helmeted like the Greek
goddess Athena and leans on a spear.
</P>
<P>
   In Delacroix's ``Liberty Leading the People,'' she leads the
rabble's charge over the barricades, waving a flag and carrying a
rifle, her hands too full to hold up her drooping bodice.
</P>
<P>
   Every mayor in France gets to pick a Marianne statue, and they
usually end up buying the classic versions, according to Francoise
Pfiffer, who runs the Louvre studio that makes most of them.
</P>
<P>
   But often, she said, they spend a lot of time mulling over the
Bardot, with its artsy wet-T-shirt look. France's city halls would
look quite different if Frenchmen dared to go shopping alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really want the Bardot, but their wives object,'' Ms.
Pfiffer said. ``One mayor came here with his wife and she was quite
shocked when she saw the breasts. I managed to reassure her by
telling her that most of the time, the statue wears a Tricolor sash
that covers all that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises another question: If a new Marianne has to be
chosen, why can't the country that has produced George Sand and
Francoise Sagan pick one on the basis of something other than
looks?
</P>
<P>
   Of the five finalists chosen by the 36,000-member Association of
French Mayors, two are supermodels, one is a game-show host, one a
singer and one a television news anchor. The mayors vote by the end
of this month, and a new statue is to be unveiled in November.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of the small town of Artigues-pres-Bordeaux, Francoise
Cartron, 60, has already fired off a letter to the association
chiding them for their choices _ beautiful women and honorable
ones, she said, but should choosing a new Marianne be a beauty
contest?
</P>
<P>
   ``We must move away from the conventional course of a Marianne
who is uniquely a symbol of feminine beauty,'' Mrs. Cartron said.
``These days women no longer settle for the limitations that were
too often forced on them, and the Marianne of the year 2000 should
really resemble the women of this country who each day create,
innovate and move us forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cartron says her office has been flooded with calls of
support, people agreeing that the choice of a new Marianne should
be more than a beauty pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who made these choices?'' Mrs. Cartron said. ``I think there
is an inner circle of mayors at the association and, being in
politics, they tend to be men of a certain age and they came up
with this list. Because you have to ask yourself _ why would you
choose these women? They do not reflect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cartron has not heard yet from the mayors association. And
it seems unlikely that she will. A spokeswoman for the
organization, Catherine Doumas, said crisply that if Mrs. Cartron
had objections to the candidates, she could simply not vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've had complaints,'' Ms. Doumas said. ``All kinds.
Some people from Brittany said: Why not someone from Brittany?
Others said other things. But we did it the way we did it because
after all, at some point, you have to make a decision or nothing
will ever get done.''
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, though, Mrs. Cartron might consider herself lucky
to get the silent treatment. While the French may be great admirers
of female beauty, outspoken women in politics often face a barrage
of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, hundreds of fed-up women, and a few dozen men,
announced that they were creating a ``watchdog'' group to defend
women in public life. Career women, they said, are often accused of
earning their success in bed and are labeled according to their
looks as mothers, whores or maids.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which includes several former Cabinet ministers,
issued its manifesto after a trade union circulated a pamphlet
taunting the female head of a state-owned radio station. She was
compared to the spendthrift mistress of King Louis XV and advised
that she could learn some management techniques from brothel
madams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough,'' said the group, calling itself Chiennes de Garde _ a
kind of play on words that means Lady Watchdogs. ``We watchdogs are
displaying our fangs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the French have had a woman as a symbol of the lofty
principles of their constitution, they have only recently turned to
women to represent them in government _ another subject under
discussion here these days.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, France _ which did not give women the vote until
1944 _ had fewer women in its National Assembly than any other
parliament in the European Union, ranking 72nd in the world. Since
then several of the major parties have made it a point to promote
candidates who are women. Just last week, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin unveiled a report proposing that his Socialist Party reserve
40 percent of its seats for women.
</P>
<P>
   In its search for the new Marianne, the mayors association
surveyed about 100 mayors for suggestions, Ms. Doumas said. The
candidates were then chosen to reflect a ``range of professions.''
They also had to agree not to make any money from the enterprise
and to make themselves available to the sculptor, who has not yet
been selected.
</P>
<P>
   To help them choose one of the five candidates, France's mayors
are to receive pictures of the young women: Estelle Hallyday, a
model and sometime television presenter; Patricia Kaas, a waiflike
singer; Laetitia Casta, a model who recently appeared in the film
``Asterix le Gaulois''; Nathalie Simon, a game-show host and
champion wind-surfer; and Daniela Lumbroso, a journalist. They will
also receive statements submitted by the candidates on why they
wanted to be models for Marianne.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hallyday, for example, says that having represented French
goods overseas, she would be glad now to represent France as a
whole, ``modern, dynamic and alive, but without forgetting its
traditions.'' Ms. Casta says she would be ``extremely touched to be
chosen.'' As she recently represented a Gauloise, representing
Marianne ``would help her transcend several centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cartron says that if asked, she would suggest the French
astronaut Claudie Andre-Deshays as a model for Marianne. ``There is
a woman who has succeeded in a man's field,'' she said. ``Now that
is really an advancement, and she is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the association sticks with its five candidates, Ms.
Cartron says, Artigues-pres-Bordeaux will stick with its 1873
version of Marianne.

GIVING MORE CARE TO A DOG'S LIFE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Calif., Ohio, Kan.)   (af)  
 By REBECCA M. KNIGHT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you have pangs of guilt whenever you leave Rover to fend for
himself all day? Take heart. Dog day-care centers, where dogs are
left while their owners run errands, head to the office or simply
clean house, are popping up all over.
</P>
<P>
   The American Board and Kennel Association estimates that of the
more than 8,500 kennels nationwide, 500 specialize in day care. And
that care often provides far more than a cage, a bowl of chow and a
rubber ball: The centers may offer an array of amenities, from
massages and baths to swimming lessons, off-leash exercise, even
pedicures.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world, we tend to think of our pets as our
children,'' said Dr. Kay Cox, an animal psychologist in Phoenix.
``Leaving your dog alone for the day is just like leaving a small
child alone; dogs and children need socialization and
interaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Wong of Oakland, Calif., chief executive of an
advertising agency in San Francisco, happily acknowledges spoiling
Wabbi, her 9-month-old soft-coated wheaton terrier. Wabbi is
enrolled at K9 to 5, an upscale center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Dog day-care, Ms. Wong said, ``is good for the mental health of
the dog because it's incredibly lonely for a puppy to be left alone
all day.''
</P>
<P>
   K9 to 5, which offers training, grooming and walking, is so
popular that the waiting list is more than nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Most clients come from upper-middle-class, single-dog
households. ``Our customers are mostly professionals with no
children,'' said Marc Helsing, owner of Downtown Dogs' Daycare in
San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dog day-care is growing in popularity, he added, because of
Americans' changing work habits. ``People don't work a standard
9-to-5 shift anymore,'' he said. ``They are out of the house more
often, and sometimes they're too tired to take their dog for a walk
when they come home from the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Kercher, owner of Yuppy Puppy in Troy, Ohio, said, ``Dog
day-care is a place where dogs can play ball, go for a walk and
build relationships with other dogs, just like a regular kids' day
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veterinarians aren't as enthusiastic. Dr. Charles Myer of
the Dog and Cat Clinic in Leavenworth, Kan., is not convinced that
dogs need such pampering. ``It's certainly not for the dog's
benefit,'' he said. ``It's more for the psyche of the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   But many dog owners swear by it. Ona Wigginton, membership
coordinator at the Denver Museum of Natural History, brings her
miniature dachshund, Heidi, to Big Back Yard, a dog day-care center
in Denver. ``Heidi gets right in the car and knows where she's
going in the morning,'' Ms. Wigginton said. ``She usually needs a
couple of days' rest after being there; she just plays all day
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are spending more than ever on their pets _ $7 billion
alone on veterinary expenses. Thirty-eight percent of Americans own
dogs, according to the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, and in
1998, dog owners spent nearly $300 a year, on average, on their
pets, not including $500 in veterinarian bills.
</P>
<P>
   Dog day-care may not be for the thin of wallet: A single visit
to K9 to 5 can cost up to $40. Grooming and one-on-one interaction
with a trained specialist cost more.
</P>
<P>
   To put the figures in perspective, a massage for humans at a
reputable day spa in New York City costs about $80 an hour; at the
New York Dog Spa and Hotel, an upscale dog day-care business in the
Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, a massage is $60 an hour. A
pedicure for humans at a beauty salon runs about $30; one for the
dog is $15, polish optional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get real fancy,'' said Kercher, whose Ohio center also
offers nail care. ``We have 28 colors to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Many centers have a grueling admissions process. Downtown Dogs'
Daycare, for example, requires owners to complete a three-page
questionnaire about their dog's medical and behavioral history.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaire serves as a character sketch that details
everything from the dog's known commands to its fears. The next
step is a meeting at which the dog is tested for his reaction to
other dogs of varying temperaments. In fact, dogs have been
expelled from day care for fighting and other disruptive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had several dogs removed from the program,'' Helsing
said in a regretful tone. ``Some dogs just aren't a good fit,
unfortunately.''

REVIVING TERM-LIMITS MOVEMENT 
 CALLING IN THE ARMY  
 FORESTS AND TREES  
 PROTECTING FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remember term limits?
</P>
<P>
   That once popular idea to limit a lawmaker's tenure in office
has faded fast on Capitol Hill. But a new group, headed by Rep. Jim
DeMint, R-S.C., is trying to jump start the movement by
accentuating the positive.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizen Legislators Caucus will champion the work of House
members who, like DeMint, vow to limit their own terms. And caucus
members promise not to make life uncomfortable for the growing
number of lawmakers who break their own term-limits pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is not to be bomb throwers,'' DeMint, a freshman
legislator, said. That's in contrast to U.S. Term Limits, a group
that has blasted lawmakers who flip-flop on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's credibility and strength has been undercut by the
broken promises of former term-limits advocates. Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., was practically the poster boy for term limits
after he toppled House Speaker Tom Foley in 1994. Now, Nethercutt
says he was wrong about limited tenures; he wants to have a long
and happy career on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., under pressure from party leaders to
run again, just isn't saying whether she'll honor her own pledge to
leave Congress after four terms. One term-limit group is already
running television ads dubbing the congresswoman ``Slick Tillie.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no such name-calling from the new caucus, DeMint
said. Instead, his group will promote the legislative records of
its members, noting, for example, that term limiters have a track
record of supporting cuts in government spending.
</P>
<P>
   A MILITARY MIND-SET?
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have worked themselves into a lather over the
botched 1993 government raid on the Branch Davidian compound in
Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Launching new investigations, they've denounced the Clinton
administration's changing stories about the use of incendiary
devices, and they're questioning what role the military played in
advising and training some ATF agents for the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with little fanfare, House members and senators
overwhelmingly passed a huge defense authorization bill that makes
it easier for local law enforcement agencies to call in the
military for help in cases involving biological or chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency has not been lost on some observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that at the same time Congress launches an
investigation of the military role in Waco, it is authorizing the
military to have a role in other law enforcement operations,'' said
Gregory Nojeim, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   COMPENSATING FOR REDUCED COMPENSATION
</P>
<P>
   As disputes over federal logging policy have cut timbering in
some national forests, payments to surrounding rural counties and
school districts have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Under agreements dating to 1908, counties with forests in their
boundaries get 25 percent of the timber revenue to compensate them
for a reduced tax base. But those payments have diminished with a
decline in timber harvesting _ dropping to less than 10 percent of
historic levels in some counties.
</P>
<P>
   Two Southern Democrats, Rep. Allen Boyd of Florida and Nathan
Deal of Georgia, are proposing a solution to what they say is a
problem with significant consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of these losses on rural communities and schools
has been staggering,'' said Boyd. ``School children have been held
hostage as their teachers have been laid off, their classrooms left
in disrepair and their academic enrichment programs abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Under their plan, forest counties would get a fixed payment for
the next five years while the government works with local
communities to develop a permanent solution. The bill has broad
support from education, county and forest interest groups. The
Clinton administration has a less generous, competing plan.
</P>
<P>
   UNPROTECTED BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   The agricultural disaster in North Carolina caused by the floods
from Hurricane Floyd has top farm policy administrators searching
for ways to shelter farmers from such losses.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman lamented in an appearance
before the National Pork Producers Council that livestock farmers
are ill-prepared financially to deal with huge losses, often
lacking insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture is the most unprotected business in America,''
Glickman said. ``You just can't buy it for all practical
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the administration is looking at ways of
protecting farmers, instead of simply handing out emergency aid
each time a disaster strikes. But he offered no specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the next farm bill is going to have to address this
much more directly,'' he said.

 &HT;    New `Profiler' cuts a sultrier silhouette
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As Lexi Sterling, the flame-haired siren
on ``Melrose Place,'' Jamie Luner wreaked more havoc than that
infamous Washington intern.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox's long-running soap is dead. Luner is very much alive.
And she's joining the cast of NBC's ``Profiler'' (10 p.m.), trading
in her sexy bustier for an FBI badge and gun.
</P>
<P>
   Luner plays Rachel Burke, a former prosecutor-turned FBI
profiler. She replaces star Ally Walker, who leaves the show next
week. Tonight, Burke is brought in to find Sam after she's been
taken hostage by Jack of All Trades, her serial killer tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the proooo-filerrrrr,'' Luner howls. ``Isn't that wild?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, like, yeah. Considering the grim drama is about a
stone-faced FBI agent who uses sixth sense visions to catch crazed
killers, the loopy Luner is the last person you'd think the
producers would hire to replace Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shooting a movie in Mobile, Ala., and was asked to put
myself on tape,'' Luner recalls, ``so I went to a local video
taping place and asked the guy who worked there to read with me. He
really had a thick accent and you had to get by that. But thank
gosh I knew my lighting. I kept going back in front of the camera,
checking it, reviewing it and I even edited the tape a couple of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Luner?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the tape, we saw strength, the accessibility to
the character,'' says executive producer Clifton Campbell. ``It was
a pretty easy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers stress they're not bringing in the same type of
character. ``Rachel doesn't have the sort of burden of tragedy that
Samantha Waters had,'' says executive producer Stephen Kronish,
</P>
<P>
   The self-deprecating Rachel will do something Sam never did:
smile. Heck, Sam often looked creepier than the demented killers
she captured. She made ``Millennium'''s Frank Black look like Bob
Hope. Well, she did have it tough. Jack killed her husband, she
never knew her mom and her dad was gone all the time when she was a
kid.
</P>
<P>
   Luner says she looks forward to injecting some humor into what
has always been a humorless show. ``There's a lot of drama, but
I'll be able to throw my comedy in there,'' says Luner. ``You know,
some dry, off-the-cuff humor, which is definitely what the show
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Kronish: ``It's still going to be a show where we are
chasing psychologically oriented crimes. But because Rachel has not
been victimized to the extent that Sam has means we can inject a
different element into the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering Luner is ``Profiler'''s new cast member, will she
tread lightly?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tread lightly? That's not why they hired me,'' she says with a
laugh. ``I'm going to come and do what I do. It's wonderful to come
into a family that's already established and tight and working like
a well-oiled machine, you know. And I've been a new kid on the
block before. You know, you eat lunch by yourself the first couple
of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Luner has certainly come a long way. Eleven years ago she was
the dim-bulb Cindy Lubbock on ``Just the Ten of Us,'' a ``Growing
Pains'' spinoff. Viewers still remember her as the manipulative
viper on the WB's short-lived soap ``Savannah.'' And, of course,
there was ``Melrose,'' the series in which Luner elevated camp to a
high art form. Now she's a take-charge FBI agent. ``The opportunity
to play a character totally different than I've been seen in before
is a wonderful opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Luner winks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she's pretty ballsy.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Drug advertisers aim to do one thing: sell you
products
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Anyone who watches enough television commercials
knows there is no health decision so foolish, no disorder so
debilitating, that it can't be overridden by a product at the
drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn keeps you up at night but you just can't stand the
boredom of a sensible diet? Have we got a pill for you! We're not
allowed to tell you to grind up an extra one and sprinkle it on top
of your chili dog with onions, but we sure can give you the
impression there is nothing our magic pill won't let you eat.
</P>
<P>
   Or do you sneeze just looking outside the window during allergy
season? No problem. The right pill will have you frolicking in the
meadow and rolling through the blossoms in no time. Live a little.
Stop and smell the ragweed.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising in general is pretty much the art of coaxing us to
spend money we don't have for products we don't need because they
can't really deliver on the promises the advertisements hint at. If
something is both new and improved, wouldn't that only make it
better than nothing?
</P>
<P>
   But advertising medical products requires a level of
responsibility that advertisers don't normally display. A person
who chooses a box of corn flakes or brand of jeans that isn't just
right probably isn't going to die from it. Most European countries
have banned direct-to-consumer drug ads in order to protect their
citizens from being under-informed and overmedicated.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, nearly all prescription drug ads were
directed at doctors. They wrote the prescriptions. But federal
restrictions on those ads loosened in 1997 and drug companies spent
$1.3 billion in advertising to American consumers last year, more
than the beer companies spent. The ads targeted not only people who
wanted to lose weight or grow hair, but also those who were afraid
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. More than two-thirds of allergy sufferers say their
primary source of treatment information is advertisements. In a
national survey this year, 53 percent of doctors said a patient had
requested a prescription drug by name. Primary-care doctors report
closer to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The providers are just livid about that,'' says John Tonkin,
executive director of the self-insured employers' organization that
has renamed itself the Three Rivers Health Initiative. ``The
Internet is the same problem. There's plenty of information out
there, but it's not knowledge. It's just information.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies contend they are providing a useful service in
educating customers. That's true to a point. Drugs save money and
lives when they're used correctly, and ads certainly have prompted
many people to take valuable medications.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have supplemented ads with information on the Web
and in mailings to truly raise the level of knowledge about
particular disorders. Some have helped erode the stigmas against
mental illness and impotence. An allergy drug maker will mail you a
reminder just before your allergy season begins wherever you live.
But keep in mind that it provides that service so you won't forget
to buy its product.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements are a source of education in the same way the
Cartoon Channel is a source of art. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has reprimanded nearly 20 manufacturers in two
years, and Consumer Reports found half the drug ads it examined to
be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a comprehensive review for a patient to make an
educated decision on whether this drug should be taken or not,''
says primary care Dr. Gregory Wise.
</P>
<P>
   TV commercials have to name a drug's biggest risks, and you can
even hear them if your VCR plays back in slow motion. The ads are
less reliable about discussing precisely who should and should not
use the drug. Not every body needs extra calcium, for example, or
can even tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
   So while it's fine for patients to ask their doctors for a
particular drug, it's also essential to listen when the doctor
explains why that's not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   They all have side effects, even over-the-counter drugs. If
they're strong enough to help, they're strong enough to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not magic. A person with high cholesterol won't get
enough exercise wrestling with the childproof cap on his medicine.
He shouldn't wash it down with a milkshake, either.

 &HT;    Belief in abstract or physical hell a prickly question
 &HT;    By Stephanie Allmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ You're led down a dark tunnel into a black-lighted
basement. Sounds of moaning and screaming come from behind walls _
lamenting thirst, physical torment and a longing to be with God.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to hell _ at least one version.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Worship Center in Waco uses this scenario, a ``hell
house,'' to illustrate what church members believe hell is: A
literal place of torment for people who reject Jesus as a savior.
</P>
<P>
   But is hell a place or a state of mind?
</P>
<P>
   That question, long debated by theologians, philosophers and
everyday believers, resurfaced this summer when Pope John Paul
shocked some by referring to hell as, ``the state of those who
freely and definitely separate themselves from God, the source of
all life and joy.''
</P>
<P>
   After this statement, some religious leaders expressed
misgivings about the implication that hell is an abstract
separation from God, rather than a literal lake of fire as
described in the biblical book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Timothy Vaverek, pastor of St. Joseph's Catholic
Church, said the pope's statement has been taken out of context,
and that Roman Catholics do believe in hell as more than a state of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joy in heaven and suffering in hell is spiritual and
physical, because we are creatures that are made of both body and
soul,'' Vaverek says. ``There will be a resurrection of the body.
But even in this life, our greatest joys and sufferings are
spiritual in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's religions include a concept of hell, or
eternal damnation for evil souls, in their beliefs, although the
reality of hell has taken on many representations. The most popular
images of the Christian view of hell include flames and the devil
ruling the underworld with a pitchfork in hand.
</P>
<P>
   But these images are not enough to understand hell, Vaverek
says, because no one knows what hell looks like.
</P>
<P>
   And some say images of fire and physical torment are wrong
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the soul leaves the body, physicalness ceases to exist,
so we're talking about the spiritual realm,'' said the Rev.
Theodore Tsitsilianos, priest at St. Nicholas Orthodox Church in
Waco. ``We don't really believe there's a physical hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Patterson, distinguished professor of religion at Baylor
University, says people must ask a question that can't be answered
by anyone who hasn't been to hell: If separation from God starts in
this life, and if God sustains a person in separation after death,
what is that like? ``This remains an unsettled question,''
Patterson says.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson says hell is a metaphor for the worst condition one
can imagine. For instance, Americans might see hell as an atomic
meltdown, he says. But believing in hell as a physical or spiritual
place is often an individualized belief.
</P>
<P>
   The physicality of hell is only one point of contention among
Christians. Some believe that to avoid hell, people must live a
good life; others believe a faith in Jesus Christ is enough.
</P>
<P>
   One Christian belief is that Jesus spent time in hell after he
died on the cross and before he rose on Easter morning. And most
say God gave humans free will to choose whether they will end up in
heaven or hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible says hell is made for Satan and his angels, not for
people,'' Family Worship Center pastor Darrell Price said. ``I
believe he weeps over people that are in hell, but at the same time
is a holy and righteous God. Hell is a real place, but nobody has
to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Bible scholars agree that hell is place of eternal torment
where God does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever metaphor you use, it does stand for something quite
real, and that is a broken or no relationship with God,'' Patterson
said.
</P>
<P>
   National polls show that 70 percent of Americans believe in
heaven, while only 50 percent believe in hell, and few believe they
are going to hell themselves, according to the Religious News
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the world doesn't want to believe in hell because they
don't want to face that there are other consequences for what they
might be involved in,'' said John Wachsmann, senior pastor of
Church on the Rock in Waco.

 &HT;    Two sitcoms, one offbeat drama show promise
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Boy hits girl with car. Boy gets girl.
Boy loses girl. Boy tries to win back girl by singing naked with a
rose sticking out of his rear.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this kooky scenario actually happens on ``Cold Feet,''
NBC's charming romantic comedy. Based on the hit British series of
the same name, ``Cold Feet'' explores the lives of three Seattle
couples in different stages of their relationship. The concept is
hardly original. The WB's ``For Your Love'' does the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   There's Adam (David Sutcliffe) and Shelley (Jean Louisa Kelly).
He's the smooth ladies man, she's commitment shy. Both are working
on that wonderful, horrible and achingly painful thing called
dating. There's Adam's best buddies, Pete (William Keane) and Jenny
(Dina Spybey). They're happily married and expecting their first
child. He's tired all the time because she wants to have sex every
two minutes. There's Shelley's friends Karen (Alicia Coppola) and
David (Anthony Starke), the upscale married couple with marital
woes. She's a stressed mom who wants a nanny, he's a
work-all-the-time dad who doesn't want a nanny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Feet'' successfully combines lighthearted comedy (you
can't beat that rose scene) with tender, heartfelt moments. There's
even some ``Ally McBeal''-like fantasy scenes thrown in for good
measure. But ``Cold Feet'''s strength lies in its finely drawn
characters. If you've ever been married or in a relationship,
chances are these are people and situations you can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   As Adam and Shelley, Sutcliffe and Kelly are most interesting.
The shaggy-haired Sutcliffe is particularly appealing _ especially
when he's smiling. Women, by the way, will love his rear. Both
Sutcliffe and Kelly capture how awkward first dates can be. She
drops her fork at dinner. He spills water. She wants a kiss good
night, but he's not sure so he doesn't give her one. Does any of
this sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Feet'' should definitely warm your heart.
</P>
<P>
   `NOW AND AGAIN'
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if you had the speed of Michael Jordan, the strength of
Superman and the grace of Fred Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   What would you be?
</P>
<P>
   The Three Billion Dollar Man!
</P>
<P>
   Eat your heart out, Steve Austin. Clearly, $6 million doesn't
buy much these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' (not to be confused with ABC's ``Once and
Again''), is an intriguing new series that's part love story, part
comedy, part action-adventure and part sci-fi. And it's all
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS show starts out like a routine drama. A middle-age
insurance executive named Michael Wiseman (John Goodman in a
special one-time appearance) is a devoted family man with a wife
(``Independence Day'''s Margaret Colin) and daughter. He's up for a
big promotion, but doesn't get it. Despondent, he goes out drinking
with a co-worker. On the way home, Michael is accidentally pushed
in front of a train and dies.
</P>
<P>
   But, ah-ha! His uninjured brain is saved. The government, you
see, has spent billions of dollars on research since World War II
to build a super man willing to wage war and take risks mere mortal
men won't. The government wants to harvest Michael's brain and put
it into a lean, 26-year-old ``omnipotent'' body (Eric Close). The
catch: He can never contact anyone he knew in his first life. If he
does, well, it's curtains for the new and improved Michael.
</P>
<P>
   While Michael still yearns to see his family, he's also
fascinated with his new body. After all, the guy has a 30-inch
waist, he can do handstands on wheelchairs and boasts an impressive
``package'' ladies will love.
</P>
<P>
   How will Michael be used? We don't know yet since none of the
show's threads ties together in the opening episode. For instance,
there's a terrorist called ``The Egg Man'' who's killing people all
over the world. Why? We don't know. But we're sure Michael will put
a stop to it.
</P>
<P>
   Close may be the star of ``Now and Again,'' which was created by
``Moonlighting'''s Glenn Gordon Caron, but this series actually
belongs to Dennis Haysbert. As a dashing government doctor, one
moment he's singing ``Close to You,'' the next he's sinisterly
barking ``If he utters a word to anyone else, shoot him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again'' is one of the most densely plotted new shows
of the season. There's something interesting about a show that
doesn't wrap up everything in a neat bow after 60 minutes. Watch it
now. Then watch it again.
</P>
<P>
   `ODD MAN OUT'
</P>
<P>
   Have you seen CBS' ``Ladies Man''? ``Odd Man Out'' is the teen
version.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old kid named Andrew (Eric von Detten) lives with five
beautiful women. The problem is, those women are his mom (Markie
Post), his aunt (Jessica Capshaw) and three sisters.
</P>
<P>
   While he wants to watch ESPN with his buddy, his female
roommates prefer ice skating tournaments. Guess who wins?
</P>
<P>
   Even though Andrew lives with people whose voices are higher
than his, women are still a mystery to him. Can't most guys say the
same thing?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he tells his female lab partner that he doesn't want a
relationship. But then he starts hitting on a blond hottie. Of
course, the situation gets sitcom silly when the lab partner and
blond hottie compare notes at Andrew's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odd Man Out'' is a mildly charming comedy that should please
its intended audience. Post still looks great, Capshaw is a blond
hottie herself and as the harried Andrew, von Detten is
appropriately goofy and sweet.

DRUG FLOW REMAINS STEADY ALONG BORDER DESPITE CRACKDOWN, OFFICIALS
SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Infrared cameras, vapor tracers and other high-tech
devices have enabled law enforcement officials to seize more
illegal drugs along the Southwest border this year than last, say
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crackdown, the rate of drugs flowing across the
border has remained steady during the past three years, officials
say, accounting for between 50 percent and 60 percent of the drugs
smuggled into the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Border Patrol agents already have made 7,310 seizures this
year, up 10 percent from last year, according to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service. Statistics showed during this fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30, that agents seized 1.08 million pounds
of marijuana, up 24 percent from last year. Agents also seized
26,104 pounds of cocaine, up 15 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the National Control Policy Office,
partly credited nearly $26 million in new equipment, ranging from
audio devices to drug testing kits, that went to state and local
governments along the border during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the seizure rates, it's almost
unbelievable,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   But poor management and coordination between federal and local
officials has bogged down drug enforcement efforts, McCaffrey
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to provide more federal support to state and local
authorities because they are being overwhelmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional mandate to hire 1,000 border patrol agents each
year until 2001 to improve security along the border has fallen
short, critics say. The past decade, the number of border agents
has doubled to 8,000, but the Border Patrol would need more than
16,000 agents to deter unauthorized crossings, according to a 1998
University of Texas study.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year 658 positions have gone unfilled, said Rep.
Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, who represents a border community and
is a former border patrol agent. ``We still have areas along the
border where you can drive a four-wheel vehicle through
unnoticed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials did cite some successes.
</P>
<P>
   Coordination between the Border Patrol and U.S. Customs Service
has produced numerous seizures, said Samuel Banks, deputy
commissioner of the Customs Service. For example, Border Patrol
agents borrowed a mobile truck X-ray from Customs Service to
capture 772 pounds of marijuana from a commercial vehicle at a
check point in Sierra Blanca, Texas, on Sept. 17, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the House, Senate and the Clinton administration
have all crafted proposals to reorganize the INS, which oversees
Border Patrol operations. Much of the frustration has stemmed from
the agency's inability to slow down drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent several years working to get INS funding for more
border patrol agents and better equipment. This reorganization
proposal reflects congressional frustration with the agency's
failure to use these additional resources to keep illegal drugs and
illegal immigrants out of our country despite these additional
resources,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to a recent proposal introduced in the Senate
to streamline INS's drug enforcement operations. ``Congress may
have no choice but to consider more dramatic action, including
better organization of the INS.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has increased the Border Patrol's budget from $362
million in 1993 to $727 million in 1997. While funding increases
have enabled agents to exert more pressure on smugglers, McCaffrey
said, smugglers have become more desperate and have devised new
ways to elude law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the biggest threat to our defense of illegal
narcotics comes from the Southwest border. We have not yet achieved
our goals there,'' he said.

   Can Magazines Really Pick Stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Lots of publications have felt the sting of criticism from
Brill's Content, a monthly journalism review. Now it's the turn of
three top personal-finance publications _ Money, Smart Money and
Kiplinger's _ which were taken to task in the October issue of
Content for the stocks and stock funds they have recommended to
readers in cover articles.
</P>
<P>
   Content compared three groups of selections during the last five
years to the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index and said the
conclusion ``wasn't pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Money's choices returned an annualized average of 17.18 percent,
Kiplinger's 16.99 percent and Smart Money's 9.28 percent. During
the same period, the S&AMP;P 500 returned an average of 27.14 percent.
An open-and-shut case?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. By using the same standard to measure all the stock
picks, Content was in some cases trying to compare apples and
oranges. For instance, to compare Smart Money's May 1998 group of
``10 Stocks Under $25'' with the S&AMP;P 500 is to compare
smaller-capitalization or inexpensive issues with what is
essentially a large-cap growth index.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's June 1994 ``safe haven'' stocks _ which
intentionally give up higher returns for security but still managed
a respectable 15.41 percent annualized return _ are difficult to
compare with the S&AMP;P 500, as are foreign stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the Content article alludes to this difficulty and
gives editors of the three magazines their say. Smart Money's
financial editor, Jersey Gilbert, calls Content ``arbitrary'' for
looking only at cover-article stocks and says Smart Money suffered
in the comparisons because of its emphasis on small-cap stocks,
which have slumped in recent years. He says he expects that they
will do well eventually.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't Content compare the magazines' selections with
more than one index, especially for groups of stocks that cannot be
gauged accurately against the S&AMP;P 500? The Russell 2000, for
instance, is considered the benchmark index for small-company
issues; the Wilshire 5000 is a yardstick for the 7,400 publicly
traded companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Reed Baker, who wrote the Content article, said in an
interview that one reason he used only the S&AMP;P 500 was to avoid
confusing readers.
</P>
<P>
   But he agreed that criticism of the index as the sole standard
was valid. ``No methodology is perfect,'' he said. ``This is true
for us as well as for these other magazines. But we felt that over
all it was the best thing we could use. After all, it's the
benchmark that the magazines themselves use across the board to
measure the performance of most of the fund managers they feature
in their articles.''
</P>

   IPO WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stock Auction, Take 3
</P>
<P>
   The third time's the charm. At least, that seems to be what the
owners of Andover.net of Acton, Mass., are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provides online tools, news and other
services for Linux programmers and Web site designers, plans to
become the third candidate to go public via the Open IPO system of
W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co. The system prices initial public offerings
through an online ``Dutch auction,'' which insures that all shares
are sold at the highest price, netting the most money possible for
the issuer.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the two companies that have used the system have failed
to reward those early investors. Ravenswood Winery went public in
April, selling a million shares at $10.50 apiece. Its shares closed
at $10.6875 Friday on volume of just 3,700 shares. Salon.com, which
sold 2.5 million shares at $10.50 in June, closed at just $5.15625
on Friday, on volume of 16,200 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, lackluster performance is in some ways the point of the
system: new issues are priced to the hilt, so there is unlikely to
be a post-offering run-up. W.R. Hambrecht, based in San Francisco,
also charges less for taking companies public than do old-line
investment banks.

BUSH EMBRACES HOME SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush was embraced by the
Christian home school movement on Friday when he vowed to protect
the rights of parents to educate their children without government
interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view home schooling as something to be respected, and
something to be protected,'' Bush told about 1,500 people attending
the Home School Legal Defense Association conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The home school movement is steeped in the Christian faith and
has close ties to religious conservative groups like the Family
Research Council and the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bush, other Republican presidential hopefuls who
spoke at the conference included magazine publisher Steve Forbes,
radio commentator Alan Keyes and Pat Buchanan, who has accused GOP
leaders of softening the party's conservative message.
</P>
<P>
   Michael P. Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense
Association, applauded Bush for his pledge to allow parents to be
``completely left alone by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is elected president, we will have a real friend in the
White House,'' Farris said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has vowed to strip federal education funds from
failing public schools. He would allow parents to take portable
federal accounts to private schools _ a program that includes
elements behind the controversial voucher proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
front-runner, has been critical of Bush's education proposals,
saying the Texas governor wants to ``slam the door on kids in
America's public school system.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Gore has accused Bush of endangering federal school
funds with his ``risky Republican tax plan,'' Forbes has charged
that the Texan's proposals promote big government, a threat to home
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance before the home school conference came one day
after Bush unveiled in Charleston, S.C., his proposals to
strengthen America's armed services. His pledge to shore up the
military drew enthusiastic applause from the home schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Saying this ``is still a world of madmen'' terrorists and
missiles, Bush vowed to ``rebuild the military power of the United
States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed $20 billion over five years to develop smarter
weapons and technology and $1 billion in pay raises to make the
military a more attractive workplace for enlisted personnel and
officers.
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington, Bush was honored by the Republican National
Hispanic Assembly during a dinner and gala. He was presented an
award for leadership by Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, and Carlos
Gutierrez, chief executive officer of the Kellogg Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a history of always being inclusive,'' Bonilla said of
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not embrace Hispanic-Americans because of our vote. He
sincerely cares about us,'' said Bonilla, who also serves as an
adviser to Bush's presidential campaign.

   Small Companies, Big Donations
</P>
<P>
   It may take a huge fortune to make a national splash in
philanthropy, as Bill Gates has done lately with his $17 billion
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But as the booming economy produces a bumper crop of new
millionaires and successful small businesses, a big growth story in
American charitable donations is being played out away from the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Small business is where the growth is in companies' giving,
according to ``Give and Take: A Candid Account of Corporate
Philanthropy,'' by Reynold Levy (Harvard Business School Press,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   And millionaires, not billionaires, are often unrecognized
sources of the new contributions, says Levy, a former president of
the AT&AMP;T Foundation who is now chief executive of the International
Rescue Committee, an organization that assists refugees.
</P>
<P>
   He says much small-business giving is ``obligation-based'' _
going to community organizations that expect local businesses to
donate. But as small companies mature, the personal values of the
entrepreneurs who run them increasingly come into play, inspiring
support for causes that are close to these owners' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The more impassioned giving, Levy said, is springing from
``something very much in the American culture _ a very strong
impulse to helping others.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of millionaires with maturing businesses
suggests that charitable organizations would be wise to get to know
as many entrepreneurs as they could.
</P>
<P>
   The Perfect Paychecks
</P>
<P>
   The grass isn't always greener, after all _ at least where
personal incomes are concerned. The Lutheran Brotherhood, a
financial services organization in Minneapolis, sponsored a recent
survey in which 53 percent of the respondents said they were being
paid the right amount for the work they did, while only 41 percent
felt underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfaction won the day _ even though, when the respondents
were asked how much they expected to earn at the height of their
lifetime earning power, the average came to just $44,600 a year.
(Average pay for all American workers, by the way, was about
$30,300 in 1997, according to government statistics.) Only 4
percent of those surveyed said they thought they would ever make
more than $100,000 in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,004 Americans, chosen at random, was conducted
earlier this year by Yankelovich Partners.
</P>
<P>
   So did anyone out there feel overpaid? Just 2 percent of the
respondents said yes.

 &HT;    CONGRESS USES GIMMICKS TO LIVE UP TO SOCIAL SECURITY PLEDGE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some call it gimmickry or tricks of the budget
trade. Less charitable critics call it bald-faced lying.
</P>
<P>
   But then, labels and definitions are what it's all about, as
Congress tries to convince the public that it is living up to its
politically potent pledge not to spend Social Security trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``are not spending one penny'' of the funds, Rep.
Tillie Fowler of Florida, vice-chairman of the Republican
Conference, repeated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
offered a similarly adamant ``No'' when asked whether the spending
bills that Congress is trying to pass for next year will invade the
Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Those assertions come after the Congressional Budget Office
issued a reality check, telling lawmakers last month that their
spending plans for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would exceed
revenues and dip into Social Security surpluses by as much as
$30-40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Congress is concocting an array of creative schemes
to spend tens of billions of dollars without counting it in next
year's budget. At least technically, where there's an accounting
trick, there appears to be a way:
</P>
<P>
   _ Among the most popular is the ``forward funding'' gambit.
Ridiculed as the 13th month of the year by some, it means that
Congress agrees to a spending level for a program but requires that
some of the money be spent _ and accounted for _ in the following
year. Used only sparingly in the past, the idea has caught on like
wildfire this year. A total of at least $12.5 billion has been
proposed as ``forward funding'' for the year 2000, compared with
$1.9 billion in the 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
   _ A reverse technique is the ``delayed obligation,'' which
allots an agency's annual spending but designates some of the money
to be spent at year's end, so the outlay will be counted in the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The budget ``plug'' has become a mainstay. Generally, Congress
uses cost estimates set out by its own budget office for keeping
track of budget totals. However, where the White House budget
office estimates are lower, congressional budget leaders this year
have told their budget office to ``plug'' in the lower amount.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic has reduced the congressional spending estimates by
$16-19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Congress has continued to use the revenue
estimates of their own budget office because they are more
optimistic than administration forecasts. In effect, Congress has
developed a mix-and-match budget of the most favorable numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perhaps the most convenient vehicle is the ``emergency''
spending bill. Under budget rules, the president and Congress can
designate any bill as urgent spending, and it automatically is
exempt from all spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Once reserved for genuine emergencies such as disasters, this
label is now used for the 2000 census, for the 24-year-old
low-income home energy assistance, and for the long-anticipated $7
billion in assistance to farmers. President Clinton is expected to
ask for funds for troops in Kosovo, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having more creative definitions this year'' for
emergencies, said Robert Reichauer, a former congressional budget
director. He said Congress and the president were premature in
promising to save all of the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   However, others have a harsher view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all games,'' said former Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn., who now
cochairs a private bipartisan group called Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget. ``They've been lying all year about the
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They set (budget) caps that are unrealistically low,'' Penny
said. ``And instead of admitting that, Clinton sends a budget that
pretends to raise revenues, and Congress adopts a budget resolution
that pretends they'll have the courage to keep the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither side wants to admit the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., blasted his colleagues for their
budget gimmicky recently in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans do not understand budget terminology like
'forward funding,''' he said. ``What the American people do
understand are terms like 'smoke and mirrors' and 'dishonesty.' ``

AN INTERNET STABLE IS AHEAD OF THE PACK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>

sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a summer of Internet flame-outs, the stock of Internet
Capital Group was noteworthy for streaking higher.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital, a holding company in Wayne, Pa., that owns
stakes of between 10 percent and 50 percent in a portfolio of 36
mostly private Internet-related companies, sold an 11 percent stake
in itself to the public on Aug. 4, at $12 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ugly recent environment for Internet stocks, the
shares finished their first day of trading at $24.4375 and are now
at $91.125. That gives the company a stock market capitalization of
$11.3 billion, versus $8.08 billion for CMGI, the Internet holding
company in Andover, Mass., to which it is often compared.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that run-up, the stock has continued to receive some
favorable notices. Henry Blodget, an Internet analyst at Merrill
Lynch, which was lead manager for Internet Capital's offering, has
called it a ``must-own'' holding for long-term investors. The
stock, he said, ``allows public-market investors to invest at
private-market prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of Internet Capital's ``partner businesses,'' as it
calls its holdings, are engaged in so-called business-to-business
commerce on line. And many Internet experts say it has enormous
growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research in Boston expects business-to-business
E-commerce to grow from $43 billion in 1998 to $1.3 trillion in
2003 _ far above the $108 billion it expects in E-commerce directed
at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Turner, chief investment officer of Turner Investment
Partners, a money manager in Berwyn, Pa., who bought shares at the
offering, said the company's ``built-in diversification'' is key to
investing in business-to-business E-commerce, ``where winners and
losers are especially tough to identify.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1996 by Walter W. Buckley III, now
39, who is chief executive, and Kenneth A. Fox, 29, a director.
Both were employed at Safeguard Scientifics, an information
technology firm with an impressive record in starting technology
companies; Safeguard is Internet Capital's largest shareholder,
with a 14.3 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital's largest holding, Verticalnet, went public in
February at $16 a share and is now at $32.4375. It has 47
industry-specific online sites for commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A big advantage of business-to-business E-commerce is scale.
``It's a higher-margin, higher-impact business,'' said Charles
Finnie, managing director at Volpe Brown Whelan, the San Francisco
investment bank that was a manager for the Verticalnet
underwriting. A typical transaction, he noted, can be thousands of
dollars, compared with, say, $15 for a book.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Capital may have advantages in attracting start-ups. It
has devoted 40 percent of its current budget to amassing in-house
expertise to help such businesses get off the ground. Because it
owns only part of its businesses, their entrepreneurs can keep big
positions and share in future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Web-stock investors have stayed on the sidelines,
seeing that Internet Capital trades at more than 11 times analysts'
estimates of net asset value. Moreover, management expects to incur
operating losses for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Tracey, manager of the Oppenheimer Enterprise fund, does not
own Internet Capital shares, saying the company's businesses _ some
with little more than a trickle of revenue _ are just too young to
evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not be giving them enough credit for the individual
properties,'' he said, ``but their companies are very
early-stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Blodget, for his part, predicts the shares will reach $125
within two years, on his assumption that Internet Capital, through
its stakes in its partner companies, will account for 1 percent to
3 percent of all business-to-business E-commerce.

BRAZIL'S COFFEE INDUSTRY NOW EMPHASIZES QUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALFENAS, Brazil _ At an air-conditioned compound carved out of
the rolling green hills of southeastern Brazil, the headquarters of
the coffee plantation overseen by Washington Luiz Alves Rodrigues
buzzes with the kind of intensity one expects at an Internet
start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're emerging from the Stone Age,'' Rodrigues, 39, said in
his glass office. Nearby, a few dozen casually dressed employees of
Ipanema Agricola, one of Brazil's largest coffee producers, hunched
over a single table with computers updating bean analyses, weather
dispatches and real-time prices.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Brazil's first producer to create a product for
Starbucks Coffee, is at the forefront of a wide-reaching
transformation in this country's coffee industry, the world's
largest. Lured by the market for high-end coffees that has spread
from Europe to the United States and is now growing in other
countries, many Brazilian producers are focusing for the first time
on quality instead of quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brazil produces roughly a third of the world's estimated
coffee output of 106.8 million bags _ each bag weighs 132 pounds _
the shift in priority to better-quality coffee could be savored by
fans of java around the globe. And together with a parallel quest
to increase efficiency, which is resulting in higher yields on
Brazilian farms, better coffee could also mean cheaper coffee in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage where Brazilian coffee is at is similar to where the
California wine industry was in the 1970s,'' said Michael Nugent,
head of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.'s coffee desk in Napa, Calif. ``Back
then sweet wines were the thing, and dreamers started to create a
quality market that was almost nonexistent. The eventual dividends
were huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts agree that it will take a while for changes on
Brazil's coffee farms to trickle down to the consumer, a look at
how companies like Ipanema have reinvented themselves, and how many
other Brazilian producers are following suit, may provide some
insight into where the global coffee industry is heading.
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on quality is a departure from the industry's
primary objective, which is supplying large processors like Procter
&AMP; Gamble Co., which sells the Folgers brand, or Philip Morris Cos.,
which markets Maxwell House. Shipments of instant coffee, in which
distinctive taste is not necessarily a plus, is also a big
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than a century Brazil has produced the most, so there
was no need to make the best,'' said Steven Topik, a professor at
the University of California at Irvine who is writing a history of
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Brazilian coffee is still sold to large
international processors, the crumbling of bureaucratic structures
that sought to prop up Brazil's status as the world's leading
producer, through agreements aimed at controlling production, has
had much to do with the changes washing over the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, with much of the world ushering in freer markets, the
International Coffee Organization's accord, which used export
quotas to help determine prices, was dissolved. Subsequently, the
state-controlled Brazilian Coffee Institute, which attempted to
control production, was abolished in an early effort to limit
government interference in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big thing for growers to realize that there are
actual consumers out there, not just faceless institutions to deal
with,'' said Marcelo Vieira, the international director of the
Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association, an organization formed by a
dozen producers in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As growers scrambled to adjust to this new reality, they began
visiting countries like neighboring Colombia, the world's
second-largest producer, where cultivation on small, mountainous
farms has resulted in some of the world's most prized coffees. A
delegation of farmers also scoured cities like Seattle, where the
specialty coffee craze was in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   After observing the way farms in smaller countries supplied the
burgeoning market for specialty coffees in the United States,
Ipanema, which is half-owned by Julio Bozano, a billionaire
investor who is one of Latin America's richest people, shifted its
strategy to the cultivation of quality beans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the company won important contracts with clients in
Germany, France and Japan. Its biggest coup, though, came with a
product called ``Ipanema Bourbon,'' which the company says is made
from the same acidic beans that were favored by Brazilian coffee
barons at the turn of the century, a time when Brazil's weight in
world coffee markets was even greater than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of being wooed, Starbucks, which shunned
Brazilian coffee except for use in some of its blends, said a few
months ago that Ipanema Bourbon would be its first coffee from
Brazil sold straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear to us that here was a coffee detached from
Brazil's generic past,'' said Marc Schonland, Starbucks' vice
president for green coffee.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason it has taken so long for Brazilian producers
to tap high-end markets abroad has something to do with the way
coffee is consumed in Brazil, which has higher per-capita coffee
consumption than the United States, even though incomes are much
smaller. In recent years, Brazil has overtaken Germany as the
second-largest coffee-consuming country, leading producers to focus
more on domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazilian homes, coffee is consumed throughout the day in
small cups with copious amounts of sugar or hot milk, which
obscures the original taste. And in business meetings or social
gatherings, a handshake or a kiss on the cheek is almost always
followed by an offer of a small cup of sweetened coffee. To refuse,
even late at night, is to raise eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that coffee never developed into a luxury beverage in
Brazil is no surprise to Roberto DaMatta, a Brazilian
anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame. ``Coffee is the
comma of cultural grammar, the small, informal pleasure,'' said
DaMatta, who is planning to write an essay on the place of the
coffee break in Brazilian society.
</P>
<P>
   When Brazilians buy coffee publicly, they usually do it standing
up at a bar or restaurant counter, and they down it quickly after
adding sugar, much the way tequila is emptied from a shot glass.
Little attention is paid to the origin of coffee served in
restaurants, although the growing popularity of espresso blends and
sit-down cafes in large cities like Sao Paulo is throwing new light
on quality.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a recent study by the Brazilian Coffee Industry
Association showed that a quarter of the coffee sold in Brazil was
found to contain additives like corn, wheat or fruit rinds that
allow producers to cut costs. The outcry that ensued prompted the
association to increase the standards for the purity seal that it
grants to additive-free coffees.
</P>
<P>
   As Brazilians wake up to the allure of higher-quality coffees, a
parallel transformation is shaking the country's coffee industry.
Many farmers are migrating from southeastern Brazil to the
country's Midwest and Northeast, as a new agricultural frontier
opens on the region's highland savannas.
</P>
<P>
   There, in a vast, virtually frost-free area known in Portuguese
as the ``cerrado,'' producers are using new irrigation and
mechanized planting techniques that have resulted in the world's
highest-yielding coffee farms. In western Bahia state, the center
of the new coffee frontier, high-density planting methods allow up
to 2,000 trees to be cultivated per acre, compared with about 400
on older farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a frontier in the physical and technological meanings
of the word,'' said Leon Yallouz, a former employee of the U.S.
Agriculture Department, whose estimates of Brazil's coffee crops
are closely followed by analysts. Yallouz said that efficiency
gains could allow Brazil to produce 40 million bags of coffee a
year under optimal weather conditions _ or 50 percent more than the
26.5 million bags that some coffee analysts are forecasting for
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what impact a potential increase in
Brazilian production could have on coffee prices, since there are
so many other unpredictable factors _ like weather, politics and
ebbs in the production and consumption in the world's 60 other
coffee-producing nations. But recently consumers in the United
States got a taste of what could happen after Brazil's largest crop
in 11 years was absorbed in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Procter &AMP; Gamble said it would cut the price of its
coffee to accompany a decline in the price of raw beans. After the
company said the price of a 13-ounce can of Folgers would fall by
10 cents, to $2.20, Philip Morris followed suit with its own price
cut. Similar price cuts could occur if, as some organizations have
warned, a coffee glut results from unrestrained exports by
producing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, for example, exceeded by more than 6 million bags the
target agreed on with the Association of Coffee Exporting
Countries, which was 15 million bags for the year ending June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil's output is expected to fall in the coming year
because many trees are in an off year of a two-year production
cycle, some experts expect production to bounce back and continue
rising. With unemployment concerns riding high, and with the
economy forecast to register its second year of no growth,
authorities hope the coffee industry, which already employs more
than 3 percent of the population, will provide some relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think jobs in Brazil's coffee industry should increase as
production also increases,'' said Rubens Barbosa, Brazil's
ambassador to the United States and a former chairman of the
Association of Coffee Producing Countries.

`DOG PARK': STRAINING AT THE LEASH

   It's all very simple. When Andy and Cheryl broke up, she took
their dog, Mogley. Now Mogley is traumatized from watching Cheryl
and her new boyfriend, Trevor, having wild sex. Meanwhile, Andy
meets Lorna at a mostly empty singles bar, not knowing that she is
Trevor's old girlfriend. Andy and Cheryl take Mogley to a dog
psychologist. Lorna, who is supermodel-beautiful, inexplicably
dates a nerd she met at a video store. Andy falls into a
relationship with Keiran, a nutritionist who throws a party-a-deux
to celebrate the 50th time they've made love. Jeri and Jeff stand
by in perfect lovey-dovey couplehood, with their two boxers, while
their friends try to work out their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog Park'' was written and directed by Bruce McCulloch (who
also plays Jeff), a member of the television comedy group Kids in
the Hall, but there's no sign of the troupe's signature wit. The
character of the dog psychologist (Mark McKinney, also from Kids in
the Hall) who talks like Mister Rogers when he isn't howling is,
however, well conceived and sort of fun. Janeane Garofalo is in the
film, but she spends most of it looking and sounding mildly
disgusted at having to do this dialogue. (There is some amazingly
forced, self-conscious exposition at the beginning. Unless the
forced self-consciousness was supposed to be funny.) But she does
have the film's best line: ``Trust me. I'm a life-style editor.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, as might be expected, lots of scenes with dogs,
sometimes more than half a dozen at a time, but they don't get to
do much of anything cute. Natasha Henstridge looks gorgeous as
Lorna, whose job is playing Miss Bookworm on a children's
television show. Luke Wilson is also attractive as Andy, who works
at a magazine. But there's not an honest moment and between them
and in the end ``Dog Park'' is just listless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog Park'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes strong profanity, graphic sexual
situations and partial nudity.

ANDREOTTI IS ACQUITTED OF CONSPIRING WITH THE MAFIA TO MURDER A
JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Giulio Andreotti, a towering figure in postwar politics
who was prime minister seven times, was acquitted Friday of
conspiring with the mafia in the 1979 murder of a muckraking
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   An aide, Claudio Vitalone, a former foreign trade minister, was
also found innocent in the killing of Carmine Pecorelli. So were
four other co-defendants, some of whom have been convicted of
mob-related crimes in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is not expected to immediately quell Italy's
questions about how Andreotti's Christian Democratic Party stayed
in power for more than 50 years. Mostly, the verdict revived
soul-searching about the country's judicial system and prosecutors'
reliance on the testimony of turncoat informants.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentence was read out in a Perugia courtroom,
Andreotti, 80, who stayed in his Senate office in Rome, told
reporters, ``I knew that I was right, but it is not enough to be
right. You have to find somebody to prove it.'' He said the verdict
showed that ``the system works.''
</P>
<P>
   The wily, enigmatic former power-broker, whose now defunct party
ruled Italy throughout the Cold War, is not yet entirely in the
clear. He is currently on trial in Palermo on charges that he was
the mafia's chief political protector in Rome. But some of the
turncoat mafia bosses who testified in the Perugia trial are also
witnesses in Palermo, which could undermine the Sicilian
prosecutors' case.
</P>
<P>
   Andreotti, who was not jailed during the trial, is a lifetime
senator. In between court appearances he participated with his
customary verve in parliamentary debates on NATO expansion and
Kosovo. Friday, he attended Mass and then went to his Senate office
as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But the former prime minister remains the symbol of a byzantine
political system that finally collapsed in the early 1990s under
the weight of its own corruption. In that sense, it was Italy's
trial of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In Perugia, Andreotti was accused of having ordered the 1979
assassination of Pecorelli, a newspaper editor who had repeatedly
pried into the dirty secrets of politicians and, according to one
politician who testified under oath, at times accepted bribes to
stop publication.
</P>
<P>
   Two co-defendants, who were also found not guilty, had been
accused of carrying out the crime: Massimo Carminato, who has been
linked to right-wing terrorist groups active in the 1970s, and
Michelangelo La Barbera, who was convicted of taking part in the
1992 murder of one of Italy's most famous anti-mafia prosecutors,
Giovanni Falcone. Gaetano Badalamenti and Giuseppe Calo, both
convicted mobsters, were also acquitted of arranging the murder of
Pecorelli.
</P>
<P>
   Like the trial in Palermo, the Perugia trial, which started in
1996, relied heavily on testimony by ``pentiti,'' former mafia
members who turned informants.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McCarthy, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins
University in Bologna, said, ``The verdict is not surprising. The
prosecutors didn't have any documentation, it was all based on the
hearsay of some pretty dubious people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Italy there will also always be the suspicion that
Andreotti, the genius of the postwar regime, was too clever for
them and got away with it again,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the verdict was predictably divided, because
Andreotti so polarizes Italian society. Many right-wing politicians
hail him as the man who transformed Italy from a backward,
agricultural country into a major industrial power. For decades, he
was esteemed in the United States for skillfully maneuvering to
prevent Communists from sharing power at a time when they had 30
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Andreotti, a devout Catholic, always tried to stay in favor with
the Vatican. A prolific author of foreign policy books and memoirs,
in 1982 he published ``At Every Pope's Death: Popes I Have Known.''
In a reception line after a beatification Mass at St. Peter's last
May, Andreotti was favored with a special blessing from John Paul
II.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, the Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls
expressed ``satisfaction over a verdict that was certainly
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Italians nicknamed him ``Beelzebub.'' Conspiracy theorists
assert that he played a sinister role in not preventing the Red
Brigades' assassination of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978,
a crime that still has the kind of resonance in Italy that the
Kennedy assassination has in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Perugia prosecutors argued that Pecorelli had been killed
because he had gathered incriminating information about the
Christian Democrats related to, among other things, the Moro
kidnapping.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though Andreotti bore it with his usual poker face and sharp
tongue, the 3{-year trial, in which 226 witnesses were called, took
its toll on Andreotti, who complained that he felt betrayed by his
former political cronies in Parliament, who did nothing to prevent
his trial.
</P>
<P>
   But until he was first charged in 1993, the politician whom
foreign leaders knew as ``Mr. Italy'' seemed invulnerable, a master
of intrigue who used his cunning to keep power and avert
prosecution. He did that even though he had been investigated in
connection with dozens of political scandals, from the 1975
Lockheed bribery scandal to charges that he profited from a
military contract for Permaflex mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have accused me of being responsible for everything since
the Punic Wars,'' Andreotti commented acidly in 1995. Many charges
were dropped, others dried up because he had parliamentary immunity
from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   After a spiral of corruption cases known as Tangentopoli, or
``Bribesville,'' which in 1992 toppled the Christian Democrats _
and the Socialist Party _ parliamentary immunity became less
iron-clad.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, prosecutors in Sicily were winning big cases
against the mafia. When Andreotti was charged with conspiring with
mob bosses, a parliamentary commission ruled that the Senate could
vote to waive his immunity. Seeing political support in Rome drain
away, he waived his right to immunity and agreed to testify in both
trials.
</P>
<P>
   When the Palermo trial began, Andreotti told reporters that his
only remaining ambition is ``to live long enough to see the truth
triumph.''

UT HONORS SLAIN CIVIL RIGHTS HERO WITH STATUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The slain civil rights hero Martin Luther King
Jr. became the first African-American to be honored with a statue
Friday in the 116-year history of the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-foot bronze depiction of King in his doctoral robes, his
arm outstretched in welcome, faces the mostly black neighborhoods
of East Austin and the LBJ Library. It is believed to be only the
second statue of King on a college campus nationwide and the first
on a predominantly white one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amid all the controversial statues, we finally have one that
is a symbol of hope,'' said former student body president Marlen
Whitley, who played an instrumental role in bringing the statue to
campus.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, students of different races fought against funding
difficulties to place King on a campus once torn by segregation and
strife and also home to statues honoring Confederate leaders
Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at noon CST Friday, the monument to King was unveiled
against a backdrop of gospel music, children's voices rising in
tribute and the booming oratory of Martin Luther King III.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I've had the pleasure of attending many street
dedications and other dedications in the memory of my father, I was
particularly moved by the story behind this magnificent
sculpture,'' King told the crowd estimated at 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a story that epitomizes what the civil
rights movement was all about, it is the story of the efforts of
the students at UT to erect this statue.''
</P>
<P>
   The story began at the keyboard of student Sean Price who
suggested in a 1987 editorial in the Daily Texan newspaper that a
statue of King should be erected on campus. It was time to send a
new and more positive message to minority students who felt
intimidated by the presence of the Confederate statues, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   The idea clicked with students Becky Helton, Michael Mark and
Dave Winter, who formed a committee, passed out petitions, made
T-shirts and buttons, and even hosted a benefit concert on Sixth
Street called ``Statue Aid.'' Eventually, they were able to get the
university's approval for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1987, a group of students here at this great university had
the idea that a time had come for a statue to be erected on this
campus,'' King said. ``Like students who sat in lunch counters
throughout the South, students who worked on this project refused
to be turned around. Like the freedom riders, who rode the buses to
desegregate transportation on our nation's highways, you refused to
be turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   The three students who gave legs to Price's idea 12 years ago
were reunited as the ceremony ended and swamped by souvenir
autograph-seekers. Winter joked that it was his ``15 seconds of
fame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the statue is beautiful. I'm so happy,'' said Mark, an
assistant district attorney in Liberty, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impressed me was being thanked by someone like Martin
Luther King III. That was pretty amazing,'' said Helton.
</P>
<P>
   UT President William Faulkner hailed the statue's unveiling as a
symbol of inclusion, and pleased the crowd by announcing the UT
tower would be showered in orange light to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core purpose of our university is to transform lives for
the benefit of society,'' Faulkner said. ``In these closing days of
the millennium, I know of no other figure in the 20th century whose
life and work so embodies that purpose than Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Wilson, president of the MLK sculpture committee, said
efforts of the initial three students were bolstered five years ago
by three others who found a way to solve the funding problem. They
proposed a $1-per-semester fee over four years, and the students
overwhelmingly approved it in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day forward, the presence of the statue of Martin
Luther King Jr. will say that the University of Texas of the 21st
century is not only a university of the first class but a
university that serves and embraces all Texans,'' he said.

   HSING CHUAN CITY, Taiwan _ Waiting to be heard, about 100
protesters Friday lined up quietly near the smashed apartment
complex on Min-an Road where they lived until a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted the government to do more to help them after this
week's deadly 7.6-magnitude earthquake destroyed their homes. They
thought they found the right official to listen to them: the county
magistrate who was touring the site.
</P>
<P>
   But he left without speaking to them, and the silent, patient
group erupted in rage and tears. The shift epitomized the anger
toward government as chances grow slim of finding many more
survivors from the quake that has already killed upwards of 2,100
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sneaked out without talking to us!'' charged Bing Chang Wu.
</P>
<P>
   ``My child is sick and we have no money and nowhere to go!''
sobbed Shu Cheng Yu, her hands shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese are homeless, help is still
slow to come to remote areas, and money for victims hasn't yet
materialized. President Lee Teng-hui admitted to a lack of central
coordination and inefficient distribution of supplies when the
quake first hit.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the protesters outsider the Min-an Road building
grew agitated, the county's deputy magistrate was standing before
them, explaining in detail through a bullhorn the governments plans
to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has in many ways performed quite well, say foreign rescue
experts. No response to disaster, they say, can be perfect.
Taiwan's relief efforts were well-prepared and highly structured,
said Chuck Mills, a member of the Fairfax (Va.) Fire Rescue
Response Unit, and part of the 90-person US rescue team that came
to help Taiwan dig out survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two teams from 19 countries arrived to help Taiwan,
including units from Japan and South Korea which rescued
a &UR;  &LR; 6-year-old boy trapped for more than three days. About 300
people, most presumed dead, are still buried beneath destroyed
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   All rescue efforts and requests for supplies are being
coordinated swiftly through an emergency response center in the
capital Taipei, manned by representatives of each government
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human instinct in this kind of circumstance is to find someone
to blame, but given the scope of the event, the authorities have
done pretty well,'' said Brian Ward, director emeritus of the Asia
Disaster Preparedness Center in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 army troops arrived at the Min-an Road apartment
complex within hours after the quake, and began combing it for
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   One building in the complex lurched to a dangerous slant, while
another tumbled to the ground; 132 people survived and an estimated
45 are believed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident our deployment has been very quick,'' said
General Chung Teh Mo, the troops commander.
</P>
<P>
   Also within hours, a makeshift police unit was set up with
phones, fax machine, and laptop computer containing a register of
all the building's residents.
</P>
<P>
   Belongings painstakingly recovered by rescuers from the
building's crumbled remains _ photo albums, money, jewelry _ are
being carefully logged in a register, and then stored in the
district police headquarters, in hopes they might be returned to
their owners, or next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   With no signs of life coming from the building since soon after
the quake, authorities continued to work round-the-clock to
retrieve the 22 bodies still trapped in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   An anguished Li Shang Wu, supported by her two sisters, waited
for the bodies of her children and her husband. The partial remains
of what were thought to be her 11-year-old son and 6-year-old
daughter finally emerged. Rescuers carried charred bits of bone and
clothing in two clear plastic bags and set them before Wu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, they are my beloveds. I want to see their whole
bodies,'' she pleaded. Taiwanese and Mexican rescue teams returned
to work, boring deep into the remains of the building, and lifting
out concrete piece-by-piece to continue their search.
</P>
<P>
   Poor construction is suspected to be behind the Min-an Road
building's collapse. Steel support bars on the first two floors are
thought to have snapped. That's what led Taiwanese authorities to
arrest a contractor and an architect who worked on the building.
Also, the assets of 16 different builders involved with the
complex's construction have been frozen.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the country, another contractor was arrested,
and three others ordered not to leave Taiwan, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the damage seems associated with building faults. You
can see this in the way buildings were hit in an isolated way,''
said Robert Rojas, a US rescuer with the Miami-Dade County Fire
Rescue Department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared with the recent earthquake in Turkey, where
flimsy construction is believed to have led to the destruction of
thousands of buildings, the higher level of building standards in
Taiwan is thought to have saved countless structures from
crumbling, and causing more deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign rescuers involved in both the Turkish and Taiwanese
quakes say Taiwan had an easier time of it than Turkey. Even though
both quakes measured nearly the same on the Richter scale, the
epicenter of the Taiwan quake, unlike Turkey's, was away from major
cities.
</P>
<P>
   With a spate of three earthquakes _ Turkey, Greece, and now
Taiwan _ in just over a month, many rescuers are exhausted.
American rescuer Chuck Mills, who doesn't claim to have an answer
why there have been so many tremors of late, said only: ``I'd like
to have a little bit of a break between occurrences.''

NEW FORD-150 SVT LIGHTNING IS THE WORLD'S FASTEST PICKUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wow!
</P>
<P>
   There's no better word than that to describe the experience of
driving the 2000 Ford F-150 SVT Lightning pickup, which is probably
the fastest production-model truck in the world, and one of the
fastest vehicles I've ever driven.
</P>
<P>
   It's really a good thing I just had the Lightning for one week,
because if I had kept it much longer, I probably would have gotten
in trouble. With just light pressure on the accelerator, this baby
jumps out and starts running, and without even knowing it, you're
way beyond the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure how handy that's going to be in this country, where
the highest legal speed limit is 75 mph (just 70 here in Texas).
This is a truck that needs a place to run, and public highways just
aren't the place for it. Perhaps anyone considering purchasing the
Lightning should arrange for some regular track time at a nearby
speedway.
</P>
<P>
   SVT stands for ``special vehicle team,'' a group of Ford Motor
Co. car nuts who have been given free reign to take ordinary,
everyday vehicles and make them special _ both in appearance and
performance (but with the emphasis clearly on performance!).
</P>
<P>
   These folks have reinvented the Mustang Cobra, Contour and a
handful of other Ford vehicles, but I don't think any of those
compares to the good looks and extraordinary performance of the
Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay dearly for the right to own one. List price is
$30,895, including transportation. You can buy a base model F-150
for not much more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood is a special supercharged version of Ford's
5.4-liter Triton V-8 engine, rated at a whopping 360 horsepower and
440 foot-pounds of torque. (That's 100 horsepower more than in the
regularly aspirated 5.4-liter V-8.) This is a far cry from the
version of this engine that comes in the regular F-150. SVT
engineers added a forged steel crankshaft, forged-alloy connecting
rods and forged pistons, and lowered the compression ratio to 8.4:1
to allow addition of the Roots-type supercharger, which sits on top
of the intake system.
</P>
<P>
   That's as technical as I'm going to get; the gearheads among you
can buy one of the car-buff books for more of that stuff. What you
really need to know is that this engine, along with a four-speed
automatic transmission from the Super Duty F-series, pushes the
Lightning from zero to 60 mph in just 5.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There are some sports cars out there that can match or slightly
exceed that, but not any pickups except perhaps the 1991 GMC Sonoma
Syclone pickup. It had a 4.3-liter turbocharged V-6, and was pretty
quick.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Syclone, the F-150 Lightning is a limited-production
model and it won't be found at all Ford dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the best handling to go along with the Lightning's
speediness, the SVT engineers decided to use a regular cab,
short-bed, flare-side version of the F-150. You can get three
people in the front seat if you need to, but there is no
extended-cab version to allow you to take the kids along in the
rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Round driving lights and a special front fascia design are
peculiar to the Lightning. Our test truck, with Oxford white
clearcoat paint, came with a factory-installed soft cargo-area
cover that made the vehicle look really, really cool.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rather luxurious for a truck. The seats are
covered with a combination of textured ebony leather and
graphite-colored cloth; the door panels are ebony leather; and
there is a leather-wrapped steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's seat is the 40 percent part of a 60/40 split front
seat, but it is like a bucket seat, and it holds the driver in
place very snugly during tight turns. The driver's side has
electric controls. There is a flip-down armrest/storage bin that
can be pushed up and out of the way to allow a third person to ride
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the instrument panel, with its luminescent white-faced
gauges that turn blue-green at night with bright orange needles.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment includes dual air bags with a
passenger-side cut-off switch; a premium AM/FM stereo with
single-disc in-dash CD player; dual electric remote-control outside
mirrors, four-wheel disc brakes with three-channel antilock system;
power windows and door locks; manual air-conditioning, overhead
console with electronic compass and exterior temperature gauge;
cruise control; remote keyless entry; and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Standard are eight-inch, five-spoke, cast-aluminum wheels and
special Goodyear Eagle tires _ Z-rated for high-speed operation.
There is a solid rear axle and a 3.55:1 limited-slip rear end; the
rear suspension has five-leaf springs, and there are gas-tuned
shock absorbers all around. Up front, there are coil springs and a
solid stabilizer bar. Steering is power-assisted recirculating ball
type.
</P>
<P>
   The only options offered are the soft tonneau cover ($150),
towing package ($245) and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six-disc
remote CD changer that fits behind the passenger seat ($210).
</P>
<P>
   Our test truck came with ``The Club'' attached to the steering
wheel to prevent theft, but that's really not necessary. The
Lightning has Ford's passive anti-theft system, which uses a tiny
radio transponder built into the ignition key, set to a special
security code. It must correspond to the code stored in the truck's
engine computer; if not, the vehicle won't run. Steal it without
the proper ignition key, and the Lightning will be useless.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says the Lightning stops from 60 mph in just 137 feet,
which is 10 feet more than it takes to stop the much-lighter SVT
Mustang Cobra. Top speed is 140 mph, according to Ford. I didn't
try this.
</P>
<P>
   No fuel-economy figures were provided for the 2000 model, but
the 1999 version was rated at 14 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 24.5 gallons of gasoline.
</P>

<P>
   AT A GLANCE:
</P>
<P>
   2000 Ford F-150 SVT Lightning
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Limited-production, high-performance, full-size,
two-door, rear-drive, three- passenger, flare-side, regular-cab
pickup from Ford's Special Vehicle Team.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Back for another year with a few minor refinements
is Ford's most fun pickup ever. With its supercharged 5.4-liter
Triton V-8, the Lightning has 360 horsepower and zips from zero to

EVACUATION DRILL BOMBS WITH MUSCOVITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It may have been the most harrowing fire drill ever,
and perhaps the most outrageous. But as a move to engender public
confidence in a country shaken by a wave of deadly violence, the
former KGB's fake-explosives trick has, well, bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights ago, police investigating the basement of a high-rise
apartment building in western Russia on a tip from a resident,
found three sacks filled with what looked like explosive and a
device that looked like a timer set to go off within a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that similar devices have killed 300 people in Russia
this month, residents took little time to evacuate the 12-story
building in Ryazan.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially fatal blast had been prevented. Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Russia's security chief admitted that the whole episode
had been a drill to test citizens' vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Patrushev, head of the Russian Federal Security Service,
the domestic successor of the KGB, told residents _ most of whom
had to spend a sleepless night in a nearby movie theater _ that
agents had deliberately planted dummy explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a security training exercise,'' Patrushev said on
Russian television. ``The sacks contained only sugar. There were no
explosives inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said the deadly blasts were caused by an
explosive that resembles sugar and authorities have warned citizens
to look out for anyone carrying large bags into basements.
</P>
<P>
   Patrushev added that Ryazan had responded better than other
Russian cities where similar exercises were being held. A spokesman
for the federal police agency, Alexander Zdanovich, apologized to
the residents ``for the inconvenience and the emotional shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the building was declared safe, television showed
shaken residents afraid to return to their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators expressed outrage at the use of such a tactic in a
country already on the edge over the bombings. One lawmaker called
the incident ``monstrous.'' The Ekho Moskvy radio station quoted an
unidentified security agent as saying Russians may start believing
rumors that the police agency was behind the real bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrushev must not understand the current situation in
Russia,'' said a report in Saturday's Izvestia, which like many
newspapers, had fallen for the FSB's trick and Friday reported the
foiled bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, authorities reported they found a powerful device in the
southern city of Stavropol and safely detonated it. There was no
word on whether that one was real or not.

ASIAN NATIONS CONCERNED ABOUT ROLE IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Trying to extricate themselves from a
long-running financial crisis, Indonesia's Southeast Asian
neighbors are concerned about how long their presence will be
needed in East Timor and what their participation in the
international force will cost them, Thailand's foreign minister
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister, Surin Pitsuwan, who is in New York for the
General Assembly debate, has been meeting with U.N. officials who
are drawing up plans for future assistance to East Timor as it
moves toward independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   President B.J. Habibie has pledged to honor East Timor's vote to
end its relationship with Indonesia, but it is not clear when the
results of that referendum will be formally recognized by the
Indonesian Parliament, which assembles early next month, or whether
there will be efforts by the president's political opponents to
block the action.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has provided the deputy commander of the force now in
East Timor, Maj. Gen. Songkitti Chakkrabhat, and is likely to field
the largest contingent of troops after Australia. Songkitti was
formerly Thailand's military attache in Jakarta. He speaks some
Bahasa Indonesia, the national language, and knows Indonesian army
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, a member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, has said from the start that it would like to see troops
from neighboring countries prominent in the international force. In
addition to Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore are
also contributing to the international force, but in much smaller
numbers and often with specialists rather than soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Each country made its own decision because getting a consensus
from the association could be complicated, said Surin, who as
Thailand's foreign minister is the current chairman of the group,
known as ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly respond to the call of the international
community, of the U.N. Security Council, and of Indonesia, because
we are in the region, because we are part of the family, as
President Habibie said,'' Surin said in an interview. ``But the
parameters must be clear _ political parameter, division of
responsibility, time frame, the expense. All these have to be
defined as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Surin said that Thais, with a strong free press and many
political parties, were already asking questions about the
international force and what will follow it when the United Nations
takes over administration of East Timor until it can hold elections
and install a government. Costs of the interim force are expected
to be borne largely by Japan and Australia, but fielding military
contingents can nonetheless be a drain on national treasuries, even
with outside help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thais are asking about the uncertainties,'' Surin said. ``In a
free and open society, this is very legitimate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Next week, U.N. officials will get a chance to speak about East
Timor's future with the East Timorese independence leader, Jose
Alexandre Gusmao, who is known as Xanana. He will be in New York
next week to meet with Secretary-General Kofi Annan and others.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, a guerrilla leader who was arrested by Indonesia seven
years ago and released last month, first sought refuge in the
British Embassy in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, fearing an
attack by Indonesia gangs opposed to relinquishing the territory.
Last week he moved to Darwin, Australia, and announced that he
hoped to return soon to East Timor to set up an interim government.
</P>
<P>
   Surin, a Harvard graduate who once worked as a visiting fellow
on Capitol Hill as a legislative aide to Geraldine Ferraro, said
that Southeast Asians are also very concerned about how Indonesia
is handled by the outside world during the East Timorese
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to maintain diplomatic communications open,'' he said.
``We have to maintain the political discussion, so that we can
avoid any possible area of misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   With Indonesia at a very unstable political moment in its
history _ as its foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said here when the
Security Council was debating the introduction of the international
force _ Southeast Asians are anxious that Habibie, already facing
protests, is not further weakened, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   In talks with the Indonesians and others, Surin said, ``We have
been able to cover the sharp edges of some of the emotional issues.
We have been able to cushion the emotional impact on some who need
the cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped that the outside world would give Indonesia's
human rights commission the first chance to investigate reports of
massacres in East Timor. This body recently studied reports of
atrocities in Aceh, a perennially rebellious Indonesia province at
the northern tip of Sumatra, and issued a strong report.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has never taken part in the kind of operation now
getting under way in East Timor. Surin said that there was little
hesitation, however, when the Thai government and military were
asked by Annan to play a major role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly because of the nature of the issue,'' he said.
``All of us in the U.N. are midwives to bring this baby into the
world, so we are now responsible, each and every one of us
according to our preparedness and ability, to see that the outcome
of the August 30 consultation will be carried through.''

JUDGE ORDERS L.A. TRANSIT AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE 248 NEW BUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal district judge took a further step in
directing the operations of one of the nation's largest mass
transit operators with a bluntly worded decision late Thursday
ordering the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority to acquire 248 more buses to ease overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Terry J. Hatter Jr., gave the MTA just 30 days to buy
or lease the buses at least on a temporary basis, a drastic order
given that new buses generally take more than a year to order, and
even locating used or refurbished buses can take many months and
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the order was called for because the transit
authority had failed to live up to its promises to improve bus
service under a federal consent decree signed three years ago. That
order, administered by a court-appointed special master, was
intended to improve the system's poor bus service to black,
Hispanic and low-income residents.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also flatly rejected the MTA's arguments questioning
some of the court's legal authority to force improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The transit authority said it would hold a special board meeting
on Wednesday to determine if it would appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., which
initiated the lawsuit, expressed satisfaction with the decision,
but the MTA also took some comfort because the ruling was not even
more drastic.
</P>
<P>
   The special master had previously ordered the transit authority
to immediately acquire more than 500 buses to reduce the numbers of
people who have to stand at peak hours or are left fuming on street
corners as jammed buses pass them by.
</P>
<P>
   Under a highly unusual federal consent decree signed in 1996,
the special master had been given broad powers to effectively force
the transit authority to scale back its once huge rail construction
program and to focus instead on improving its long neglected bus
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very pleased, I'll have to say that,'' said Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke, a county supervisor and chairman of the MTA
board. ``We certainly felt it was a well-thought-out decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burke added that the judge had also sided with the transit
authority in allowing it to ease overcrowding by reallocating buses
from less traveled routes to the busiest, although this will
require negotiations with its unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be able to arrive at some means to achieve this,''
she said. ``I feel so much better that this is within reason now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision is part of one of the most dramatic shifts in
transportation strategy a major city has undergone in recent
decades. Just five years ago, the MTA had planned to spend $183
billion over 30 years to build a large network of subways and light
rail lines throughout Los Angeles County, the nation's most
populous with more than nine million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was envisioned as a way of getting commuters out of
their cars and onto public transit, cutting congestion on the
city's often choked freeways.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government began to balk at financing the
program, and many urban planning experts contended that a rail
system, in a region as decentralized as Los Angeles, could never
get enough people out of their cars. Then the lawsuit charged the
authority with discrimination by taking money away from buses to
build the rail lines, which would have connected more affluent
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the MTA entered into the consent decree in which it
was ordered to buy more buses and reduce overcrowding under a fixed
schedule. The transit authority has not met some of the deadlines,
but it has initiated a massive bus buying program; from last July 1
to next June 30 it will put 437 new buses on the road, and over the
next five years it says it expects to buy about 15 percent of all
new buses manufactured in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the rail program has been reduced to a fraction of
its former size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed when I see the old, rundown buses going down
the street,'' Ms. Burke said. ``We want to improve bus service. I
hold the position that all available resources should be used to
buy more buses.''

RUSSIAN BOMBS POUND CHECHEN CAPITAL; CIVILIANS FLEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Tens of thousands of civilians fled Chechnya's capital
Grozny as Russian warplanes Friday pounded the breakaway region's
capital and the Kremlin vowed to wipe out militants it accuses of
terrorizing Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia and Chechnya lurched towards a new full-scale war,
waves of Russian jets fired rockets at factories, oil refineries,
television stations, residential areas and a busy marketplace,
killing at least 12 civilians and wounding 40, according to reports
from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's strikes on Grozny, the heaviest since Russia's bloody
defeat in a 1994-1996 war with Chechnya, were accompanied by a
stark warning: Turn over the Islamic fighters the Kremlin accuses
Chechnya of harboring, or face massive retaliation and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will pursue the terrorists everywhere, if it is in the
airport, then in the airport,'' said Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin. ``You will forgive me, but if we catch them in the
toilet, we will rub them out in the outhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, speaking to reporters during a state visit to Kazakhstan,
denied that Russia was hitting civilian targets and called the
strikes a response to ``international terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   But reports and footage from Grozny indicate that numerous
houses and cars had been hit, along with a telephone station, and
oil storage tanks that spewed black smoke into the sky. The Russian
Interfax news agency said Su-25 strike aircraft had also bombed a
column of cars near the village of Samashki, killing at least eight
people and injuring others. The Russian bombing campaign began
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed a line of some 5,000 vehicles jamming
a road leading to the neighboring republic of Ingushetia to the
West of Chechnya. Other footage showed women weeping over a man's
body. The Chechen government reported that 300,000 had fled the
fighting and at least 12 deaths and 40 injuries in six waves of
attacks from early morning to late Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee figures were impossible to confirm independently,
but local journalist Said Asuyev insisted that the 12 people killed
Friday were not fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I can guarantee 100 percent,'' Asuyev said by telephone
from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts in Moscow expressed concern that the attacks would
provoke the rebels to retaliate with attacks on Russian cities. But
in a blunt assessment of Moscow's strategy, sources close to the
government said that this is exactly what the Kremlin wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians are sick of Chechens,'' said one source. ``This is a
provocation against the (Chechen) fighters to attack, to build
support for even harsher measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia began launching air raids against Chechnya following a
string of bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and other
Russian cities this month that have claimed more than 300 lives.
The Chechens say nearly as many civilians have died over the past
week of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government blames the blasts on Islamic militants
led by Chechen renegade commander Shamil Basayev and a Jordanian-
or Saudi-born commander who goes by the name Khattab. The two
commanders twice invaded Dagestan, the southern Russian republic
east of Chechnya, in recent weeks, saying they wanted to unite the
regions into a single Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens have denied involvement in the bombings, but most
Russian politicians, and mass media, wholly endorse the Kremlin's
view that it is time to crack down on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, popular television commentator Sergei Dorenko called
for ``carpet bombing'' of the breakaway region. Moscow newspaper
advocated using biological weapons, napalm or even tactical nuclear
weapons. So did speakers at a hearing on Chechnya in the Russian
lower house of parliament, the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia no longer intends to capitulate to the Chechens,'' said
the respected daily Kommersant Friday. ``All conversations will be
held the only way Chechnya understands, from a position of
strength. The Russain leaders have finally figured it out _ if you
give shelter to terrorists, it's up to you to face the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the bombs in Russian cities, the public outcry that
accompanied the start of the last war in Chechnya is absent so far.
Two thirds of Russia's 145 million people live in high-rise
apartments like the three buildings decimated in blasts this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, no one cares if a thousand, ten thousand or a
hundred thousand Chechens are killed, if it means the end of
terrorism in Russia,'' said the source.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin is putting high stakes on a victory. Putin, whom
President Boris N. Yeltsin has named as his successor, would see
his popularity skyrocket before presidential elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has been building up its forces along the
Chechen border, but military analysts say the army probably is too
weak to invade or sustain any serious ground conflict _ at least
for now. Russia's withdrawal from Chechnya in 1996, after tens of
thousands of people died, left the republic in control of the
rebels, although no country has recognized their claim of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian generals, many of whom believe they could have won
the last war but for the meddling of Moscow politicians, have
reportedly drawn up a plan for a full-scale invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from the US approach over Kosovo they once so
bitterly denounced, Russian military and political leaders have
been saying that Moscow will first use its superiority in the air
to soften up the Chechens. But the generals have not ruled out a
ground campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot and do not have the right to rule out any form or
means of action to fulfill the main mission of liquidating
terrorist formations on Russian territory, including their bases,''
Col. Gen. Valery Manilov told a news conference this week.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov is one of several generals said to be drawing up plans
for an invasion of Chechnya. Another, North Caucasus commander
Gennady Troshin, said expressed confidence this week that ``this
time, no political forces in Moscow will save the fighters from
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's President Aslan Maskhadov, whose residence is located
in one of the areas hit Friday, said the air strikes show ``that
Russian aviation is not doing battle with terrorists but with the
Chechen people.''
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, the rebels' military commander in the past war who is
now seen as a relative moderate in relations with Russia, appealed
to Moscow to choose negotiations rather than force. But Maskhadov
has little control over the radical fighters operating from his
territory, whom Russia blames for a wave of crime, abduction and
murder that has spread around the region.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's self-styled foreign ministry has appealed to world
parliaments and governments to ``stop the agression.'' But analysts
say that Chechnya, the site of brutal kidnappings and slayings of
Western aid workers and journalists, has squandered much of the
international sympathy its independence struggle once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Western governments, which chided Moscow for the
brutality of the last campaign, criticize Russia too harshly. For
one thing, says Anatol Lieven, analyst at the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London, what Russia is doing in
Chechnya looks too much like NATO's bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia for the West to protest too loud.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the West believes the Russian claims that the
Chechen fighters have been receiving aid from Islamic terrorist
organizations _ which means Russia and the West have the same
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says the Russians can get away with a great deal,''
Lieven said. ``Last time the Russians didn't go out to massacre
Chechens. This time the Russians would feel free to do anything.''

GORE RECEIVES THANKS FOR 1982 LIVER TRANSPLANT EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charlie Fiske knows Al Gore didn't invent the
Internet. But Fiske thinks Gore engineered something even more
valuable when their paths crossed 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 Fiske, then a financial manager at Boston University,
learned his 2-month-old daughter was dying of liver disease. He and
his wife, Marilyn, spent months finding a hospital that would
perform an organ transplant _ back then, only two in the country
did. But locating the liver itself was nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such thing as a national organ bank. For seven
months, while his daughter languished at Boston's Children's
Hospital, Fiske begged hospitals and the local media to join the
search, finally turning to Representative J. Joseph Moakley, the
South Boston Democrat, for help to tell his case on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, after a series of chilling coincidences, a
healthy infant liver appeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, unbeknown to Fiske, was Gore, then a
34-year-old congressman from Carthage, Tenn., whose office helped
prod a group of prominent pediatricians to listen to Fiske.
</P>
<P>
   Gore does not tout his role in helping save Jamie Fiske, now a
healthy 17-year-old high school senior in Bridgewater, Mass. But he
gets plenty of credit for subsequently pushing a health issue that
hardly rakes in votes _ as the first member of Congress to hold
hearings on organ transplants in 1983, and in 1984 helped pass into
law a national system to match donors with recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore was the catalyst. He put it on the national agenda,''
said Fiske, who is now a leading transplant advocate. He also runs
a hostel in Brookline, Mass. for families undergoing the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gore met with a group of organ donors and recipients to
discuss the latest hurdle in organ donations: persuading people to
let relatives know they want to donate organs when they die.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also announced a $13 million grant program for
organ-donation programs _ $937,000 of which is slated to go to the
Education Development Center and the New England Donor Bank in
Boston. And he presented the Organ Donor Leave Act, a program to
let federal employees take a month off instead of the current limit
of seven days for donating organs.
</P>
<P>
   But in a roomful of organ donors and recipients, one of the
first people Gore waved to was Fiske, 53. Today, Fiske still
flashes back to his desperation over his daughter's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing we would not have done,'' he said.
``Nothing. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiske and his wife, a teacher, knew nothing of their daughter's
disease, biliary artesia, a bacterium believed to be picked up
during pregnancy that causes an infant's liver to dissolve. All
they knew was their baby's skin had turned yellow, and her abdomen
was bloated from what they later learned was internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   When they learned Children's Hospital would not perform a liver
transplant _ and that the University of Pittsburgh had a three-week
waiting list just to be evaluated _ they flew to the University of
Minnesota, which promised to see Jamie right away. But the real
obstacle came in the months that followed in finding the organ.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a loose association of medical groups that shared
tips on available organs, there was no organized way to find a
healthy infant liver for their daughter. And organ transplants in
general were considered a risky last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Fiske called anyone he thought could help _ local newspapers,
television stations, pediatricians, the Massachusetts congressional
delegation, and then-Lieutentant Governor Thomas O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1982, Fiske heard the American Academy of
Pediatrics was meeting in New York. The meeting of prominent
physicians was going to be broadcast live on television, and Fiske
wanted to speak.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the academy dismissed Fiske's request, holding fast to
regulations that allow only medical professionals to speak. Fiske
turned to Moakley and the press. Two days later his phone rang, and
he was invited to speak before the group, without ever knowing why
the group had changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   On national television, Fiske told the doctors about his
family's crusade. Hundreds of miles away, a couple in Utah happened
to catch part of Fiske's speech. Five days later, as the wife was
driving across a local train track, a train smashed into her car,
killing their 11-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed with grief, the husband nonetheless remembered
seeing Fiske on television. He wanted his child's death not to be
in vain. His hospital in Utah called Jamie Fiske's doctors, and
within weeks the young child was given a new liver.
</P>
<P>
   Only years later did the Fiskes learn that Moakley had turned to
Gore, then chairman of a powerful House science and technology
subcommittee. A year later, when Gore held congressional hearings,
Fiske came to speak. When Gore helped write the National Organ
Transplant Act, Fiske was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't his constituents. We hadn't met him,'' he said.
``But we came to him as a family . . . And he reacted as a
parent.''

CLINTON WARNS DEMOCRATS ON ECONOMIC ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Friday said ``honest
differences'' exist between the Democrats and Republicans, and
warned Democrats worried about retaining the White House next year
not to let a ``collective amnesia'' about the economy lead to a
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a recent survey, Clinton said, ``Times have been so
good for so long the American people couldn't remember when it was
bad, and tended to give everybody good ratings on the economy _
Bush, Hoover, the whole crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 40-minute pep talk to the Democratic National
Committee, Clinton said most Americans have forgotten that
Democrats are responsible for the booming economy. And he directly
confronted polls that show voters wanting a change in the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not whether we're going to change, but what
kind of change we're going to make. And are we going to change
based on all the good things that are going on in America now, or
would we instead take a U-turn and go back to the stuff that got us
in so much trouble before the vice president and I came here?''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He told the crowd not to panic over recent national polls
showing Vice President Al Gore trailing the Republican
front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming Bush, Clinton referred to the governor's defense
policy speech on Thursday that promised large increases in defense
spending. But Clinton said those increases would not be possible
under the Republican tax cut bill that Bush supported and the
president vetoed that same day.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not explicitly promote Gore in his speech and
referred to him only as the vice president. He did not make any
references to former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, who is
challenging Gore for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his first campaign for president, Clinton said, ``In
June of 1992, you know where I was in the polls? Not behind _
third. Third. This is not a horse race; you don't collect any money
if you show. ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But then, what happened? Then the election started
for the real people....It became real. And people began to look and
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted the early start to the next presidential campaign,
reminding his audience that he did not announce for president until
October 1991. This time, however, ``I feel like I have been going
through this campaign all my life, and I'm not even running in
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the Republican leaders in Congress to work with
Democrts to hammer out a spending plan that would shore up Social
Security, Medicare and education. ``I still believe there's the
opportunity for us to work together,'' he said.

BOSTON COLLEGE OPENS PERMANENT TIP O'NEILL EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hoping to teach a new generation that politics can be
noble, as well as local, Boston College Friday unveiled an improved
and permanent exhibit in honor of its most famous alumnus, the late
House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony marked by sentiment and humor, dozens of O'Neill's
old friends and family members gathered to swap stories, reminisce
and celebrate an American original.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a penny every time I told a funny story or singled
out Tip as a great man or a dear friend, I'd be a wealthy man,''
said Representative J. Joseph Moakley, the Democrat from South
Boston, his voice choked with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tip O'Neill was always just who he was,'' said Moakley, the
keynote speaker. O'Neill was a man, as they say in North Cambridge,
whose hat always fit him. ``Never an ego. No pomp or circumstance.
Tip was Tip,'' Moakley said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the ceremony, the university awarded the speaker's
widow, Mildred ``Millie'' Ann Miller O'Neill, 85, its Joseph
Coolidge Shaw medal to honor her contributions to educational
opportunity in Cambridge and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life with Tom was a wonderful experience, and I am proud to
have shared those 50 years (he spent in politics) and see parts of
it displayed at this library,'' said Millie O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   The new exhibit, located in the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Library,
is not BC's first attempt to commemorate its distinguished son. A
replica of O'Neill's Washington office, which included the desk he
used as House speaker, was assembled after his retirement in a
nearby building that houses the John J. Burns library, where BC
keeps its special collections.
</P>
<P>
   The original location was a mistake, BC officials acknowledged.
Though the Burns library is prized by scholars, it is not generally
used by BC's undergraduate students, and has limited hours of
operation. It was closed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by O'Neill's friends, the college resolved to build a
new exhibit in the O'Neill library _ its main research facility and
``obviously the most appropriate place,'' said BC spokesman Jack
Dunn. The O'Neill library, with its stacks and carrels, is in
virtually round-the-clock use by thousands of students and
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tip O'Neill is a giant among our alumni,'' said BC Vice
President James McIntyre. ``We want our students to have a model
that they can pattern their lives on.'' Time passes swiftly,
McIntyre noted: this year's class of BC freshmen were in
kindergarten or first grade when O'Neill retired in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Now BC's students and visitors can wander, as the late speaker's
friends and family members did Friday, through a multimedia exhibit
and enjoy selections from the university's huge collection of
O'Neill's congressional papers, photographs and political
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The family's roots are sunk deep on the Heights. The speaker's
daughter Rosemary noted that in Friday's crowd were many of the 18
members of the extended O'Neill family who have attended, or are
attending, Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing displays that commemorate O'Neill's boyhood in
North Cambridge, and his days at Boston College, visitors arrive at
the heart of the new exhibit, which is built around the speaker's
desk, a mammoth piece of furniture once used by President Grover
Cleveland. It was from behind that desk that O'Neill, sleeves
rolled up and puffing on a cigar, led the Democratic resistance to
the conservative revolution of President Ronald Reagan in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   On the walls around the desk, the authentic drapes, scale model
of the USS Constitution and paintings call to mind another famous
visitor to O'Neill's office, which was decorated with Irish
mementoes and scenes from the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill took immense satisfaction when British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher made a courtesy call on the Speaker and
discovered to her dismay, as his late counsel Kirk O'Donnell once
recalled, that ``there wasn't one decoration that didn't represent
a profound irritant to the British Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at BC that O'Neill swung a saber on the fencing team,
chaired the senior year smoker for the all-important Holy Cross
football game, dated Millie, ran a close but losing race for the
Cambridge city council and was defeated in two attempts for student
office.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his pals from North Cambridge and his Boston
College classmates, O'Neill won a seat in the Massachusetts House a
few months after graduation in 1936. He spent the next 50 years in
politics, and never lost an election.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was nearly 11 p.m., and Tiffany Dubin was seated
at a vanity table on a hot-pink velvet chair in the dressing room
of her Upper East Side apartment, wearing a baby-doll nightgown.
Her day had begun with meetings at Sotheby's, where she is the head
of the fashion department, continued with an afternoon trip to
Chinatown to buy bar stools and after a quick change into a 1960s
Norman Norell dress, wound down at a business dinner at Fressen in
the meatpacking district.
</P>
<P>
   But even though her makeup had long since worn off and the flip
of her brunette bob had gone limp, Ms. Dubin seemed to be getting
her second wind. ``I'm a workaholic,'' she said perkily. ``I have
to hide it from my husband. It's a problem. I'll put him to sleep
at 11:30 and then go on the Internet to buy plexiglass display
cases for my sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sale'' is ``Cocktails,'' the latest in a series of themed
auctions of vintage clothing and kitsch accessories that have
challenged the stodgy, elitist world of Old Master paintings and
rare coins that Sotheby's and Ms. Dubin's own upper-crust
background represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making fun of that whole world _ I'm having fun with
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it's OK to say that?'' she asked, letting out a
nervous, high-pitched laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, to be held on Thursday, Sept. 30 includes 1960s Pucci
hot pants, Hugh Hefner's silk pajamas and all kinds of lounge
accessories _ corkscrews, openers, matchbooks _ more typically
found at flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin is well aware that her esthetic, as well as her
position at Sotheby's, raises eyebrows. Because her stepfather is
A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping-mall tycoon who bought Sotheby's in
1982, took it public four years later and reigns as chairman today,
her professional qualifications are often questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her stepfather must have something to do with Tiffany getting
the job,'' said Keni Valenti, an antique clothing dealer in New
York, expressing a view shared by many. ``A lot of these kids at
Sotheby's are well-to-do children who have been handed something to
make something of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Dubin, 33, shrugs off charges of nepotism and the
spoiled-rich-girl image. As a teen-ager, she started at the bottom
at Sotheby's, filling in for receptionists. In 1984, she entered
Georgetown University (where she met her future husband, Louis
Dubin, a real estate developer), but she took seven years to
complete her bachelor's degree because she took time off for
secretarial school and a job as a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to New York, she worked at Sotheby's as a personal
shopper for major clients, handling everything from phone bidding
to jewelry repairs. In 1997, after she handled the fashion end of
the sale of the estate of Martha Phillips, the owner of Martha, the
high-end Park Avenue women's clothing store, she was allowed to
create the fashion department.
</P>
<P>
   To mount her first big sale that year _ of vintage haute couture
from France _ she relied on family connections. Ms. Dubin's mother,
Judy Taubman, is a statuesque blonde and former Miss Israel who
resembles Britt Ekland and is well known at the Paris couture
houses. Ms. Dubin called on her mother's friends, couture customers
like Sao Schlumberger, Catherine Deneuve and Empress Farah of Iran
_ to consign their one-of-a-kind dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her high-society breeding, Ms. Dubin distances herself
from her mother in terms of taste. ``My mother is a safe dresser
who wears classics and doesn't experiment,'' Ms. Dubin said. ``She
has very definite ideas about what is right and what is wrong in
terms of clothes. I'm wrong. She doesn't like trendiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin may have put herself on the map by raiding the closets
of her mother's friends, but her promotion of used (even expensive
used) clothing was a detour into flea-market chic that her mother's
set would never appreciate. Her seven fashion sales to date _ given
witty titles like ``To Have and to Hold'' (for handbags) and ``Pulp
Fashion'' (for paper products) _ have exploited the recent interest
in midcentury design, attracting a much hipper crowd than normally
found at the auction house at York Avenue and 72d Street. A Dubin
sale brings out deejays, East Village clothing vendors in vintage
Nikes, downtown designers like Pixie Yates and models like Chandra
North who, between sneaking cigarettes outside the building, mingle
with suited corporate types from Hermes and the Metropolitan
Museum's Costume Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her sales are fun, inventive and sexier than most anything
else you'll see at auction,'' said Bruce Wolmer, the editor in
chief of Art and Auction magazine. ``Her sales get a range of
people, not just the traditional collectors of vintage couture but
a whole crowd of style tribes in New York.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Trendiness is what Ms. Dubin is all about. She recently sold off
an apartmentful of antiques, including a 19th-century English
commode and her Piranesi prints, to redecorate with 1960s and '70s
furniture, much of it bought on Ebay. Posing for the January cover
of Town &AMP; Country magazine, she wore a $75 vintage dress. Her
mother's response, as Ms. Dubin recounted it: ``It would be so much
better if you wore simple clothes, not those silly trendy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Mrs. Taubman was traveling in England and could not be
reached for comment, but Ms. Dubin's brother, Christopher Rounick,
confirmed that his mother is not the staunchest admirer of his
sister's taste. ``My view of my mother and sister is that growing
up, my mother instilled in my sister her fashion taste, but my
sister wanted to try out different things,'' he said. ``My mother's
style is impeccable, but modern taste isn't her era, and she's not
doing anything to understand it. I don't think my mother is wild
about my sister selling vintage clothes. She doesn't really
understand the nostalgia. She's from Israel, and `vintage' is more
an American thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin said the other day: ``My mother thinks I'm crass. She
doesn't like it. I got that from my father. It's amazing how genes
split themselves up.'' Ms. Dubin's parents divorced when she was
12; her father, Herbert Rounick, died in 1991. An owner of several
clothing companies, Rounick was the son of a Lithuanian immigrant
who peddled socks on the streets of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ms. Dubin's identification with her father, others are
not so quick to see the connection. ``Tiffany is very refined and
elegant,'' said Valenti, the antique clothing dealer, who recalled
his surprise at learning she was Rounick's daughter. ``I knew her
father, and he was a short, husky guy who smoked cigars, a real
go-getter. He was in the rag business, but I guess Tiffany is now
in the rag business, too.'' Far richer rags, however.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin's 10021 ZIP code and her ties to the pashmina pack
have certainly helped advance her career. ``What Tiffany has done,
which is brilliant, is to target her circle of well-heeled Upper
East Side girls who have fairly honed fashion sensibilities and are
sophisticated shoppers,'' said Hamish Bowles, Vogue's European
editor at large and a vintage clothing collector himself. ``She has
made vintage clothes acceptable to a certain set of people who have
been squeamish about buying old clothes.'' People like Jennifer
Creel, Milly de Cabrol, Nadja Swarovski and Marina Rust.
</P>
<P>
   That set may also have deeper pockets than the ordinary couture
collector. ``Tiffany Dubin pulls in clients that bring in bigger
bucks,'' noted Valenti, who sold a Christian Dior suit at Sotheby's
for $44,000. ``She can sell a Courreges dress for $6,000 to $7,000.
Can Doyle do that?'' He was referring to William Doyle Galleries,
the only other auction house in New York with an independent
fashion department. (Christie's includes clothing in its celebrity
and entertainment sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin's auctions are more like publicity events for In Style
magazine than high-brow sales with a roomful of silent bidders. In
December 1998, for an auction of celebrity-owned designer and
vintage handbags, Kevin Krier, a fashion show producer, helped Ms.
Dubin recruit Tom Ford of Gucci as a sponsor. The auction room was
transformed, with waiters dressed in black Gucci outfits passing
trays of fruit-flavored sodas in psychedelic colors.
</P>
<P>
   E! Entertainment Television covered the event.
</P>
<P>
   Those with more conventional expectations of an auction house
say Ms. Dubin's sales lack substance. ``Sotheby's fashion
department is all about publicity, parties, presentation and
image,'' said Linda Donahue, the director of couture and textiles
at Doyle, where fashion auctions have been held since 1983. ``We're
a whole different ball game. We're about buying the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism is that Ms. Dubin's sales, despite their high
profile, do not generate much income _ grossing less than one-half
of 1 percent of Sotheby's $2 billion revenues in 1998. Wolmer of
Art and Auction estimated that individual sales have brought in
$300,000 to $400,000. ``The events are more spectacular than the
price results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Her last show, ``Pulp Fashion,'' in May, was an out-and-out
flop: about 30 percent of the items _ 1960s paper dresses and a
duct-tape copy of the Kelly bag _ went unsold.
</P>
<P>
   But Sotheby's defends Ms. Dubin, saying that she has attracted
new customers. ``So much of what the fashion department does is to
bring in new clients and collectors,'' said David Redden, an
executive vice president. ``I would guess most of her customers are
new to Sotheby's, and they're young, too. We have to keep renewing
the collectors.'' Ms. Dubin says that she has added 6,000 new
clients to Sotheby's mailing list and that about 40 percent of them
now cross over to other sales categories, like photography and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Dubin has gradually built up the prices for
vintage fashion. The items in her first show of Paris couture three
years ago brought an average of $500 each. For ``Cocktails,'' there
are many lots estimated at more than $3,000, and Ms. Dubin expects
a profit of at least $100,000. Helene Verin, a housewares and shoe
designer, sold a pair of Norma Kamali sneakers for $1,100 at a
Dubin sale last year. ``Nobody else can get that kind of price
except her,'' said Ms. Verin, who bought the shoes in the '70s for
less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin's budget is small _ not enough to pay for her splashy
color catalogs or the sales themselves, and so she has taken the
somewhat controversial step of selling ads in the catalogs and
seeking corporate sponsors for the sales. After ``Pulp Fashion,''
she received an angry letter from a client. ``She was very
disappointed that Sotheby's was demeaning itself by relying on
advertising,'' Ms. Dubin said. ``But I said: `Great! We're another
form of retailing, so what's the difference?'''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Cocktails,'' Ms. Dubin again is pushing the boundaries of
what customers expect at Sotheby's. With the economy bubbling and
the taste for luxury sweeter than ever, the sale is a timely
acknowledgment of the role of cocktail culture in New York social
life. The sale includes a Playboy Bunny costume (estimated to sell
for $8,000 to $10,000), the first ever offered at auction, and the
proceeds for this and several other lots will benefit the Community
Research Initiative on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Christie Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy
Enterprises, was the host for a dinner to stir interest in the
auction, drawing a stylish crowd to Playboy's penthouse on Fifth
Avenue. Playmates in Bunny suits greeted guests like the junior
jet-setters Sloan Lindemann and Ghislaine Maxwell, the artists Ross
Bleckner and Tom Sachs, and Jack Kliger, the president of Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines. The entertainment featured a drag queen who
belted out a song. The decor, including a Playboy bunny ice
sculpture and fake fur runners on the tables, was pure '60s kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   The tables glowed with Lava lamps, which Barbara Cirkva, the
fashion director of Chanel in the United States, confessed she had
never seen before. But another guest recognized the lamps right
away as part and parcel of the recycled esthetic Ms. Dubin
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she has done is take the buying and selling and
collecting of vintage clothing from an obsessive, arcane club into
the wider public arena,'' said one guest, Amy Fine Collins, a
fashion writer and special correspondent for Vanity Fair. ``She has
people buying vintage clothes, boasting about wearing vintage
clothes. People used to be ashamed, or at least secretive, about
wearing these clothes. Now it's a badge of honor and chic. Tiffany
legitimated all that.''

SLUMP IN HOME SALES MAKES ECONOMISTS TAKE NOTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE BUTTERFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home sales dipped slightly in August for the second straight
month across the nation, part of a summer slump that industry
officials concede may run deeper later this year because of higher
mortgage interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The current slowdown comes amid a record year for home sales,
however, and is not expected to have a major impact on the booming
real estate market unless interest rates go even higher, officials
say. That is seen as particularily true in Massachusetts where
demand for housing continues to run high, often outstripping
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a delay in the market as opposed to a
weakening,'' said Edward Shanahan, chief executive officer of the
Greater Boston Real Estate Baord.
</P>
<P>
   August sales of single-family homes dropped 2.3 percent in
Massachusetts, compared with July of this year, according to the
Massachussetts Association of Realtors, falling from 5,288 in July
to 5,165. Home sales for both months, meanwhile, were far below
June of this year, when there was a record 5,991 single-family home
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, sales of previously owned homes fell 2.8 percent in
August to seasonally adjusted annual level of 5.2 million. That
follows a fall of 4.1 percent in July, according to the National
Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials appeared to be unconcerned by the summer
downturn, insisting it occurs every year. They say record high home
sales in the spring may have made the current dowturn seem sharper.
</P>
<P>
   But those record sales came on the heels of declining mortgage
interest rates. Recently, those rates have been rising, and are up
more than a point compared to a year ago. Nationwide, the average
rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan grew to 7.63 percent in July
from a low of 6.49 percent in October of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgage grew to 8.01 percent in August as compared with 6.99
percent in August 1998, according to industry data.
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry officials remain confident that the boom in the
Massachusetts housing market _ particularily in Greater Boston _
will continue. They note that even with the summer slump, August
sales of homes this year still ran 4.9 percent higher than August a
year ago. And last year was a record year, they add.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our point of view, the market is still performing at a
record level,'' said John Dulczewski, spokesman for the
Massachusetts Association of Realtors. He added that demand for
housing continues to exceed supply ``in most areas of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Devorah Shortsleeve, who with her husband, Robert, owns Pleasant
Realty Group, a real estate firm in Jamaica Plain, agrees. ``This
is an untraditional market,'' she said. ``No one could have
predicted the prices we're getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the drop in sales in August compared to July of
this year, the selling price of homes actually rose by 2.7 percent.
The average single-family home in Massachusetts sold for $247,811
in July. In August, that had risen to $254,415.
</P>
<P>
   The market for condominiums was similar. Sales dropped 1.3
percent in August when compared to July of this year, to 1,400
units sold. The average selling price rose 0.7 percent to $157,640.

NASA OFFICIALLY GIVES UP ON MARS ORBITER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA on Friday gave up what it acknowledged previously was a
futile search for the missing Mars Climate Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft was last heard from early Thursday as it was
maneuvering into orbit around Mars after a near 10-month journey
from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., believe a navigational error made at the facility caused
the $125 million spacecraft to soar too close to the Martian
surface and burn or break up in the planet's thin atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 24 hours, ground control teams continued to search
for a signal from the spacecraft, using a large terrestrial radio
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The effort ceased at 6 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory formed an investigative
panel, including independent experts, to look into the
circumstances surrounding the error and to recommend changes in
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   An internal JPL investigation also was initiated Thursday, and
NASA's Washington-based space science chief will impanel a third
group of independent experts next week, said space agency spokesman
Doug Isbell.
</P>
<P>
   The JPL groups will be asked to work quickly to safeguard NASA's
Mars Polar Lander, an even more complex robotic mission. Nearly
nine months into its journey from Earth, the Polar Lander is to
touch down softly at the Martian south pole Dec. 3 to dig for
evidence of ice in the subsoil.
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander's next mid-course correction maneuver is
scheduled for Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15 the Climate Orbiter executed the last of four
mid-course maneuvers since its Dec. 11 launching from Cape
Canaveral, Fla. Each of the maneuvers is intended to remove
navigational errors.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sept. 15 maneuver, the Climate Orbiter was believed to
be on a course that would take it to an altitude of 88 miles above
the Martian north pole after a 17-minute breaking maneuver,
according to a revision of the estimate Friday. That maneuver was
to slow the probe enough for the planet's gravitational forces to

<P>
   Instead, NASA believes, an error in the Climate Orbiter's
navigational computations placed the space craft on a bad course
that took it to an altitude of 35 miles, too close to the surface
to withstand destructive atmospheric forces.

<P>
   The Climate Orbiter was to spend more than two years circling
Mars like a weather satellite. It was to record changes in
temperature, wind speed, moisture and dust.
</P>
<P>
   The lost spacecraft was also to function as an orbital
communications relay between Earth and the Polar Lander mission.

<P>
   NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, which has been orbiting the Red
Planet since late 1997 will function as a back-up. Additionally,
the Polar Lander is equipped to communicate directly with
scientists on Earth.

US FARMERS MAY BE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG ON DESIGNER FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   US farmers are growing more concerned about the deep investment
many have made in genetically-altered crops, as export markets are
refusing them, and large US processors, like Archer Daniels Midland
Co., are paying extra for non-genetically modified grains.
</P>
<P>
   European demands for labeling of genetically engineered foods
only complicate matters for US farmers who have started using the
new seeds. Labeling, they fear, may scare off consumers here and
abroad, yet if they don't label they may not have access to outside
markets. This dilemma comes at a time when farmers are selling
bumper crops at below production costs and facing one of the worst
profit crunches since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a consultant on farm issues, Charles Benbrook, said a
key USDA official told him that the federal government has decided
to develop a government labeling proposal before the World Trade
Organization meeting at the end of November in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a meeting earlier this week involving USDA, EPA and
FDA where there was a decision that the government will proceed as
fast as possible in developing a labeling policy that will
hopefully meet the demands of the marketplace,'' Benbrook, a
consultant for Consumers Union and the Institute for Agriculture
and Trade Policy, told reporters at a news conference in Washington
organized to air farmers' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But USDA spokesman Andy Solomon said that simply was not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no such decision, and US policy has not
changed,'' Solomon said. He said Secretary of Agriculture Dan
Glickman has discussed looking into volunteer labeling for
continued access to export markets.
</P>
<P>
   Archers Daniel Midland Co. (ADM), one of the largest
agricultural processors, is currently paying an extra 8 to 10 cents
per bushel of corn grown that is both grown from non-genetically
altered seeds and stored in elevators with good access to river
barges, for easier segregation and transportion purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing to understand is if we have a customer willing
to pay for non-genetically altered grains, there will be more
premimums,'' said Karla Miller, spokeswoman for ADM.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, ADM informed grain suppliers they should segregate
non-genetically enhanced crops because, even though ADM ``remains
supportive of the science and safety of both biotech development
and traditional plant breeding methods to improve crops,'' its
business is ``driven by the consumer's desire to have choices.''
The customers are from Europe and Japan, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, ADM has also teamed up with Du Pont, owner of a
major gene-seed subsidiary, to pay contracted farmers an extra 18
cents per bushel for soybeans made from one of Du Pont's
non-genetically engineered seed strains.
</P>
<P>
   With companies like ADM now paying more money for crops from
regular seeds, farmers feel as though they have been taken for a
ride by these big agricultural companies since they have had to pay
more money for the new herbicide and pest-resistant seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are no different from consumers because they are
consumers,'' said Bill Christison, president of the National Family
Farm Coalition and owner of a 2,000-acre farm in north-central
Missouri. In addition, some farmers who embraced the new seeds with
the thought of heartier crops have seen reduced yields.
</P>
<P>
   Family farmers, in particular, say they are hurt by the fast
consolidation of seed companies with food processing companies,
since only a few companies now ``control the food system, from the
biotech seed to the pork chop that you eat,'' said University of
Missouri rural sociologist William Heffernan.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McGuire, board member of the American Corn Growers
Association, said, ``Congress should assure that (premiums for
crops that have not been genetically altered) are not allowed and
they should hold the genetics and seed companies liable for any
added testing or segregating costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers will definitely buy less of these type of seeds for
next spring,'' Christison said.

`SNOOPS' GOES UP AGAINST `JACK &AMP; JILL' ON SUNDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First time I watched ``Snoops,'' I wasn't impressed. Second
time, I decided it would probably be my guilty pleasure for the
1999-2000 TV season. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's a different sort of David E. Kelley series. No
heavy sociological messages here, a la ``The Practice,'' ``Chicago
Hope'' or even ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Snoops'' is fluff, but well-made, watchable fluff, and smart
Sunday-night counterprogramming to ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to indulging his passion for beautiful women (Gina
Gershon, Paula Jai Parker and Paula Marshall), Kelley the wonder
producer injects ``Snoops'' with more of the sound track of his
youth (heavy on Motown oldies), as well as his love of hockey
(Gershon's character is named for Hall of Fame goalie Glenn Hall).
</P>
<P>
   Gershon, Parker and Marshall are three-fourths of a private
investigation firm that bends rules to win cases. (Danny Nucci is
the fourth fourth.) As Hall explains to Marshall's character, Dana
Plant, when she is still considering joining the firm: ``We bug
people, we break into their houses, we steal Social Security
numbers. We're not the police. We have more in common with
criminals. We just have better intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they do it with high style, cool gadgetry and _ truth
be told _ sex appeal, allowing us the opportunity to look the other
way when they hack into a government database for some crucial
piece of information but still like them.
</P>
<P>
   Such antiheroic behavior has worked well for Kelley with ``The
Practice'' on Sunday nights. As the new 9 o'clock lead-in,
``Snoops'' may benefit from the same suggestion that most good
people are still flawed, and it could give ABC a new Sunday
franchise that offers a distinct and welcome alternative to the
frequently tiresome Sunday night movies on CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Over at The WB, the counterprogrammers have placed ``Jack &AMP;
Jill'' in the 9 o'clock slot on Sundays, hoping to create a
compatible relationship-saga mate for ``Felicity,'' which moves to
Sundays at 8 for its second season, starting tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But where ``Felicity'' started off last year with the polish of
a big-budget film, ``Jack &AMP; Jill'' is a rough-hewn work in
progress. Amanda Peet plays Jacqueline ``Jack'' Barrett, who
discovers on her wedding day that her fiance is sleeping with the
maid of honor. Ivan Sergei plays David ``Jill'' Jillefsky, whose
girlfriend seems perfect until ... until he meets Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Things are further complicated when Jack ends up working with
Jill's girlfriend, but do we care? Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Snoops. Hourlong comedy/drama about a California detective
agency that doesn't do things by the book. Starring Gina Gershon,
Paula Marshall, Paula Jai Parker, Danny Nucci, and Edward Kerr.
Season premiere Sunday night on ABC. Parental guideline rating:

EX-PRESIDENT STANDS TALL FOR A VIEW OF WOODS, GARCIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ A man in his mid-70s tried desperately to
watch Tiger Woods putt on the 14th green. He had arrived well after
the gallery and struggled to find a good viewing spot, standing on
his tiptoes in an attempt to see over the crowd that stretched six
rows deep and encircled the putting surface. He looked at his wife
with a face full of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment Friday morning, President George Bush
understood the difficulty of following a match featuring Tiger
Woods and Sergio Garcia. Before he found his way inside the ropes,
Bush stood on the fringes of a crowd that appeared to account for
more than a third of the estimated 30,000 in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   With play taking place on only four holes at once, fans jockeyed
for position as the two phenoms toured the course. And for those
who arrived unaccompanied by Secret Service agents, the experience
was either enjoyable or annoying. It all depended on perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty difficult to find a good vantage point,'' said
John Davis of San Francisco. ``Honestly, I think the best place to
watch is on your couch in your living room, where you can see the
holes unfold. We've just tried to find a couple of spots on the
course where we can watch. The crowds are too big. If you're trying
to follow, you're always playing catch-up. It's hard to find a
place where you can actually see anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators committed to keeping up with Woods and Garcia
employed different strategies. On the 13th hole, a group of eight
daring fans climbed a shaky tree to get a better view of the green.
If tree limbs were unavailable, a nearby boulder filled in. Some
skipped every other hole, preferring to hit the even tees, where
they could watch the headliners' long drives.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans resorted to holding periscopes, which sold for $58 in
the Ryder Cup golf shop. Around most greens, the mirrored devices
formed a miniature forest, allowing fans to stand a good distance
away and feel like they were in the front row. Unless you waited
for hours in a particular spot or held a periscope, views of the
greens and fairways were obstructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd's taking nothing away from it,'' said William Kea of
Wayland. ``It just adds to the excitement. You can feel the
excitement today. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a mix of complaints and enthusiastic responses regarding
the crowds cheering for Woods and Garcia, there was no debate that
watching the match live had its moments. On the 10th hole, just
before Woods and Garcia teed off, a piece of white paper floated
onto the fairway. Many gasped at what they presumed was a 350-yard
drive by Woods, then laughed when they realized the error. Two
minutes later, the crowd gasped again when Woods's drive fell just
25 yards short of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you come for,'' said Fran Polom, after the lengthy
drive landed. ``You don't see that stuff on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Jesper Parnevik's decisive putt dropped on the 17th
hole, most spectators were stuck listening to radio broadcasts of
the match and watching the Jumbotron alongside the 18th fairway.

`FREAKS' HAS HEART, SOUL AND BRAINS: CAN IT SURVIVE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often, a show will fail because it has no soul. It might have
the cleverest hook, the hottest cast and drop-dead writing, but if
it can't draw inspiration from someplace far beyond the printed
page, it may very well be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks,'' on the other hand, may fail because it has
no hope of drawing viewers to a crummy Saturday night time slot.
But don't ever suggest it lacks soul. Or heart. Or brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks'' is that wonderful rarity among television
series, a show that simultaneously lampoons reality and embraces
it. Harking back to 1980 and a suburban high school in Michigan, it
follows sophomore Lindsay Weir and her freshman brother, Sam, as
they negotiate the obstacle course of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gentler time, when a bully might say to his prey,
``You're dead, man!'' and not mean it literally. But the class
distinctions that most of us remember from high school, no matter
the year, are as sharp as ever in the hands of creator/writer Paul
Feig.
</P>
<P>
   Feig obviously doesn't see high school through the same lens as
folks at, say, The WB, whose teen-oriented shows are replete with
statuesque girls and chiseled guys. The kids on ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks''
look absolutely normal. Not ugly, mind you, but just like somebody
you probably went to school with.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, played with delicate sensitivity by Linda Cardellini,
is a smart girl who has taken to hanging with the loser fringe
since her grandmother died. Convinced that her grandma went to an
uncertain reward, Lindsay is questioning the merits of investing
time and effort into academic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Consorting with the slacker freaks, frequenting the school's
smoking pavilion and wearing her father's old army jacket are
outward manifestations of her disaffection. But rebellion can't
darken Lindsay's good heart. It only stokes the compassionate fire,
which forms the core of ``Freaks and Geeks.'' Lindsay is a good kid
with good intentions, and if ``Freaks and Geeks'' is starting to
sound sort of sweet, well, it is. But still very real.
</P>
<P>
   Take Lindsay's brother, Sam. Definite geek. A prepubescent one,
at that. As a tiny freshman subject to frequent bullying, he's not
sure which is worse: being terrorized by an upperclass thug or
having his big sister save his bacon.
</P>
<P>
   John Daley makes Sam the quintessential everyguy, who knows he's
above fighting but might not be able to avoid it, and who likes the
cute cheerleader but may be too nervous to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite parental figures that seem to be cardboard cutouts,
``Freaks and Geeks'' is often funny and always familiar. Best of
all, it manages to explore the folly of cliquishness without
sledgehammer didacticism.
</P>
<P>
   What a pleasure, and what a good show!
</P>
<P>
   Freaks and Geeks. One-hour comedy/drama about high school life,
circa 1980. Starring Linda Cardellini, John Daley, Samm Levine,

STOCKS REBOUND BUT INVESTORS HAVE THE JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a volatile day of trading, which saw all the
major indexes down sharply during the day, stocks rebounded Friday
and finished off slightly. But while the market held together after
a big selloff Thursday, a host of concerns, including higher
interest rates, a weaker dollar and overvalued technology stocks,
will continue to trouble investors.
</P>
<P>
   The declines for the week left the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of
500 stocks just a fraction from a 10 percent decline since its July
16 high and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average off 9.2 percent
from its high. The technology-heavy NASDAQ is 5.1 percent below its
September high, but that is after a 13 percent decline from July 17
to Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Where the market goes from here is difficult to say but
investors have many reasons to be jittery. The Federal Reserve
could raise interest rates for a third time since June when
policy-makers meet Oct. 5. The rebound of the economies in Asia and
Europe are making those markets more attractive, which could drag
investors away from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of foreign investors back into Japan is the main reason
for the dollar's dramatic slump against the Japanese yen over the
last 10 weeks. Although the dollar is off 15 percent against the
yen, it is not significantly weaker against the world's other major
currencies. But a continued slide against the yen could still help
pull stocks lower as Americans fear a flight of Japanese investors
back home.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called confessional season on earnings is also under way
and more negative announcements about missing earnings estimates
could rattle the market in the current environment even though
earnings growth for the third quarter is expected to be strong.
Apple Computer and FDX Corp. are among the major companies to issue
recent warnings.n
</P>
<P>
   But this wave of concern has not reigned all the exuberance that
had sent stocks so high. Another new issue of an Internet stock
took off Friday as shares in Alteon Websystems jumped from their
initial offering price of $19 a share to $74 15/16. Several other
IPOs also did well Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished at 10,279.33, down 39.26 points or 0.4 percent,
after falling as much as 131 points in the afternoon. The S&AMP;P 500
dropped as much as 16 points before ending down 3.05 points, or 0.2
percent, at 1,277.36. The NASDAQ composite index fell 9.42 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 2,740.41. It was down as much as 65 points.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow was down 524 points, or 4.9 percent, its
worst weekly performance in a year. It is now 1,046.71 points below
its all-time high, reached Aug. 25. This week it also broke through
the bottom of the trading range it had been in since mid-May. Now
the Dow is back to where it was on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the Dow is still up 12 percent and the NASDAQ 25
percent. But the S&AMP;P is now up only 3.9 percent, which if held
would be the poorest annual performance since 1994. The poorer
performance of the S&AMP;P, which is a broader index than the other
two, reflects how this year's rally has been concentrated in a few
technology and other big name and big company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood
Walker in Baltimore, said the market was in a valuation correction,
a decline that occurs when stock prices far outstrip their promised
earnings. He does not think that the bottom has been hit yet. But
he said ``we are a lot closer to it than some people might think.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures that the market will have gotten back on a more
secure footing when more than 50 percent of the stocks in the S&AMP;P
500 index have declined 10 percent or more from their 52-week
highs. As of Friday, 43.6 percent of the S&AMP;P 500 was in that
category. Another sign that stock valuations were back in
attractive ranges would be 20 percent of the S&AMP;P 500 stocks down 30
percent or more from their 52-week highs. Just over 10 percent of
the S&AMP;P are in that category now.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the recent decline, Cripps said, is that he
thinks the Federal Reserve is much less likely now to raise its
interest rate target a third time. ``The fact that the stock market
has cooled off takes away a reason to act,'' he said. Fed officials
have said repeatedly that the rally in the stock market this year
has helped fuel the consumer spending that is keeping the economy
growing at a pace that is faster than the policy-makers would like.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This week's stock selling has given a lift to the bond market,
pushing the yield on the 30-year bond below 6 percent again.
Friday, as more investors chose the relative safety of bonds, the
price of the 30-year bond rose 9/32 to 102 7/32. The yield, which
moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.96 percent, down from
5.98 percent Thursday. The yield on the 30-year bond yield has
crossed the 6 percent level more than a dozen times since June.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed
interest rate moves, was unchanged as the yield remained at 5.53
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen for the
first time in five trading days. The small rally came despite
comments from Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers on Thursday that
seemed to rule out any effort by the United States to help support
the dollar against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar inched up to 104.17 yen from 103.95 on Thursday. The
euro, the new 11-country European currency, rose slightly against
the dollar, finishing at $1.0464 from $1.0440 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But currency analysts expect the decline in the dollar against
the yen to resume because the Bank of Japan has apparently decided
not to move to slow the Japanese currency's rally even though it
could be a threat to Japan's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, stocks fell Friday with the Nikkei index of 225 stocks
dropping 454.03, or 2.6 percent, to 16,871.73. In the last two
trading days the benchmark stock index has fallen 5.9 percent.
After a rise of 33.9 percent this year, this selling could be a
signal by some investors that they are worried that the
strengthening yen cold trip up the emerging economic recovery in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co., Intel Corp., MCI WorldCom and Pfizer lead the
market lower. And it took most of the day for the technology sector
to shed the hangover from Thursday, when Steven Ballmer,
Microsoft's president, set off a rapid afternoon selloff when he
said technology stocks were absurdly overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   A $3 jump in IBM, which fell 3 3/16 on Thursday, helped the Dow
rebound from its lows. Internet stocks and other technology stocks
also rallied. Amazon and Ebay were both up after falling on
Thursday. Microsoft, which fell as much as 2 5/16 during the day,
finished down just 1/4.

ABOUT THAT LAND-RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 26, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have lost a dozen friends and colleagues to the Internet in
the last few years. I think of them as having gone over the
mountains, to California. Now the children of friends are leaving
with some frequency for the Web. When they describe their plans, I
am reminded of of the Oklahoma land rush.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these leavers I will encounter again, someday,
somewhere. Often the distances are only virtual. In some cases we
still live in the same town. But the gulf between their world and
mine is great, even though I am a frequent visitor to California.
</P>
<P>
   I derive much comfort from images of the California Gold Rush
and the Oklahoma land rush, because they remind me that the place
where I live isn't going to disappear just because a land rush is
taking place in another part of the economy. The landscape will
slowly change, of course, in certain predictable ways. But it will
remain, recognizably _ the Landscape.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Massachusetts was old and rich when most Californians
still spoke Spanish and Chicago was a swamp behind a dune. Even
though the rest of the country has grown enormously, Massachusetts
is still old and rich and those who live here now are not much
worse off than the ones who went. It is just small: There are only
some 5.5 million citizens in the Boston/Worcester/Lawrence area,
compared to 8 million in metropolitan Chicago and 32.7 million in
the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   The ``map'' that professionals use to gauge the shape and
significance of events on financial terrain is a comparatively
recent innovation known as the capital asset pricing model. Before
that, money managers relied on various yardsticks and, before that,
the seats of their pants.
</P>
<P>
   CAPMs come in all shapes and sizes. They frame allocation
decisions for portfolios simple and complex _ from common stocks
alone to portfolios containing stocks, bonds, currencies, real
estate, collectibles, and every other conceivable asset; to choices
that are even more fundamental (intuitively, at least) among
instruments of work and love.
</P>
<P>
   The now-fading craze for technology stocks took off after
professional portfolio managers began including Internet stocks in
their asset allocation decisions a couple of years ago. A series of
assumptions and, presto! Practically overnight, the economy
developed a new Internet sector.
</P>
<P>
   The sector will grow until the assumptions are revised and then,
Whammo! The new sector will shrink. Gradually it will find its
proper place. The difference between a CAPM and the map of the
United States is that markets fluctuate while continents drift only
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   There is no corresponding map to guide the allocation of media
attention, though there probably should be. Instead there are
history books. One of my favorites, ``Enterprise: The Dynamic
Economy of a Free People'' by Stuart Bruchey, describes three
distinct technological and geographic frontiers that were settled
in the wake of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and silver in California and Nevada were the first
frontier. (Copper, lead, zinc and other deposits led to the opening
of new territories from Wisconsin to Arizona, too.) Fewer than
1,000 people lived in San Francisco in 1848, the year that gold was
discovered at Sutter's Mill; in 1860 the city's population was
56,802 and in 1868, 133,000.
</P>
<P>
   The second was the cattlemen's frontier _ the Cattle Kingdom, as
it came to be known. Stretching up the Great Plains from Texas to
Kansas and southern Illinois, then west to New Mexico, Colorado,
Wyoming, and Montana, the cattle industry made innumerable
fortunes, populated a dozen states west of the Mississippi, and
displaced 11 Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The third frontier was agriculture, and the manufacturing
revolution that accompanied its spread. During the 1870s, so-called
Bonanza Farms of 1,000 acres or so spread along the railroads in
the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota _ wonders of
large-scale integration not found anywhere else in the world but
the Central Valley of California. Such large-scale interprise
fueled the growth of the farm machinery industry and the rise of
the Chicago markets.
</P>
<P>
   Each boom produced its legends, and its share of ghost-towns,
too _ played-out mining camps, drought-plagued farms, and bankrupt
English and Scottish investors. Massachusets, which had enjoyed its
boom in textiles half a century before, sagged, too, after 1900.
But its cities didn't turn into ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   So what of the Internet? Partly it is a distibution system.
parallel to rails, highways, airways. Partly it is a communication
system, parallel to the post office, telegraph, telephone, radio,
and television.
</P>
<P>
   It embodies novel features, too. David Roddy, chief
telecommunications economist for Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting, says
that the Web is rapidly becoming a transactions system, threatening
banks as well as retail establishments, and giving rise to new
intermediaries in markets for ``trust'' _ guarantors of privacy and
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet surely will reconfigure the landscape, just as
trains, roads, and airplanes did in their day. There will still be
50 states. There will still be ten categories in the Standard
Industrial Classification Code. There will still be maufacturers,
of cars, trains, planes and every other kind of hard good that a
modern industrial nation needs to function. But there will be any
number of new industries that didn't exist before, too, jockeying
for position.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is the distribution of power, and not just the
slow drift of the center of population to the West. The decisive
event of the 19th century came early: the opening of the Erie
Canal.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Boston and Philadelphia had vied with New York to
be the nation's leading metropolis. Each had its peculiar ways. But
with the two-way opening of the huge interior market of up-state
New York (and the Great Lakes beyond) to ocean trade, New York
surged ahead and never looked back. It quickly became the capital
of the American empire. The junction of the transcontinental
railroads with the Great Lakes and Mississipi watershed gave
Chicago a similar prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Something of the sort may be in the works with California,
thanks to the new developments in technology. It is a commonplace
that a Web doesn't have a center. Yet the money and influence now
flowing to the Bay Area _ and to Seattle to the north _ seem likely
to confer a mantle of leadership that the West has never enjoyed
before.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the rush of talent to the Internet probably more
nearly resembles the migration that took place in the years after
World War II than any other. That was a goldrush that put
Washington, D.C. preeminently on the map. And though it, too, led
to a concentration of power, it left the rest of the Landscape
substantially unchanged.

   I'll Take a Double Latte And a Personal Loan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call South Umpqua Bank a store or a computer cafe, says Raymond
P. Davis, but please do not call it a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, chief executive of South Umpqua, based in Roseburg, Ore.,
said he doesn't want his bank's 15 branches to be ``prisons'' like
most banks; he wants his customers to kick back and relax.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, South Umpqua offers fresh-brewed coffee, sofas and
chairs, background music, a rack of magazines and newspapers, a
big-screen TV (usually tuned to a financial news channel) and
computer terminals for trading stocks over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is also gadgetry that lets customers learn about the
bank's offerings or even buy postage stamps. ``We're retailers,''
Davis said. ``We're a store where you buy things, only we sell bank
products and services, not Levis.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank-cum-cafe idea came from Charlene Stern, president of
Stern Marketing Group in Berkeley, Calif., who calls most banks
shortsighted for sending off their customers to automated teller
machines and discouraging visits to branches. Those banks reduce
costs but lose an opportunity to cross-sell, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the come-in-and-browse approach was a big reason that
South Umpqua's earnings have been growing 20 percent annually. Its
customers use an average of 2.5 of the bank's products _ checking
accounts, personal loans and so on _ compared with 1.2 for average
American bank customer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Locals in Roseburg, a logging town not yet blessed with a
Starbucks outlet, seem to like the kaffeeklatsch atmosphere. Joy
Marie Yeo, a patient advocate at a local hospital, said that the
last time she was in the bank, she schmoozed over coffee with her
dentist and his wife. While there, she made a mental note of the
automated loan machine in the bank. ``I've got a daughter who may
be going to medical school,'' she said.

COURT RULES MCDERMOTT MUST STAND TRIAL IN LEAKED TAPE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jim McDermott must face trial in a civil suit
over allegations that he leaked an illegally recorded cellular
phone call to newspaper reporters, a federal appeals court ruled
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the three-judge panel split 2-1 against the Seattle
Democrat, all three judges were harshly critical of McDermott for
his alleged role in providing three newspapers with a tape of a
telephone call among House Republican leaders. McDermott at the
time of the incident was the top Democrat on the House Ethics
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A public official charged with the oversight of the ethics of
his colleagues willfully dealt with felons and knowingly received
unlawfully obtained evidence on the chance that he might be able to
use something contained therein to embarrass one of the colleagues
whose ethics he was charged with policing,'' wrote Judge David
Sentelle, who, ironically, was the only judge on the panel who
voted to toss out the case against McDermott on free speech
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an incident on Dec. 21, 1996, in which Rep. John
Boehner, R-Ohio, then the chairman of the House Republican
Conference, participated in a conversation among GOP leaders,
including then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, by cellular telephone from
the parking lot of a Florida waffle house. A Florida couple active
in Democratic politics picked up the conversation on a police
scanner, taped it, and provided the tape to McDermott at the
recommendation of their own congresswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was of interest because the Republicans were
discussing their strategy for handling an expected Ethics Committee
announcement that Gingrich would pay a fine and accept a reprimand
for his allegedly unethical conduct. Democrats believed that the
conversation itself violated an agreement Gingrich had made with
the Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day after McDermott received the tape, stories about
it, including a partial transcript in one case, appeared in three
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida couple who taped the call pleaded guilty to
violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and paid a
fine. McDermott has consistently refused to say what role he played
in providing the tape to newspapers. That will be the issue at
trial, and is also the subject of a long-running Justice Department
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner, frustrated that the Justice Department investigation
seems to have fizzled, sued McDermott. It was that lawsuit that was
dismissed by U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan and was reinstated by
the appellate panel yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan had ruled that McDermott's alleged action in providing the
tape to newspapers was protected by the First Amendment, just as a
newspaper would be protected for publishing the contents of the
tape.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panels majority, made up of Judges Douglas
Ginsburg and Raymond Randolph, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``McDermott's behavior in turning over the tapes doubtless
conveyed a message, expressing something about him. All behavior
does. But not all behavior comes within the First Amendment,''
Randolph wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In receiving the tape, McDermott took part in an illegal
transaction,'' Randolph wrote. ``If he did not thereby break the
law, he was at least skirting the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentelle, the dissenter, said McDermott's conduct is protected
by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see how we can draw a line today that would punish
McDermott and not hold liable for sanctions every newspaper, every
radio station, every broadcasting network that obtained the same
information from McDermott's releases and published it again,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott must now decide whether to appeal to the decision to
the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit, or to appear for trail before Hogan. All three judges on
the panel were appointed by Republican presidents, and McDermott
could try to find a more sympathetic audience either on the full
court of appeals, or, failing that, at the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, through a spokesman, would say only that he was
disappointed and now plans to consult with his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who was the owner of the
intercepted cell phone and who brought the lawsuit against
McDermott, was delighted, saying ``I am gratified that the Court
agreed to uphold the constitutionality of our laws that protect
U.S. citizens from invasions of their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner is seeking $10,000, plus possible punative damages, plus
attorneys' fees.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Near the end of one of his last days as Mexico
City Mayor, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano was in his office,
reviewing a dismal newspaper poll that showed that far more city
residents disapproved of his City Hall performance than approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Leaving, Rejected!'' said the headline that announced the
poll.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas, who is to step down next week to run for
president, was undaunted and cheerful. Tongue in cheek, he
suggested that his low rating might translate into a healthy lead
in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is stupendous!'' he said, cackling.
</P>
<P>
   That was a far-fetched reading of the poll. But it underlined
the confidence that he brings to his third uphill presidential run
as the standard-bearer of the left.
</P>
<P>
   National surveys show that Cardenas will enter the campaign in a
distant third place, so far behind that were he not the son of a
popular revolutionary president, the equivalent of a Mexican
prince, his candidacy would approach irrelevancy.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview this week, Cardenas argued that his chances
for winning had improved since 1988, the year when, many Mexicans
believe, the authorities defrauded him of victory, and since 1994,
when he was barred from television in his second campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions have changed,'' Cardenas said. ``Now we can get on
television. Now there are significant government funds available
for our campaign. Before they were tiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the regime will use all of its resources to stay in
power. You'd have to be ingenuous to see it any other way.
Conditions are not ideal. But they're better.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a risk this time around, however. Cardenas could
besmirch his place in history by playing the spoiler, because he is
highly likely to draw millions of votes from the leading opposition
candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada of the center-right National Action
Party. That could help President Ernesto Zedillo's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, win its 12th consecutive
presidential victory.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians who represent Cardenas, five small parties and Fox
have been negotiating for four months to avoid that by forging a
coalition that could run a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But time is running out. Fox and his allies were considering a
last-minute proposal that would outline a new methodology for
mounting an opposition primary election.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who is far ahead in the polls, has rejected similar
proposals before. Cardenas has shown no flexibility either, partly
because he and Fox disagree profoundly on many issues. Cardenas'
father nationalized the petroleum industry, creating the
state-owned oil company, Pemex. Fox has suggested that Pemex should
be privatized.
</P>
<P>
   Personal contrasts have also caused friction. Cardenas is an
urban intellectual in the erudite, often haughty tradition of the
Mexican left. Fox is an earthy former governor of Guanajuato who
wears cowboy boots and campaigns as a free-marketeer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas is so ineffective he couldn't get a dog out of the
back pasture,'' Fox said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox is a man who has nothing between his two ears,'' Cardenas
shot back.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview he again derided Fox, who often compares PRI
authorities to snakes and scorpions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox has no program,'' Cardenas said, cracking another smile.
``He's said he's going to use his cowboy boots to kill black
snakes, spiders, scorpions and I don't know what all. But I don't
know of a single proposal about economic or agricultural policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' smiles bear mention, because his trademark is a scowl.
For years after the disputed 1988 elections, he and his followers
wore frowns, partly because PRI authorities treated them roughly
and sometimes violently as they built their Party of the Democratic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said Cardenas should be scowling now. His tenure
as mayor, during which daily government-controlled television
newscasts have blamed him for everything like street muggings and
traffic jams, has exhausted his political capital, said Alfonso
Zarate, editor of a political newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas lost by winning'' his landslide election victory in
1997 that installed him in City Hall, Zarate said in an interview.
``The most consistent personality of Mexico's democratic transition
is now heading toward a cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas disagreed, saying, ``We've demonstrated that in
Mexico you can govern honorably, in a new way, with less arrogance,
in closer contact with the people. And we've shown that you can get
things done.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent nationwide door-to-door poll by the Mexico City
newspaper Reforma showed that if the elections had been held late
last month, either of the two most likely PRI presidential
candidates would have received 35 percent of votes, Fox would have
received 27 percent, and Cardenas 15 percent. Cardenas dismissed
such hypothetical situations as meaningless nine months before the
elections, which will be on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even begun to campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo appears to be improving the opposition's chances by
using his influence to insure a victory in the PRI primary on Nov.
7 by former Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas said: ``Labastida can't even heat up his own house. He
doesn't get anybody excited. We'll put together a majority, if we
write a good program and organize my kind of 24-hour-a-day campaign
that's really out there with the people. We can win this.''

`SIMON SEZ': HIS JUMP SHOT LACKED CREDIBILITY, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of the review) 
(HLW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When did Interpol start hiring sideshow freaks?'' a character
asks early in ``Simon Sez.''
</P>
<P>
   When, indeed?
</P>
<P>
   But movies and real life are two different things, and ``Simon
Sez'' is a star vehicle for none other than Dennis Rodman, the
trash-talking, body-piercing former Peck's bad boy of the National
Basketball Association. So perhaps moviegoers can buy into the idea
of a 6-foot-8-inch black man with blond hair, earrings, nose rings
and an assortment of conspicuous tattoos as some kind of
inconspicuous lawman.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he does live in a villa on the French Riviera and ride a
bright yellow motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rodman is inescapably watchable, ``Simon Sez,''
directed by Kevin Elders from a screenplay by Andrew Miller and
Andrew Lowery, adds up to a minor league action adventure film. Its
plot seems as if it had been fished out of the wastebaskets of
writers who have written scores of better examples of the genre
dating at least as far back as ``Dr. No'' in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The plot deals with the efforts of Rodman, as an Interpol agent
named Simon, to foil the efforts of an overrefined villain, Ashton
(Jerome Pradon), to line his pockets by wreaking destruction with
weaponry bought from a corrupt colonel and guided by software
created by an American magnate whose nubile daughter, Claire
(Natalia Cigliuti), is being kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Taking part in the action from time to time are Nick (Dane
Cook), an inept former CIA classmate of Simon's; The Dancer (Emma
Sjoberg), apparently Simon's ex-wife; and a couple of comic monks,
Macro (John Pinette) and Micro (Ricky Harris), who are part of
Simon's team.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Rivera scenery nor the martial arts of Xiong Xin
Xin, much less the automotive stunts attributable to Remy Julienne,
can lift ``Simon Sez'' beyond the very ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Sez'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It
includes some mildly coarse language, plenty of gunplay, a small
amount of bloodletting and hand-to-hand combat, some of it as
foreplay.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   `SIMON SEZ'

Lowery, based on a story by Moshe Diamant and Rudy Cohen; director
of photography, Avraham Karpick; edited by Alain Jakubowicz; music
by Brian Tyler; production designer, Damien Lanfranchi; produced by
Diamant and Ringo Lam; released by Independent Artists. Running
time: 90 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.

 &HT;    Gingrich friend told to produce gifts, letters
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An attorney for Marianne Gingrich has handed a
33-year-old congressional aide in Washington a sweeping list of
items to produce next week in an attempt to pin down her
relationship with the former speaker of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   To Wednesday's videotaped deposition, Callista Bisek, a staff
member on the House Agriculture Committee, has been ordered to
bring everything from gifts to bank statements to photographs that
link her to 56-year-old Newt Gingrich, who is seeking a divorce
from his wife of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   A subpoena filed last month in D.C. Superior Court asks for
documents and other items dating back to January 1995, when
Gingrich was sworn in as the first Republican speaker of the U.S.
House in four decades. Attorneys for the twice-married Gingrich
have acknowledged that he has a ``relationship'' with Bisek, and
the two have been photographed walking hand in hand in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items requested:
</P>
<P>
   _ Any cards, letters, electronic messages and other
correspondence that passed between Bisek andGingrich.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any gifts given to each other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bisek's home and mobile telephone records for the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Records of any loans, payments or gifts on Bisek's behalf
through any entity in which Gingrich holds greater than a 10
percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photographs showing the two together.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any audio and video recordings of Bisek and Gingrich together.
</P>
<P>
   _ And clothing or other personal items belonging to Gingrich
that are in Bisek's possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 100 percent standard,'' Washington divorce lawyer
Sanford Ain said of the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to establishing a relationship between Gingrich and
Bisek, such subpoenas are often used to look for what's referred to
as ``marital waste,'' Ain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to find whether (Gingrich) gave her any money to
hold, or whether he spent any money on her for which he should be
charged,'' Ain said. Judges often count those extramarital
expenditures against the offending spouse when splitting a
divorcing couple's assets.
</P>
<P>
   John Mayoue, who represents Marianne Gingrich, also is likely to
be looking for any assets Gingrich may have transferred to Bisek in
an effort to hide them from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In pleadings filed in Cobb County, Ga., Superior Court, Marianne
Gingrich has accused her estranged husband of trying to transfer
certain assets before filing for divorce in July. Through his
attorneys, Gingrich has denied the charge, saying his wife held all
their liquid assets when he left her.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoue and Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, were unable to be
reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The chance the public will see Bisek's deposition is slim. Her
deposition would not necessarily be filed in the court's record.
Unless the deposition is used at trial, it would remain with the
attorneys, and a trial isn't likely in a high-profile divorce such
as the Gingriches'.
</P>
<P>
   While divorce attorneys agree Bisek would have a difficult time
persuading a judge to excuse her from the routine deposition, they
say Bisek could delay the process by filing technical objections to
the way in which the subpoena was served.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a divorce settlement between the Gingriches would
spare her, too. For now, the Gingrich divorce is scheduled for
trial next month in Cobb County Superior Court.

PUBLISHER DESTROYING BOOK AFTER PLAGIARISM CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest of five disputed biographies by a prolific Scottish
author who has been repeatedly attacked as a plagiarist was ordered
withdrawn and destroyed by his publisher on Friday after a
historian's report branded it a ``spectacular and sustained act of
plagiarism.''
</P>
<P>
   The book by James Mackay, ``I Have Not Yet Begun to Fight: A
Life of John Paul Jones,'' will not be distributed, and all 7,500
newly printed copies of the $28 book will be junked, said Morton
Entrekin, president and publisher of Grove/Atlantic, which had been
scheduled to publish the work in the United States next month.
</P>
<P>
   Entrekin had ordered publication halted for further study last
week after The New York Times raised questions about similarities
to a 40-year-old out-of-print work, ``John Paul Jones: A Sailor's
Biography,'' by Samuel Eliot Morison, the American historian, who
died in 1976. The comparison, carried out for Entrekin by a
Columbia University history professor, David Armitage, amounted to
``an absolutely scathing indictment,'' Entrekin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay's telephone in Glasgow, Scotland, appeared to be out of
order Friday and he could not be reached for comment. Last week,
Mackay denied plagiarizing the Jones book or any other work.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Publishing Co. in Edinburgh, which had published
Mackay's book in Scotland last year, also said Friday that it was
halting distribution and destroying remaining stocks. ``We do feel
very, very disappointed that we put our faith in an author with
something of a track record, only at the end of the day to discover
that it would appear he's abused our trust,'' said Bill Campbell, a
managing director of Mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two years that one of Mackay's books
was ordered pulped. Last year, John Wiley &AMP; Sons withdrew its
American edition of Mackay's biography of Alexander Graham Bell,
which a Boston University professor, Robert V. Bruce, had denounced
as a copy of his 1973 biography.
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement that forestalled litigation, Wiley then
destroyed the remaining copies at a cost to Mackay of about
$40,000. Scholars have also challenged three other books as
plagiarisms: biographies of Mary Queen of Scots, Andrew Carnegie,
and the 13th-century Scottish patriot William Wallace, known as
``Braveheart.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrekin declined to make available Armitage's report in full
but quoted sections that he said reflected the historian's
conclusion that Mackay had plagiarized the Morison work. He said
that Armitage reported: ``It is absolutely certain that Mackay
committed a spectacular and sustained act of plagiarism.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Entrekin said, the historian concluded: ``I
have no doubt that Mackay has committed gross plagiarism.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrekin estimated that destroying the copies could cost
Grove/Atlantic $30,000 to $35,000 but that because the publisher's
contract was with Mainstream rather than Mackay, Grove/Atlantic
expected to be reimbursed by Mainstream.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed about it,'' Entrekin said of the failure to
review Mackay's history of controversy, which was reported starting
last year in a series of articles in The Scotsman, Scotland's
leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the Jones book was welcomed by Samuel Loring
Morison, a grandson of the historian. ``We plan no legal action,''
he said, adding that the estate's trustees had sent the publishers
a letter warning, ``Big Brother is watching you.''

INVESTING WITH ROBERT E. KERN: FREMONT U.S. MICRO-CAP FUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Calif.)   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic of
Freemont U.S. Micro-Cap is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On weekends, Robert E. Kern cultivates lima beans, beets and
potatoes in the garden behind his country home in northeastern
Pennsylvania. During the week in Manhattan, as portfolio manager of
the $237.3 million Fremont U.S. Micro-Cap fund, he tills a
different field: some of the smallest publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   While his agricultural endeavors have suffered from the extremes
of this year's weather, his stock-picking has yielded a bumper
crop. The fund was up 122.1 percent in the 12 months ended Sept. 17
and 56.3 percent in 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, Fremont U.S. Micro-Cap has returned 25.1 percent a
year, on average, for the three years ended Sept. 17, compared with
11.1 percent for its small-growth peers, according to Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Kern, 63, credits the success of the fund _ advised by Fremont
Investment Advisors, an affiliate of the giant Bechtel Corp. of San
Francisco _ to a relentless focus on companies with new kinds of
products, services or technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investment philosophy is growth _ but importantly, within
growth, a focus on innovative growth companies,'' he said from his
midtown Manhattan office. ``These are concentrated mostly in the
economic sectors where the level of innovation is the highest _ in
technology, health care, consumer and service companies.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing stocks, he starts with 5,100 companies with market
capitalizations of $10 million to $500 million, a traditionally
volatile group. He whittles those down to fewer than 1,000 by
screening for annual revenue growth of at least 20 percent. ``We
also like to see increasing profitability,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Special attention is paid to gross profit margins. ``High
margins tell you if a company is able to price goods and services
on a value-added basis, as opposed to commodity pricing,'' he said,
``and how much money is left over for research and development,
sales and marketing to enter new markets and expand existing
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   He also scrutinizes the market prospects of companies' clients
and customers. ``If you find companies that serve other companies
with very large potential markets, that certainly gives them the
opportunity to grow at a very rapid rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kern says he is a firm believer in the old saw that the success
of small companies is determined by their executives' mettle. He
figures that he and his two senior investment managers (one of whom
is his son, David, 35), along with the fund's two analysts, spend a
quarter to a third of their time evaluating management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in microcaps, which have limited resources, it's
important to see how management is focusing on the best
opportunities for future growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To arrive at the 60 to 75 stocks that the fund usually holds,
Kern distills figures like projected earnings growth and comes up
with his most important number for a company _ its enterprise
value, or what it would be worth to someone seeking to acquire it
whole.
</P>
<P>
   He generally likes to buy stocks that are trading at some
discount to enterprise value, but he declined to say how much of a
discount.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Netopia, an Alameda, Calif., company that provides fast
Internet access to small businesses over digital modems. These are
marketed by local exchange carriers, the phone companies created to
compete with the Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Netopia also creates Web sites that can be customized by
business owners. Company management shifted its focus several years
ago to these two areas, ``both of which we think are excellent,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in March at $20 each; Netopia closed on Friday
at $33.625, or 67 percent of his estimate of its enterprise value.
He expects Netopia's revenue in fiscal 1999 to be $42 million, a
figure that he thinks could double in the next 12 to 18 months.
Kern also thinks Netopia will post its first profit in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Photon Dynamics, a maker of equipment used
to test flat-panel computer and TV screens. Production of
flat-panel displays has risen sharply, Kern said, and Photon's sole
competitor is a Japanese company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Photon will gain market share, especially in the
rapidly growing Taiwan market, because of the advanced technology
in its testing equipment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares of Photon, based in San Jose, Calif., at an
average of $7 a share last fall. He projects annualized revenues of
$50 million in the September quarter and a three-year annual
earnings growth rate of 40 percent to 50 percent. The stock now
trades at $19.875, or 57 percent of his estimate of enterprise
value.
</P>
<P>
   Kern began buying Adept Technology, also based in San Jose, at
its 1996 initial public offering, only to sell the stock, at a
profit, in the midst of the 1997-98 Asian economic crisis. The
company makes robots used for materials handling and other
industrial applications.
</P>
<P>
   He bought Adept stock again late last year, at $7 a share. The
stock closed on Friday at $7.625, or 38 percent of his estimate of
enterprise value.
</P>
<P>
   Adept has entered the business of making robots for the
semiconductor equipment industry, doubling its potential market,
Kern said. ``We think there's an excellent opportunity for Adept to
gain significant business, because of the increased demand for more
reliable and higher-quality robots,'' he added. He figured that
revenues could grow more than 20 percent annually over the next
three years.

OPPOSITION LEADER SEEKS TO FORGE AUTONOMOUS REGION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia _ The opposition demonstrations against
President Slobodan Milosevic may be faltering in cynical Belgrade,
but 60 miles to the north, in Vojvodina, there is both energy and
direction, with politicians' planning for a long-term effort to
undermine the credibility of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 protesters have turned out nightly this week in
the provincial capital, Novi Sad _ sometimes more than in Belgrade,
but in a city of some 200,000 people, one-10th the size of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a portly, charismatic politician named Nenad Canak has
focused the protests on installing a new ``transitional''
Parliament and government for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Those new officials, including Canak as provisional prime
minister, will now seek to win Western recognition for themselves
and Western aid for Novi Sad and Vojvodina, to emphasize the
international isolation of the Milosevic government.
</P>
<P>
   Canak, a good speaker with a sense of irony, has encouraged his
protesters to clean the Parliament building with soap and water to
wash away the ``corruption and filth'' of the Milosevic years, as
plainclothes policemen watched from inside, their arms crossed and
faces hard. On Thursday, the ``new'' officials were ``sworn in'' on
the Parliament steps, as existing officials were urged to vacate.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not, protesters say they will lock the existing
officials (and the police) in the building, will block the phone
lines with automatic dialers and try to burn out the fax machines
by sending black pages, then cut water and electricity to the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kosovo, Vojvodina had its autonomy stripped by Milosevic in
1990, and this spring NATO's bombers hit it hard, destroying Novi
Sad's oil refinery, hitting its government building and demolishing
its three bridges over the Danube River. That cut the city in half,
ruining water and power lines and blocking the Danube to
international shipping.
</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare, the Milosevic government has just opened a
two-lane pontoon bridge. The bridge is a key part of Milosevic's
effort to ``reconstruct the country'' while the protesters,
according to state propaganda, try to finish the war NATO started
by bringing him down.
</P>
<P>
   But for Canak, 39 and a former member of the Serbian Parliament,
Milosevic is less the issue than Vojvodina's stolen autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Canak will organize a gathering in a park, with lots
of food and drink, under the rubric, ``No one can make a revolution
on an empty stomach.'' Here in Vojvodina, formerly a part of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, fun and food _ and drink _ are
indispensable to any serious activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's theater, yes, but not only theater,'' he said. ``You can
attract people with theater, but there must be some substance, too,
some action.''
</P>
<P>
   Canak and his allies are concentrating not on the rallies, which
will not continue here past the weekend on a daily basis, but on
creating substance behind the idea of an alternative government
that will restore some autonomy to the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to demand some immediate support from the West,'' he
says, ``and I think I'll get some.'' He wants food, heating oil,
diesel fuel, transformers and cement _ so he can provide aid to
people, even to the local police and military, that the government
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Canak and others here complain that the West, both governments
and media, are too Belgrade-centric, ignoring the needs and
concerns of other parts of Serbia, where the opposition to
Milosevic is stronger. Little Western aid comes here, for instance,
and Vojvodina has little local media, despite having more than 2
million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   While Canak is sometimes attacked by Belgrade as a
``separatist'' or treated as a quasi-nationalist, he has built his
political career in the last decade on local issues. His League of
Social Democrats is refurbishing a large building downtown with
offices, a library, radio station, generators, presses, a small
cinema and a cafe, both to earn income and also try to be
self-sufficient in the political struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start making some problems here,'' he says
happily. ``Milosevic's tactic for survival is always to wait and
see. We can't allow that. They underestimate us all the time, which
is to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   During the rally, Canak delighted the crowd with coarse jibes at
Milosevic and the secret police, whose cameras he identified, red
lights blinking, in darkened rooms in surrounding buildings. ``Look
at that window there, say hello, and put on a big smile,'' he told
the crowd, which cheered, pointed and whistled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come down here and show your real face,'' he yelled, as the
camera was pulled back. ``There are no terrorists here. Just the
free people of Vojvodina who don't want you any more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after a disappointing series of opposition rallies
this week in the Serbian capital, the Alliance for Change insisted
Friday that its demonstrations would continue until Milosevic
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 10,000 people came for a march Friday, and half stayed
for speeches, a more encouraging showing than in the previous two
days.
</P>
<P>
   But Alliance officials also made appeals to Vuk Draskovic, the
leader of the larger Serbian Renewal Movement, to join the
protests, and they agreed to attend talks Sept. 30 on conditions
for early elections, which Draskovic favors.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Alliance officials had a long meeting about the
future of the rallies, but decided they could not give up and
maintain any credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way back for us now,'' said Vladan Batic, the
Alliance coordinator. ``We will finish the job we started.''

`FOOLING WITH WORDS': BILL MOYERS AND THE POETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television is a lot of things, but it is very rarely nourishing
to the soul. Leave it to Bill Moyers, that journalistic seeker of
wisdom, to find a way _ ``Fooling With Words: With Bill Moyers.''
</P>
<P>
   In this splendid two-hour PBS special, Moyers visits ``the
largest poetry festival in North America'' in Waterloo, N.J., where
12,000 people turned up, and talks to the poets. He also listens to
them, and that's where the nourishing comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light splashed this morning on the shell-pink anemones,
swaying on their tall stems down blue-spiked veronica; light flowed
in rivulets over the humps of the honeybees. This morning I saw
light kiss the silk of the roses.'' That is Stanley Kunitz, born in
1905, reading his own work.
</P>
<P>
   Marge Piercy, dealing with a less traditional topic, recites a
poem with these lines: ``Modern woman, thin as a blade of
scissors''; ``closing her eyes to food, hungry, always hungry'';
``when will women not be compelled to view their bodies as science
projects, gardens to be weeded, dogs to be trained; when will a
woman cease to be made of pain?''
</P>
<P>
   What the artists have to say about poetry is less enthralling
but often inspiring. Like Robert Pinsky's faith in its power to
transform the world: ``I believe that before Baudelaire and Dickens
made the city poetic, it wasn't as poetic.'' And like Amiri
Baraka's flat statement, ``There's people dying every day for lack
of what is found in poems; poetry is necessary as breath.''
</P>
<P>
   The two hours include poems about roses, puppies, the glories of
being the first wife (as in serial monogamy, not a harem), a
traffic roundabout in Ireland, and Barbie and Ken exchanging heads.
One has the title ``Please Fire Me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is poetry accompanied by music, some that straddles the
fence between recitation and rap. There is a lot of audience
laughter but a few too many invasive shots of rapt listeners.
Sometimes the applause after a particularly touching work is
mood-jarring, making it clear why the Beats made a habit of
snapping their fingers in approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the advice is to benefit from poetry by reading it
aloud. Maybe yoga classes, meditation and martinis don't have to be
this era's only ways to get in touch with an inner calm.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona, who held out longer
than most Republican governors before endorsing anyone for the
party's presidential nomination, has decided to back Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, according to people close to both politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Her endorsement is particularly interesting because one of
Bush's rivals is Sen. John McCain of Arizona. And former Vice
President Dan Quayle, who is also seeking the nomination, has lived
in Arizona for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who is expected to announce the endorsement early next
week, joins a list of 23 Republican governors who are formally
supporting the presidential bid of their colleague from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In another interesting endorsement that underscored a
candidate's momentum, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said Friday that
he was endorsing Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential
nomination instead of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler was one of the staunchest, most vocal defenders of
President Clinton and the Clinton administration during the events
surrounding Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But at a news conference in Washington on Friday, Nadler said
that he had come to believe, over recent weeks in particular, that
Bradley was the stronger Democratic candidate, with the better
chance of defeating the Republican nominee in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you frankly, if I had been called up and asked to
pledge myself to Gore four months ago, I would have said yes
without thinking,'' Nadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has not yet announced her decision to endorse Bush, and
neither Francie Noyes, a spokeswoman for Hull, nor Mindy Tucker, a
spokeswoman for Bush, would confirm that it was in the offing. Hull
and Bush are scheduled to make a joint public appearance in Phoenix
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said of Hull, ``The governor's position, for now, is that
she is supporting Arizona's favorite sons.''
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the governors said that her selection of
Bush over McCain or Quayle was a done deal. It suggests that McCain
may have difficulty winning even the primary in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his campaign late Friday, McCain said
he was not concerned about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I was disappointed to learn of Jane Hull's decision
to endorse Governor Bush,'' McCain said, ``I am extremely confident
that the statewide grass-roots organization of committed Arizonans
that supported me in three consecutive elections to the U.S. Senate
will bring me to victory once again.''

PEDRO AT THE TOP OF THE 300 CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have been watching something special in Pedro Martinez this
year, but his magical season has been even better than we realized.
For this one season, Martinez has been the greatest strikeout
pitcher in baseball history. There are fewer than a dozen pitchers
in the history of the game who have recorded 300 strikeouts in a
single season, and Pedro has struck out more batters per inning in
1999 than any of the 300 Club members.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, with 300 strikeouts in 204 innings, is averaging 13
strikeouts per nine innings, which is unprecedented for 300-K
pitchers according to the Elias Sports Bureau in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Randy Johnson is averaging 12 strikeouts per nine
innings, with 342 K's in 255 innings. No one before, not Nolan
Ryan, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Bob Feller, or Walter Johnson, has
averaged 13 strikeouts a game in a 300-strikeout season.
</P>
<P>
   To consider that Martinez is doing this in an era of
super-juiced balls, whip-like bats, smaller parks, and, above all,
minute strike zones, is remarkable. Enjoy it while it lasts,
because it may never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say he has more catches than quotes. Big Ben
Coates, who very rarely speaks with the media, is heading to Hall
of Fame territory with 465 catches and 50 touchdown receptions in
his nine years with the Patriots. If it happens, will give his
acceptance speech in sign language? Coates does his talking on the
field, where he is near unstoppable. ``They (opponents) know when
we get close to the goal line,'' said quarterback Drew Bledsoe,
``I'm going to throw to Ben and they still haven't stopped it. I
know if I get the ball anywhere near him, no matter how many people
he has around him, Ben is going to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates is currently sixth on the all-time list for catches by
tight ends. Ozzie Newsome of Cleveland leads with 662; Denver's
Shannon Sharpe, the active leader, has 542; Kellen Winslow retired
with 541; Steve Jordan of Minnesota had 498; Jerry Smith of
Washington had 480; and Coates is at 465. If he stays on his feet
for the rest of the season, Coates will pass Smith and Jordan. If
he plays two more years, he'll pass Winslow.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a big difference between Coates and those above
him. Coates also blocks. The others did very little. They were
primarily pass receivers. Only Smith (60) and Dave Casper (52) had
more touchdown catches. Coates has 50 so it will only be a number
of weeks before he passes Casper. Casper was terrific, and the
closest to Coates in this group as a pure tight end. The others
were wide receivers wearing tight end numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben has a lot of things going for him,'' said Jets coach Bill
Parcells, who had the good fortune to coach Coates for four years.
``He has great size at 6-5. Long arms. He has excellent hands, and
a bag of tricks. He knows how to push off (the defensive back) and
get away with it. He knows how to hunch his body and stick out his
backside when he is running a curl pattern so the defensive back
can't come over the top of him to knock the ball down. And most
important, he knows how to get open and catch the ball in tough
situations.'' Coates doesn't get the French pastry, as Bob Cousy
likes to say, because he chooses not to talk, which is certainly
fine with the Patriots fans as long as he continues to catch
footballs and get into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Smith was remarkable for his position. ``Jerry weighed
just about 190 pounds but he was a tough guy,'' said Bobby
Mitchell, his former teammate and now a vice president with the
Washington Redskins. ``We had Sonny Jurgensen at quarterback,
myself on one side, Charley Taylor on the other, and Jerry at tight
end. He was a great intermediate route (15-20 yards) runner, and
Sonny liked to go to him close to the goal line.'' Smith retired
after the 1977 season with 60 touchdown catches in 13 years; Coates
is in his ninth year.

   Here is the straight scoop from someone with a track record for
selling sports tickets over the past two decades. This year's
baseball All-Star Game still ranks as the best local ticket of all
time. The All-Star package, two tickets to either the home run
hitting contest or the All-Star Game, went for $2,500 per ticket at
their most expensive. The Ryder Cup at the top of the market went
for $1,000 per ticket. My friend says if the Red Sox play the
Yankees in the American League Championship Series, those tickets
could approach All-Star Game levels.

   Great story in Brockton, Mass. next Tuesday, when Steve Demasco
comes to town to speak to the students at his old high school about
what determination can do for you, no matter how tough your life
is. ``I grew up in the Richmond Street projects with my mom, who
had artificial legs. We were on welfare. I was a sports fanatic,
but was never big enough or good enough to make any teams. Besides,
I had to go to work to help my mom,'' said Demasco, who owns 30
United Karate Studios around the Northeast. He has done well enough
to open a new Rocky Marciano Gym in Brockton. ``It will be a thrill
for me to spearhead the drive to open a new Rocky Marciano gym. The
old one is out of business,'' said Demasco. ``When I was working, I
went to the the old Rocky gym at nights and on the weekends,''
Demasco said. ``There I met a guy named Vinny Vecchione. He
straightened me out. He told me not to go in the wrong direction.
He told me I had the brains to do better. Vinny was like a second
father to me. He took an interest in me when there wasn't really
anything I could do for him. I tried boxing, but I wasn't that
good. But it was about this time that I took an interest in
karate.'' Demasco eventually went to Southeastern Massachusetts
University, worked several jobs, and set out on his own to be an
entrepreneur. Demasco will be one of the main speakers on a program
that includes members of President Clinton's staff.

   On the morning of the 1996 NFL draft, the Patriots were picking
seventh and had their eyes on three defensive players _ linebackers
Kevin Hardy and Simeon Rice out of Illinois, and defensive end
Cedric Jones of Oklahoma. If all three went off the board before
the New England pick, the Patriots would switch to offense and Ohio
State receiver Terry Glenn. Hardy was taken second by Jacksonville,
Rice third by Arizona. In retrospect, the Patriots should thank the
Giants, who are here Sunday night, for taking Jones with the fifth
pick. He has been a huge disappointment, failing to tell scouts he
could not see out of one eye until after he was drafted. Jones
comes in here as a starting defense end because Chad Bratzke, who
had a Pro Bowl-type season in 1998, left for the Colts via free
agency. Last week at Giants Stadium, the Redskins wore out Jones
and the cornerback behind him, Jeremy Lincoln, on the way to a
50-21 rout.

   Last week, your humble servant talked about cheating in sports
and surrendered some of the tricks in baseball, hockey, and
basketball. Here are a couple of yarns about pro football. This
comes from Gino Cappelletti and goes back to the very first
Patriots game ever, vs. Denver, at Boston University in 1960. Just
a few weeks earlier, the Patriots buried Denver in an exhibition
game and were big favorites in the opener. But they were upset,
13-10. ``A little while later, I bumped into Frank Filchock, who
was the Broncos coach,'' Cappelletti said. ``I knew him from
Canada. The Broncos had practiced before us at BU the day before
the game. We were playing Friday night, and Lou Saban, our coach,
wanted to practice under the lights. Filchock took his time leaving
BU and when he was walking up the street, he saw us practicing. So
he slipped into the back of the grandstand and took notes. Saban
gave us a full practice, everything we were going to do. Filchok
got back to the hotel, called a team meeting, and told them what we
were going to do. We couldn't figure out how we coud beat them so
easy in preseason, and then have them turn it around the way they
did in the opener.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 years ago the Bears and Packers met at Chicago in the
final game of the season. Neither team was going anywhere. The
Bears put a hidden camera in the press box and filmed the Packers
offensive coordinator signaling in all of the plays from the bench.
When the season was over, they matched the hand signals with the
players, broke the code, and had a big edge for two more years,
until the Packers coaching staff got fired. When Green Bay played
Chicago over those two years, the Bears would watch the Packers
coaches signal the play, then the Chicago defensive coordinator
would signal his players, tipping them off to what the Packers were
going to do.

 &HT;    Tanzania primed for tourism, investment, ambassador says
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles Stith's title may be ambassador, but he sounds
a lot like a salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Stith, a former Atlanta resident, has been the U.S. ambassador
to Tanzania for a year. He returned this week to tout the benefits
of the east African country as a place for American tourism and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta stop was part of a four-city tour during which Stith
squired Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa through Boston, New
York, Washington and Atlanta. Their mission was to promote Tanzania
to American political and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Stith said President Clinton sent him to Tanzania partly because
he recognized that, to be credible, the African Growth and
Opportunity Initiative had to work somewhere besides South Africa,
which has a strong economy. The initiative is designed to encourage
free trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``A place like Tanzania has many of the fundamentals in place,''
Stith said.
</P>
<P>
   The country, which is about twice the size of California, lies
on the Indian Ocean and has a population of 31 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The country is a multiparty democracy, it is stable and it is
not divided by ethnic tension, Stith said. Inflation, which was 30
percent in 1995 has been cut to 7.5 percent. There are the
embryonic beginnings of a consumer economy. It borders large
freshwater lakes, including Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika,
making it a potential gateway for the movement of goods to the
interior of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And it boasts tourist attractions second to no other African
country, Stith said _ including Mt. Kilimanjaro, Serengeti National
Park and the Selous Game Reserve, the second-largest reserve in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But challenges remain. Tanzania, the CIA World Factbook says, is
``one of the poorest countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And when people in the United States, who Stith noted are
notoriously uninformed about geography, hear about war in Congo,
they tend to think that all of Africa is unstable, he said. News
coverage focusing on war, poverty and famine also leaves a negative
impression, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stith took up his post as ambassador shortly after the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, was bombed by
terrorists, killing 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was a terrible event, but it had a positive side
effect, Stith said. Before the bombing, Stith guessed, fewer than
10 percent of Americans could have said where Tanzania was. After
the bombing, suddenly, Americans were talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Stith, 50, who considers Boston home, lived in Atlanta from 1973
to 1975. He graduated from the Interdenominational Theological
Center, worked on Maynard Jackson's first mayoral campaign and
worked at Central United Methodist Church with the Rev. Joseph
Lowery.
</P>
<P>
   He met his wife, Deborah, when she was a student at Spelman
College. His two children attend school in Atlanta, as well. His
son, Percy, who is 20, spent the last year working as Stith's
aide-de-camp in Tanzania. He is a sophomore this year at Morehouse
College. Stith's daughter, Mimi, 17, who also spent last year in
Tanzania, is a freshman at Spelman.
</P>
<P>
   So the trip to Atlanta gave Stith a chance to visit family
members and renew old acquaintances. It also gave the ambassador a
chance to trot out his salesman's pitch on behalf on Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is safe and it's stable,'' he said. ``So come on
and check us out.''

SICK OF PAPERWORK? SOME OFFICE WORKERS SAY IT'S THE PAPER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., N.Y., Fla., Wis., Calif.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of how carbonless copy paper works is being sent
to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (af)  
 By KEITH MULVIHILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carbonless copy paper is everywhere. Write something on the top
sheet, and it is replicated on the sheets below, usually in a
medium blue hue, without fuss or mess. Handle the stuff now and
then, as most people do, and it is a great convenience. But handle
it constantly and, some people say, it will make you sick.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, also known as NCR paper (for ``no carbon required''),
is coated on one side with microscopic capsules. Pressure from a
pen or dot-matrix printer bursts some of the capsules, releasing
chemicals that react with others on the sheet below to make a
visible dye.
</P>
<P>
   The complex formula varies from brand to brand, but among the
dozens of chemicals used are several, like formaldehyde, odorless
kerosene and various organic solvents, that can be hazardous in
sufficient quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Health concerns about heavy exposure to carbonless copy paper,
or more precisely, the chemicals it emits, are not new: the
government first studied the issue in the 1980s but found the
available data to be inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   But after an accumulation of further research and complaints by
workers, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health
reopened its inquiry and has drafted a report for publication later
this fall that may lead to a new requirement for warning labels on
packages of carbonless paper. Workers who say they have been harmed
opened a new legal front earlier this month by filing a
class-action suit in California on novel legal grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Though manufacturers have occasionally offered settlements to
individual workers who have sued them contending injury, they
maintain that carbonless paper is safe, that the chemical exposure
from using it is trivial and that no one has yet demonstrated a
definite link between the product and any illness. According to
Pulp and Paper Weekly, a trade publication, American paper mills
shipped more than 700,000 tons of carbonless paper last year, and
it is likely that nearly every American adult has come into contact
with it at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most people do not handle quite as much of it as
Brenda Smith did at work. She spent 25 years as an operator and
customer service representative for Bell Atlantic and its Bell
System predecessors in Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like helping people,'' she said in a recent telephone
interview, ``and people always told me I sound real nice over the
phone.'' For the last 10 of those years, much of her daily
paperwork involved forms printed on carbonless copy paper,
sometimes a hundred or more a day. ``It was all around us,'' she
said, ``on our desks, in the supply closets and in the file
cabinets.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a flu that sneaks up on you, Ms. Smith said, illnesses
gradually came to plague her. ``I suffered from chronic headaches,
bronchitis and laryngitis,'' she recalled. By 1992, when she was in
her early 40s, she could no longer do her job and was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she said, she had no idea what was causing the
deterioration in her health, but she now believes she was acquiring
a condition called multiple chemical sensitivity from her years of
heavy exposure to carbonless paper. Now 51, Ms. Smith said she
suffers constant fatigue and sinus infections and gets by on Social
Security disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   And she has become an activist, seeking out others who also
believe that they have been made ill by carbonless paper. One she
found had a job that was very similar to hers.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kozlowski, 51, worked for Bell Atlantic in Annapolis,
Md., for 23 years as a customer service representative. She said
she suffered reddened and swollen eyes, vertigo and migraine
headaches during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and after an
extended leave from her job, was let go in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Sharon MacLaughlin, a former county welfare examiner
in Ithaca, N.Y., who reports multiple chemical sensitivity symptoms
similar to Ms. Smith's.
</P>
<P>
   The three women began working together six years ago to raise
awareness of health issues surrounding heavy exposure to carbonless
paper, and in March formed a group called the Carbonless Copy Paper
Injury and Information Network, with a Web site devoted to news and
research reports about the issue, www.carbonless.org.
</P>
<P>
   Its main goal is to force manufacturers to put warning labels on
their products. ``All we want is for people who use carbonless copy
forms to be aware of the health risks,'' Ms. Smith said. ``It's not
our intention to scare people. Obviously not everyone will have
problems. But heavy users should be warned.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because of their activities, the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health in 1997 reopened an inquiry that had
lain dormant for a decade. ``In 1987, we came to a conclusion that
we couldn't come to a conclusion,'' said Paul Schulte, director of
education and information at the institute, who is overseeing the
current investigation of carbonless paper. ``The data wasn't clear,
so we put it aside. In the ensuing 10 years, the scientific
literature kept growing and so did the number of individuals who
alleged health effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute's new report is being reviewed by other government
agencies, academic researchers and manufacturers of the paper.
Schulte would not discuss the report's detailed findings in advance
of its publication, but said in general that the effort was
complicated by the difficulty in predicting adverse reactions like
skin and eye irritation that have been attributed to the paper.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on use patterns, environmental conditions and
genetic characteristics,'' he said, as well as chemical exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest problem for scientists and regulators is
that carbonless copy paper is not an easy-to-define product. The
processes and chemicals involved in its manufacture are proprietary
and closely guarded by the competing manufacturers. (The leaders
are Appleton Paper, Mead and Moore.)
</P>
<P>
   The exact chemical composition varies greatly from sheet to
sheet, form to form and manufacturer to manufacturer, according to
Charles Schmidt, who until recently was a professor of
environmental engineering at the University of Florida in
Gainesville and who has reviewed the national institute's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the information concerning composition and production
is described in patents rather than more readily available
scientific literature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory research by Schmidt and colleagues at the university
found that a class of chemicals called alkyl biphenols used in
carbonless paper can be transferred to human skin, and that
odorless-kerosene fumes are a primary component of the gases that
can be detected evaporating from the paper even before it is used.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers say their own research has found no cause for
concern at any level, and they object to the idea of warning
labels. ``Carbonless copy paper has not been associated with any
health risks, so no need exists to make health warnings,'' said
Bill Van Den Brandt, a spokesman for Appleton Paper in Appleton,
Wis., which produces more than 500,000 tons annually, making it the
leading manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Garwood, a spokeswoman for Meade, which made 216,000 tons
last year, said her company is also convinced that its product is
safe to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the institute's soon-to-be-published report is
likely to conclude that some level of risk exists. ``The major
message is that it can be irritating to some people,'' said Dr.
Robert McCunney, president of the American College of Occupational
and Environmental Medicine, who has reviewed the report.
``Carbonless copy paper has the potential to cause skin and
mucous-membrane _ eye, nose and throat _ irritation.''
</P>
<P>
   The national institute has compiled a long list of symptoms that
have been reported in connection with heavy exposure to the paper,
but so far it has not assessed just how many people may be at risk
or who they are; instead, the institute has examined factors like
the volume of paper used, room temperature, ventilation rates in
work and storage areas and general work practices as possible
contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe that it may be impossible to establish a
direct link between exposure to the paper's chemicals and serious
medical conditions like Ms. Smith's.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that the report may help resolve is a semantic one,
but with important regulatory consequences: whether carbonless copy
paper should continue to be classified as an ``article,'' like a
stapler or a file cabinet, or whether it more properly belongs
under the heading of a ``chemical substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires
warning labels on packaging and detailed fact sheets made available
to employees about chemical substances in the workplace, but not
for articles. Sharon Snyder, a spokeswoman for OSHA, said the
agency was looking into the classification issue.
</P>
<P>
   A class action lawsuit, filed by Ms. Smith's group on Sept. 2 in
California, contends that carbonless copy paper falls afoul not of
federal regulations but of that state's Proposition 65. That
right-to-know law, adopted in 1986, requires companies to give a
``clear and reasonable'' warning before knowingly exposing anyone
to carcinogens or other hazardous chemicals on a state-published
list.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which names 12 paper manufacturers as defendants,
asserts that at least three chemicals on the state's list _
formaldehyde, benzene and toluene diisocyanate _ are used in
carbonless paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the apparent paradoxes of the digital revolution is that
it has proved a boon to the makers of analog chips, those quaint
devices that process continuous electronic signals rather than the
zeros and ones that their digital cousins do.
</P>
<P>
   It is only an (italics)apparent(end italics) paradox: Humans
cannot hear, see, taste, smell or touch digital, and no matter how
digital a device, it cannot be powered digitally or receive radio
waves in digital form. So wherever a device interacts with its user
or its environment, there one finds analog chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what, the real world is going to be analog,'' said
Jill Hauser, an analyst at T. Rowe Price, the money manager. ``If
anything, the digital phenomenon has increased demand, it has
driven analog.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst at S.G. Cowen, added, ``Human beings are
analog.''
</P>
<P>
   Several diversified chip makers, including Texas Instruments, ST
Microelectronics and the National Semiconductor Corp., include
analog chips in their product portfolios. But analysts say some of
the best prospects are in four companies that specialize in analog
chips, and particularly in the high end of the analog market.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these are pure-play analog companies: Linear Technology
and Maxim Integrated Products. Two others, Analog Devices and
Burr-Brown, make primarily analog components but also derive a
substantial amount of sales from so-called mixed-signal chips,
which combine digital and analog functions, as well as digital
signal processors, or DSPs, specialized chips often used in
conjunction with analog circuits.
</P>
<P>
   None of these stocks are cheap at the moment, and none are
trading too far from their highs. Linear Technology closed on
Friday at $63.6875, up 42.2 percent so far this year. Maxim is at
$67.3125, up 54.1 percent; Analog Devices at $56.3125, up 79.5
percent, and Burr-Brown at $39.4375, up 68.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In general, producing analog chips is less capital intensive
than making digital chips, because analog chips do not benefit from
the latest manufacturing processes.
</P>
<P>
   This is because packing circuits closer together, which digital
chips do to increase speed, only causes noise and heat problems for
analog. Lower capital outlays mean less depreciation dragging on
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, analog chip design is still as much art as
science, benefiting little from modern computer-aided design
software. So analog companies are dependent on design power of the
human kind: engineers with years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Because these experts are hard to come by, the barriers to entry
in the analog business are surprisingly high. And because
individuals, unlike computer programs, tend to design highly
differentiated chips, competition for any given product is low.
</P>
<P>
   So analog is ``intellectually intensive, not capital
intensive,'' said Louis Gerhardy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Several market trends point to continued growth of analog chip
use _ and stock price appreciation. There is, for example, the
growing use of analog-rich flat-panel displays on desktops, and the
migration of users from desktops to portables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analog chip content in a notebook computer is two to three
times what it is in a desktop,'' Gerhardy said.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of digital cellular phones and the growing use of
fiber optic data and communications lines are playing a role, too.
Fiber optic lines typically have analog transceivers and amplifiers
at both ends, and ``even though we talk about digital cellular
phones versus the analog phones of a year or two ago, the analog
content in the phones is actually higher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio waves depend on continuous, slight fluctuations of a
frequency, which is why the radio portion of a cellular telephone,
TV satellite receiver or any sort of wireless communications device
is full of analog chips. ``Ones and zeros don't travel; electrons
travel,'' said Terry Ragsdale, an analyst with J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhardy has strong buys on Maxim and Linear Technology, each
with a target price of $80, and a rating of market outperform on
both Analog Devices, with a target of $65, and Burr-Brown, with a
target of $50.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gerhardy prefers the pure plays, Peck, of S.G. Cowen,
recommends Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, for their ability
to produce chips that mix analog and digital signals, as well as
digital signal processors.
</P>
<P>
   While he expects total semiconductor sales to grow at 13 percent
to 14 percent a year for the next five years, and analog to grow at
20 percent, he expects mixed signal to grow at 30 percent 35
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Peck rates Analog Devices a strong buy, with a target of $75,
and Texas Instruments a buy, based on its current price of $83.875,
with a long-term target of $140.
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale recommends Analog Devices, with a target of $68. He
said that Linear and Maxim had long operated at peak efficiency,
and that this was reflected in their share prices, but that Analog
had room to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Klee, portfolio manager of the John Hancock Global
Technology fund, has held several of the analog stocks over the
years, including Linear back in 1983 when it was a private company,
and he is now a major holder of Analog Devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought the stock much lower and have made a lot of money on
it, but we believe it can go higher,'' he said.

 &HT;    MindSpring up as deal gains favor
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What a difference a day makes in the world of Internet
investing.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, MindSpring's stock was pummeled when it announced a
$3 billion merger with competing Internet provider EarthLink. The
price fell $5.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But by Friday investors had decided the merger wasn't so bad
after all and drove MindSpring's stock up $2.68 3/4 to close at
$30.06 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Why the flip-flop in perspective? Nobody can know for sure but
one analyst who covers MindSpring offered a theory.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bacurin, an analyst with J.C. Bradford, said that
MindSpring's stock had been driven up during the past week by
rumors that Microsoft was going to buy the Atlanta-based company.
</P>
<P>
   When those rumors proved false, investors were deeply
disappointed and many of them deserted MindSpring's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the dust has settled and people are seeing the value of
the merger with EarthLink,'' says Bacurin. ``People are realizing
that this merger will make the new combined player a much stronger
national player.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring stockholder Alan Taettle agreed. ``I'm bullish on the
stock,'' said the former MindSpring executive and general partner
of Noro-Moseley Partners in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Taettle is not alone, if Internet chat rooms are any indication
_ MindSpring stock has come back into favor. On Yahoo's finance
page and other similar sites, investors were talking up MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   There's good reason for the chat room enthusiasm. In 1996, when
MindSpring first went public, 100 of its shares, when adjusted to
today for stock splits, was worth $67. At Friday's close, those 100
shares were worth $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes sense, Taettle said. He explained that, with the
addition of EarthLink, MindSpring would now have some 3 million
subscribers. That number represents a size that advertisers should
take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring should now be able to get more ad revenue and that
will give a big boost to its bottom line,'' said Taettle.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, American Online, the industry's largest player, now
generates much of its income from advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that investors like MindSpring's merger is that
EarthLink's stock also rose Friday, said Bacurin. It was up $5.18
3/4 to close at $47.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that both stocks are up indicates that the market
definitely favors the merger,'' said Bacurin.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the merger, expected to close sometime early next
year, the combined companies would take EarthLink's name. But the
new company would be based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will become, at least for now, the second
largest Internet provider. America Online remains by far the
largest, with nearly 20 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   While bigger, the new EarthLink will continue to face serious
challenges, said Bacurin.
</P>
<P>
   For one, America Online continues to grow. Also, despite
consolidation, new players are still flooding into the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new players are testing a strategy of offering free
access and supporting themselves instead by selling advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Bacurin and other analysts are confident that, while the
going may be tough, the new EarthLink will prosper, driving its
stock up even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't enough ad dollars going in to support the free
service model,'' says Bacurin. ``It costs on average between $6-$10
a subscriber to provide service and ad revenue hasn't been enough
to cover this.''

AUTO REVIEW (Phoenix) - Suddenly, station wagons are cool. Not the
big, beefy Ranch Wagons, Custom Cruisers and Roadmasters that once
hogged the highways before being displaced by minivans and

four-door wagons, mainly from Europe. Volvo wagons have been
transformed from boxy haulers into svelte fashion statements. Audi

But it's a critic's job to tell you more. You shouldn't just know
that the show, set in a Michigan high school in 1980, is good. You
should know how good. Here's how good: It will make you like a Styx

 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Bank of Scotland PLC mounted a $34-billion hostile
bid on Friday for National Westminster Bank, an institution twice
its size, in the biggest takeover attempt in British banking
history.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the bid would create the second-largest banking
company based in Britain, after HSBC Holdings PLC, and ahead of
Barclays and Lloyds TSB. It sent the shares of both National
Westminster and Bank of Scotland soaring in anticipation of a
possible bidding war, and was seen as a stunning display of the
push in Europe toward banking consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after mergers and acquisitions from Switzerland to France
and Spain, the reverse takeover bid underlined the pressures on
banks to strive for size, seeing this as a way to defend themselves
against predators in an increasingly competitive market. ``The
pressure for consolidation has been building up for some time,''
said John Tyce, an analyst at SG Securities here. ``This changes
the scenery of British banking forever. Banking isn't ever going to
be the same again, even if the deal never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir David Rowland, chairman of Natwest, the would-be quarry,
promised to block the deal. ``We are determined to stop the Bank of
Scotland from acquiring Natwest Group on the cheap,'' he said,
``and are convinced that this offer is not in the best interests of
our shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Scotland, which is based in Edinburgh, said it would pay
1.6 of its shares and 1.20 pounds in loan notes for each share of
National Westminster. That would value the company at 12.50 pounds
a share _ a 19.5 percent premium over Natwest's closing price on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bid, which analysts said would ignite a new round of banking
mergers in Britain, pushed Natwest's shares up nearly 28 percent,
to 13.38 pounds. Bank of Scotland shares gained 15.2 percent, to
8.135 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal would give Natwest shareholders 68 percent of
the combined bank, while Bank of Scotland would choose its
management. The Scottish bank said Natwest would retain its
separate status, but Bank of Scotland's chief operating officer,
Gavin Masterton, would be named chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The offer eclipsed the value of the last major merger in British
banking, a $20.1-billion deal that fused Lloyds and TSB late in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time that Bank of Scotland sought to
acquire Natwest, according to executives close to the deal. A
series of three meetings occurred about a year and a half ago
between officials of both banks about a friendly deal. Ultimately,
Natwest rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the deal is clearly less friendly and the Scottish
bank has said that its bid is conditional on National Westminster's
abandoning a plan, announced two weeks ago, to buy Legal and
General Group, Britain's fourth-largest insurer, for $17.2 billion.
Legal and General shareholders are scheduled to vote on that deal
at a meeting on Oct. 6, and on Friday Bank of Scotland urged them
to reject it. Legal and General could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Scotland said in a statement that it intended to sell
several Natwest units, including the Gartmore fund managers, if its
bid went through.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the deal said that high-level executives from
both camps spent the morning on Friday in a rather unfriendly
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was not an exact copy of banking mergers on the
Continent, which have been far more directly affected by the
introduction of the European single currency. The euro's arrival in
January inspired many banks there to see consolidation as a defense
against cross-border raiders.
</P>
<P>
   With Britain outside the euro zone and unlikely to join for at
least three years, British banks have ``remained on the sidelines''
of Continental European deals, focusing on retail and commercial
business at home, said Sam Theodore, a European banking specialist
at Moody's Investors Service. But with the industry in flux and
giants emerging in Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere, ``the
underlying reason for many of these mergers is the uncertainty most
banks feel about their future,'' Theodore said. ``And when in
doubt, they try to increase their size.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing its bid on Friday, Bank of Scotland opened a twin
attack on Natwest's own merger plans with Legal and General _ and
on its bigger rival's track record. Peter Burt, Bank of Scotland's
chief executive, told reporters, ``We are offering Natwest
shareholders a better proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We aim to reverse Natwest's underperformance in its core
business,'' he said. ``We aim to divest the noncore business, and
we expect to see substantial future capital returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Shaw, the governor of Bank of Scotland, said, ``We
continue to believe more value could be created for shareholders
through a concerted effort to eliminate costs within the Natwest
banking business.''
</P>
<P>
   Natwest declined all comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In a notable twist, Bank of Scotland is being advised by
Gleacher &AMP; Co., which Natwest sold in April. Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and Credit Suisse First Boston are also advising the Scots.
J.P. Morgan is advising Natwest.
</P>
<P>
   With a market value at Thursday's close of 17.7 billion pounds,
or $29 billion, National Westminster is almost twice the size of
the Bank of Scotland, whose market capitalization was 8.9 billion
pounds, or $14.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the two banks' performance has been radically different.
Profit at the Bank of Scotland has doubled in the last five years,
while National Westminster has been held back by rising costs,
particularly at its 1,730 branches in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts tended to agree with Bank of Scotland's approach of
lobbying against Natwest's acquisition of Legal and General, which
they said the bank offered too much for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer,'' Tyce of SG Securities said. ``You have to
vote to scrap this stupid deal and take the money from the Bank of
Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham Wood, head of British equities at Standard Life
Investments _ which owns 2.6 percent of Natwest, 2.6 percent of
Legal and General and 1.9 percent of Bank of Scotland _ applauded
the possibility that the Scottish bank might buy Natwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the fact that this bid produces an alternative
route to get value for Natwest shares,'' he said. ``I am not going
to commit myself on how we are going to vote on this,'' he added.
``It is a hostile bid, and I think this is just the start. There
will be a lot more that happens before this gets to the final
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether other suitors will emerge, but ``the
market is anticipating another bidder,'' said Robin Down, a banking
analyst at ABN Amro in London. ``Frankly, I'd be surprised if there
wasn't a counteroffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts said that there were not many banks in Britain
that could acquire Natwest without raising the red flags of
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bank of Scotland, one institution mentioned as a possible
suitor, has said only that it is monitoring the situation. Abbey
National PLC and Halifax PLC could also be bidders, though analysts
said their chances were slim.
</P>
<P>
   British regulators could make it difficult for an outsider from
the Continent or the United States to join in a battle because, as
in France and elsewhere in Europe, British banking is something of
a jealously guarded national prize. And analysts said that the very
nature of Natwest as a bank associated with Britain's retail market
might make it less attractive for outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Scotland said that there would be job losses among
National Westminster's 64,400 employees, but that this would be
achieved largely through voluntary departures and attrition. Bank
of Scotland employs 22,700 people.
</P>
<P>
   The bank made headlines in the United States earlier this year
when it backed out of a proposed joint banking venture with the
Rev. Pat Robertson, the television evangelist, after protests over
Robertson's disparaging remarks about Scotland and homosexuals. As
the venture was being delayed, Robertson referred to Scotland as a
``dark place'' where ``you can't believe how strong the homosexuals
are.'' The venture was to have started a television banking service
in the United States.

IN HOME OWNERSHIP DATA, A HIDDEN GENERATION GAP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rising home ownership is billed as one of the great rewards of
America's economic boom. And so it is: The percentage of households
that live in their own homes has never been greater. But examine
that touted superlative closely, and these gilded years come into
more sober focus.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nation's 103 million households, 66.6 percent occupy
homes owned by a member of the household. A chief ingredient of the
American dream is on track, statistically. The breakthrough came
early last year, when persistent home-buying everywhere in the
country finally carried the home ownership rate past the old record
of 65.8 percent, set in 1980. Households in every age group have
gained ground since 1995, when the boom years really got rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Go back only that far, and the economy has indeed lifted all
boats, to invoke an overworked metaphor. But go back to the early
1980s and a less sanguine story emerges. Households headed by older
Americans, it turns out, have carried the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, there would be no record. In every age group under
55, home ownership remains below where it was in the early 1980s.
Lifting all boats turns out to be the wrong metaphor; bailing them
out is more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really the story of the 1990s in general,'' said
Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government. Most people ``are still getting back to where they once
were, and they are not back there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For all who believe they see in the current prosperity a new era
of greater well-being, history is a useful antidote _ in this case,
the history of home ownership. It became widespread only after
World War II, when a booming economy, rising incomes, plentiful
jobs and the miracle of low-interest 30-year mortgages set off an
explosion of suburban construction and home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The people who are over 55 today bought in that era. Their
parents had been renters more than owners, so, naturally, as the
children have aged and have replaced their parents in the Census
Bureau's statistics, the rate of home ownership among older
Americans has risen smartly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bought before the affordability crunch, and it is just
gravy for them,'' said William Apgar, assistant secretary for
housing at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for today's under-55 generation. They got into home
ownership in a big way starting in the mid-1970s, just as home
prices and mortgage interest rates began to rise. Recession, rising
unemployment and stagnant wages threw up more obstacles. By the
early 1980s, the percentage of American households living in
owner-occupied homes had peaked _ and then declined steadily for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Affordability was not the only issue. The proliferation of
single-parent households contributed to the trend. So did the
tendency toward later marriage. ``The predisposition of nonmarried
people is to rent,'' said Nancy McCardle, a research analyst at
Harvard's Joint Center on Housing Studies. But affordability is the
big issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even among married couples in the under-44 age group _
encompassing the most important home-buying years _ the rate of
homeownership is not quite back to its 1982 level of 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The trends are similar among minority groups. The home ownership
rate among blacks, for example, has risen to 45.8 percent from 42
percent in 1993, a considerable increase. The Clinton
administration calls plenty of attention to this growth, whose time
frame coincides with the Clinton presidency. But black households
have recovered only the ground lost since 1983, when the rate was
45.6 percent. Viewed historically, blacks are, like so many others,
running in place.
</P>
<P>
   Or behind the curve: Homeowners today are much more highly
leveraged than 15 years ago. Then, a down payment equal to 15
percent of a home's price was common; now 5 percent or less is more
the norm, even to qualify for government-backed mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best of times, but how can you reach out to more
people when down-payments are already close to zero and both
spouses are working and trying to earn all that they can,'' said
Eric Belsky, executive director of the Harvard Center.
</P>
<P>
   Low mortgage interest rates have contributed mightily to the
revival in ownership, keeping homes affordable despite rising
prices. Still, owning a home is increasingly a wedge separating
low-income Americans from more prosperous households, even those
only moderately better off.
</P>
<P>
   Among homeowners, the median household income (half earn more,
half less) has risen to nearly $46,000, up 16 percent since 1982,
after adjusting for inflation. Home ownership has lately become too
expensive for those with less than $25,000 in annual income, many
experts say. More than 30 percent of all households fall into that
category.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a problem for democracy. Study after study has
shown that homeowners are much more active in their communities
than renters. ``Owning a home gets you rooted in a place,'' Jencks
said. ``You find yourself caring about the community, the politics,
the schools, the appearance of your neighborhood. You go to more
meetings and what happens at those meetings matters more. By and
large, these are good things. They are the American way.''

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ In a valley that celebrates its bumper crop
of winners, you might count people like Julian Cornejo as among the
losers. Cornejo, 55, a technician in computer-aided design, has
spent the last 15 years working as a kind of high-tech gypsy for
various temporary agencies, a situation that now leaves him nearly
broke and on the brink of homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary workers have become a hidden subculture here,''
Cornejo said. ``You don't enjoy the stock options or the holidays.
When you're laid off, you just bite the bullet. You don't get much
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornejo's experience as a temp, which included a financially
ruinous dispute with an employment agency over a workers'
compensation claim, has led him to support a new effort to organize
contingent workers throughout Silicon Valley. And the travails of
workers like him offer what union organizers see as a unique
opportunity to improve on the negligible headway they have made
among technology workers at established companies.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to organize the valley's huge army of temporary
workers also reflects growing concern about the widening gaps
between differing classes of workers in the high-tech economy of
the late 1990s. Research from both ends of the labor-management
spectrum shows that while top executives' compensation has been
soaring throughout the decade, the real wages of lower-end workers
have been stagnant or dropping, even in the pulsing heart of the
technology boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a myth that everyone is rich and that poverty is just
a transitional problem,'' said Bob Brownstein, policy director for
Working Partnerships, a labor-backed group that has studied the
valley economy. ``That is something that is simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownstein and several academic experts trace much of widening
class chasm to a shift by high-technology companies to hiring
temporary workers. Since the mid-1980s, employment in temporary
agencies in the valley has risen at twice the overall job growth
rate and now accounts for 27 percent to 40 percent of the total
work force, according to Chris Benner, a researcher for Working
Partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Wages for part-time workers _ mainly clerks, electronics
assembly workers and technicians _ have generally lagged behind
those of full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   Greater reliance on temps is a trend in many sectors of the
economy, but according to Brownstein, it represents an especially
stark shift in culture in the technology industry, where the role
models used to be giants like Intel and Hewlett-Packard that prided
themselves on generous, almost paternalistic employment policies.
</P>
<P>
   A new wave of companies, he said, reject such practices and
instead use temporary or contract labor to maintain flexibility
while restricting their permanent staff to a small number of core
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the valley's temps, like Cornejo, have
trade-school-taught computer and technology skills that once might
have spared them from the kinds of indignities more usually
associated with garment sweatshops or farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   No longer, said Erica Rios, a union organizer. Unlike the young
programmers and engineers who work crushing hours but can hope to
join in windfall profits through stock options and other
incentives, ``these workers do not feel they are part of the
high-tech industry,'' she observed. ``They play an important role
but feel totally unappreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Their disaffection is the starting point for organizing efforts
like Working Partnership's Temporary Workers Project. The project
includes setting up a temporary-workers' association, drafting a
new model code of conduct for employers and establishing a new
temporary agency called Together(AT)Work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rios said the effort sprang from workers' complaints that
the workers' compensation and health benefits offered by for-profit
temporary agencies are inadequate and that the agencies make it
difficult for workers to avail themselves of their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Cornejo said he filed a workers' compensation claim in February
1998 after experiencing a shoulder injury on the job at a local
semiconductor company, but received nothing until October, because
of what he called foot-dragging by the agency that had placed him;
the injury left him far behind on his bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agencies don't want to press a claim that may cost a
company something,'' he said. ``They don't want to bite the hand
that feeds them.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions may see an opportunity, but industry officials doubt
that labor will have any more luck organizing contingent workers
than they have had with full-timers. Carl Guardino, president of
the Silicon Valley Manufacturers Association, said unions simply do
not fit well into what he sees as the region's highly collaborative
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason that Silicon Valley has functioned so well
for so long _ and so many boats have risen _ is that there is not
so much of this `us versus them' that is associated with many of
the unions,'' Guardino said. ``I can appreciate that they are
looking at this sector. But will they be effective in Silicon
Valley? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the evidence backs him up. The organizing effort has not
succeeded in changing policies at major temporary agencies, and
after nine months in existence, Together(AT)Work has placed only
100 people. Yet both Ms. Rios and Christine Macias, who runs the
temporary agency, see their efforts as just the beginning of a
breakthrough for unions in an industry unfriendly to their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the issue of contract workers and their treatment
in the workplace has attracted media attention, including articles
in The San Jose Mercury News, and a California State Senate
committee plans hearings on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Brownstein says that the valley's image as the home of a new
democratic capitalism is beginning to wear thin, and that both
workers and employers are coming around to the idea that new
standards for temporary labor are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more people, even in industry, who fear
that the gap between the rich and poor is becoming the biggest
threat to the security of the valley,'' Brownstein said. ``You
don't have to be a Cassandra or a radical to know something needs
to change. That's the discussion we're trying to start.''

U.S. CENTER TO AID TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TIMOR-RDP) 
(HLW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Expecting continuing disaster in East and West
Timor, U.S. forces on Friday began setting up a center in Darwin,
Australia, to coordinate military and relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   This could mean sending more U.S. troops to East Timor,
according to Admiral Dennis Blair, the commander of U.S. forces in
the Pacific, who said that the United States promised to increase
its small contingent of 200 troops if the Australian commanders of
the mission consider it necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said that additional troops would be called in to do
``what we can do that others can't do as well,'' including
transport, intelligence as well as coordinating military and
civilian relief work. ``We'll be responding to the requests as they
come up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the people of East Timor have fled their homes and
are either taking shelter in the rubble of the destroyed towns or
hiding in the hills, according to the U.N. refugee organization,
and nearly 200,000 are taking refuge in West Timor, waiting for
emergency assistance and protection to return home.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of disease and a lack of food and water for homes
may result, according to a senior Pentagon official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to address this as an international
community as rapidly as possible,'' the official said. ``And that
challenge will extend not just to East Timor but, of course, to
West Timor.''

WHEN `HAVLICEK STOLE THE BALL!'

<P>
   No. 98 in the 100 most memorable sports moments of the 1900s
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell looked around the Celtics huddle and said, ``Will
somebody please take these goat horns off my head?''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds earlier, the Boston Celtics' leader had committed a
monumental mistake to give the hated Philadelphia 76ers a chance to
pull out the seventh and deciding game of the 1965 Eastern Division
finals at Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had the lead, 110-109, and the ball with six seconds
remaining when Russell, trying to throw the ball in bounds over
76ers center Wilt Chamberlain, hit a guy wire attached to the
backboard. That gave the ball back to the 76ers and set the stage
for one of the most legendary radio calls in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Hal Greer, on the baseline underneath the basket,
looked at the Celtics' defense, lofted the ball toward Chet Walker,
and ...
</P>
<P>
   ``HAVLICEK STOLE THE BALL! OVER TO SAM JONES. HAVLICEK STOLE THE
BALL! IT'S ALL OVER! IT'S ALL OVER! CELTICS WIN!'' screamed Celtics
broadcaster Johnny Most amid the bedlam inside the arena.
</P>
<P>
   After the Celtics routed the Lakers in five games of the Finals
to win their seventh consecutive NBA title, the Fleetwood Record
Co. of Revere, Mass., issued a record of the highlights of that
championship season. The title of the record was, of course,
``Havlicek Stole the Ball'' and featured the biggest homer in
sports, Most, in his irascible, us vs. them, the
Celtics-can-do-no-wrong view of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics fans, of course, loved it, snapping up 115,000 copies _
now collector's items _ and forever immortalizing John Havlicek,
who received more notoriety for that one deflected pass than the
many more remarkable accomplishments of his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting years later, Havlicek said, ``Thank God for Bill
Russell. What was going to be the most disappointing moment _ the
low point of his career, really _ is what made me famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks also to Most, already every bit as big a Celtics
tradition as the parquet floor, Auerbach, the banners and the black
high-top sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   As Celtics great Larry Bird once said of Most, ``He's great.
He's a homer. He lives and dies for us. What more can you ask of a
guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Havlicek said he had only one regret from that memorable night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sorry I missed Johnny Most on the radio. I bet he
went bonkers.'' \Ntagtop:Scott Monserud, (817) 390-7162

STOCKS REBOUND, BUT INVESTORS HAVE THE JITTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a volatile day of trading, which saw all the
major indexes down sharply during the day, stocks rebounded Friday
and finished off slightly. But while the market held together after
a big selloff Thursday, a host of concerns, including higher
interest rates, a weaker dollar and overvalued technology stocks,
will continue to trouble investors.
</P>
<P>
   The declines for the week left the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of
500 stocks just a fraction from a 10 percent decline since its July
16 high and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average off 9.2 percent
from its high of Aug. 25. The technology-heavy NASDAQ is 5.1
percent below its Sept. 10 high, but that is after a 13 percent
decline from July 17 to Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Where the market goes from here is difficult to say but
investors have many reasons to be jittery. The Federal Reserve
could raise interest rates for a third time since June when
policy-makers meet Oct. 5. The rebound of the economies in Asia and
Europe are making those markets more attractive, which could drag
investors away from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of foreign investors back into Japan is the main reason
for the dollar's dramatic slump against the Japanese yen over the
last 10 weeks. Although the dollar is off 15 percent against the
yen, it is not significantly weaker against the world's other major
currencies. But a continued slide against the yen could still help
pull stocks lower as Americans fear a flight of Japanese investors
back home.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called confessional season on earnings is also under way
and more negative announcements about missing earnings estimates
could rattle the market in the current environment even though
earnings growth for the third quarter is expected to be strong.
Apple Computer and FDX Corp. are among the major companies to issue
recent warnings.n
</P>
<P>
   But this wave of concern has not reined in all the exuberance
that had sent stocks so high. Another new issue of an Internet
stock took off Friday as shares in Alteon Websystems jumped from
their initial offering price of $19 a share to $74 15/16. Several
other IPOs also did well Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished at 10,279.33, down 39.26 points or 0.4 percent,
after falling as much as 131 points in the afternoon. The S&AMP;P 500
dropped as much as 16 points before ending down 3.05 points, or 0.2
percent, at 1,277.36. The NASDAQ composite index fell 9.42 points,
or 0.3 percent, to 2,740.41. It was down as much as 65 points.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow was down 524 points, or 4.9 percent, its
worst weekly performance in a year. It is now 1,046.71 points below
its all-time high, reached Aug. 25. This week it also broke through
the bottom of the trading range it had been in since mid-May. Now
the Dow is back to where it was on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the Dow is still up 12 percent and the NASDAQ 25
percent. But the S&AMP;P is now up only 3.92 percent, which if held
would be the poorest annual performance since 1994. The poorer
performance of the S&AMP;P, which is a broader index than the other
two, reflects how this year's rally has been concentrated in a few
technology and other big name and big company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood
Walker in Baltimore, said the market was in a valuation correction,
a decline that occurs when stock prices far outstrip their promised
earnings. He does not think that the bottom has been hit yet. But
he said ``we are a lot closer to it than some people might think.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures that the market will have gotten back on a more
secure footing when more than 50 percent of the stocks in the S&AMP;P
500 index have declined 10 percent or more from their 52-week
highs. As of Friday, 43.6 percent of the S&AMP;P 500 was in that
category. Another sign that stock valuations were back in
attractive ranges would be 20 percent of the S&AMP;P 500 stocks down 30
percent or more from their 52-week highs. Just over 10 percent of
the S&AMP;P are in that category now.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the recent decline, Cripps said, is that he
thinks the Federal Reserve is much less likely now to raise its
interest rate target a third time. ``The fact that the stock market
has cooled off takes away a reason to act,'' he said. Fed officials
have said repeatedly that the rally in the stock market this year
has helped fuel the consumer spending that is keeping the economy
growing at a pace that is faster than the policy-makers would like.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This week's stock selling has given a lift to the bond market,
pushing the yield on the 30-year bond below 6 percent again.
Friday, as more investors chose the relative safety of bonds, the
price of the 30-year bond rose 9/32 to 102 7/32. The yield, which
moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.96 percent, down from
5.98 percent Thursday. The yield on the 30-year bond yield has
crossed the 6 percent level more than a dozen times since June.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the two-year note, which is more sensitive to Fed
interest rate moves, was unchanged as the yield remained at 5.53
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise, the dollar rose against the Japanese yen for the
first time in five trading days. The small rally came despite
comments from Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers on Thursday that
seemed to rule out any effort by the United States to help support
the dollar against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar inched up to 104.17 yen from 103.95 on Thursday. The
euro, the new 11-country European currency, rose slightly against
the dollar, finishing at $1.0464 from $1.0440 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But currency analysts expect the decline in the dollar against
the yen to resume because the Bank of Japan has apparently decided
not to move to slow the Japanese currency's rally even though it
could be a threat to Japan's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, stocks fell Friday with the Nikkei index of 225 stocks
dropping 454.03, or 2.6 percent, to 16,871.73. In the last two
trading days the benchmark stock index has fallen 5.9 percent.
After a rise of 33.9 percent this year, this selling could be a
signal by some investors that they are worried that the
strengthening yen cold trip up the emerging economic recovery in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co., Intel Corp., MCI WorldCom and Pfizer led the market
lower. And it took most of the day for the technology sector to
shed the hangover from Thursday, when Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's
president, set off a rapid afternoon selloff when he said
technology stocks were absurdly overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   A $3 jump in IBM, which fell 3 3/16 on Thursday, helped the Dow
rebound from its lows. Internet stocks and other technology stocks
also rallied. Amazon and Ebay were both up after falling on
Thursday. Microsoft, which fell as much as 2 5/16 during the day,
finished down just 1/4.

ON THE TRAIL OF SAM RYDER'S HOLY GRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Fearing that I might someday be old enough to
play golf, I find myself trekking through the wilds of darkest
Brookline at 6 a.m. Friday in search of the holiest grail called
the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the secrets of golf are within the grail,'' I had been
advised by my Uncle Studley, a linksman of long standing. ``Seek it
out!'' Uncle has defined ``preferred lies'' as the tales he told
his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   I feel like the intrepid reporter Henry Stanley on an 1871
safari through the Ugandan bush trying to locate Rev. David
Livingston. Except that Stanley had guides, and porters to carry
his typewriter and other necessities while I'm lugging my computer,
hoping to discover an outpost named The Country Club where the
grail may be sequestered.
</P>
<P>
   Trudging into the heart of darkness is the only way, I'm told.
No autos allowed, even close. But as the sun begins to make itself
felt in this gilded ghetto, I can see that other seekers are up and
about and hurrying. Large structures behind high iron fences take
shape on Clyde Street in the early light _ perhaps fortresses,
prisons, or housing projects?
</P>
<P>
   One of them, though, is a residence of Mr. Mitch Kapor on nearby
Warren Street, and, according to a hand-lettered sign, offers
parking on the grounds for $50. It may help with the mortgage
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Parked in my way at the club entrance is a red fire truck. Is
there a conflagration? Private Joe Hingston of the Brookline Fire
Department informs me it's only a precaution _ ``In case Tiger
burns up the course.'' That would be the hotshot firebug Eldrich
(Tiger) Woods. Tiger, Tiger is not burning brightly. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 the gates open. The Carnival on Clyde has erupted.
Suddenly _ the golf rush is on. People are running frantically
through the entryway, as though reenacting the evacuation of
Saigon. A volunteer worker, rope-holder Penny Scheerer, is nimble
enough to avoid a trampling, saying, ``I hope I'm as lucky tomorrow
and Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Dew glitters on the vastness of greenth and a lyric from
``Oklahoma!'' is inescapable: ``There's a bright golden haze on the
meadow . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   My friend, Aurelio, paying her first call, approves. ``The
landscape . . . the trees . . . the dappled sunlight and shadows .
. . the raked sand like a Japanese garden . . . it's magical.''
She's right.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature, with some help from Bill Spence and his grounds
crew, has performed slendidly. So has sculptor Bob Pack, with his
life-sized bronze coupling of the sainted Ouimet (townie Francis
Ouimet, US Open winner over this terrain 86 years back), and
10-year-old caddie, Eddie Lowery.
</P>
<P>
   Some time ago I interviewed the local St. Francis, expecting to
be regaled with a recounting of the green amateur's great victory
of 1913 over the favored British pros Vardon and Ray. But, no.
Ouimet recalled that what stood out in his career was an irritation
named Bill Chick, an inability to beat this fellow Bostonian in
several local tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the mob is spreading out, moving quickly in many
directions, seeking choice viewing positions, or terrified that
merchandise will run out at the shopping tents. Before long
thousands and thousands of them cover the course. Some are slogging
from hole to hole in slow, hopeful lines, like crowds of refugees _
but refugees with Rolexes and American Excess cards.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that the most earnest aficionados among them,
tramping hill and dale, will get more exercise than the golfers
whose swings they covet. Many also exercise their vocal cords,
addressing the balls that have been addressed by the golfers with
strident commands, the most frequent being: ``Get up there!''
</P>
<P>
   Cheering explodes like infrequent artillery rounds, but the
roars are never where I am.
</P>
<P>
   Majestic oaks along the eighth fairway provide shade _ and
frustration. I am behind one, admiring the bark, getting a
marvelously obstructed nonview of a sensational putt by Hal Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Glimpses and partial glimpses of the participants are my
rewards. Across the same fairway I see the glistening iron at the
top of a Phil Mickelson backswing as he extricates the ball from a
mess of rough where David Duval had put it. Duval's errant shot had
brought groans, and justifiable scoldings _ ``I could have done
that'' _ from such numerous spectators as Tom Wheeler next to me.
Sometimes the gods play like mortals.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite station is on the soft grass beneath a weeping
willow, across a reflecting pond from the 10th green. It would be a
nice place for the losers to gather Sunday, to weep and console
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the golfers, inside the cordoning ropes, march
reporters, cameramen and ladies, usually blondes. Knowledgable Liz
Kahn of London's Mail on Sunday, informs me, ``They're the wives
and `whatevers.' '' Ah, chip-followers.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart is glimpsed through the branches of a pine on the
18th fairway. Aurelio admires his knickerbockers: ``He's so much
more stylish than the others.'' But not as stylish as a man who may
be buried in them, Gene Sarazen, a finder of the grail as victor
four times between 1927 and 1937. My shining memory of the courtly
Sarazen was his hole-in-one at Troon, Scotland, during the 1973
British Open. He was 71. ``It seemed like the thing to do,'' he
smiled. ``I won't be here again. Anyway, it was just a 5-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   It is afternoon, and hot now. I encounter a former government
employee, George Bush, who beat up on another townie, Michael
Dukakis, 11 years ago in another tournament, several million up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you play this game?'' he inquires. Not wishing to alibi
that I'm insufficiently aged, I confess honestly, ``Well, Mr.
President, I have actually played this course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot my weight, sir, as the guest of a member whose
membership was probably immediately revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that he expects to be joined here by sons Jeb and the
other George. ``We'll inundate the place.'' Since there may be two
or three Republican voters in The Country Club, they'll be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Evening arrives, and I haven't found the holiest grail.
Apparently it was on display at the opening services Thursday when
an invocation was delivered by an area clergywoman. It was then
revealed that the grail donor, Samuel Ryder, had contributed most
of his fortune to golf and religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any difference?'' asks my Uncle Studley, speaking for
the thousands on this acreage.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Almighty is interested in these proceedings is
unclear. But Biblical scholars will tell you that Moses got out of
the bullrushes with a wedge and a prayer.

steppe, the Soviet Union detonated more than 400 nuclear explosions
during the Cold War. On Saturday, if all goes well, the Earth is
expected to reverberate once more. But this time, the explosion in
the tunnel of an underground maze that once criss-crossed the
world's largest nuclear test range will be conventional, not
nuclear. And its goal is to insure that this site will be used for
war no more. The blast is also expected to scientists identify and
measure secret underground nuclear tests conducted by India,
Pakistan, China or by rogue states. By Judith Miller. (Scheduled to

ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER SOAP OPERA IN THE SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is annual debate about which conference is the nation's
best. With six teams ranked No. 20 or higher, the Big Ten can stake
a claim to the title. With two of the past three national
champions, the Southeastern Conference also has a right to beat its
chest and howl at the moon.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say this for the SEC: It's the best conference when it
comes to story lines. And it's rarely dull. This week, ``As The SEC
Turns'' provided lots of drama and interest. As is often the case,
the soap opera was bubbliest in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The main news involved the forced resignation of athletic
director Bob Bockrath, the former AD at Texas Tech and California.
Just another administration transaction, you say?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Bockrath is the third consecutive Alabama AD to be
fired. As Arkansas AD Frank Broyles put it, ``Bear spoiled them.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul ``Bear'' Bryant died in 1983, but his spirit is alive.
Bryant was 'Bama's football coach ``and'' athletic director when
that sort of arrangement was allowed, and each of his predecessors
gets compared to The Bear. You know how much The Bear is revered in
the state when you understand that the school's football coach and
athletic director rarely fail to measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Bockrath _ Bottom-Line Bob _ did wonders for the school's budget
and facilities, but he fell short in the personality category. And
his departure doesn't bode well for Crimson Tide coach Mike DuBose.
He's on a short leash (or noose).
</P>
<P>
   Bockrath's departure came the week after Alabama was shockingly
upset at home by Louisiana Tech. Bockrath hired DuBose and
supported the coach when he fibbed about a relationship with a
female athletic-department employee that sparked a
sexual-harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   With his top administrative supporter out, it appears the only
way DuBose can save his job is to reach the SEC championship game.
To do that, the Crimson Tide needs to beat No. 14 Arkansas today in
Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   How hot is DuBose's seat? No bricks have flown through his
office window yet, but they're already mentioning Clemson coach
Tommy Bowden as a possible successor. That classifies as
walking-on-the-sun hot.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, Alabama's bitter in-state rival, went through a similar
messy divorce last season when Terry Bowden resigned in
mid-October. His successor, Tommy Tuberville, is grateful that the
Alabama affair is taking some of the attention away from his 3-0
team's game with Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville, you see, left Ole Miss to take the Auburn job in
November. And while today's Colorado-Washington game has a juicy
ex-coach angle, the Auburn-Mississippi game has Rebels fans looking
for sweet revenge against the coach who jilted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are a lot of people in this state talking
about the game, and a lot of people in Oxford _ I'm sure when they
go to class, the players hear about this ballgame,'' said Ole Miss
coach David Cutcliffe, who was Tennessee's offensive coordinator
last season. ``I've taken the stand that this is a positive for us,
keeping the game on their mind and keeping them focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels were upset last week by Vanderbilt, and Auburn
recorded a surprisingly easy victory at Louisiana State. For Ole
Miss to have a chance in the SEC West race, it needs to win today.
Add in the incentive of playing against their former coach, and the
Rebels appear to have plenty of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a tough situation for our football team, but we're
looking forward to getting it over with and getting back to life,''
Tuberville said. ``I think after this game, everybody will kind of
forget about it; it'll come up maybe a little next year when we
play back in Oxford. But after this week, hopefully we'll get back
to normal.''
Spotlight
Samuel using successful mold to rebuild at New Mexico State
Tony Samuel knows how the system works. He's in his third season at
New Mexico State, one of Division I-A's wasteland programs. He's
slowly but surely done a good job of building a respectable
program. But the phone calls don't start coming until something
unusual happens.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Samuel has spent more time taking calls of
congratulation and doing interviews. That's because a week ago, the
Aggies upset No. 22 Arizona State, 35-7, in Tempe. The result and
the margin were equally shocking. Fans snuck into Aggie Memorial
Stadium on Saturday night and tore down both goal posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you're in a situation like we're in, and you beat at
top-25 team in their backyard, that's great,'' said Samuel, whose
team plays at UT-El Paso today in a game that counts as a Big West
Conference game because of a scheduling quirk. ``But you have to
keep it in perspective. It's one game, and we're playing again this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State hasn't had a winning season since 1992. The
school has been to three bowl games, the last in 1960. It has never
had a consensus All-American. Samuel, who was a 10-year assistant
at Nebraska, took over a program that had gone 1-10 in 1996 and had
won just 27 games over the previous 12 seasons. He admits that some
of his coaching friends compared the New Mexico State job to a
suicide mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like this was a diamond in the rough,'' said Samuel,
one of five minority head coaches in Division I-A. ``Scholarships
were down, and there was willingness to pay the price to win.
Beating Arizona State put us on the map. If we're pushing a rock up
the hill, it's not rolling back. We're on schedule. I don't know if
we're going fast or slow. We're making steady progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel is trying to mold the program in the image he knows best
_ think of New Mexico State as Nebraska Southwest. All of his
coaches _ including defensive coordinator Rich Glover _ played or
coached at Nebraska. The Aggies' offensive and defensive schemes
are practically carbon copies of the Huskers'.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, New Mexico State was seventh nationally in rushing
_ two-tenths of a yard behind Nebraska. This season, the Aggies are
third in rushing with 313 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor coach Kevin Steele, who coached at Nebraska with Samuel,
is an admirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 3-0 and rolling,'' Steele said this week. ``That
situation is a testament that if people are patient and hang in
there, good coaches can get a program turned around. He's got his
philosophy implemented, and now it's paying off. Tony is one of the
best football coaches I've ever worked with.''
Quick hits
From hurricane to Hurricanes This should be a week to savor a 3-0
start and prepare for a potential headline-making home game with
No. 9 Miami (Fla.). Instead, East Carolina's players have been
stranded by the flooding created by Hurricane Floyd. Last Saturday,
the Pirates beat South Carolina in Columbia. And that's been their
home away from home; returning to campus in Greenville, N.C., was
out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Today's game with the Hurricanes _ ironic nickname, right? _ has
been moved to Raleigh, N.C. East Carolina has been able to
practice, review tape and lift weights using South Carolina's
facilities. Most of the $250,000 that East Carolina received for
playing South Carolina has been spent on this extended and
unexpected road trip for the school's 100-member traveling party.
</P>
<P>
   A football game, no matter how important, seems trivial. About
25 players lost everything they owned when their apartments
flooded. Most of Greenville is without electricity, and drinking
water is unsafe. Your basic natural disaster. So this week, the
Pirates tried to make do as best they could. And having practices
to prepare for a game did provide a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're practicing, that's the only time we're not worrying
about what's going on back home,'' East Carolina coach Steve Logan
said. ``We're taking it day by day, moment by moment. We're going
to play. I just don't know how well we'll play.''
Marching to entertainment At least half the fun at two of today's
games should come at halftime. Here's the marching band scouting
report:
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's game with Stanford is a key Pacific-10 Conference game.
But at halftime, Stanford's irreverent and often politically
incorrect marching band figures to fire at an easy target _ UCLA's
recent handicapped parking pass scandal that involved several
members of the Bruins' team.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's marching band was banned from Notre Dame after a
scathing routine involving the Irish Potato Famine and was banished
from Oregon after making fun of the spotted owl. The band's scripts
must be approved before being performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't attack the handicapped, but rest assured, UCLA will
get its due,'' said Chris Henderson, the band's PR director and keg
drummer. ``That's all I can say at this point. The rest is
confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Rice is aiming for a sellout (yeah, right) of its
game with Navy. However, a bigger draw than the game figures to be
the halftime performance of the song ``Louie, Louie'' by the
Kingsmen. Their original recording is a longtime college party
favorite. At least 15 high school bands will be on hand for Band
Day, and they will join the Marching Owl Band and the Kingsmen at
halftime in performing ``Louie, Louie,'' which is Rice's unofficial
fight song.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation Top-ranked Florida State gets a passing grade
_ about a C-plus _ from Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden. Florida State
is allowing 17.7 points a game and is 51st in total defense (the
Seminoles were No. 1 in total defense last year). ``We haven't been
impressive yet,'' said Bowden, whose team plays at North Carolina
today. ``We've been winning because we have superior personnel. You
can have all them great players, but you've still got to put them
together. You've got to peak in November.''
</P>
<P>
   You wonder if the coaches who vote in the ESPN/''USA Today''
poll are paying attention. Miami (Fla.) loses in the last minute to
Penn State, and the coaches drop the Hurricanes from No. 9 to No.
13. And that's three spots behind Ohio State, a team Miami defeated
in the Kickoff Classic. ``It's a little disappointing because I
really feel like winning that game ought to carry some weight,''
Miami coach Butch Davis said, ``but it looks like, `What have you
done lately?'''
</P>
<P>
   After a closer-than-expected 24-21 victory over San Diego State,
Southern California called a players-only meeting. ``We talked
about people's attitudes toward coaches, about whether they were
getting the ball, or not playing enough,'' linebacker Markus Steele
said. ``You don't want that leading into the next game. Because
player attitudes can cost you. Certain players just called out
other players.'' No word on whether wide receiver R. Jay Soward was
discussed. Not exactly regarded as the ultimate team player, he was
openly sulking after making just two receptions against the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   Is it coach Hal Mumme's offensive system? Or is it the
quarterback? You decide. In his first three games as a starter,
these are Dusty Bonner's numbers: 92-of-133 (69.2 percent) passes
for 1,089 yards, 12 touchdowns and three interceptions. Here are
Tim Couch's numbers in his first three starts in 1997, his first
season as a starter for Mumme: 99-of-143 (69.2 percent) for 1,081
yards, 15 touchdowns and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off Cincinnati's upset of Wisconsin, Conference USA has
four chances at upsets today. Memphis is at No. 7 Tennessee,
Cincinnati is at No. 10 Ohio State, No. 9 Miami plays East Carolina
and Southern Miss is at No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M.
Quotes North Carolina coach Carl Torbush, whose team faces Florida
State today on kicker Sebastian Janikowski, who has 21 touchbacks
in 26 kickoffs:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just not a whole lot of use in working on your kickoff
return team this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State cornerback David Macklin on teammate Chafie Fields'
79-yard touchdown reception against Miami's Mike Rumph that gave
the Nittany Lions a 27-23 victory Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   ``I play that route against Chafie every day. When I saw how
that guy lined up against him, I was just thinking, `If we could
get him the ball, it might mean the game for us.' He's beaten me on
that \Rroute\S a few times, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois coach Ron Turner on his team's 41-36 victory over
Louisville:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was a shootout or not, but it was a heck of
a football game. If anybody watched this one and didn't like this
game, then they should go and watch soccer because they're not
football fans.`
By the numbers 0: Number of times Purdue quarterback Drew Brees has
been sacked. He has attempted 122 passes.
</P>
<P>
   2: The longest winning streak for Alabama under coach Mike
DuBose.
</P>
<P>
   13: The number of games it took Indiana quarterback Antwaan
Randle-El to accumulate career totals of 1,000 yards rushing and
2,000 yards passing. That's an NCAA record. Minnesota's Ricky
Foggie did it in 18 games, West Virginia's Major Harris in 19 and
Kansas State's Michael Bishop in 21.
</P>
<P>
   15: Number of consecutive Pacific-10 conference victories by
UCLA going into today's game with Stanford. The Bruins' last league
loss came in the first game of the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   16: Kent's losing streak, the longest in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   65: Career touchdowns for Miami (Ohio) running back Travis
Prentice. That ties him with Indiana's Anthony Thompson on the
career list. Prentice needs 11 more touchdowns to break the record
set by Texas' Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   88: Number of points Vanderbilt has scored in three games. Last
season, it took Vandy eight games to score 88 points.
</P>
<P>
   89: Arizona's ranking in total defense. Desert Swarm is no more.
The Wildcats are allowing 35 points and 416 yards per game.
Inside the numbers

   Delectable Options On the Grocer's Shelf &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George T. Shaheen, the chief executive who helped build Andersen
Consulting into the world's largest consulting firm, said last week
that he was leaving to become the chief of Webvan Group, an
Internet start-up in Foster City, Calif. It wasn't the first offer
Shaheen received recently. Last year, he was wooed for a top job at
EDS, but turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   So why leave the firm just as its protracted battle with its
sister accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, is coming to a head in
final hearings next month? One answer: stock options. Webvan, an
online grocer that plans to go public, has offered Shaheen a stake
of at least 3 percent, which could soon be worth tens of millions
of dollars if the offering is successful.
</P>
<P>
   But that certainly is not assured. While Shaheen is a whiz when
it comes to information technology and electronic commerce, it's
not clear what he knows about grocery shopping beyond what he might
have picked up from his parents, who ran a grocery store near
Peoria, Ill. His wife, Darlene, said this week that he has
accompanied her to the local market, Draeger's in Menlo Park,
Calif., on a few occasions. Now, she said, the family will be
buying its groceries on line.

   Erskine Bowles, the investment banker turned Clinton White House
chief of staff turned investment banker, continues to resist
another trip back into the public sector. After some pondering, he
recently turned down an offer to become interim chancellor of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Among the drawbacks:
no guarantee that he would become permanent chancellor. The interim
job eventually went to William O. McCoy, a retired BellSouth
executive, while a broader search is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a creature of the private sector, and I plan to stay there
for the foreseeable future,'' said Bowles, a 1967 North Carolina
graduate. He now divides his time between Charlotte, N.C., and New
York as managing director of Carousel Capital Partners, an
investment firm of which he was a co-founder, and general partner
of Forstmann Little.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles considered running for governor in North Carolina next
year, then decided against it. But don't count him out of the
public sector yet. He recently agreed to lead Gov. Jim Hunt's North
Carolina Rural Task Force, an economic development effort. As
Bowles explained, ``I'll always want to do my part to add to the
community woodpile.'' &QL;

last summer in the Adirondacks, McGinn, sailing in a race on Upper
St. Regis Lake, where he has a home, took on water through a hole
and sank. The boat, with one of his friends as owner and captain,
is one of only 12 idems, as they are called _ fast but
sophisticated 100-year-old wooden boats sailed only on that lake.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn was soon back. Another of the idems, which usually stay
in families for generations, was for sale. He bought it, and the
Upper St. Regis Yacht Club let the crew (including his wife,

finished fifth of the 11 still racing. (The 12th is in a museum.) &QL;

   When Bono, lead singer for U2, wanted to gain United States
support for the global Jubilee 2000 campaign to cancel Third World
debts, he began this spring by calling Bobby Shriver. As in, the
son of Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, nephew of John F.
Kennedy, brother of Maria Shriver. ``Take your pick,'' Shriver
said. ``I prefer to be called the brother-in-law of Arnold
Schwarzenegger.''
</P>
<P>
   Shriver, a former venture capitalist at James Wolfensohn's
investment bank, and his mother had worked with Bono on the Very
Special Christmas recording project, to benefit the Special
Olympics. For the debt forgiveness cause, inspired by the Bible's
mention of a debt amnesty every 49 years, Shriver has contributed
his financial acumen and arranged for Bono to meet with figures
including David Rockefeller; Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist,
and Wolfensohn, now president of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's been a great help in the U.S.,'' Bono said just after
a recent meeting with Robert Rubin, which Shriver had also
arranged. ``I don't want to be part of some sort of warm,
fuzzy-feeling initiative. I want the ideas to be rigorous.''

 &HT;    AirTran's new plane greeted with ceremony
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An airline that's been known for old planes now boasts
the newest one.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Airways on Friday showed off its first Boeing 717 at
Hartsfield International Airport, where the discount carrier will
begin putting the jet into service next month.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes, among the early-risers who turned out
for a 7:17 a.m. ceremony on Concourse C, declared himself duly
impressed after a tour of the new jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is or not, it looks tall on the inside,'' Barnes
observed, adding he also likes the handrails along the overhead
luggage bins. ``I'm always jostling back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also endorsed AirTran's competitive impact at
Hartsfield, where it nips at the heels of local colossus Delta Air
Lines. ``AirTran has brought competition and reduced fares,''
Barnes said. ``That's really the American system, you know. I'm
glad AirTran's here.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTran, based in Orlando, Fla., but operationally based at
Hartsfield, is the first airline to buy the twin-engine 717. The
plane is essentially a fourth-generation update of the DC-9s
AirTran now flies.
</P>
<P>
   Though outwardly almost indistinguishable from the DC-9, the 717
has more powerful engines and updated cockpit technology.
</P>
<P>
   For passengers, the plane has larger overhead bins and an extra
lavatory.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joe Leonard said
the 717's arrival makes a broader statement about the carrier,
which has struggled to overcome its history as the tragedy-scarred
ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says we're here to stay, we're modern, we're high-tech and
we're safe,'' Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran gets seven more 717s from Boeing this year and 50 by
2002. They'll replace most of the DC-9s, which average 27 1/2 years
old, though some of those planes will remain in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The 717s begin entering service around Oct. 14, following crew
training.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran placed a $1 billion order for the planes in 1995, when
it was still known as ValuJet and the 717 was a drawing-board
design called the McDonnell Douglas MD-95.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since then. Friday's ceremony came two years to
the day after ValuJet changed its name to AirTran in a bid for a
fresh start after the 1996 crash of Flight 592.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McDonnell Douglas has been absorbed by Boeing, which
redubbed the MD-95 the 717.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, a one-time Eastern Airlines executive hired to take
over AirTran's recovery effort in January, has recruited a new top
management team. ValuJet co-founders Robert Priddy and Lewis Jordan
remain major shareholders and directors of AirTran but have no
management roles and didn't attend Friday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran's prospects have brightened with back-to-back profits in
the past two quarters, although third-quarter results will
undershoot Wall Street expectations because of Hurricane Floyd and
capacity increases by other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's becoming a great turnaround story,'' said veteran
Wall Street airline watcher Julius Maldutis of CIBC World Markets.
``The new planes can only help.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all analysts are as sanguine, and AirTran stock has been
stuck around $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market still does not believe this company has turned the
corner,'' Maldutis said. ``It's going to take sustained earnings
results.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTran has logged slow but steady increases in ridership this
year. Leonard said the carrier has more than 1,000 business
accounts, up from about 450 when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The 717 will not only provide an image boost _ the airline has
run TV ads heralding its arrival _ but will also cut costs, Leonard
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane burns 20 percent less fuel than the DC-9. In addition,
the new planes come with a Boeing warranty and will have lower
maintenance costs. AirTran estimates costs of operating 50 717s
will be $65 million a year less than what its current fleet of 44
DC-9s and four 737s cost to fly.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the planes aren't free. AirTran has interim
financing for initial deliveries but is still negotiating for
long-term financing, Leonard said. He noted that the $20
million-a-plane price tag, which ValuJet was able to negotiate
because McDonnell Douglas needed a launch customer, is less than
what some regional airlines are paying for jets half the size.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said AirTran's capacity will remain almost flat this
year, as older planes are retired when the new ones arrive. But in
2000 the airline plans to boost seat capacity 7 percent and add
flights from Hartsfield, he added.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran now has 135 daily departures to 30 cities from Atlanta.
It is reconfiguring its 18 gates at Hartsfield to eventually have
200 daily flights over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran gave the first 717 a name, ``Esprit de Corps,''
suggested by flight attendant Tana Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOEING 717
</P>
<P>
   Seats: 105 in coach in a 3-2 layout, 12 in business-class in 2-2
layout.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $20 million each, under 1995 launch order negotiated by
ValuJet.
</P>
<P>
   Background: Fourth in a series of narrowbodies that includes the
DC-9, MD-80 and MD-90. (Those models were built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing.)
</P>
<P>
   Features: New engines burn less fuel and are quieter and less
polluting than previous models. Updated cockpit. Passenger cabin
has bigger overhead bins with handrails.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery schedule: AirTran is scheduled to get eight this year,
eight in 2000, 12 in 2001 and 22 in 2002.

AFRICAN VIRUS MAY HAVE CAUSED MOSQUITO-BORNE ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mosquito-borne illness that has killed three
people in New York City may not have been St. Louis encephalitis,
as experts thought, but may have been a similar disease that has
never been diagnosed in the Western hemisphere, government
scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, West Nile virus, was discovered this week in dozens
of birds that died in and around the Bronx Zoo this summer. The
virus is indigenous to north and east Africa and Asia, and
occasionally makes its way to Europe, but it has never been found
in birds or humans in the Americas, said Duane Gubler, the director
of the division of vector-borne infectious disease for the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, the illness that has infected at least 14 people
in New York City and four in Westchester County was believed to be
St. Louis encephalitis, which was surprising enough, because that
disease is rarely found outside the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of tests will be needed before health officials are sure
whether the people stricken were infected by some type of West Nile
viruslike illness or St. Louis encephalitis. Officials at the CDC
said they hope to complete the tests next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery of the West Nile strain in the birds has cast
doubt on the original diagnosis, officials said. ``West Nile virus
is closely related to St. Louis encephalitis, the virus we thought
was causing the outbreak,'' Gubler said. The discovery of the dead
birds, he added, ``has caused some confusion as to whether that is
true now.''
</P>
<P>
   If officials confirm that the disease that sickened New Yorkers
was the West Nile virus, it would have no practical effect on those
who have become ill, or on the efforts to prevent the disease from
spreading. Both illnesses are transmitted from birds to mosquitoes
to people, via the same type of mosquito. The insecticide used to
kill those mosquitoes is exactly the same.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of both illnesses are virtually the same and are
usually mild, though in rare cases they can cause neurological
disorders and even death. Experts said those severe cases _ which
generally involve the elderly, children under 5 and those with
compromised immune systems _ are even less frequent with West Nile
virus. With both illnesses, there is no cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important message to get across is that all the public
health and responsive measures implemented are the same,'' said Tom
Skinner, a spokesman at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   But from an epidemiological standpoint, the discovery of West
Nile virus in New York is stunning. ``This is exciting,'' said
Gubler. ``We prefer it didn't occur, but it is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing in the waning years of the late 20th
century is the transport and movement of these viruses in new
areas,'' he added. ``And you get a virus moving into a new area,
the entire mosquito population is susceptible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday, two elderly women were added to the list of confirmed
cases of the mosquito-borne illness. One of the women, who is 90
years old and in critical condition, was the first case to be
confirmed in Manhattan since the outbreak began in August.
</P>
<P>
   Now, old and new blood samples from humans and roughly 450
birds, as well as trapped mosquitoes, will be examined by the CDC,
which will try to determine whether the West Nile virus found in
the birds was what caused the New Yorkers to become ill.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the diagnosis of those who are ill may
have been mistaken, experts said _ the two illnesses are very
similar, and few would have thought to look for an illness whose
closest brush with this country was in France in the 1960s. The
worst modern outbreak of West Nile disease was in Romania in 1996,
when 90,000 cases were confirmed and 17 people died.

FRESHLY CUT US TEAM COULDN'T PREVENT A SHEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Team solidarity in the form of buzz haircuts
didn't work. Phil Mickelson's new 'do didn't prevent him from
imitating Bill Buckner on the first day of Ryder Cup play.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. If the Yanks had come out smoking after succumbing to
the scissors, it might have been the most significant event in
haircut history since Astrid Kirchherr styled the locks of four
lads from Liverpool in Hamburg in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   With one day of team play complete, it's Old Europe 6, United
States 2. Six, two, and not even. What an ``exhibition.'' Score one
for Old Hair over New Hair.
</P>
<P>
   The US players tried, folks. They really tried. Those who
believe America's Ryder Cup golfers have no team spirit can tell it
to the folks over at the Beaucage hair salon in Boston. When the
American team needed a spiritual stylist to cut hair on the eve of
golf's Big Event, Beaucage got the call from the Four Seasons
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, they all planned to shave their heads as a show of
team unity,'' said Beaucage stylist Henry Stonie, ``but I think
they lost their nerve a little bit when we actually showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The US players have been battling an image that paints them as
self-absorbed millionaires. It's supposed to be one of the reasons
they fail in team golf. When the Americans convened for dinner in a
Four Seasons function room on the eve of the first matches, the
call went out for some scissors, razors, and stylists.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Boudreau, owner of Beaucage _ not to be confused with
Floyd's Barber Shop _ sent two employees to the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau does not keep a photograph of every head he's had the
pleasure to know, but his shop has been a haircut home to Cher,
Prince, Cybill Shepherd, Coretta Scott King, and Winona Ryder. And
now they have Tiger clippings, which might fetch something in the
memorabilia market.
</P>
<P>
   Stylist Stonie knows nothing about golf, but he knew Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   It was an odd setting. American team members were eating and
drinking with their wives and girlfriends when they decided team
haircuts would be a unifying act. Sheets were set down on the floor
of the room and players sat in banquet chairs to have their bangs
clipped. Davis Love, Mickelson, and David Duval followed Tiger to
the chair while other players photographed the event.
</P>
<P>
   US captain Ben Crenshaw also had his hair cut _ but not a buzz.
``We had two captains come in and say a few words,'' he said.
``This team is so very together. We depend on each other. It's a
wonderful thing to see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell there was all this bravado in the room,''
recalled Stonie. ``This was right before their big pep talk and
this was a way of bringing everyone together. Tiger Woods came up
to me and said, `Hi, I'm Tiger,' and sat right down in the chair.
There was no attitude. He likes his hair shaved to the skin. Then
there was this other player, I didn't know (Love). His hair was a
little long, over his ears, and I just cut it short. Too bad. It
would have been fabulous if they all showed up with shaved heads at
the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Stonie normally gets $45 for a haircut, but the salon charges
double for house calls. Stonie said he was generously tipped by a
PGA official.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized hair is a time-tested display of team solidarity.
Members of the Romanian national soccer team dyed their hair yellow
(the Romanian flag is yellow and blue, but the players opted for
yellow) when they made it to the second round of the 1998 World
Cup. Several members of the US women's soccer team went with red,
white, and blue hair for the 1999 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Hair uniformity sometimes supplies a competitive edge. In
Barcelona in 1992, members of the US men's Olympic volleyball team
shaved their heads after a bogus foul was called on bald teammate
Bob Samuelson. US players believed the officials were picking on
Samuelson, but when the whole team went bald, the refs were unable
to find their favorite target.
</P>
<P>
   And now we have some of our golf lads showing the world that
they truly care about each other and the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon, a member of American Ryder Cup teams in 1995 and
'97, said, ``I think it's fun for them to do that. Anything to
unify the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic didn't work. Closely-cropped Tiger and balding Tom
Lehman got smoked by Sergio Garcia (who already has a buzz) and
Jesper Parnevik in the morning and the sheared tandem of Duval and
Mickelson fared even worse against Colin Montgomerie and Paul
Lawrie. Then Mickelson spit in the bit in the second game of the
doubleheader. Two close shaves, both misses. Give the poor man his
hair back.

ARUM MUST PAY KING'S RANSOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  You can wager your favorite Oscar De La Hoya doll _ you wind
it up and it walks backward _ that Don King will seek some
semblance of financial parity with Bob Arum if there is going to be
a rematch between De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   As you might have heard, De La Hoya wound up earning between $23
million and $24 million last Saturday night against Felix Trinidad
to establish himself as the most overpaid hoofer in the history of
song and dance.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the $14 million that Arum reportedly earned that will
assure King of being a tough negotiator when he and Arum desist
with their shrill rhetoric and sit down to work out the numbers for
De La Hoya-Trinidad II.
</P>
<P>
   You see, King, whose fondness for theatrical showmanship is
exceeded only by his fondness for money, wound up taking home a
mere pittance $2 million from a yawn of a fight that didn't come
faintly close to living up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad made $8.5 million for chasing the ever-retreating De La
Hoya around the ring for 12 rounds at the Mandalay Bay Events
Center.
</P>
<P>
   With Trinidad now holding the welterweight title belts of the
WBC and IBF and with another King fighter, James Page, possessing
the WBA belt, King will command far more leverage in the next De La
Hoya-Trinidad negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt if Don King will give his consent to a rematch unless
Trinidad is guaranteed of earning the same wages as De La Hoya and,
more importantly to King, King is guaranteed of earning more than
Arum.
</P>
<P>
   Unless those two developments unfold, there won't be a rematch,
which I would gladly applaud. ...
</P>
<P>
   The De La Hoya camp can spin its hero's first defeat all it
wants and Bob Arum, Bill (Bozo) Caplan and the others already are
orchestrating revisionist history but the fact remains De La Hoya
went into a timid shell the final three rounds and didn't deserve
the decision over Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   If De La Hoya had done what he was supposed to do for the many
millions he was earning actually fight instead of run then he
probably would have emerged with a stirring triumph.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care what Arum, Caplan or the others say, the bottom
line is that De La Hoya acquitted himself in a manner befitting
of &UR;  &LR; the nickname affixed to him by Michael Katz of the New York
Daily News and picked up by the Trinidad people, Chicken De La
Hoya. ...
</P>
<P>
   Spoke to the HBO's extraordinary analyst, Larry Merchant, who
had De La Hoya a 6-5-1 winner, and he said: ``De La Hoya would have
been disqualified in the amateurs for the way he ran during the
final three rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Merchant was harassed by Julio Cesar Chavez and
his cowardly entourage after the De La Hoya-Trinidad fight and only
the intervention of Las Vegas police prevented what would have been
a terribly ugly scene. ...
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West tells me Shaquille O'Neal has dropped 15 pounds, and
predicts O'Neal will be even more dominant this season than he has
been in the past for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille looks in sensational shape,'' says West.
</P>
<P>
   Does this new-look O'Neal mean that the Lakers' center will
actually concentrate this winter as much on blocking shots and
grabbing rebounds as he does on dunking the basketball
</P>
<P>
   ? ...
</P>
<P>
   West was ringside at the De La Hoya-Trinidad fight, and had
Trinidad winning by a couple of points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar looked as though he were trying to figure out how to
escape from the ring in the final few rounds,'' observed West.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. ...
</P>
<P>
   The best NFL team I've seen this month is the Oakland Raiders.
I'm still skeptical how far the Raiders can go with a lifetime
journeyman quarterback, Rich Gannon, at the controls, but Al Davis
finally seems to have stacked his roster with talented, disciplined
players who understand how to play the game. ...
</P>
<P>
   USC track coach Ron Allice, on the athletic and academic upswing
taking place at Long Beach State: ``Two factors have changed
everything at the college in recent years  &UR; _  &LR; the Pyramid and Bob
Maxson (the school's president).''
</P>
<P>
   I agree. ...
</P>
<P>
   The resilient Atlanta Braves, despite all their injuries, have
refused to buckle and seemed to have withstood a serious challenge
to their N.L. Eastern Division supremacy from the New York Mets.
The Mets have superior position players, but they can't match
either the Braves' superlative pitching or the clutch antics of
Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves remind me of the 1988 Dodgers, who lost Pedro
Guerrero and Fernando Valenzuela with injuries but still went on to
win a world title. ...
</P>
<P>
   I have an overwhelming feeling that the Minnesota Vikings one
day if not now will regret handing 31-year-old Brad Johnson over to
the Washington Redskins and keeping 36-year-old Randall Cunningham.
...
</P>
<P>
   This riveting battle that the Dodgers and San Diego Padres are
staging for third place in the N.L. West Division has me on nightly
edge. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've been trying to figure out who's had more useless RBI this
season between the Angels' Mo Vaughn and the Dodgers' Gary
Sheffield. It looks like a draw to me. ...
</P>
<P>
   Will someone please explain to me why Notre Dame hired Bob
Davies as its coach in the first place?. ...
</P>
<P>
   Phil Trani had a lengthy phone conversation with the Chicago
Bears' rookie quarterback, Cade McNown the other evening.
Naturally, McNown is not thrilled about playing behind Shane
Matthews. ...
</P>
<P>
   Someone should explain to Oscar De La Hoya that the object of a
boxer in a megabuck promotion is not only to win, but also to
entertain. De La Hoya dispensed an absolute stinker, and I wouldn't
pay 50 cents in his next pay-per-view show, much less 50 dollars.
...
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in my mind the Detroit Lions are better off
without Barry Sanders, but I'm not sure Barry Sanders is better
without the Detroit Lions. ...
</P>
<P>
   My pal the Downey Flash, Johnny Ortiz, has become a regular
boxing contributor on the Fred Wallin &AMP; Peter Vent sports talk show
at 9:30 on Saturday evenings on KRLA (AM 1110). Ortiz also has
written a memoir entitled, ``They Called Me Nero Because I Was
Always Fiddling Around,'' which soon will be in local book stores.
When the wages of sin are paid, ol' Johnny, who signed up for all
the romance languages when he attended college and was a wolf in
chic clothing, will get time and half for overtime. ...
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea how good or bad USC and UCLA are, but I suspect
I'll have a better idea after this weekend. ...
</P>
<P>
   If Oscar De La Hoya has regrets about the way he fought during
those final rounds against Felix Trinidad, he should be a true
sporting gentleman and give refunds to those who squandered their
money to watch such a disgusting, rip-off performance.

SAT ORGANIZATION IS SET TO JOIN WEB'S EDUCATION GOLD RUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under threat by the rapidly growing online industry that helps
students prepare for and select colleges, the College Board, the
nonprofit organization that administers the SAT, voted Friday to
create its first-ever for-profit subsidiary in a move to establish
a flashy full-service Web site of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote of the College Board's 24 trustees is a
radical shift for a staid 100-year-old group best known as the
objective overseer of college-entrance exams, thrusting an
institution honored for its dispassionate conservatism into the
big-money world of Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   It follows a spate of new advertisement-driven online ventures _
including an upgrade just this week of the Princeton Review's Web
site _ focusing on the lucrative high-school and college market, a
trend that has raised concerns about the commercialization of
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not willing to give up our not-for-profit expertise to
somebody who's just in it for the money,'' said Gaston Caperton,
who took over as president of the College Board in July. ``We have
the right values. We have the right goals. What we have to do is
have the right capital and expertise to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan for a Web site to cater to a college applicants' every
need, from financial aid forms to SAT tutoring, marks the
convergence of two major trends in education in the 1990s: the
expansion of for-profit enterprises, and the explosion of
electronic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in a world of piranha economics in regard to
education,'' said Arthur Levine, a scholar of higher education who
is president of Teacher's College at Columbia University. ``Every
Wall Street firm, seemingly, has an education department. Venture
capitalists are moving into this very quickly. Any nonprofit that
fails to recognize both the opportunities and the challenges that
come from the digital world is destined for extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   While most experts, including Levine, admired the College Board
for diving into a wave they see as inevitable, some said the
venture presents a conflict-of-interest. The plan calls for
Caperton to serve as the new company's chief executive, and the
trustees to retain majority-control of its board.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a pure educational mission, the organization would
now have the added motivation of money. That means trying to sell
products to students lured to the site, say, to register for the
Scholastic Assessment Tests, with the knowledge that a successful
Website could eventually go public and make everybody involved
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Caperton said it had to be a for-profit subsidiary in order to
entice the $10 million he has lined up in initial investments, and
to attract technological talent in a sphere where stock options are
essential to any job offer. But critics were more cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is drawing on their reputation and the
institutional endorsement they've had over the years and using that
to turn a dollar,'' said Scott Rice, an professor of English at San
Jose State University who is writing a book about the influence of
money in schools. ``A testing agency should be purer than Caesar's
wife. That's hardly the case if they're going to enter the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed site, www.collegeboard.com, would offer free or
low-cost tutoring for the tests the College Board sponsors and
guidance in navigating the admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   It would be funded in part by advertisers hawking computers,
cars and credit cards, with commercial links for everything from
opening a bank account to buying and selling furniture for dorm
rooms. Eventually, Caperton believes the new site could be used to
train teachers for Advanced Placement courses, or even to teach
those classes to students in schools where they are not available.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed venture comes at the conclusion of the most
competitive college-admission season in history. It would join a
flourishing cyber-crowd _ including the test-preparation giants
Princeton Review and Stanley Kaplan _ attempting to cater to that
throng.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to www.kaplan.com and www.review.com,
collegeboard.com would also compete with CollegeQuest.com,
embark.com and CollegeNet.com, all Web sites trying to serve as a
kind of electronic guidance counselor holding students' hands
through the college-selection process _ and making money along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's student loans or computers, a lot of people are
starting up these sites because advertisers want to reach these
kids,'' said John Katzman, the president of Princeton Review, whose
site charges colleges $2,000 to post their sales pitches, and plans
to eventually offer $800 test-prep courses online. ``You're hitting
the most achievement-oriented, brightest high-school seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar trend, some 500 colleges and universities have
contracted with a new company, Campus Pipeline, to run Web sites,
complete with advertising, on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   And Harvard University is currently pondering five paths it
could pursue in cyberspace, including a harvard.com venture that
would attempt to exploit for profit the school's platinum name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rule nothing out,'' Harvey Fineberg, Harvard's provost, told
the Boston Globe earlier this month. ``The boundaries between
for-profit and not-for-profit are much more flexible than they ever
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that the 56 million Americans between the ages
of 10 and 24 have some $278 billion of disposable income. About 5
million students are currently online, a number projected to
quadruple in the next three years.

about 50 million hits a month, officials said, and if current
trends hold, online registration for the Oct. 9 Scholastic
Assessment Tests will attract about 1 million students, or one out
of every three test-takers.
</P>
<P>
   But the current College Board site _ which will remain active
for guidance counselors and admissions officers _ is
``old-fashioned,'' Caperton said, filled with ``written stuff that
is put on the net.'' Plans for the new site are far more
interactive, with all the bells and whistles of the dot-com world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be innovative, aggressive, and use the same
kind of resources our competitors are using,'' Caperton said.
``This is an aggressive step. You've got to be aggressive in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The venture is a somewhat natural brainchild for Caperton, the
former Democratic governor of West Virginia, whose political legacy
was bringing computers to his state's impoverished schools. After
leaving office in 1996, he also focused on technology when he ran
the Institute on Education and Government at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a departure for the College Board, a membership
organization of some 3,300 schools and institutions that meets its
$250 million budget mainly through test-registration fees, dues and
sales of practice-exam books. It remains unclear what the role of
the colleges and other member institutions will be in the new
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to change the culture,'' said Donald M. Stewart,
Caperton's predecessor at the College Board, who ran the
organization for more than 12 years. ``Rather than having people as
volunteer educator-consultants, they'll have to be paid. If their
information and talent and ideas are being tapped for commercial
purposes, then this is a different culture. It's a different set of
incentives to participate.''

SOME SHAREHOLDERS SUE BANK OF NEW YORK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A shareholders lawsuit was filed on Friday against
the Bank of New York Co. and its directors, accusing them of
allowing Russian organized crime figures to launder billions of
dollars through the bank illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed as a purported class action on behalf of all
shareholders in the company, but that designation is subject to
approval by a federal judge. The suit, filed in Federal District
Court in Manhattan, seeks damages on behalf of the bank itself for
what the shareholders call reckless mismanagement of the company by
the directors.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating
suspicious money transfers through accounts at the Bank of New York
in the fall of 1998, but news of the investigation has only
recently become widely publicized. Investigators have found that at
least $4.2 billion, and perhaps as much as $10 billion, in Russian
money flowed through the bank, and they are working to determine
how it was used.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives have admitted lapses in procedures, including
the failure to challenge or halt suspicious activity in nine
accounts at the core of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the bank nor any employees have formally been charged
with any crimes. However, the bank has dismissed two employees, and
suspended a third.
</P>
<P>
   The case is a shareholder derivative suit, which allows
shareholders to sue corporate directors they contend mishandled
company affairs. Any damages awarded would go to the corporation,
rather than to the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   There was no response on Friday night to a telephone message
left for a spokesman for the bank.

 &HT;    Delta's top executive gets second bonus of $1 million
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines' top executive, Leo Mullin, got $1.7
million in cash compensation during the carrier's past fiscal year,
including his second consecutive $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are disclosed in the airline's proxy statement,
issued late Friday in advance of the annual shareholders meeting
Oct. 28 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin got $695,833 in base salary for the fiscal year that
ended June 30, according to the proxy. That was up from $571,250
for his first 10 months at Delta.
</P>
<P>
   In awarding the $1 million bonus, Delta's board of directors
cited the company's strong profits and ``continued improvements in
customer service and operations.'' It also boosted Mullin's base
salary to $700,000 for the current year.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman said Mullin's cash compensation is
third-highest among major airline chiefs, behind Continental CEO
Gordon Bethune and American CEO Donald Carty.
</P>
<P>
   As at many corporations, the bulk of long-term compensation for
Mullin and other Delta executives lies in stock options, which
offer potentially large payouts if shares rise above set targets.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin got 118,200 stock options last year, exercisable over 10
years. They are worth an estimated $2.5 million, according to a
standard value model required in proxies. When hired, Mullin had
received 1 million future options, valued then at $16.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin has yet to exercise any options, and Delta's recent stock
slump has sharply reduced their current value. Shares closed Friday
at $46.93 3/4, down 37 1/2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer Maurice Worth, who retired Sept. 1, got
combined salary and bonus of $1.16 million, up from $1.02 million a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Worth also got 63,200 future stock options, with an estimated
value of $1.3 million under the model used in the proxy.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Vice President Vicki Escarra, promoted to the top
customer service post last year, got $620,000 in salary and bonus.
She also got 233,000 future stock options with an estimated value
of $5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Vice Presidents Warren Jenson and Frederick Reid,
hired by Mullin in 1998, each got $925,000 in combined salary and
bonus. Reid got 125,000 future stock options with an estimated
value of $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jenson, who left Delta Sept. 7, received 4.6 million shares of
restricted stock and 500,000 stock options. By leaving, he
forfeited the options and kept only 24,800 restricted shares, worth
about $1.1 million.

STUPIDITY ON THE AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Andelman, a fixture on Boston radio for the last 30 years,
told WEEI listeners Friday that he thought Tiger Woods ``choked''
in the morning because ``he went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and got
a bone caught in his throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Even rich white people cringe when they hear such lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Fried Chicken?
</P>
<P>
   Choked?
</P>
<P>
   Not even Fuzzy Zoeller was that stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Andelman is.
</P>
<P>
   He has not only lost his fastball, he has lost his marbles. With
one offhand remark, Andelman has shown Ryder Cup visitors the other
Boston, the one without corporate tents, manicured greens, and, you
know, ``sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Andelman wasn't funny, nor was he right. Tiger didn't choke. He
and his partner, Tom Lehman, simply got beat by Sergio Garcia and
Jesper Parnevik in their foursomes match on the first day of Ryder
Cup competition. And to miss that suggests Andelman knows little
about sports, even less about golf, and nothing about gaining
admittance to (wink, wink) ``predominantly'' white country clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing the First Amendment protects such fools. If it
didn't, Andelman would have been taken off the air a long time ago,
not because of the outcries of offended blacks but by embarrassed
white folks, tired of having their ignorant cousins spitting in
their bottled water as they just try to get along at The Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   USA a winner
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   USA Network did a phenomenal job covering all of the action at
The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   When the cable station was focusing on one match and heard a
roar from the gallery of another, it quickly switched to a replay
of the significant shot. USA never missed a beat in what clearly is
a complicated event to cover.
</P>
<P>
   So much excitement, only one television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger on one shot, Jesper on another. There was so much going on
that Hal Sutton and Jeff Maggert, the only Americans to win, did
not dominate the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could have imagined that you would have needed a sedative
to watch golf?'' quipped Johnny Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was on USA along with other NBC on-air personnel because
while the cable station was televising the first day, it was a
production of NBC, which will carry Saturday's and Sunday's action.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was more dramatic than Phil Mickelson missing a 4
1/2-foot putt on the 18th hole during the first afternoon four-ball
match, giving Parnevik and Garcia a 1-up victory. Mickelson had
missed a similair putt on 16, and took quite a bit of time lining
up his shot on 18.
</P>
<P>
   All that time spent over the putt troubled Miller. ``This
concerns me,'' he said. ``You can over-think these things. Putting
is all about seeing it, feeling it, and getting up there and
hitting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said this putt was important not only because of the a
1/2-point swing but also for Mickelson's career. ``He's got to make
this putt,'' said the analyst, ``to become the player that everyone
thought that he would be.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mickelson missed it, NBC's Jim Gray interviewed him and
his partner, Jim Furyk. ``I don't know what to say,'' Mickelson
said. ``Both of those putts were low and away. It's certainly
disappointing. We played well throughout the day. I needed to make
those putts, and I just didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik demonstrated his class when he talked about the match.
``No one deserved to lose,'' he said. ``I was hoping that he did
make the putt, because they were playing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a Tom Lehman clip-in on the first hole of
the morning's foursomes, the Americans produced few highlights.
David Duval struggled, and the remainder of the team played solidly
but not spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   One complaint about the coverage: The score ought to be on the
screen all the time. With all the ebbs and flows of match play,
viewers are sometimes at a loss for the significance a particular
shot _ unless they know the score.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol has a valid point when he
argues that his job is to keep eyeballs on his network's coverage.
But most will stay tuned by choice, not because they are forced to
wait until a graphic appears or an announcer provides the score.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, viewers didn't have to wait long Friday, but for
those tuning in and out, which likely is the majority, a score as
an on-screen fixture would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if USA can have its logo plastered on the lower-right
corner all day, why not a score?

DAVIS LOVE PUTT SCORES A HALVE AT 25 FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Four-ball Match 2 
Davis Love and Justin Leonard, United States, halved with Colin
Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie, Europe. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The afternoon was dissolving toward disaster.
The Europeans were rolling, turning The Country Club into an
elongated Ryder Cup death march for the Americans, and Paul
Lawrie's putt for eagle on 14 had the Euros poised to take a 1-up
lead in the second of four four-ball matches Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Davis Love stood over his own 25-foot putt,
pulled back his club, and drained a matching eagle. The hole was
halved. The match stood all square. Suddenly, it looked like the
Yanks finally had found the emotional springboard they so
desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   Like some electrified end zone celebration, Justin Leonard ran
over to Love and stood chin to chin with his partner. They
exchanged a quick volley of emotional barks, squared up their
shoulders, and swashbuckled boldly on to No. 15. Chants of
``U-S-A'' cascaded from the gallery. More than four hours played,
four holes to go, and everything was even.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big putt,'' said Lawrie, referring to the emotional brick
wall that Love's eagle provided. ``And the one (on No. 18) also was
a hell of putt.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Love's putt on 18 that salvaged a half-point for the
Americans, ending a battle of 5 hours 20 minutes. Only minutes
earlier on 17, the Euros grabbed their first lead of the afternoon
when the sage and crafty Colin Montgomerie rolled in a 5-footer for
a birdie 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks were but one hole from giving up one more valuable
point, this time in a match they had never trailed for 16 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie then placed his second shot on No. 18 squarely on
the green, nothing less than a par waiting for him as he strode
almost majestically up the fairway. BBC commentators remarked that
Monty's wide chest was puffed up, how much he seemed to be enjoying
himself, how he looked so comfortable in his role as elder
statesman in charge.
</P>
<P>
   But Love, who earlier in the day aided partner Payne Stewart in
halving a round of foursomes, again responded under pressure. He
hammered his second shot some 20-plus feet past the pin on 18,
again stood calmly over his putt, and steered in a downhill,
left-to-right breaker for birdie. The packed gallery erupted in
jingoistic fervor, and moments later, Montgomerie saw his own
birdie attempt miss wide.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie made his way off the green, hopped into a waiting
car, and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got ahead,'' said Love, referring to the temporary 1-up
lead the Yanks took when Leonard rolled in a birdie putt on the
ninth hole. ``But we could never get 2 up. We just didn't get the
birdies we needed in the middle of the round, and you aren't going
to beat Colin Montgomerie without birdies. We were fortunate he
didn't have two or three himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Euros didn't erase the 1-up lead until the 13th. Montgomerie
made one of his patented approach shots and followed up with an
easy putt for birdie. The US lead had lasted three holes, just
under an hour and 20 minutes, all of which would have been a
meaningless footnote if not for Love's last, valuable putt.

ON VIEWER LIST, ESPN SERIES NO. 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America loves lists, and it doesn't matter what kind of list,
either. Ten largest potholes. Ten neighborhoods with the highest
crime rate. Ten thinnest supermodels. Ten worst Clipper seasons.
Twenty worst Clipper seasons. Americans just love rating anything
from top to bottom, or bottom to top in the case of David
Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has its own list going right now, a ranking of the top 100
athletes of the soon-to-end century that is causing angst within
the sports community.
</P>
<P>
   Three horses made the list, and a Bronco named John Elway was
left off. Two female athletes and a horse ranked higher than Mickey
Mantle. And even though the NFL rules the planet, only one NFL
player made the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is great. But what's overlooked in all the chit-chat
is the production value of ESPN's entire package, which includes
the 50 half-hour vignettes, four special theme shows on the
greatest games, coaches, dynasties and influential off-field
individuals, six SportsCentury SportsCenter-of-the-decade specials,
and hundreds of ``Classic Moments'' that have been airing all year.
</P>
<P>
   Every facet has been impeccably produced, from the golden hue in
interview segments of the athlete vignettes to the extra effort in
finding new and different voices to talk about the honorees.
</P>
<P>
   The writing has been excellent across the board. The six
different theme shows are hosted by important personalities outside
the usual sports arena, creating cultural significance. And the
SportsCenter flashbacks were also affectionately produced, down to
the use of hats and typewriters for segments on the '40s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, the SportsCentury package is every bit as good as
HBO's standard-setting sports documentaries and Ken Burns' 18{-hour
tome to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shapiro, a former producer in Los Angeles for ESPN's ``Up
Close'' and the first version of Jim Rome's TV show, is the
executive producer. He was the first person hired for the project,
and every decision beyond the rankings has been his.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a labor of love and will end as a labor of
love,'' Shapiro said. ``In between, there was a lot of labor. But
it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me, and that's the way
I've looked at it from beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   The mandate ESPN handed Shapiro was hefty. It wanted the series
to stand apart from what ESPN usually does, in part because
portions of it would air on ABC Sports (the top two athletes and
some of the other specials). The network backed its mandate by
giving Shapiro a staff of almost 100, 35 of them full-timers
dedicated to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be evocative,'' said Shapiro. ``Whether it was in
the words, music, photos or interviews, we wanted to draw people
in. Always, we wanted to set high journalistic standards that would
separate the athlete vignettes from the other features we've seen
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I always loved was interviewing and research. Anything I
do starts with research, and that's where we started this project.
We interviewed more than 1,500 people for these programs. We wanted
storytellers who would interpret the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been shows done on Muhammad Ali, and they've all
been great. So there was no way we were going to do the definitive
show on Ali in 20 minutes. We had to ask what we could do that was
different.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a high bar to set, but Shapiro and crew cleared it. For
example: The profiles of Nos.49 and 40 on the list, O.J. Simpson
and Lawrence Taylor, didn't gloss over their off-field notoriety.
The segment on Mickey Mantle, No.37, reflected his beloved status
against the personal problems that led to his premature passing.
</P>
<P>
   To give segments a different feel, Shapiro and his crew went to
Scotland to fetch images of Turnberry for the segment on Jack
Nicklaus, and to Zaire and Manilla for the segment on Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   The segments on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell (which
hasn't aired yet) looked at their reticence in the public eye and
the way it shadowed their lives. Russell, it turns out, is the only
athlete profiled who declined to be interviewed for his own
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a universal look (for the athlete segments),''
Shapiro said. ``John Walsh (ESPN's executive producer) came in
after the first one (on Chris Evert) and said `are they all going
to look like this?' That to me was the equivalent of Vince Lombardi
patting Jerry Kramer on the back and saying `You're going to play
great today.' It gave me the energy boost to do 49 more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want people we interviewed to look back and tell
stories. This wasn't a retrospective. I wanted to relive these
careers in the present tense. I wanted to relive the Thrilla in
Manila as if it happened last night. We wanted viewers to feel a
visceral response.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Smith, the nephew of late, great sportswriter Red Smith, was
the lead writer on the project, Bud Morgan the lead producer, and
Fred Christensen the senior producer. Smith and Morgan had spent
portions of their career at ABC Sports, writing and producing for
shows as varied as The American Sportsman and ABC's early Olympic
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan hardly fit the ESPN mold he's 69, and Shapiro had to talk
him into moving from L.A. to Bristol for two years. Christensen, a
longtime producer of ``Up Close'' for Roy Firestone, also had to
make the L.A.-to-Bristol jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know enough to do this all myself,'' said Shapiro, an
Iowa graduate who began his career at NBC Sports. ``I had to
surround myself with people who have been around the business and
around sports. Fred was incredibly valuable because of all the
people he knew from his days with Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a tough sell. You're selling the century. We all
won't be here the next time a century comes around. That was not
only part of the sell, but why we all wanted to make this stand
out.''
</P>
<P>
   It does. On a ranking of best millennium programming, it may be
remembered as No.1.
</P>
<P>
   __ More lists
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro removed himself from any consideration of who ranks
where. The rankings, limited to North American athletes, were an
internal decision made by ESPN, which relied on members of its own
family and a panel of 48 other well-known sports sources to put
together the top 100.
</P>
<P>
   The panel included: (sportscasters) Roone Arledge, Bob Costas,
Dick Enberg. Roy Firestone, Curt Gowdy, Bud Greenspan, Bryant
Gumbel, Keith Jackson, Jim McKay, Al Michaels, Vin Scully and Jim
Simpson; (sportswriters) Frank Deford, Mel Durslag, Sam Lacy,
Robert Lipstye, Mike Lupica, the late Jim Murray, the late Shirley
Povich, Bob Ryan, Dick Schaap; (dignitaries) Anita DeFrantz, Harry
Edwards, David Halberstam, Richard Lapchick, Burt Sugar, George
Will.
</P>
<P>
   There were bound to be disagreements over some of the
selections. Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders both made the top 100
ahead of athletes like John Elway, Johnny Bench and Sugar Ray
Leonard. There have been complaints about Martina Navratilova and
Babe Didrikson making the top 20 ahead of Larry Bird, Mickey Mantle
and Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I have a problem with Carl Lewis making the top 20.
He competed in four Olympics, won numerous gold medals, and
dominated the long jump during his career. But he never set the
world record in the long jump, and his 1988 100-meter world record
and gold medal came only because Ben Johnson was a dope.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Navratilova, No. 19 and will be profiled tonight at 7:30
p.m. The '80s SportsCenter decade, hosted by Susan Sarandon, also
airs today at 4 p.m. The '90s SportsCenter airs Nov. 12, hosted by
Billy Crystal. ESPN Classic is running a mini-marathon of
previously aired SportsCentury profiles Saturday starting at 9
a.m., from No. 30 to 19. And a coffee table book on the Top 100 is
due in book stores this month.
</P>
<P>
   __ And now the news
</P>
<P>
   NFL ratings were up again for Week2, with ESPN's Jets-Bills game
Sunday night posting ESPN's biggest Nielsen since 1995. ... The
Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad fight may have been a stinker, but
the PPV box office was huge 1.25 million buys and a gross of $64
million, both records for a non-heavyweight fight. ... The 49ers'
women's volleyball match at Pacific Saturday (2 p.m.) will air on
the University Television Channel (cable Channel 60 or 68 in Long
Beach, 25 in Lakewood) as well as the Orange County Newschannel
(OCN). ... Long Beach Ice Dogs coach and GM John Van Boxmeer guests
on Irv Kaze's KIEV (870 AM) talk show Saturday at 5 p.m. ...
Veteran L.A. sportscaster Gil Stratton will receive the Diamond
Circle award at the Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters dinner tonight.

5 QUESTIONS FOR BILL WALKER RESPONDING TO CALL OF DISASTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (af)  
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The devastating earthquake that struck Taiwan in the early hours
of last Tuesday also shook the ground under many a technology
executive's feet around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan plays a crucial role in the global computer industry: The
country is the fourth-largest producer of semiconductors and a
leader in memory chips, and its factories assemble a big chunk of
the world's desktop, portable and notebook computers, many under
contract for well-known American and Japanese brands.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Corp., whose logic chips are the brains in products
from Palm Pilots to safety systems in Mercedes-Benz cars, has few
operations of its own in Taiwan, just sales and marketing offices
and a chip design facility.
</P>
<P>
   But three of its important suppliers are there: the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and the United Microelectronics
Corp., ``chip foundries'' that make components for Motorola under
contract, and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, which assembles
and tests chips made at the foundries.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three suffered serious direct damage, but, like many
other Taiwanese manufacturers, they were forced to halt operations
by widespread power outages that the country is struggling to
repair.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walker, the Motorola vice president who oversees global
manufacturing, is the man charged with coping with the earthquake
and its disruptions. As he responded to questions last week, word
of new developments kept reaching him in his Austin, Texas, office
_ over his Motorola alphanumeric pager. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. News of the quake broke late Monday morning, Texas time. How
did it reach you, and what did you do first when you heard? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Less than an hour after the quake, Wayne Nesbit, the
Austin-based boss of the team that oversees operations in Taiwan,
notified me. Within minutes, we were in contact with our team in
Taiwan by phone and were able to confirm they were safe. The team
immediately went to visit the factories and gave us detailed
reports on their condition within hours.
</P>
<P>
   We learned that there was little apparent structural damage to
the facilities, but the power was off, and the extent of the impact
would not be known until power was restored. There were no injuries
to our employees or offices, and on Wednesday, power was restored
to our design center; it's back up and running.
</P>
<P>
   We updated our affected customers as quickly as we could. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Once you had an initial picture of the extent of damage, how
did you proceed? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We designated a team of people to mobilize, assess and react
as quickly as information could be obtained. They set up an
internal Motorola network and determined who the point people would
be, both in Taiwan and in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has employees who live right next to Hsinchu Science
Park, where most of the chip factories are located. They are
constantly going to the factories and getting on-the-spot reports
from factory representatives.
</P>
<P>
   So far, our people have been limited to the office areas of the
factories; the only people inside the operations areas have been
the emergency crews and start-up crews, the people whose job it is
to put machines back on line and recalibrate them as power comes
back up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were the Taiwanese companies with which Motorola does
business prepared for this disaster? Are you satisfied with their
response?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've been very impressed with the responsiveness of the
government and companies, given the level of the disaster. There's
been a tremendous amount of effort by the companies to keep us
informed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much production has been lost, and how are recovery
efforts progressing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. At all of the facilities, we are optimistic that this will
have only a short-term impact. In the ASE facility, we anticipate
getting back up very soon. I don't have any estimates of production
loss at this time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. At what point do you switch to using suppliers from other
parts of the world, and what is the cost associated with doing
this? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since we expect to have our Taiwanese suppliers back in
operation in the near future, we don't expect to have to turn to
our other resources for chip supplies. But in our overall sourcing
strategy, we're diversified around the world. So while this was a
disaster for Taiwan, in Motorola's overall semiconductor business,
we expect the earthquake will have minimal impact.

AIDS-POLICY EXPERT APPOINTED HEAD OF MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has chosen one of the
nation's leading experts on AIDS policy to run Medicaid, the health
insurance program for poor people and the disabled, administration
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Timothy Westmoreland, a 45-year-old lawyer, said he
would begin work on Oct. 18 as director of the Center for Medicaid
and State Operations, a unit of the Department of Health and Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid finances health care for more than 35 million people,
using $107 billion of federal money and $82 billion in state money
this year. But the program has often been neglected by federal
policy-makers, who devote far more attention to Medicare, the
health insurance program for elderly people and some of the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland will also supervise the Children's Health Insurance
Program, created in 1997 to provide coverage for uninsured children
not eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1995 Westmoreland worked for Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., on the staff of the health subcommittee of the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce. Westmoreland worked on
legislation affecting a wide range of programs and agencies,
including Medicaid and Medicare, family planning, mental health,
childhood immunizations and the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But his most important role was to make lawmakers aware of the
AIDS epidemic and to get money for AIDS research at a time when few
people understood the disease and the Reagan administration
resisted additional spending
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get members of Congress to respond to AIDS as
public health authorities and biomedical researchers encouraged
them to do,'' Westmoreland said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Shilts, a historian of the epidemic, wrote in 1987 that
Westmoreland had worked on AIDS ``longer than just about anyone on
Capitol Hill,'' starting with reports of the first cases, in 1981,
in Waxman's district. Westmoreland recently wrote a treatise on
Medicaid and AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid now finances care for at least half of all people with
AIDS in the United States and is the largest source of money for
that purpose, providing $3.9 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Westmoreland may help the administration expand
Medicaid to cover low-income people who have been infected with the
virus that causes AIDS, but have not shown symptoms of the disease.
Vice President Al Gore said in 1997 that such coverage could save
lives and might save money.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid pays medical bills for two-thirds of all nursing-home
residents, for most welfare recipients and for millions of people
who recently left welfare. In addition, it pays for one-third of
all births in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Westmoreland's biggest challenge is to get more children
enrolled in Medicaid and in the new health insurance program for
children. Administration officials said that more than 6 million
children were eligible for the two programs but had not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Clinton said he was disappointed with the slow pace of
enrollment in the new program. Gore said this month that he wanted
to expand the program to cover many more children and uninsured
working parents as well.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Westmoreland, by the secretary of health and
human services, Donna Shalala, was cleared by the White House and
does not need Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland, a graduate of Duke University and Yale Law School,
has been a senior policy fellow at the Georgetown University Law
Center since 1995.

 &HT;    Buzz Aldrin's goal is to cut cost of space flight
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Thirty years after leaving the second set of
footprints on the moon, astronaut Buzz Aldrin is trying to sell the
aerospace industry on a craft that would one day allow large
numbers of civilians to travel into space.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of space tourism has been alive for years, and this
week, the Hilton Hotel Inc. chain said it might be only 15 or 20
years before it builds its first hotels in outer space. But Aldrin,
who was in Austin this week, believes a venture he has forged with
some Texas engineers and businesspeople has designed the vehicle
that will make space tourism a reality sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in the long vision ... getting to Mars,
permanently getting to Mars,'' said Aldrin, who followed Neil
Armstrong onto the surface of the moon in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, Aldrin has worked with Hubert P. Davis,
a Canyon Lake engineer, to develop reusable booster rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Their company, Starcraft Boosters Inc., is creating a business
plan and hopes to attract the tens of millions of dollars it will
take to get the idea out of the wooden model stage. They hope
Austin could be a source of that capital and know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to 50 cents on the dollar is spent on computers and
software and that's Austin's bag,'' said Davis, who spent 17 years
with NASA in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications of Dr. Aldrin's vision are really very
significant for the state,'' said Dirk Jameson, a retired Air Force
lieutenant general the company hopes will be its chief executive
with offices in Austin. Shareholders also include Aldrin's son,
Andy.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin's vision begins with lowering the cost of launching space
flights while raising their safety and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the space shuttle, which drops its rocket boosters into
the ocean after each launch, Aldrin's design would house the
boosters in an unmanned aircraft that could return them to earth to
be quickly reused, saving millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than designing new rockets, Aldrin's company wants to
employ the existing Atlas III rocket system made by Lockheed
Martin, which could be another cost savings. Aldrin believes the
first booster could launch in a few years. After seeing Aldrin's
small models Thursday, David Dolling, professor of aerospace
engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, said he found the
ideas intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to do something like that. We're going to
have to go to some reusable technology,'' Dolling said. Dolling
said he believes Aldrin's advantage might be that he is proposing
to work with major aerospace companies rather than invent a
competing technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Aldrin has competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed is testing a reusable rocket system that would power a
NASA space plane called the X-33. The futuristic project would
create reusable vehicles and power, but has been expensive to
develop and is not yet ready. Boeing is also designing a reusable
vehicle system.

NHL LOOKS TO CANADA TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR CANADIAN TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bid to keep hockey, the Canadian national sport, in Canada,
the National Hockey League has asked the Canadian government to
subsidize the country's six major-league hockey teams by more than
$30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of four of the six teams say that they are in dire
financial straits and that most of them could be be forced to sell
their teams or move to the United States unless the Canadian
government steps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no other choice,'' said Rod Bryden, chairman of the
Ottawa Senators. ``We can either leave or go bankrupt. We won't sit
here and die. We'll go somewhere else _ the States _ where we can
thrive. I don't think Canadians realize how desperate the situation
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal from the NHL, which if approved would involve a
government more directly than ever before in the everyday operation
of professional sports in North America, calls for the Canadian
government to give the league a share of the revenue from
provincial lotteries that are based on the outcome of NHL games. It
is part of a package of recommendations from the league to help the
Canadian clubs compete financially with their American counterparts
and to prevent some of them from migrating to American cities.
</P>
<P>
   The league has been talking with national and provincial
officials in Canada for the last 18 months about the economic
strains endured by most of the Canadian franchises. These include
the amount of taxes on property and income and the weakness of the
Canadian dollar compared to the American dollar. These forces have
put at least four of the six Canadian teams in jeopardy. The
Montreal Canadiens, hockey's most fabled franchise, say they pay
more in property taxes each year than all 22 of the American NHL
teams combined.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to move the talks forward, the league presented a
formal proposal to the Canadian government last week. The
eight-page plan asked for significant tax relief and 20 percent of
the money raised by the existing and quite popular provincial
lotteries that are based on NHL games. Last year, revenue from
those lotteries totaled $170 million.
</P>
<P>
   Relief from local taxes is common for most American professional
teams, as is government aid in building stadiums. In one sense, the
Canadian hockey teams are asking only for the tax advantages now
enjoyed by nearly all their American competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Ottawa are reviewing the plan and have
not formulated a response, said Jennifer Sloan, a spokeswoman for
the Canadian industry minister, John Manley, who has been
overseeing the talks between the national government and the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal has already sparked a spirited debate in
Canada. Proponents contend that because hockey is an essential part
of Canadian culture, the government should step in to keep the six
teams in Canada. Opponents argue that the lottery revenue should
continue to be used for health care and social services, not for
millionaire players and owners.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey has been a vital element of Canadian culture for decades,
and most NHL games are broadcast on Canadian television to large
and enthusiastic audiences. Yet in the last four years, two
major-league teams have left the country for more economically
appealing locales in the United States: the Quebec Nordiques moved
to Denver, and the Winnipeg Jets went to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six remaining Canadian teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and
the Montreal Canadiens are unlikely to leave. Both have deep roots;
for 25 years, until the NHL expanded to 12 teams from six in
1967-68, they were the only two Canadian teams in the league.
Moreover, Toronto is Canada's largest city, and the Maple Leafs are
ranked among the top third in the league in revenue because of a
solid fan base and a brand new arena, the Air Canada Center, which
opened earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But for the four other Canadian teams _ in Ottawa, Vancouver,
Calgary and Edmonton _ matters are different. Bryden said economics
could force the Senators to shut down or move. ``The real, hard
fact is that if we don't get a tax regime that is tolerable, we'll
leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadian teams in other professional sports, including
baseball and basketball, are experiencing similar financial
hardships. Like the hockey teams, these franchises find it hard to
keep high-priced free-agent players in Canada, where income taxes
are much higher than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL and the six Canadian teams say that governments at the
local, provincial and national levels must all pitch in to help the
teams become more competitive financially. They ask, in their
formal plan, for abatements on property taxes and the elimination
of some provincial taxes, like a 10 percent amusement tax in
Ontario that treats NHL games as non-Canadian entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bryden said the Senators paid more that $37 million in taxes
last year. That was in addition to the cost of maintaining the
Corel Center, which was built entirely with private funds, as were
roads leading to the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The league's proposal also calls for something entirely new:
annual operating support. It would come from the sale of lottery
tickets based on the outcome of NHL games. League officials say the
teams deserve a share of the $170 million annual pot because the
games are the intellectual property of the NHL and its teams.
</P>
<P>
   They say that a 20 percent take would provide $34 million to be
shared among the six Canadian teams. The American teams would get
no share of the money under the NHL's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario's hockey lottery, the country's most popular, someone
must choose at least three games, picking the winners or predicting
a tie. There is no limit on how much money can be wagered on each
ticket, but all three choices must be correct to win. The
provincial government sets the odds.
</P>
<P>
   William Daly, the NHL's senior vice president for legal affairs,
said the league opposed the lotteries when they were created in the
early 1990s. He bristled at the suggestion that giving the league a
share of the lottery revenue amounted to a government subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think hockey subsidizes the Canadian government, as we
subsidize the lottery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In discussions, governmental officials have appeared willing to
consider the lottery proposal, Daly said. ``We think politically
it's the most feasible proposal,'' he said. ``It's a voluntary tax,
so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for the new revenue, the league is offering to allow
the provincial lotteries to use league and team logos to promote
lottery sales. The NHL has also promised to keep the six Canadian
teams in place for the next five years and to continue several
existing league programs, including one that helps Canadian teams
keep their own players from being lured away by American teams. The
league has provided more than $42 million to the teams since 1995,
helping to offset the difference between the weak Canadian dollar
and the stronger American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The early response to the NHL's plan has been mixed. Some
newspaper editorials in Canada have condemned it, saying that the
money from the lotteries should continue to be used only for
medical care and charities. Other editorials have criticized the
idea of tax relief but endorsed the sharing of lottery revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Eves, the Ontario minister of finance, who oversees his
province's lottery, wrote a letter to Manley opposing any reduction
in provincial revenue. Eves said the province could not afford to
shift money from nonprofit groups to the owners of professional
teams. ``If the federal government wants to provide direct cash
support with the money already given to them by the provinces,''
Eves wrote, ``that is your decision.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After days of roiling party strife over Pat
Buchanan, Gov. George W. Bush on Friday asked the renegade
Republican to stick with the party, saying, ``I'm going to need
every vote I can get among Republicans to win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments showed him to be making an effort as the party's
presumptive front-runner to hold together the Republican coalition
after a strange week in which Buchanan has drawn the Republicans
into a consuming debate over the merits of the Western response to
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's remarks, made in an interview with editors and
reporters of The Associated Press, simply sparked new controversy.
They put him squarely at odds with rival John McCain and a growing
band of Republican critics of Buchanan who said he had gone so far
from the American mainstream in his foreign policy views that the
party should bid him farewell and let him seek the Reform Party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's call for Buchanan to remain in the party comes just two
days after the Texas governor told an array of Jewish groups and
Jewish Republicans at a private meeting in Austin, the state
capital, that he was not joining the roiling public debate over
Buchanan's views. He told them that he thought he would inflame the
discussion and simply draw more attention to Buchanan, according to
several people familiar with the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   His stand Friday drew some instant criticism. ``I think McCain
is right and Bush is wrong,'' said William Kristol, the editor of
``The Weekly Standard,'' a conservative magazine. He said the
governor's stand ''will ultimately backfire'' when the Democratic
nominee turns to Bush in a debate and ``says Pat Buchanan said `A B
C' and you want him in your party and want his support.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation
League, who had attended the Wednesday meeting with Bush, said the
governor had ``unfortunately put politics over principle.'' He said
Bush should show ``leadership and say a Pat Buchanan, with those
views, should belong in no party.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan on Friday accused Republican critics who have taken
sharp issue with his book of ``opportunistically piling on me.''
The book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' includes passages
questioning whether Hitler chose to wage war with the West or was
driven to it by Britain and France's promise to declare war on
Germany if the Nazis invaded Poland. In addition, he argues that in
1941 Hitler was preoccupied on the Russian front and did not
represent a threat to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do those attacking me realize they are defending the policies
that produced World War II and virtual annihilation of the Jewish
population of Europe?'' Buchanan asked in a statement released by
his campaign. ``While the West is busy erecting Holocaust museums,
it has failed to study the history that produced it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Today, the United States is handing out war
guarantees all over Eastern Europe, guarantees a future generation
of Americans may refuse to honor, guarantees that are driving a
defeated, demoralized, divided and democratic Russia, with 20,000
nuclear weapons, straight into the arms of a Chinese Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's flirtation with the Reform Party has caused a schism
in Republican circles over how the conservative commentator should
be dealt with, with some vilifying him as being far outside the
party mainstream and others still trying to keep him and his
followers in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain, an Arizona senator, became the first
Republican presidential candidate to call for Buchanan to be
ushered out of the party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said Republicans
should stand ``on principle'' against Buchanan because he
considered Buchanan's views of World War II ``so far outside of the
philosophy of what America is all about that it's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Elizabeth Dole stopped short of asking Buchanan to
leave the party. But she said, ``I am appalled by Pat Buchanan's
comments. I not only disagree strongly with his analysis of
history, I believe his comments are grossly insensitive to those
Americans who gave their lives and those veterans who fought and
suffered greatly to preserve freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Baron, a spokesman for former Vice President Dan
Quayle, said, ``Pat Buchanan is a good man and should not be driven
out of the Republican Party for things he may not have even said
and written.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, another Republican presidential candidate, said in
an interview Friday that he did not think Buchanan should be forced
from the party, and that he considered the debate a ``distraction
from the issues the country really wants to debate in this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Having said that, I remember that my own father felt
that the most noble thing he had done was to fight for the liberty
of the people of Eastern and Western Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   After McCain called on Wednesday for Buchanan to be ushered out
of the party, the Bush campaign initially responded by saying the
governor ``will continue to run a positive issue-oriented campaign
that reaches out to all walks of life and broadens the base of the
Republican party.'' Only when pressed on how Bush viewed Buchanan's
account of history did the campaign add the statement, ``Our
soldiers were fighting for the cause of freedom, and Gov. Bush
honors and appreciates all those who sacrificed for the freedoms we
enjoy today.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush and his senior advisers, by coincidence, held
a long- planned luncheon with representatives of a wide array of
Jewish groups, including the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations, the Anti-Defamation League, the
American Israel Public Relations Committee, B'nai B'rith
International and the Republican Jewish Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people familiar with the two-hour session
who spoke on condition that they not be identified, it covered a
wide array of issues ranging from Middle East policy to the
dividing line between church and state. Some of those present took
the opportunity, however, to make clear how troubled they were by
Buchanan's role in the Republican Party and his views.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, several people said, agreed that he was troubled too by
Buchanan's view of history. But he said that he thought that if he
entered the public debate it would only make it louder and win
Buchanan more attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush, in an interview with The Associated Press, said
he disagreed with the conservative commentator's view that Nazi
Germany wasn't a threat to the United States after 1940. He also
said that Buchanan ``inflicted a few'' wounds to his father's
re-election campaign with a strong showing in the 1992 New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   But he urged the commentator not to bolt. ``I don't want Pat
Buchanan to leave the party,'' he said. ``I think it's important,
should I be the nominee, to unite the Republican Party. I'm going
to need every vote I can get among Republicans to win the
election.''

   KURCHATOV, Kazakhstan _ Here under the desolate Degelen
Mountains in the wind-swept Central Asian steppes, the Soviet Union
detonated more than 400 nuclear explosions during the Cold War that
helped it perfect the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, at noon on Saturday, Sept. 25, the earth is
expected to reverberate once more with the seismic shock waves of
an underground blast with the force of 100 tons of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the explosion in the next-to-last tunnel of an
underground maze that once crisscrossed the world's largest nuclear
test range will be conventional, not nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   And its goal is to insure that this site will be used for war no
more. Scientists say the blast will also help them identify and
measure secret underground nuclear tests conducted by, say, India,
Pakistan and China or by rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea is full of tunnels,'' said a senior Pentagon
official.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the United States and Kazakhstan have quietly
collaborated on a series of ambitious projects worth more than $170
million, financed by Washington, to help the now independent
government of President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev carry out his
pledge to forswear the nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
that Kazakhstan inherited from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But this security relationship, which American officials
describe as the closest they have with any former Soviet republic,
is now roiled by recent disclosures of the sale of more than 30
MIG-21 fighter jets to North Korea for $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   While Kazakh officials lobby to dissuade Washington from
imposing economic sanctions that would cost their country $75
million in annual foreign aid and jeopardize the close security
ties, scientists here at the Semipalatinsk test range, roughly the
size of Indiana, are struggling to stop impoverished Kazakh
scavengers from stealing copper and other precious minerals from
the radioactive tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   A large amount of irradiated copper was sold to China by a
private Kazakh company three years ago, prompting a formal protest
from Beijing, Kazakh officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told people in surrounding villages a hundred times how
dangerous it is to touch this metal, but what can we do when people
are hungry?'' said Murat Akhmetov, director of the Institute of
Radiation, Safety and Ecology in Kurchatov, the once secret nuclear
city of 30,000 that has shrunk to one third its former size.
``Scavenging irradiated copper is as self-defeating as selling
MIG's to rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary ``calibration'' experiment scheduled for
Saturday is the second of three tests intended to accompany the
closing and sealing of the last of 181 tunnels here at the Degelen
Mountains, where the Soviet Union conducted hundreds of underground
blasts after atmospheric testing was banned in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people have been involved in preparing for Omega 2,
as the blast is known. In addition to implanting seismic monitors
in a tunnel on the eastern side of the mountain range and its
drift, Kazakh and American scientists painted rocks and joints
inside the tunnels bright red, green, yellow and white.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Kovalev, director of the Degelen Mountain complex, said
the paint will enable scientists to assess how the blast shatters,
moves and distributes the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are standing is one of only 15 `clean' tunnels where
nuclear tests were not conducted,'' said Kovalev, as he walked
carefully through a part of the tunnel that will soon become
rubble. ``So we were able to work eight and nine-hour days
preparing the tunnels for the blast.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most heavily radioactive tunnels, by contrast, miners
were able to work shifts of only an hour and a half a day.
</P>
<P>
   More than five miles of copper-lined cable was laid to provide
power to the electronic sensors and monitors buried deep inside the
shafts. Sandbags were placed along the tunnel walls to protect the
instruments from the blast's full force. Near the end of the
tunnel, the scientists scooped out a huge cavity some 20 feet in
diameter that now holds the explosives and the detonation charge.
The test chamber's floor has been painted blood red.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through these vast underground passageways, whose
multi-colored coats of paint are illuminated by slightly iridescent
lamps affixed to the rock walls, is like exploring a surreal mine
shaft decorated by a mad finger painter. The air is dank and moldy.
The railway track that carried equipment and construction materials
deep inside the mountain is now covered with gravel and loose rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for us at first to do this work,'' said Kovalev,
who came to Kurchatov 30 years ago to build these channels of
death. ``It's not psychologically easy to destroy what you helped
build.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week before the blast, Kovalev supervised the loading of
100 tons of chemical explosives into the test chamber. The
instruments placed in 11 bore holes that were dug from or near the
chamber into a lower tunnel, the drift, were re-checked. The video
cameras situated just inside the tunnel portals, or openings, were
switched on to ensure that they, too, functioned properly.

OFFICIALS IN GEORGIA CONFISCATE STOLEN URANIUM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A cache of stolen uranium was intercepted by Georgian
officials this week, underscoring the continuing danger of nuclear
theft in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials said they confiscated a kilogram of
Uranium-235 on Monday night just miles from the Georgian-Turkish
border.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the nuclear material seemed to be low-enriched
uranium and that the smugglers had not acquired nearly enough to
help an aspiring nuclear power make a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Low-enriched uranium is far less of a worry than highly-enriched
uranium, which can be used to make nuclear bombs. But low-enriched
uranium can be processed to make high-enriched uranium. And the
shipment of low enriched uranium could be dangerous if there was
enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the episode indicates trafficking in nuclear materials
remains a major worry. It also suggests there has been a breakdown
in controls at a nuclear power plant or fuel fabrication factory,
probably in Russia or Ukraine. Georgian scientists insist the
nuclear material did not originate in their country and that
Georgia was simply being used as a transit point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that the Georgian authorities were paying
attention to the problem of nuclear smuggling and did something
about it,'' said a U.S. official. ``The bad news is that the
uranium found its way into the black market. It is important to
keep this material locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been an
enormous concern about nuclear theft but relatively few documented
cases of diversions of nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant incidents occurred in Prague in 1994
when authorities there confiscated 2.7 kilograms of highly-enriched
uranium, which is believed to have originated in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no major smuggling cases in recent years,
Western officials have been concerned that the economic crisis in
Russia and neighboring republics would lead to a new series of
thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian authorities said the case began with Valiko Chkmivadze,
a 60-year-old Georgian. Georgian authorities said on Friday that
they have kept a close watch on Chkmivadze because he was
previously detained by Turkey on suspicion of trading in nuclear
material.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian police followed him and two other Georgians as they
drove to Batumi, near the Georgian-Turkish border on Monday. They
were caught with the uranium and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In the last day or so, the uranium was taken to a shut-down
research reactor outside the Georgian capital of Tbilisi for
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The Tbilisi reactor has a storage area equipped with a
sophisticated alarm system. That security system was installed by
the United States several years ago to protect highly-enriched
uranium previously stored there.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the concern about keeping nuclear material in the
volatile Caucasus, the highly-enriched uranium and a cache of spent
radioactive fuel was flown by U.S. Air Force planes to Britain in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The material confiscated in Batumi this week has not yet been
analyzed. But it appears to be low-enriched uranium fuel pellets
for a nuclear power plant, according to Georgian and U.S. experts.
</P>
<P>
   Zurab Salaridze, the deputy director of the Institute of Physics
in Georgia, said in an interview that the cache consisted of 219
small dark-color tablets, which are cylindrical in shape. The
tablets are one centimeter high and seven millimeters in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nuclear weapon cannot be made with low-enriched uranium,''
said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard University. ``But a
sufficient quantity of such material could greatly reduce the
amount of work required to make weapons-grade uranium.''
</P>
<P>
   Added a U.S. official: ``If Iran somehow managed to obtain 100
or 200 kilograms of lower-enriched uranium we would have something
to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the confiscation of one kilogram has prompted
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One question is whether the Georgians have seized all of the
stolen supply or whether other material is still available on the
black market or had seeped out of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the origin of the uranium and whether its
appearance on the black market indicated that nuclear controls in
the former Soviet Union were fraying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that it came from Ukraine or Russia,'' said
William C. Potter, the director of the Center for Nonproliferation
Studies in Monterey, California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low-enriched uranium fuel does not constitute a significant
proliferation hazard,'' Potter said. ``The significance of this
case is that it indicates there is traffic in radioactive
materials.''

</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party won two parliamentary by-elections, but with
considerably less support than it drew in May 1997, when it swept
to power in Britain. Victor Bill Tynan narrowly held off the
challenge of the Scottish Nationalists in a suburban Glasgow seat
vacated by George Robertson, who is becoming NATO's

They succeed Screaming Lord Sutch, who committed suicide in June
after three decades of delighting even the politicians he tormented
with his lampooning of British public life. Hope, renamed Howling

 &HT;    Tapes reveal Johnson worried over Vietnam, civil rights
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Even as early election returns pointed to a
historic victory, President Lyndon Johnson worried about whether
his 1964 landslide would be perceived as a popular mandate and
stewed over the gathering storm in Vietnam, according to tapes
released Friday by the LBJ Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 hours of recordings _ mostly telephone conversations _
released Friday cover November and December of 1964, a time when
Johnson won the presidency in his own right and began planning the
major civil rights and anti-poverty initiatives he hoped would
define his administration. But Johnson also was increasingly
obsessed with the issue that would consume his presidency: Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, be of good cheer. We're going to give them the
damnedest licking they've ever had in their lives,'' Johnson's
running mate Hubert Humphrey tells the president at 6 p.m. on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, nursing a headache and a sore hip at his ranch
outside Austin, sounds morose. He worries that the landslide will
be viewed as a rejection of his Republican opponent, Barry
Goldwater, rather than an endorsement of him. And when Humphrey
tells the president that he plans to take a few days off after the
election, it's evident that other fears are weighing on Johnson's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in trouble in Vietnam, serious trouble. I told them to
keep you informed,'' Johnson tells Humphrey in the middle of urging
him to take the vacation. Johnson would send U.S. Marines to South
Vietnam in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the only president to record his private
conversations throughout his time in office, which lasted from the
assassination of President John Kennedy in 1963 until 1969. The
tapes total about 643 hours and include about 9,500 conversations.
The LBJ Library has been releasing the tapes several months at a
time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   His 1964 victory sealed, Johnson is in better spirits later on
election night when he calls Robert Kennedy to congratulate him on
being elected senator from New York. Their conversation is polite,
but Johnson already fears that Kennedy is positioning himself for a
run at the White House. The relationship between the two men,
already strained, would continue to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's stay as close together as he'd want us to,'' Johnson
says, referring to Kennedy's slain brother. ``Tell all that staff
of yours, ain't nobody going to divide us, and I'll tell mine the
same way and we'll move ahead and there's plenty in life for all of
us.'' Kennedy agrees.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Johnson again congratulates the new senator _ but
in a way that clearly belies his fears that Kennedy will someday
try to move beyond New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must think you're going to be running up there a long
time. I saw you smiling and waving at a bunch of kids _ they're not
even registered,'' Johnson jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking of working with you. That made me smile,''
Kennedy deftly replies.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes also contain a conversation between Johnson and
another man with whom he shared a mutual suspicion: the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. King calls Johnson's landslide ``a great victory
for the forces of progress'' and Johnson thanks King for helping to
increase black voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   But King worried that Johnson _ a Southerner known for his
legislative maneuvering _ would water down civil rights
legislation. And Johnson worried, as he told Secretary of State
Dean Rusk during a recorded conversation a month after the
election, that King ``wants to be an international figure. Our FBI
shows that he's getting ready to go international with the Negro
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential historian Michael Beschloss, who has written one
book on the Johnson tapes and plans two more, said Johnson's angst
at the end of 1964 was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he did have the largest landslide in history up to
that point, he did have very big problems coming up and he knew
it,'' said Beschloss, referring to civil rights and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that Kennedy would be in a position to cause a lot of
trouble for him in the next four years,'' Beschloss added. ``But
they knew at this point it was in both their interests to be at
least on the surface on friendly terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Johnson tapes released Friday also show the president at
his colorful best. During a phone conversation with Humphrey and a
roomful of Democratic senators on the day after the election,
Johnson's chuckles turn into snorts as he makes fun of how the
Minnesotan looked when he hopped on a horse at the Johnson ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Sen. Ross Bass remarks that it was ``a desecration to
put him on a Tennessee walking horse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a desecration of Hubert or the horse?'' Johnson quips.

CLINTON TRIES TO REASSURE PARTY ON GORE CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a passionate political speech, President Clinton
on Friday tried to reassure his fellow Democrats that Vice
President Al Gore was a strong presidential candidate, that he had
an unusually positive economy to run on and that it was way too
early to worry about his prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be of good cheer,'' Clinton urged the party faithful who were
attending a Democratic National Committee meeting. ``It's a long
time between now and November of 2000. In June of 1992, you know
where I was in the polls? Not behind, third! Third!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, mindful that the party is officially neutral during the
primary season, did not mention Gore directly or the potentially
bruising primary battles he faces with former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey. Nor did he mention the latest bad news for Gore, a CNN
poll that showed Bradley slightly ahead of Gore in New Hampshire
for the first time. The same poll showed that Clinton himself is a
giant drag on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has been raising money for his vice president and
campaigning on his behalf, and he wanted to give a boost to Gore
supporters on Friday, telling them not to become disheartened by
early polls or distracted by matters that have little effect on
real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an election yet,'' he said. ``I mean, the election
may be going on in the newspapers every day, but here, in the minds
of the American people, they still think we should be drawing a
paycheck to work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Gore and Bradley campaigns were
negotiating over a joint town-hall appearance in New Hampshire for
Oct. 27. Gore advisers have long believed that a debate format
plays to Gore's strengths, and they hope this will provide an
opportunity to help short-circuit any Bradley surge.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic committee meeting, where both Gore and Bradley
are speaking on Saturday, is also perceived as a good venue for the
vice president. It is heavily stacked with Clinton/Gore supporters
and will become even more so after Saturday, when it officially
installs Mayor Edward Rendell of Philadelphia, a long-time Gore
backer, as the new general chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But that devotion was tested Friday in a behind-the-scenes
wrangle over a resolution that the committee is to vote on
Saturday. It opposes reopening debate on the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the landmark law prohibiting discrimination based on a
person's race, religion or gender in employment and public
accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bradley said he supported amending the 1964 law to
include gays and lesbians as protected groups. But several black
and gay officials, some of them supporters of Gore, denounced the
idea, saying that any changes would provide an opening to
congressional conservatives to weaken the law's existing
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   When the resolution surfaced Friday morning, it bluntly called
for opposing any changes to the 1964 act. Bradley's campaign
attacked the resolution as an effort by the Gore camp to divide the
party and turn blacks against Bradley. After much wrangling, the
two camps agreed on modified language saying that the act should
not be reopened for debate or amendments ``that diminish its
existing protections.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute was a signal that Gore allies were willing to raise
concerns about Bradley on racial matters, the core issue of his
candidacy. Still, Bradley's fighting the Gore camp to a standstill
suggested an unexpected strength within the heart of the Gore
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those attending the meeting expressed support for
Gore. Martin Dunleavy, political affairs director for the American
Federation of Government Employees, for example, said he was not
too worried about Gore's fate in the primaries. ``It's early, and
people like to second-guess the vice president,'' he said. But he
added that the party needed to be careful about the nation's
natural desire for change after eight years of Democratic power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I think the Democrats have done a great job,''
Dunleavy said, ``there's a natural desire to re-examine the course
of the country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to this underlying yen for change, acknowledging
that it was aimed in part at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you go into the next election, don't fight with people when
they say, `We need a change,''' the president advised. ``Tell them:
`We certainly do. We always need a change.''' But, he said, ``The
question is not whether we're going to change, but what kind of
change we're going to make. And are we going to change based on all
of the good things that are going on in America now? Or would we
instead take a U-turn and go back to the stuff that got us in so
much trouble before the vice president and I came here and got the
help of the fine members of Congress and others who have worked
with us?''
</P>
<P>
   In offering a glowing assessment of his administration's record,
he said the economy had been going so well for so long that voters
might forget that it was worse under the Republicans, and he warned
against a ``collective amnesia'' that would gloss over these
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the longest peacetime expansion in our history,
instead of the worst recession since the Great Depression,''
Clinton said. ``We have over 19 million jobs instead of a handful.
We have rising wages instead of stagnant wages. We've got the
lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, the lowest welfare rolls
rates in 32 years and the lowest crime rate in 26 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supporters at the committee meeting were in the
minority, but they were fervent nonetheless. One was Jackie
Stevenson, a committee member and long-time party official from
Minnesota. ``The question is Can Gore overcome the Clinton
problem?'' she asked, referring to Clinton's impeachment and Gore's
belated attempt to separate himself from the Clinton scandals. ``It
may be too late at this point,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A playful Clinton took a swipe at Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the Republican front-runner, for supporting the Republican tax-cut
bill, which Clinton had just vetoed, and for proposing to increase
defense spending at the same time. The president said his veto had
spared Bush and other Republicans some embarrassment. With the tax
cut, he said, ``there'd be no money to pay for all these things
they're out there promising the voters,'' the president said. ``I'm
saving them a red face in 2000!''

MONTGOMERIE PROVES STEADY ON HIS FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Colin Montgomerie had his game face on, and
for the first few holes of Friday morning's match with partner Paul
Lawrie against Phil Mickelson and David Duval, it wasn't a happy
face.
</P>
<P>
   There was a little snappy give and take with the American
supporters who cheered a missed putt, and some words to a marshal
who Montgomerie felt was not doing his job properly.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie had no problems doing his job, though, earning a
3-and-2 win in the morning foursome match and, with Lawrie again at
his side, halving the afternoon four-ball match against Davis Love
and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the (morning) draw, one of America's top groups,
we had a tough game, obviously,'' said Montgomerie. ``But Paul did
well for his first time. He took the opening tee shot and took it
well. We fit well together, which is what foursomes is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, who had suffered some recent putting woes, was
right on target early and his consistency helped calm Lawrie, the
British Open champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel cool inside,'' said Lawrie, playing in his first
Ryder Cup to five for Montgomerie. ``But after that first drive, it
wasn't that bad, really. Colin was like a rock. He's just a
fantastic player, and it's nice to play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   European captain Mark James selected the pair to play the very
first match, and there was little doubt that the victory gave the
visitors a tremendous shot of adrenaline _ not to mention the
partisan crowd a sobering dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't stop a few leather lungs from making a football
reference to Montgomerie as he walked to the 13th green. ``Hey,
Tuna! You're a big piece of fish,'' bellowed one young man who
noted a Bill Parcells-like profile, minus a few pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie stayed composed, even flashing a knowing smile that
his match would soon end. Lawrie said that self-assurance was
helpful to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're huge crowds,'' said Lawrie, ``and they all want
America to win. They're all shouting, `USA.' Obviously, it's
difficult, but you just have to play your game.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, Montgomerie's game, specifically his putting, was
a personal cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Why did did he suddenly putt better? ``I don't know why,'' said
Montgomerie. ``I had been putting very poorly up to this stage. I
don't know. The Ryder Cup brings out the best in me, and I'm glad
it does. I'm looking forward now to the rest of the games.''
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's win and draw, Montgomerie improved his Ryder Cup
record to 10 wins, six losses, and four halves, and has gone
unbeaten in his last six Ryder Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin and Paul played awfully well,'' said Mickelson, who was
to suffer even more in the afternoon. ``It's not that we played
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   But later Montgomerie, after his afternoon tie, wasn't in the
same talkative mood. He immediately departed the premises via
automobile with nary a word for a marshal, a fan, and especially
the media.

ALLEN GETS NOD TO START AGAINST GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Two games into a season in which Patriots
running back Terry Allen thought he would be used chiefly as a
tutor for rookie Kevin Faulk and as a short-yardage back, Allen is
getting a start. The 10-year veteran Friday was named the starter
for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants by coach Pete
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who started the first two games, sprained his ankle last
week against the Colts and hasn't practiced all week. He likely
will not dress for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who has gained 128 yards on 30 carries, probably won't
get many more carries than he's had the previous two weeks. The
Patriots plan on spelling him with Lamont Warren and Harold Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised I've been able to get back into it as
easily as I have,'' Allen said. ``I mean, I didn't know I had
carried 15 times in each of those games until I saw the stat sheet.
It hasn't felt like that many carries for me, so whatever they ask
me to do, I'll just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen has been everything Carroll thought he'd be when he signed
him as a free agent near the end of training camp. Carroll stayed
out of the talks until the end, and that's when Allen became
serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I spoke to Pete it was just my agent and their
negotiator talking. That didn't mean anything to me,'' said Allen.
``Once Pete Carroll called me, then I knew they were serious and I
got serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' said Carroll, ``there were a number
of times I wanted to get involved earlier in the process. We just
waited until it was important to make contact. I didn't think he
could clearly decide until he heard what we had in mind for him. We
had a great conversation and I just laid it out, how we were going
to use him and what I knew about his background. I gave him an
appreciation for his work, and at the same time he understood what
we wanted and where he was going to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said he wanted Allen to know he'd be an important part
of the team early on. ``Sometimes they wonder if they're still
alive when they've been sitting around that long,'' Carroll said.
``I pumped him up and hopefully we can make this a real good
relationship. It's really working out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe said he thinks his ability to lead a comeback dates
to ninth grade. ``To be honest, that's something that every year,
when I would go to football camps in the summer, that was my
favorite time, when we had that two-minute situation and I had to
manage the clock,'' he said. ``That has always been my favorite
time of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said Bledsoe has ``familiarity with the environment and
the circumstances. Often, it's not a question of a guy elevating
himself up above everyone else, often it's everyone else having
trouble and struggling and he stays the same. Drew doesn't have to
make great throws in those situations. He has to make the same
throws he makes in practice and disregard what's going on around
him. It's the same out route, the same curl route, the same post
route time and time again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what great players are able to do. They're able to
maintain their level of play regardless of the circumstances around
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he is pleased with the practice work this week by
defensive end Ferric Collons, who will be activated for the second
week in a row. But Carroll hasn't been pleased with the work of his
other backup defensive linemen (Chris Sullivan, Bob Kuberski, and
Greg Spires). ``They haven't had a great opportunity in the first
two games to produce. Ferric has been very serious this week. I'm
not real satisfied with our backup play. I don't think our front
line guys are playing well, either. I'm not confident we have it
all together. The second half was excellent (last week), but we
still have to put it all together.'' . . . Carroll said he expects
left guard Heath Irwin to play Sunday night but Zefross Moss
(ankle) is still questionable, so the Patriots may dress an extra
offensive lineman . . . Tebucky Jones will be the primary kick
returner, but Carroll says Warren and Troy Brown may see some
action . . . Boston College High's Jim Cotter was named the coach
of the week by the Patriots after his team's 21-7 win over
Bridgewater-Raynham last weekend, the 200th win of his career. NFL
Charities will donate $500 to the BC High football program.

 KURCHATOV, Kazakhstan: functioned properly. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On ``D-Day,'' or Detonation Day, police and army units sent to
aid the hundreds of engineers, scientists, technicians and guards
who prepared for this test will fan out through the site, insuring
that the area immediately around the tunnel is clear of people
except the scientists and security guards charged with detonating
the explosives and monitoring the test from stationary and mobile
control centers at designated control points.
</P>
<P>
   For this test, as for the first one, called Omega 1, at another
tunnel in August 1998, scientists from Kazakhstan's National
Nuclear Center, their 20 American counterparts _ including
participants from the U.S. nuclear test site at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in Nevada and from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
of Columbia University _ as well as observers from Russia and
France, will be on hand to help monitor or interpret test results.
</P>
<P>
   Given the low labor costs here, American and Kazakh scientists
agreed that conducting similar tests at the Nevada site would cost
10 times as much as the $2.3 million that these calibration tests
are expected to cost.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Kluchko, a Pentagon program manager for the test, wrote in
an in-house Defense Department newsletter that the last Omega test
produced high-quality seismic records as far as 3,700 miles away.
Yuri Cherepnin, director general of the National Nuclear Center,
where some 2,000 former Kazakh nuclear scientists and technicians
now work on nonproliferation, said he expected seismic stations in
the same range as those in the Omega 1 test to be able to detect
the Saturday blast.
</P>
<P>
   The ``calibration'' experiment is rooted in a series of
Kazakh-American agreements signed in 1994 to help Kazakhstan get
rid of not only its weapons of mass destruction but also the
infrastructure that supported them.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Kazakh and American officials have quietly removed
more than a thousand nuclear weapons, closed the giant missile
silos once occupied by SS-18 Mirved Soviet ICBMs, converted key
biological weapons production centers, and moved more than 1,300
pounds of highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium out of the
country. Other major projects are under way or being planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kazakhstan has taken unprecedented steps to advance
nonproliferation and become a model of arms control for Central
Asia and other regions,'' said Vladimir S. Shkolnik, the minister
of science, a Russian physicist and veteran of the old Soviet
nuclear program here.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, Washington agreed in October 1995 to
spend $20 million blowing up and sealing the 181 horizontal
tunnels, each a mile and a half long on average, as well as
numerous vertical-bore holes, each 1,000 to 1,650 feet deep, that
are situated on the Balapan test site, near the granite-filled
Degelen Mountains, whose hard rock geology made them perfect for
underground weapons tests. So far, 179 tunnels have been blasted
and sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In closing the tunnels in which the Soviets conducted hundreds
of tests, Washington sensed opportunity. So did the international
agency created to monitor compliance with the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, now ratified by 45 of its 153 signers.
</P>
<P>
   Washington pledged an extra $1.2 million for the first two
calibration experiments in the last remaining tunnels. The
independent monitors of the test ban treaty, whose Vienna based
organization is affiliated with the United Nations, provided
another $80,000 to see whether an international team of inspectors
who are expected to arrive at test site nine days after the blast
will be able to identify the precise location of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Don A. Linger, a deputy for technical programs at the Pentagon's
Defense Threat Reduction Agency outside Washington, said the
measurements from the tests would enable seismic stations
throughout the world to ``calibrate'' their equipment and help
scientists distinguish between a natural event, like an earthquake,
and a bomb test.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is not always obvious, he added, noting that
seismologists were divided, say, over what kind of nuclear test
India conducted last year, as well as its strength.
</P>
<P>
   Cherepnin said he hoped that the United States and other
observers would eventually support research to measure
contamination levels at this sprawling test range. Soil samples
taken at different areas of the test range, he said, ``show the
existence of plutonium residues that exceed the acknowledged levels
by 100 times.'' But Kazakhstan, he added, cannot afford to conduct
such tests.
</P>
<P>
   While the precise levels of contamination have not been
measured, Kazakh scientists are painfully aware of some of the
adverse health and environmental effects of some four decades of
nuclear tests in the Semipalatinsk region, the first decade of
which were conducted above ground.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1998 U.N. report, much of the test site is
contaminated by cesium 137 and strontium 90. Local studies
attribute several lethal and debilitating illnesses, including high
rates of cancer, to radiation from the tests. Kazakhstan estimates
that 1.2 million people in and around the test site received above
normal doses of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.N. team that visited here last year had difficulty
distinguishing between adverse health effects produced by the
tests, limited to underground explosions after 1963, and those
stemming from the impoverishment of Kurchatov and other towns and
villages in the Semipalatinsk area due to the end of nuclear
testing in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   While unemployment in the region officially stands at 6.4
percent, the team concluded that real unemployment was far higher
than the national average. Half the buildings in Kurchatov, named
for the father of the Soviet atomic bomb, now stand abandoned or
crumbling. The once elegant, tree-lined streets are filled with
potholes and buckled pavement. For much of the harsh winter, there
is neither reliable heat nor electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Given this region's dependence on foreign assistance and
technical cooperation with the West, Kazakh scientists here were
particularly furious about recent disclosures that some senior
Kazakh officials either approved or failed to stop the sale of
30-year-old Soviet jet fighters to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a freaky accident that does not reflect government
policy,'' said Shkolnik, the science minister, who noted that two
senior officials had lost their jobs over the incident. ``But it
has undoubtedly hurt our country's image. I hope it will not
jeopardize tests like these and the close cooperation that benefit
both Kazakhstan and America.''

 &HT;    King statue unveiled at University of Texas
 &HT;    By Sharon Jayson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ What took 12 years to happen was over in a
moment on Friday, but it was a powerful and joy-filled moment on
the University of Texas campus. After a tug on the multicolored
cloth draped over the statue of Martin Luther King Jr., an
estimated 3,500 onlookers cheered and applauded as the bronze
likeness of the slain civil rights leader came into view.
</P>
<P>
   Amid chants of ``I Have a Dream'' and songs such as ``We Shall
Overcome,'' people of all ages and ethnicities gathered on the East
Mall at noon to watch the unveiling and dedication of the first
monument to an African-American on the UT campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's magnificent,'' said Wilhemina Delco, a former state
lawmaker and the first African-American to serve on the Austin
school board. ``It's academic. It's uplifting. It's hopeful. It's
dignified,'' she said, staring at the sculpture towering 12 feet
overhead. ``It sends the kind of message that all who come by it
can be inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to erect a statue of the assassinated civil rights
leader at UT began in 1987 when students organized the Martin
Luther King Jr. Sculpture Foundation. But the effort languished
without money to pay for the work. In 1995, another group of
students took up the funding challenge, succeeding with a student
referendum temporarily setting a student fee to pay for the
sculpture. Then artists were commissioned and the project was
finally complete this year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III, King's son, represented the family at
the dedication. He told the crowd he was especially moved by the
student-driven effort because it evoked the lengthy struggles of
the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has finally come for us to rejoice in the power of an
idea,'' he said, speaking with an eloquence reminiscent of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the remarks by officials, the gospel songs and the
electricity of the moment, it was the statue that clearly took
center stage. The crowd was drawn to it. Some touched it. They
gazed upward, squinting into the sun. Many walked full circle to
make sure they didn't miss an angle. Cameras flashed as others
posed with the frozen image.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful and I think it's great,'' said sophomore Eddie
Valenzuela, who just missed the dedication but arrived in time to
take a look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very great. I respect him very much,'' said Julie Zhu, a
graduate student from China.
</P>
<P>
   UT is only the second college in the country displaying a statue
of King. But the sculpture has a far greater significance as a
statement for diversity on a campus where statues of Confederate
heroes have long stood. Now, the statue of King is firmly planted,
looking eastward, with an outstretched arm.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, about 200 marchers began a two-mile trek through
the campus for what was termed a ``Celebration March.'' At a few
well-placed stops along the way, the marchers heard from former
students who were key players in the statue effort. Marchers jumped
in steadily along the way, swelling the procession to around 400 by
the time it reached the statue.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 fifth- and sixth-graders from Campbell Elementary
School in the Austin district made the trip, including 10-year-old
Cordelia Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave a speech that let other people get their rights to be
equal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At that last leg from the LBJ Library to the East Mall, UT
President Larry Faulkner joined the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's the thing to do. It's this kind of activity
that's so closely connected to Dr. King's life. It's a great way to
approach the unveiling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief remarks during the dedication, Faulkner called the
celebration a ``milestone'' and told the crowd that the UT Tower,
lighted orange for special occasions and athletic victories, would
be orange Friday night in King's honor.
</P>
<P>
   The King statue was created by Jeffrey Varilla and Anna
Koh-Varilla of Chicago, who were also onstage at the dedication.
The husband-and-wife sculptors are being paid $275,000 for the
project, with remaining funds from the student fee to be used for a
scholarship in King's name.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla from the morning events continued Friday with a
series of lectures and exhibits marking the first day of a weekend
reunion for UT's black alumni.

LANCE ARMSTRONG OVERCOMES CANCER TO WIN TOUR DE FRANCE 
REPEAT FOR ALL NEEDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE BAMBACH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No. 100 in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's 100 most memorable
moments of the 1900s
</P>
<P>
   He traveled much farther than 2,292 miles in 22 days to triumph
in the 1999 Tour de France, and when it was over Lance Armstrong
collapsed in joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in shock. I'm in shock. I'm in shock,'' he said after his
inspirational comeback, which ranks as one of the greatest sports
moments of the past 100 years. ``For those people who look at my
case as an example, I would just like to say one thing: If ever you
get a second chance in life to go for something, go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's second chance, and his ultimate victory tour, began
on the day doctors diagnosed testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Plano native, 28, had become an accomplished cyclist,
winning the 1993 world road championship and two stages in the Tour
de France. By 1996, he was Greg LeMond's heir as America's premier
professional cyclist.
</P>
<P>
   When he was found to have cancer on Oct. 2, 1996, Armstrong
announced his intention ``to beat this disease and ride again as a
professional cyclist.'' He persevered against a disease with a
survival rate of 65 to 85 percent, his doctors said. After surgery
in 1996 and a year of treatment, Armstrong was declared
cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to resume his riding career in 1998, but the cancer
had sapped the competitive strength that made Armstrong the world's
No. 1-ranked cyclist in 1996. When asked if he could win the Tour
de France in 1998, Armstrong responded: ``I'm not sure I could hold
your wheel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I was born to be a cyclist. Now it is much more
complicated,'' Armstrong added. ``I'm riding for a lot of reasons,
mainly to prove to the cancer community that it is possible to
return to a normal and successful life after treatment. If I do
have success, it will be very sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to competition in 1998, after rehabilitation at the
U.S. Olympic training facility in Indianapolis, and finished fourth
in the Tour of Spain and World Road Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Several strong performances carried Armstrong into the 1999 Tour
de France, his first since 1996, and his comeback seemed complete
with a victory in the prologue. But it was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to wear the leader's yellow jersey after the first
stage, then fell from the lead after Stage Two. In the eighth
stage, the cancer survivor hit the stride of a champion. Against
the wind over 35 miles of hills in northern France, Armstrong beat
the clock and the field by averaging 30.7 mph to win the individual
time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so tired in a race,'' Armstrong said,
``because I've never pushed so hard before.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued to push, extending his lead in the ninth stage.
Never a strong climber, Armstrong stunned the field on a windy,
cold, rainy day by finishing the six-climb route in the Alps 30
seconds ahead of his closest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The 86th Tour de France was Armstrong's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong faced one final obstacle on his road to victory. The
French media hounded Armstrong with accusations that he used
illegal drugs as part of his cancer treatment, referring to
Armstrong as ``The Alien'' because no one thought a cancer survivor
could dominate the toughest endurance challenge in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am being persecuted,'' Armstrong responded. ``What they want
for me is to crack on the bike and I will not crack for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong never did, passing a drug test and holding his lead
for the final stretch down the Champs-Elysees on July 25 in Paris
and, symbolically, through the Arc de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long road to get to the Tour,'' Armstrong said, ``and
it was a long road to get through it.''  &LR; tagtop:Mike Bambach (817)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What the police blotter is to the world of street
crime, Russell Mokhiber's weekly newsletter is to corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 13 years, the Corporate Crime Reporter has been
itemizing misdeeds committed by highly esteemed members of the
Fortune 500: antitrust violations, environmental crimes, Medicare
fraud, financial swindles and the neglect of workplace hazards.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years on the mean streets, Mokhiber's opinion of
the nation's most admired corporate citizens is somewhat jaundiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate crime is crime without shame,'' said Mokhiber, who
works in a one-man office in the National Press Building here.
``It's gotten to the point where when a corporation pleads guilty
to some criminal act, the stock goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Subscriptions to Corporate Crime Reporter cost $795 a year in
North America, $995 elsewhere. As that hefty price tag would
suggest, most subscribers are lawyers at the powerful firms whose
clients include the very ``corporate predators'' who trouble
Mokhiber so much. (He atones by offering discounts to helpful
prosecutors, citizen groups and journalists.)
</P>
<P>
   A number of subscribers said the newsletter helped them monitor
white-collar crime, although some quibbled with its tone. ``It's
very interesting data, but everything starts with the corporation
being presumptively guilty,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a law
professor at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Mokhiber (pronounced mok-EYE-ber) said he saved his arguments
for his columns and treated his newsletter as ``the empirical side
_ a description of what is.'' A lawyer and a longtime follower of
the consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Mokhiber first drew a bead on
the corporate world in 1988 with his book, ``Corporate Crime and
Violence: Big Business Power and the Abuse of the Public Trust.''
Since then, besides editing his newsletter, he has teamed up with
Robert Weissman, a co-director of a corporate accountability group
called Essential Action, to produce weekly Internet columns on
corporate crime, which were collected and published earlier this
year by Common Courage Press under the title ``Corporate
Predators.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he and Weissman attracted the attention of C-Span
by announcing the ``Top 100 Corporate Criminals of the Decade.''
(The list is posted on the ``Corporate Predators'' Web site at
www.corporatepredators.org/top100.html.)
</P>
<P>
   He is gratified that his newsletter has found a market niche,
with several hundred subscribers. But Mokhiber has a higher
mission: to convince Americans that they have far more to fear from
corporate malefactors than from the burglars, muggers and other
small-time criminals who dominate the public's perception of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Besides causing enormous monetary damage, corporate misbehavior
inflicts actual injuries, he said. Roughly 56,000 Americans die
each year from occupational diseases like asbestosis, he said,
compared with the approximately 19,000 victims of homicides. While
corporate crimes are being reported, ``they're not being
incorporated into the public debate,'' he said. ``We haven't been
able to do that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   If you hit the mute button as Mokhiber talks, you might mistake
this 45-year-old activist for a midlevel bank executive with his
navy pin-striped suit, snowy white shirt and muted tie, thinning
but sleek black hair and wire-rimmed glasses. He was born in
Niagara Falls, N.Y., where his father and several other family
members were rank-and-file workers for Union Carbide. Mokhiber says
that, even as a child, he was deeply troubled by the impact of
industrial pollution on his community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this incredible stench,'' he said. ``The heads of
the companies lived in the nicer areas. We lived where the smell
was its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mokhiber was 13, his father died and his mother took him
and his two sisters home to her native Lebanon. The family returned
to the United States a year later, settling in Simsbury, Conn.,
where he completed high school in 1972. He graduated from George
Washington University in 1976 in anthropology, and from Antioch Law
School in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As a law student, he worked for Nader's Corporate Accountability
Research Group. ``My politics were defined a lot by Niagara Falls _
and by Nader's influence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he and his family live an intensely private life (``We
don't have a television,'' he said) on an organic farm in Berkeley
Springs, W.Va. It is roughly a 90-minute commute to Mokhiber's
downtown office amid the fat wallets and big appetites of
Washington lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is pretty lonely,'' he said of his work. ``I'm not a
loner, but ours is clearly not a majoritarian movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mokhiber thinks that next year's presidential elections
will provide a new battlefield: ``We're thinking about surveying
all the candidates about their views on crime during the campaign.
It will be interesting to see if any of them even think of
addressing the crime being committed by their biggest
contributors.''

   George Plans to Continue But With 2 Fewer Issues &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George magazine, the political magazine whose founder and editor
was John F. Kennedy Jr., will continue publishing next year but
will reduce the number of issues to 10 annually from 12. The
magazine's appeal for both readers and advertisers has faded this
year, admitted Jack Kliger, president and chief executive of

PARENEVIK LEADS CHARGE IN THE AFTERNOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Four-ball Match 1 
Jesper Parnevik and Sergio Garcia, Europe, def. Phil Mickelson and
Jim Furyk, United States, 1 up. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ For the American team of Phil Mickelson and
Jim Furyk, there was too much Jesper Parnevik at the beginning and
too much Sergio Garcia at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final analysis of Friday afternoon's four-ball match
won by the Europeans, 1-up, there simply wasn't enough of a
Mickelson putting touch from 5 feet on two crucial holes _ 16 and
18 _ to avert defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played perfect together,'' said European captain Mark
James of Parnevik and Garcia. ``They were made for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For the US to come back and even halve the match was a scenario
that seemed nearly impossible after Parnevik, who had already holed
out an eagle-2 at the eighth hole from 135 yards, gave his team a
2-up advantage when he drained a 6-footer for birdie on the par-4
10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had everything going for me today,'' said Parnevik, and
Sergio lifted me up a few times today.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mickelson made a clutch 25-footer at 11 to draw to within
one hole, Parnevik halved the 12th with a par-saving 10-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fun _ and the drama _ reached a crescendo that later
peaked at the 18th. Furyk holed a chip for a birdie on 13, but the
Americans were even only as long as it took for Garcia to knock in
a chip of his own for eagle on 14that set off a team celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik embraced the 19-year-old, the youngest player in Ryder
Cup history, who kissed his golf ball and tossed it into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly as powerful a statement as Parnevik's eagle on the
eighth, where he lofted a 9-iron shot from the center of the
fairway to a pin tucked back left, then saw the ball bite 5 feet to
the right of the stick, then take a sharp left turn into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   That was European celebration No. 1 as Parnevik, who had five
birdies and an eagle after 10 holes, opened his arms for a gleeful
Garcia to jump into.
</P>
<P>
   After a halved 15th, the spotlight fell on Mickelson, who
responded with a shot 5 feet from the pin at the 186-yard par-3
16th. Garcia and Parnevik made par and Mickelson, who had heard
chants of ``U-S-A, U-S-A'' as he strode to the green, then evoked a
collective groan as his birdie putt broke off to the right.
</P>
<P>
   There was one more chance for redemption after Parnevik failed
to close out the match at 17 with a 7-foot birdie attempt.
</P>
<P>
   On 18, Mickelson hit a sensational 9-iron from 135 yards 5 feet
(sound familiar?) left of the pin. There was a long conference with
Furyk after Parnevik's two-putt par from 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   With US captain Ben Crenshaw and most of the crowd holding their
breath, Mickelson's putt hung on the right lip of the cup and the
US kissed its last chance for a halve goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, who thought Furyk's chip-in at 13 might have changed
the momentum but for Garcia's matching feat a hole later, said his
putts at 16 and 18 weren't aggressive enough. ``It's extremely
disappointing,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik said he was not rooting against his unlucky opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really feeling for Phil on that last hole.'' said
Parnevik. ``I really thought he was going to make it and I actually
hoped he would make it. No one deserved to lose that match.''
</P>
<P>
   After the last putt, Crenshaw slumped forward. Mickelson, who
had made a sensational 50-foot birdie putt at Two, but was plagued
by his short misses in crunch time, strode quietly from the green.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia felt the opposite emotion: ``It was the mpot enjoyable
day's golf I've ever experienced,'' he said.

   If Wisconsin couldn't beat Cincinnati last Saturday, how will it

<P>
   No. 15 Kansas State (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Iowa State (3-0)

<P>
   No. 22 Texas (3-1)

<P>
   Texas, which just beat Rice, should get big passing yardage

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The major stock indexes gave up a lot of ground last
week on fears that a stumbling dollar might reignite inflation and
dampen enthusiasm for United States equities among foreign
investors. The Dow Jones industrials lost 4.8 percent on the week;
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were hit after Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's
president, allowed on Thursday that a ``gold rush'' mentality had
driven the shares to absurd heights. The NASDAQ composite, down 4.5
percent on the week, is still up 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   If Ballmer thinks shares of technology companies are overvalued
in general, what must he think of Internet issues in particular?
Although these stocks are well off their highs, their prices are
mighty rich when judged against their earnings, if they have any.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, hurt by plunging Web stocks _ or interested in
owning companies that actually make money _ have sworn off
E-shares. But it is increasingly difficult for investors to escape
the Internet altogether.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of their incredible market performance, shares of
Internet companies play a big role in the major stock indexes, and
contribute greatly to their peregrinations. Like it or not,
investors in index funds are exposed to Internet stocks _ something
that many of those investors may not realize.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities recently analyzed a host of indexes and
the contribution that Internet stocks make to them. The firm
considers a company to be of the Internet species if it does or
will get significant sales from the Web. More than 300 qualified,
ranging from Amazon.com, E(star)Trade Group and CMGI to
lesser-known companies like Digital River and Proxicom.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major indexes, the NASDAQ composite, not surprisingly,
has the greatest exposure to the Internet, with 239 Web-linked
companies making up 49.2 percent of its market value. The Russell
2000, the benchmark for small-capitalization stocks, includes 103
Web companies, accounting for 5.1 percent of its value. (The
Internet component of the Dow industrials is not in the study,
because Dow Jones would not give Prudential the information it
needed.)
</P>
<P>
   And here is a shocker for index-fund investors: Internet
companies account for 25.9 percent of the value of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Steven DeSanctis, director of small-cap research at Prudential,
said the presence or absence of Internet stocks in seemingly
comparable indexes has skewed some benchmarks' moves. The fact that
the Russell 2000's weighting in Internet stocks is three times that
of the S&AMP;P Small Cap index may help explain why the latter is down
3.4 percent for the year, while the Russell is off 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some Internet stocks are priced more wackily than
others. But investors should know how much these shares contribute
to the market indexes' moves today. DeSanctis said that on Aug. 31,
when the S&AMP;P 500 was up 8.41 percent for the year, Internet-related
stocks had contributed almost two-thirds of that gain.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet stocks are up this year, and so continue to lift
the indexes they dominate. But there is no guarantee that their
effects on these indexes will remain salutary.
</P>
<P>
   Increased Internet exposure has another effect on these indexes:
heightened volatility. Seat belts, anyone? &QL;

MICKELSON PUTT MARKS DEPTH OF FIRST DAY FOR US

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ David Duval's final shot of the day _ a fluff
from the right rough that didn't even make the 18th green _ was
embarrassing, as was his tee shot that nearly found the Jamaicaway,
as were more than a few of Duval's 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup an exhibition? David Duval played it that way.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Phil Mickelson who will be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard did next to nothing, US captain Ben Crenshaw
paired Tom Lehman with Tiger Woods in the morning because Lehman
was a ``horse'' for Tiger to ride. Lehman may have made a
spectacular chip shot on the first hole, but from that point, even
simple approach shots (Lehman's strength) were beyond his ability.
Even worse were his putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't make any putts,'' Lehman said. ``I had a lot of
20- and 25- and 18-footers that were dead center, but short.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is Mickelson's putter that will be hung in effigy.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning of alternate shots, Mickelson and the burdensome
Duval lost to the two Scots, Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,
3-2. After that match, Mickelson said, ``We put ourselves in
position on a mumber of holes; I missed three putts from 8 feet or
less that really hurt our momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   But the morning was nothing compared to the agony of the
afternoon. The golf played in this foursome of Mickelson and Jim
Furyk against Jesper Parnevik and Sergio Garcia was spellbinding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnificent'' would be too mild an adjective, for when the
foursome made the turn _ just after Parnevik had holed out from the
eighth fairway for an eagle _ European assistant captain Sam
Torrance said his duo could not humanly do much more than they had
done on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parnevik and Garcia went out in 27,'' said Torrance, ``and
we're only 1 up. It's magnificent golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would lose another hole on the 10th but had
squared the match by the 13th. By the 16th tee, though, the
Europeans were again up by a hole when Mickelson hit a magnificent
iron shot on the par-3 hole that came to rest a mere 4 1/2 feet
from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   The roars from 14th where, in an amazing exhibition of golf,
Paul Lawrie had eagled the hole, only to watch as seconds later
Davis Love also eagled the hole, had barely died when the roar from
the 16th green exploded. Mickelson's putt, that short putt of 4 1/2
feet, would tie the match.
</P>
<P>
   But, memories did not have to be long to recall that Mickelson
had faced virtually the same putt on the 17th at Pinehurst during
the final round of the US Open in June . . . only to miss.
Mickelson has yet to make one of these putts at the absolute
crucial moment of a major.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson moved his blade. The putt did not seem to be struck
firmly. It rolled away from the hole. The golf gods repeated the
agony on the 18th where, 1 down, Mickelson struck a huge drive and
then a magnificent approach that carried the bunker and rested some
4 1/2 feet from the hole; as good as any two pressure shots can be
struck in golf.
</P>
<P>
   But the putt was not inviting; it loomed, a virtual copy of the
putt at 16 and the one on the 17th at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, watching Mickelson and Furyk line up for the putt for
moments that expanded into minutes, did not want any more agony.
``I was hoping Phil would make the putt,'' said the Swede, even if
it might halve the match and cost his side half a point. ``I was
really feeling for Phil on that last hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson finally struck the ball. His stroke was even more
feeble than the one on the 16th. The ball never even got to the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putts on the 16 and 18 were very similar _ slightly left
to right _ and I wanted to play them inside the hole,'' said
Mickelson. ``I eased into both of them and they started pretty much
in the middle of the hole and just tailed off. They weren't very
aggressive strokes; they were pretty tentative.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson yet has to make that absolutely crucial putt.
When Tiger Woods, a few holes behind Mickelson, asked if the putt
had been made and was told that it had not been, his head dropped
in silence.

MICHIGAN HOPES TO KEEP DAYNE ON SHORT LEASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michigan's mission is clear: Stop Ron Dayne. When the
fourth-ranked Wolverines (3-0) play at No. 20 Wisconsin (2-1)
today, their defensive focus will be on the Badgers' senior running
back. Last week, Dayne became the leading rusher in Big Ten
Conference history, and he needs to average a little more than 149
yards a game to surpass Ricky Williams' NCAA career rushing record.
``If you shut him down and keep him under 100 yards, it's an
accomplishment,'' Michigan tackle Eric Wilson said. ``I admit, once
he gets going, it's a struggle to bring him down,'' Michigan senior
linebacker Ian Gold said. ``But the bigger they are, the harder
they fall. We'll go for his legs. It's that simple.'' Last season
against Michigan, Dayne gained just 53 yards in a 27-10 loss. That
was his lowest single-game total last season. If Dayne is to make a
serious run at the Heisman Trophy, he probably needs a productive
game against the Wolverines, who are 34th nationally in run defense
(95.7 yards a game). ``Ron's been scrutinized more than any
athlete, particularly here,'' Wisconsin offensive coordinator Brian
White said. ``Every game's a litmus test for the Heisman.'' Dayne,
a 5-foot-10, 255-pound senior, is third in the nation in rushing
with 174 yards per game. He gained 231 yards in last week's 17-12
upset loss to Cincinnati. After fumbling away a touchdown _ his
first lost fumble in 336 carries _ Dayne has spent the week
cradling a football as a reminder. ``I'm looking at this as a big
game for me and for the team,'' Dayne said. ``After losing last
week, we have something to make up for.'' With the Badgers starting
Big Ten Conference play against Michigan, they're faced with the
challenge of recovering from a loss that quite likely knocked them
out of the national championship race. The Badgers play at Ohio
State on Oct. 2, so another loss could be devastating. ``Everybody
wants to know what kind of chemistry and leadership we have,'' said
Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez, who might have to coach from the
press box because of a knee injury that will require surgery Oct.
5. ``You always find that out when you have adversity. We'll find
that out pretty quick.'' The Wolverines hope to establish their
running game. In victories over Notre Dame, Rice and Syracuse,
Michigan has struggled to move the ball consistently on the ground.
Michigan is 74th nationally rushing, averaging 125.7 yards per
game.

TRUMP RESPONSE TO TALK OF A PRESIDENTIAL RUN: WHY NOT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald Trump was sitting in his office on the 26th
floor of the Trump Tower the other afternoon, with Central Park
stretching out 50 blocks behind him, and a desktop of newspaper
clippings spilling out in front of him, all addressing Trump's
latest venture: Presidential politics. And in case anyone finds the
notion of President Trump unsettling, the real estate developer and
casino owner was prepared with evidence to validate his potential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for one, the laudatory column that appeared on the
op-ed page of The Washington Post by Richard Cohen. And there was,
Trump related in the next breath, a poll conducted by The National
Enquirer of 100 Americans (about one-tenth of the sample size of
the standard-issue national poll) that found, as he put it, that
the nation appears to be clamoring for this famous New Yorker to
get into this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the real people,'' Trump declared of the Enquirer
readers, earnestly laying his hands across his desk. Roger Stone,
his paid consultant who was sitting across the desk, offering Trump
the occasional pointer during the 45-minute interview, added:
``That is the Trump constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   It had to happen. In an era when, it seems, everyone seems to
think that he or she can be president of the United States _ actors
and wrestlers, billionaires and governors _ Trump is trying to
determine whether there is a place in American political life for a
rogue: a developer, casino operator and proudly public womanizer.
Characteristically, Trump, who at 53 has never run for office
before, has decided to begin at the top, contemplating offering
himself as the Reform Party's candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I build the best buildings, and I'm the biggest developer in
New York by far,'' Trump observed, shrugging off a question about
his own preparedness for office. ``While that's real estate and
this is politics, are they really so different?''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Trump's new adventure is shaping up as more than
another high-profile chapter in the life of a man who was described
by Howard Rubenstein, the warhorse New York public relations
consultant and former Trump counselor, as ``probably the most
flamboyant promotion person I have met in my 45 years in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his private fortune, personal bravado and name
recognition, Trump might become the presumably witting tool by
which a faction of the Reform Party prevents Pat Buchanan, who is a
Republican, from running as its presidential candidate. If he
succeeds in blocking Buchanan, it could be a welcome turn of events
for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading candidate for the
Republican nomination, who could do without the drain of
conservative votes that a Buchanan candidacy would bring.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the convoluted internal politics of the Reform Party,
Trump's emergence suggests the extent to which celebrity and money
is transforming politics these days. Trump has never before
displayed much interest in politics, and professional politicians
have never expressed much interest in Trump, his checkbook
excepted.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who hates the mandatory political practice of shaking
hands (he described it as ``barbaric'' and unsanitary), recoiled at
a question of whether he might visit New Hampshire and Iowa to
measure whatever popular support he has. ``I don't really think it
is as necessary as people seem to think,'' he said, a little
darkly.
</P>
<P>
   Trump says that his ultimate decision _ which he says he will
make within three months _ will be guided only by a determination
of whether he can win, which in turn would mean a determination
that the economy will be bad next year, so voters will be open to a
third-party candidacy. And asked to present the basic rationale for
a Trump candidacy _ why someone might vote for him _ Trump offered
a response that seems certain to distinguish him from the rest of
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lack of spirit in the country with respect to
what's going on,'' Trump said, tapping his fingers on the desk and
glancing at a wall lined with pictures of, well, you know.
``Obviously. Things are starting to look a little bit queasy.
People are worried about the 2000 phenomenon. The Y2K. And I don't
know that I am. Because I don't think I am particularly. But you
know, they think the computers are going to come out and gobble and
destroy the world. I'm not a believer in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, some very bad things and some very good things can
happen over the next year,'' he continued. ``I really think whoever
is the Reform Party candidate is, I've always felt that the Reform
Party itself is a much more potent party in bad times than in good
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump is a registered Republican, who describes himself,
adopting the formula that has become so popular among Northeast
Republicans, as moderate on social issues (he's for abortion
rights) and conservative on fiscal issues (he supports big tax
cuts, especially for the rich). Issues asides _ and this seems
likely to be an issues-aside kind of candidacy _ Trump is
presenting himself as a personality unlike what Americans have been
accustomed to in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Trump disapproves of President Clinton's behavior
in the White House over the past four years, though he suggested
that he was bothered less by what Clinton did, than by whom he did
it with. ``It was his choice,'' Trump said. ``It was Monica! I
mean, terrible choice.'' Trump, who showed off fashion magazines
displaying cover-art of the latest in a line of models he has
dated, suggested that if Clinton had confessed an improper
relationship (Trump offered a more earthy phrase to get the idea
across) with a supermodel, as a opposed to a White House intern,
``he would have been everybody's hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any justification for cheating on your wife,''
added Trump, whose own extracurricular marital activities have been
a tabloid staple.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Trump volunteered a confessional apparently intended
to clear up any issues that might arise in a Trump candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, my social life is a very active one,'' he said, with
uncharacteristic understatement. ``So I can truly say I never took
a drug in my life. I never had a cup of coffee in my life. I never
had a cigarette in my life. And I never had a drink in my life. I
never had a glass of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to women _ I've been out with lots of beautiful
women, OK?'' he continued. ``I guess we all have our Achilles'
heel. There's nothing like _ I love women.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Trump is serious about running for president is the
matter of some debate. For one thing, he happens to have a book
coming out in January, just about the time when he plans to
announce his intentions. For another, Trump is a man who has a
better command of self-promotion than, well, most politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was in my business, I would have a competitor that I
could never outrun,'' Rubenstein said.``He's getting more publicity
than Gore.''

 MARKETERS AVOIDING MILLENNIUM PARTY BECAUSE OF Y2K FEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CAROL EMERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
The new millennium is less than four months away, but you would
never know it from walking around your local supermarket or
department store.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, makers of consumer products jumped head first into the
bicentennial hoopla. Red, white and blue was the color craze of the
year. Fife-and-drum troops seemed to march across every
limited-edition cereal box, soda can and maple syrup bottle (not to
mention license plates and quarters).
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the new millennium _ which, after all, happens only
once every thousand years _ isn't considered much of a sales
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that marketers are less aggressive than they were 23
years ago. There's a fly in the ointment: the notorious Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bicentennial was a time of celebration and the millennium
is something people are trepidatious about,'' said Jeff Goodby,
co-chairman of Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, a San Francisco
advertising agency. He noted millennium-related fears crop up
frequently in focus group interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel old,'' said the ad man, who is 48. ``You're afraid
that all of the infrastructure is going to break down. Advertisers
aren't using it because they sense that it's not a big time of
celebration, it's actually scary, depressing and perhaps
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group, concurs.
``I think if the Y2K bug wasn't an issue, you'd see (makers of
consumer-products) going nuts,'' said Lisa McCue. ``But there's
this cloud over the celebration because people aren't sure what's
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney found out the hard way that Americans aren't as
smitten by the upcoming calendar flip as one might think.
</P>
<P>
   The Plano, Texas, chain introduced Millennium Shops in its
stores last Christmas. Pillows, throws, dresses and countdown
clocks featuring the graphic ``01-01-00'' sold well at Christmas
time, but then stalled. Penney's, which had planned to keep &LR;   &LR; the
shops open all year, discounted the merchandise and shuttered them
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While the Y2K downer gets most of the blame, it also is possible
that splashy themed merchandise doesn't fit the national zeitgeist
as well as it did in 1976, posited Cami Alexander, a Penney
spokeswoman. ``People have different ideas about what they will
wear and put around their house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate, Alexander was diplomatically vague. ``Tastes
evolve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Exorbitant costs of New Year's revelry may also be putting a
damper on consumers' enthusiasm, said Alexander. Reports of
$100,000 travel packages and $2,500 Barbra Streisand concert
tickets have made the coming New Year's Eve seem overpriced and
unapproachable instead of fun and festive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of shelf life. Come January,
millennium merchandise will start to seem dated. Alexander bought a
01-01-00 baseball jacket last year, but she intends to retire it
after this winter. ``You can definitely tell what year I bought it
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are exceptions to the millennium group-shun,
most notably among marketers of products designed for consumption
on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Some champagne-makers have designed special, high-priced
millennium bottles, which they backed up with marketing campaigns
warning revelers to stock up now, before an end-of-the-year
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   For partygoers who prefer beer to bubbly, Anheuser Busch has
produced a magnum (46 ounces, the equivalent of two wine bottles)
of Budweiser beer, complete with gold lettering and a cork for
midnight popping.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies simply found the millennium gimmick too good to
pass up. The marketing department at General Mills, which makes
Cheerios, hit upon the name ``Millenios'' months ago and fell in
love with it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Millenios _ a sweetened cereal in the shape of
``2s'' in addition to the standard ``0s,'' was tested on focus
groups, where participants rolled their eyes and laughed at the
proposed name. ``But then they'd say, `Yeah, I'd buy it; I'd serve
it on New Year's Day,' '' said Ami Miesner, brand manager.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills now sells Millenios in a shiny purple box designed
for kids to use as a time capsule, storing keepsakes from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent of what you hear about the millennium has
been about Y2K, and we asked ourselves, do we really want to tie in
with something so negative?'' Miesner said. ``But we think it's
positive and we want to ... build on its celebratory nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Millenios are the only millennium-themed product General
Mills, which sells $6.2 billion dollars of groceries a year, has
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gavzer, a San Francisco acupuncturist and herbalist,
hit upon another millennium-related marketing gimmick: the Y2K
curative.
</P>
<P>
   Gavzer developed MillenniLube Y2K Jelly, a pungent body lotion
containing chamomile, St. Johns Wort and algae extract, which is
available online at www.millennilube.com and by phone at (877)
925-5355.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was kind of freaking out about Y2K and I said, `We
should make some kind of an antidote,' '' said Gavzer, who used to
run a massage oil business.
</P>
<P>
   MillenniLube, which sells for $5.99, is ``designed to calm fear,
soothe dry skin and lubricate your slide through the Y2K ride,''
the 2-ounce tube says. ``To protect against millennium bug bites,
place entire container on computer.''

 NEW YORK: than Gore.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trump is very much enjoying the publicity he has received since
associates of Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who has become
Perot's rival in the Reform Party, suggested Trump as a possible
alternative candidate to Buchanan. Trump and Ventura met at
Wrestlemania IV in 1988 in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a little surprised at this hoopla that's developed in
a short period of time?'' Trump inquired.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Trump said, he would move to the next phase of his
pre-campaign campaign, which is to determine whether he could
really win the presidency. Trump said he plans ``to sell myself,''
as he put it, describing what politicians more typically refer to
as ``campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have been politicking for a long time,'' he said.
``Whereas, I've been building for a long time. I think over the
next several months I'll make the determination as to whether
getting out there and getting on the stump _ as you would say _
could give me enough votes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, whose net worth has been estimated at $1.5 billion, and
who has never shown any hesitancy to spend money to advance his
name or career, said he would spend whatever it took to finance his
campaign. That said, it appeared that Trump may not have given much
consideration to the nittier and grittier side of getting on the
stump: The 16-hour days, the run of $50-a-night hotel rooms, the
bad food, the waves of repetitive questions by voters and
reporters. ``I mean, to a limited extent I'd be doing that,'' Trump
said. ``Today, it really is different. It's largely television.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his final decision, Trump said he saw nothing wrong
with trying to enter the profession at such an elevated level.
``Well, I know what working your way up _ I mean, look,'' Trump
responded, gesturing around at a windowed expanse of an office
that, truthfully, makes the Oval Office seem a little ordinary. ``I
mean, if you look at Ronald Reagan, who I happen to think was a
great president, look at where he came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that Reagan served as governor of California after
finishing his years in Hollywood, Trump settled back into his chair
for a moment. ``You know, I feel that I've been in politics all my
life,'' he said. ``I'm sure that lots of people will come out, and
be very harsh, and unfairly harsh. But I have been very much an
open book. I mean one thing, people know who I am. While I haven't
been public, I am public.''

AUSTRALIANS ENTER EAST TIMOR IN SHOW OF FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ As departing Indonesian soldiers marched with
their duffel bags toward this city's port on Friday, the foreign
troops who are replacing them staged an aggressive show of force,
sealing off and searching the city center for hours as helicopters
circled and clattered above them.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees crawled from cardboard shelters to watch Australian
soldiers sweep through their burned-out neighborhoods, fingers on
their triggers, as if on the front lines of a war.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the operation, Lt. Col. Nick Welch, said it was
intended to send a message to the frightened refugees and to any
potential troublemakers that Dili belonged to the international
force now.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the random looting and fires,'' Welch said, ``there may
have been the perception that we were not fully in control. The
reality is we are capable of carrying out our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The show of force, together with the visible departure of
Indonesian troops, sparked the first spontaneous celebration in
Dili of the victory of East Timor's vote for independence in a
referendum on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with two boys on bicycles, it grew to 15 men on
motorcycles and then to a pickup filled with whooping, chanting
celebrators who waved the green-blue-and-white flag of the East
Timorese independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for coming, whee-hee!'' shouted a motorcycle rider,
Jose Antonio, 21, as he drove past an Australian guard post.
</P>
<P>
   But one man on a van, Mario Victor da Costa, who wore a pale
blue U.N. cap, said that as soon as darkness fell, the revelers
would leave the streets because ``we are still afraid at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch said that no shots had been fired in the sweep, which
lasted through the afternoon and into the night and that his troops
had met no resistance. But it also appeared that they made few
arrests of armed men and seized only a few weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier report, the international force had said it made
its first arrest of a senior member of the violent militias that
laid waste to much of the region in the last three weeks, Caitano
da Silva.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the show of force, military officers conceded that they
did not have full control of Dili and that it would take far longer
to enforce security in the rest of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is a piece of string?'' one colonel said when asked
for a time estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A formal military hand-over of the territory from the Indonesian
troops who have occupied it for 24 years to the international force
that began arriving on Monday is to be completed in a few days, the
top generals of both forces said at a news session. In Jakarta,
Gen. Wiranto said the hand-over would be on Monday. But
announcements in Jakarta often have little connection with events
in East Timor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The local Indonesian commander, Gen. Syahnakri, said that by
Saturday all 11,500 soldiers who had been stationed here long-term
would be gone. Those included ``territorial forces,'' many of them
East Timorese, who were responsible for much of the violence,
together with the irregular militias that they support. Syahnakri
said 4,500 troops who arrived with him this month in what was
officially described as an attempt to restore order would be phased
out in a few days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The process of withdrawal was creating its own momentum as the
atmosphere in this mostly empty city shifted to guarded hope. The
port was busy with arriving troops, including the first Asian
contingent, 127 soldiers from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   As the foreign soldiers walked down the gangplanks of huge
transport ships, the departing Indonesians loaded belongings on one
of their own ships at a far corner of the port.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gates of the port was a tiny sign of commerce: Women
squatted and sold handfuls of mangoes, papayas and bananas. Few
people had enough money to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Plumes of smoke continued to rise from military buildings set
afire by the departing Indonesian troops. But on the sea front, at
one building the Australians intended to use, two armored vehicles
and two helicopters kept a protective eye as the Indonesians
prepared to leave. The miniature hand-over crystallized the
tensions and poignancy of the transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you again,'' an Indonesian soldier said, trying to smile
as a column filed out past the Australians. ``Goodbye, East
Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   With elaborate courtesy, an Australian officer paused as the
last Indonesian left the gate. ``May I?'' he said, waiting to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' the Indonesian responded.
</P>
<P>
   In the empty compound, strewn with litter, the Australians found
three barrels of fuel oil, together with long blue hoses, waiting
to be set afire.

 AT MORTUARY-SCIENCE SCHOOL, DEATH BECOMES THEM
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID LAZARUS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO -- A pproximately 2.3 million people will die in the
United States this year. Over the next four decades that total is
expected to almost double.
</P>
<P>
   For some, this represents an enormous business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embalmers, funeral directors, part-time funeral assistants _
you're looking at a major, major waterfall in employment,'' said
Pat Lane, a spokesman for the California Funeral Directors
Association. ``The funeral industry looks very strong right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Many wanting to participate in that boom are converging on the
Bay Area, where the San Francisco College of Mortuary Science is
projecting 20 percent growth in annual enrollment over the next
five years. The school now has 55 students.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1930, the college is the world's only such
institution with its own on-site mortuary, allowing students to
provide embalming and funeral services for people who might not
otherwise be able to afford the $4,700 average cost of a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 bodies pass through the school's downstairs mortuary
each year at a cost to their next of kin of about $500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquie Taylor, who graduated from the college in 1974 and has
served as its president since 1990, bristles at the suggestion that
her institution is a sort of &UR;  &LR; barber's college for dead people.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she sees the school's cut-rate mortuary as providing a
valuable service for the community, not to mention a unique
hands-on learning experience for aspiring funeral-industry workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the most extensive practical training of any college
in the country,'' Taylor said. ``People who can't afford a
full-service mortuary can receive basic services like
transportation of the body, paperwork, cremation and a chapel
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who want fancy airtight caskets costing thousands of
dollars, or the practiced hand of an experienced embalmer, should
look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The college occupies 12,000 square feet above an unrelated
funeral home in San Francisco's Noe Valley neighborhood. The walls
outside its classrooms are decorated with class pictures dating
back to 1931, when the white, predominantly male graduates bore
decidedly grim expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Today's students display a more varied mix of race and gender.
And although most insist that one of their main motivations for
entering the trade is to help families in their hour of need, they
see this as a savvy career move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sure thing as far as employment goes,'' said Nicole
D'Ambrosio, 27. ``There will always be work.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her interest in death goes back to watching old TV
episodes of ``Quincy,'' in which Jack Klugman played a deputy
coroner battling social injustice and assorted bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to get into forensics,'' D'Ambrosio said. ``I
still would kind of like to be a deputy coroner.''
</P>
<P>
   For Randy Anderson, 45, a future in funerals represents a fresh
start after years of managing convenience stores in and around
Modesto, Calif. ``It's an honorable business,'' he said. ``People
look up to funeral directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said his interest in the field can be traced back to
the funerals of friends and family members. ``I watched the funeral
directors, how they dealt with the family,'' he recalled. ``I
thought that if I ever got the chance to do it, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 48 mortuary-instruction programs in the United
States. The San Francisco college ranks 16th nationally in terms of
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition is about $10,000 for a full-year curriculum that
includes classes on anatomy and pathology, as well as accounting
and marketing. The associate in arts degree in funeral directing
and embalming can take from 12 months to 16 months to complete,
depending upon a student's previous academic record.
</P>
<P>
   The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools
and Colleges and the American Board of Funeral Service Education.
</P>
<P>
   Students can observe embalming procedures throughout their
studies, but they cannot participate in actual mortuary services
until reaching their third semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it will be pretty overwhelming,'' said Jeff DeNaughel,
34, now in his second semester. ``You can only hope you do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The mortuary can be an intimidating place. There are two
embalming tables, plus a rolling cart filled with makeup, hair
spray, brushes and other tools of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of embalming is hygiene,'' said Taylor, standing
beside a body that had been covered with a white sheet. ``It's
giving the person back their dignity _ bathing, shaving, trimming
the fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a body will be at the school for about a week. ``We
work more slowly than a conventional mortuary because we work
around the students' schedules,'' Taylor explained.
</P>
<P>
   As both an administrator and a teacher, she tries to infuse
students with a healthy respect for their chosen profession. At the
same time, Taylor, 46, who received an MBA from the University of
San Francisco, is unabashedly enthusiastic about the business
opportunities available to funeral directors.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent class, she explained to a dozen students about
the trend of customers purchasing their own funerals in advance of
the Big Moment, locking in lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Of the various ways this can be done, Taylor said, one of the
most popular is to offer ``guaranteed'' trust funds that permit the
funeral director to invest the money as he or she sees fit (within
a limited number of low-risk investment vehicles like certificates
of deposit).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever amount is accrued beyond the agreed-upon cost of the
funeral can be kept as profit by the funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Another relatively recent innovation has been for directors to
arrange with insurance companies to receive commissions on
funeral-related policies sold to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people who make more in commissions than they do
in funeral fees,'' Taylor told her students, who took careful
notes. ``A commission can run 15, 16 percent. That can be a pretty
good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Taylor said she sees new students as being more
open-minded about innovations in the field, more eager to combine
old-fashioned care-giving with newfangled entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key developments to watch for, she said, is for
directors to follow the lead of telecom companies and focus on
``bundling'' of services.
</P>
<P>
   This wouldn't be limited to just casket sales and providing the
full gamut of traditional services. Taylor said the modern funeral
director also will offer such premium add-ons as memorial books,
videos and jewelry featuring either a thumbprint or actual ashes
belonging to the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely price pressures,'' she said. ``The market
is wide open and changing by the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Such prospects no doubt look attractive to students at the
mortuary college, who can expect about $15 an hour upon entering
the business, rising to as much as $25 an hour after becoming a
licensed embalmer.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco campus boasts of having an 85 percent
placement rate for graduates. Lane at the California Funeral
Directors Association said graduates of the school generally are
looked upon as good bets by operators of funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   While the San Francisco medical examiner's office has no formal
relationship with the college, a spokesman said its students ``seem
like good people'' who behave professionally in the presence of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   According to Taylor, this is ultimately all that matters in
cutting it in the funeral trade. Despite the lures of a stable
career and steady income, she said, a mortuary worker must, at the
end of the day, be responding to some higher calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about just having a job,'' Taylor observed. ``It's
about finding meaning in life.''

 &HT;    Ole Miss fans still sour about losing Tuberville
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ Ole Miss fans were more than a little upset Nov.
28. Tommy Tuberville, despite repeated denials to the contrary,
left for a more lucrative head coaching job at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   The folks in Oxford have not been bashful about expressing their
outrage and anticipation for today's game between Auburn and Ole
Miss at Jordan-Hare Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outside Abner's, a popular chicken-finger restaurant near the
Square of Oxford, a sign started the countdown to the Auburn game
108 days ago. On Friday, it read: ``Go Rebs. 1 Day Until
Tuberville.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mississippian, the Ole Miss student newspaper, has an
unusual advertisement in it. In the upper right corner of the ad is
an Auburn logo circled with a line through it. On Friday, it read:
``1 Day Until Auburn.'' The ad, sponsored by a popular restaurant,
has run for 298 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the Ole Miss fans arrive at Jordan-Hare Stadium today,
some of them will be sporting T-shirts with a picture of Tuberville
on the back. Above the photo are the words: ``Liar, Liar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I guess it's good,'' Tuberville said earlier this
week. ``It means that they cared if you stayed or if you went.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Tuberville's spin on the situation. Ole Miss players and
fans say that Tuberville was less than honest with them when he
left for Auburn two days after the Rebels lost to Mississippi State
in the last game of the '98 regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville insists it was a no-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is never a good way to leave,'' he said. ``It was just a
difficult and very unusual situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After last week's 37-34 overtime loss to Vanderbilt, Ole Miss
needs to beat Auburn for any hope of contending in the SEC's
Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (3-0), which defeated LSU 41-7 last week, is trying to
continue its fast start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a little emotional, seeing all those kids you
recruited on the other side,'' Tuberville said. ``But after that,
it's just another ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuscaloosa, Alabama will play its own version of a bad-blood
game when No. 14 Arkansas comes to Bryant-Denny Stadium. It was
supposed to be a meeting of two top 25 teams and an opportunity for
Alabama to show it can be a contender in the SEC West.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's 29-28 loss to Louisiana Tech in Birmingham has
shifted the focus. Now, the game becomes a fight for coach Mike
DuBose to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson Tide (2-1) plays Oct. 2 at Florida and then has a
bye week. If it goes into its week off with a 2-3 record, it would
not be good for DuBose.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week came another bad sign for DuBose when
athletics director Bob Bockrath, the man who hired him in 1996, was
forced to resign. DuBose publicly has asked the fractured Alabama
family to learn how to get along.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson Tide is 13-13 under DuBose and 0-6 against ranked
teams.

 &HT;    The haves will get best of have-nots this week
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ Three major upsets last Saturday offered further
proof of the shrinking talent gap between college football's haves
and have-nots. _ Wisconsin, ranked in the Top 10, lost 17-12 to a
Cincinnati team that had been beaten by I-AA Troy State the week
before.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas Tech lost to North Texas (21-14), a team that had lost
52-0 to LSU the week before.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arizona State inexplicably lost 35-7 to New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, Texas Tech and Arizona all were favored by more than
28 points in their games, but all went into the tank. Now, all
three games are listed among the top 11 upsets in the '90s, and
they happened on one Saturday!
</P>
<P>
   And that is why your favorite football predictor struggled to a
12-9 week.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought Vanderbilt could score 37 on anybody,
much less Ole Miss? Who would have thought Auburn, picked to finish
last in the SEC West, would go to Tiger Stadium and embarrass LSU?
Who would have thought a Miami cornerback would get vapor lock with
a minute left and get beat deep by Penn State's Chafie Fields?
</P>
<P>
   OK, enough venting. This week's picks:
</P>
<P>
   SEC
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida (0-3) at No. 11 Georgia (2-0), 1 p.m.
(Pay-per-view): UCF finally concludes a schedule of four games _
Purdue, Florida, Georgia Tech, Georgia _ that is an athletic
director's dream. The Bulldogs need to fine-tune their offense,
with LSU coming to Athens next week. Georgia, 42-7.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mississippi (2-1) at Auburn (3-0), 12:30 p.m.
(Jefferson-Pilot). The Rebels want former coach Tommy Tuberville
but got caught looking ahead and lost to Vandy. Auburn's magic
continues. Auburn, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 14 Arkansas (3-0) at Alabama (2-1), 3:30 p.m. (Channel
46). The Crimson Tide's 29-28 loss to Louisiana Tech took the
luster off this game. With the sharks circling coach Mike DuBose,
Alabama needs to win. This week's Upset Special: Alabama, 21-20.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 3 Florida (3-0) at Kentucky (2-1), 7:30 p.m. (ESPN). The
Gators will have a letdown after last week's win over Tennessee.
Florida will give up some yards, but the Wildcat D can't stop
anybody. Florida, 52-28.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rest: Tennessee 31, Memphis 7; Miss. State 20, South
Carolina 3.
</P>
<P>
   ACC
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 1 Florida State (3-0) at North Carolina (1-1), 3:30 p.m.
(Channel 2). The Seminoles go back on the road still looking for
consistency on offense. Two years ago, this was a great game, but
not now. Florida State, 31-10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia (2-1) at BYU (2-0), 9 p.m. (ESPN2). Two weeks ago,
the Cavaliers gave up 33 points to Clemson. BYU's passing attack,
led by Kevin Feterik, is a whole lot better. BYU 35, Virginia 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rest: Duke 28, Vanderbilt 24; N.C. State 35, Wake Forest
17.
</P>
<P>
   Top 25
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 9 Miami (2-1) vs. East Carolina (3-0) at Raleigh, N.C., 6
p.m. (ESPN2). If this game was being played at East Carolina, as
originally scheduled, it would be tempting to pick the Pirates. But
Hurricane Floyd caused the move to N.C. State's Carter-Finley
Stadium. The Hurricanes from Coral Gables won't be nice, either.
Miami, 35-14.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 4 Michigan (3-0) at No. 20 Wisconsin (2-1), 3:30 p.m. If
the Badgers hadn't taken the gas against Cincinnati, this would be
a meeting of Top 10 teams. Ron Dayne gets lots of yards but not
against great defenses like Michigan's. Michigan, 28-17.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 6 Nebraska (3-0) at Missouri (2-0), 7 p.m. (Fox Sports
Net). Nebraska's offense had one touchdown last week against
Southern Mississippi. If the Cornhuskers are going to be
contenders, now is the time to show it. Nebraska, 31-7.Southern
Miss (2-1) at Texas A&AMP;M (2-0), 3:30 p.m. The Aggies had better be
careful. Southern Miss outgained Nebraska last week in losing
20-13. The Golden Eagles have a lot of athletes. Texas A&AMP;M, 28-17.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rest: No. 2 Penn State 42, Indiana 13; No. 12 Ohio State
31, Ohio U. 6; No. 13 Purdue 35, Northwestern 20; No. 15 Kansas
State 24, Iowa State 14; No. 16 USC 24, Oregon 21; Stanford 27, No.
18 UCLA 24.

 &HT;    No one declared war, so no need to be partisan
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Don't take this the wrong way. I'm as loyal
as the next one. Red, white and blue. George Washington, Abe
Lincoln, Statue of Liberty, one nation under God, indivisible,
liberty and justice from sea to shining sea, and all that. But to
tell the truth, I don't care which side wins the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   If it's war, now that's a different story. I once packed my
clubs and got involved in one of those. But this is, well, what did
a couple of our patriot players call it? An ``exhibition''? There
are enough reminders of a past unpleasantness to register with the
British, Boston Tea Party, Bunker Hill, Paul Revere's ride, and all
those streets or parks hereabouts named for something
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I've always been one for the underdog, and the
Europeans always come into this thing a hopeless cause. They have
to listen to all these Americans chanting, ``USA! USA! USA!''
waving their Stars and Stripes and chortling. They don't even have
a flag to wave, just a plain little blue piece of cloth with a ring
of gold stars, and I don't know what it stands for.
</P>
<P>
   One way you look at it, the Ryder Cup is a lopsided competition.
It's the United States against a whole continent. Us against
Europe, except for one player, Jesper Parnevik, who sips the cream
of the U.S. tour, wears a cap with ``SAP America'' on the snap-up
bill, then becomes a Swede again when the Ryder Cup beckons. In
every way the Europeans are as underdoggy as a team can get.
</P>
<P>
   They play a second-class tour. It's European in name, but roams
as far as as Australia, Asia and Africa to fill out a schedule.
Purses are smaller. Courses are low maintenance. Hotels rooms are
cramped. Bathrooms are smaller, so are the beds. Towels are larger,
but they have to last a week. They play in several different
languages and jump as many as three oceans or countries between
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the Ryder Cup here, the leading money winner on the
American tour had taken in $4,266,585. Tiger Woods. Leader on the
European tour had earned a modest $1,969,366. Colin Montgomerie.
The gap between collective purses here and over there is roughly
$80million, also roughly what it takes to run a small republic. So
you see why the natural goal of most any player outside this
country is to go where the gold is, which is what brings Norman,
Faldo, Price, Singh and all those other immigrants to these shores,
with no thought of naturalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to preserve this great tradition, there should be no
excessive partisanship by the gallery,'' it is written in a joint
message from the two captains, Ben Crenshaw and Mark James. (It
does strike as passing strange that the Europeans should choose as
captain a player who was fined and suspended for unbecoming
behavior in the 1979 matches at Greenbriar. ``That,'' said the
defendant James, ``is tons and tons of water over the dam.'')
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it may seem, my ears detected a virtual even split
between American and European enthusiasm during the matches I
followed. Perhaps it was American sportsmanship at work, or perhaps
there are that many Europeans in the gallery. Or, on the other
hand, it may be a reflection of the tide of American galleries
turning on those players who whimpered about being paid to play for
their country. There I draw a line also, for these guys play for
self under the country's flag. They play for country no more than
the Atlanta Braves play baseball for their state.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, I detected an evenness in gallery response. There was
an exception here and there, such as on the 18th hole in the
morning match, when some ``patriot'' bellowed as Miguel Angel
Jiminez struck his approach shot, ``In the beach, Miguel, in the
beach!''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ball came to rest about 10 feet from the pin as one
of the day's more exciting matches closed out. Jiminez of Spain and
Padraig Harrington of Ireland held a one-hole lead until the
Spaniard pushed his drive into the trees on 17 in the match of
alternate shots. Harrington made a splendid recovery shot, but
Jiminez's chip was short and Davis Love III and Payne Stewart
evened the match with a par, and that's the way it ended.
</P>
<P>
   A touch of irony here: This is the course on which Love's father
led the U.S. Open during the third round in 1963 and played his way
into the Masters.

 &HT;    Chipper's cheating, Mets say
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Cheating? Chipper Jones?
</P>
<P>
   Several unnamed New York Mets suggested he was, after Jones'
four-home run, seven-RBI series led to an Atlanta sweep earlier
this week. Without specifying how, several Mets suggested
anonymously in a New Jersey newspaper Friday that Jones was getting
tipped off on pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes you wonder,'' one Met was quoted in The Bergen
Record.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose 11-homer September has helped make him a
front-runner in the National League MVP balloting, shook his head
when informed of the Mets' conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's funny. That's all I can say to that,'' he said. ``How
do I get tipped off on pitches when nobody's on base?''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. Two of Jones homers' came with the bases empty. But
the Mets were curious how Jones was able to turn so nimbly on an
Orel Hershiser pitch Wednesday that was out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, burned on a three-run shot Thursday, was trying to
throw a low cut-fastball that Jones snapped out of Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done that much damage to me in the past, so I told
myself, I'm going to use the pitch I've gotten him out with in the
past,'' Leiter said. ``I knew it was down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Cleveland Indians have been accused of using
closed-circuit television cameras in their parks to steal catchers'
signs, a suggestion one Met made. Jones is hitting .384 at home,
but .279 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does it in New York, you just tip your hat,'' said one
Met.

 &HT;    America's cup far from running over
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Maybe it's the Ryder Cup that thinks it's a
Stanley Cup. Enough action to fill an entire golf season found its
way to The Country Club on Friday, not merely one day of the 33rd
Ryder Cup. A worldwide television audience and 30,000 in attendance
saw eagles on top of eagles, nonstop birdie barrages and hole-outs
from everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the United States team, that didn't change the
gory details. Undaunted as heavy underdogs, the Europeans are doing
it again. They assumed a 6-2 lead Friday after the first day of
foursomes and best-ball play, limiting the U.S. to one win in eight
matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, they raise their level of play for this
tournament,'' said Davis Love III. ``Our teams seem to come in and
not play to its capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-day deficit is the worst for the Americans since 1987
at Muirfield Village, when they eventually lost to the Europeans
15-13. For the Americans, who are attempting to avoid being
three-peated by Europe, it was a stunning development.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. will need something soon and sensational to reverse the
momentum of the Europeans, who require just eight more points to at
least tie and retain the cup. Europe's oft-mentioned seven rookies
did not lose a match. Spain's 19-year-old Sergio Garcia, the
youngest competitor in Ryder Cup history, was the only player to
win in both in foursomes and best-ball, partnering with Sweden's
Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great start for us, but I'm aware there's a long way
to go,'' said European captain Mark James.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2 1/2-1 1/2 after the morning alternate-shot
competition, the U.S. managed only a half by Love and Justin
Leonard against Scotland's Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie in the
afternoon. Things were so sparse for the U.S., the tie was treated
like a win, with Love igniting the gallery on a 25-foot birdie at
18. Earlier, Love matched eagles with Lawrie at the 14th.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' lofty world rankings proved worthless on the
first day. Both No. 1 Tiger Woods and No. 2 David Duval lost both
of their matches. They dropped one together in best-ball when
Ireland's Darren Clarke, playing with England's Lee Westwood, put
his second shot to the 18th, in fading light, to five feet and sank
it for birdie and a 1-up decision.

HENDRIX FAMILY ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR MEMORIAL TO GUITAR LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's a memorial fit for a guitar legend.
</P>
<P>
   With its domed roof, granite columns, waterfalls, pond and
life-size bronze statue, the Jimi Hendrix Memorial is sure to be a
magnet for fans of the Seattle-born rock star who still stirs
strong passions.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix's family, led by father Al Hendrix and sister Janie
Hendrix, yesterday announced plans to erect the lavish memorial at
Renton's Greenwood Memorial Park and Cemetery south of Seattle,
where Jimi Hendrix has been buried since shortly after his
drug-related death in London on Sept. 18, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming year, Hendrix will be moved from his present
burial site _ family members wouldn't say when _ and moved to the
new memorial, which will include plots for up to 60 current and
future members of the Hendrix clan.
</P>
<P>
   When the memorial is finished next September, the Hendrix family
hopes to celebrate with an all-star concert featuring a number of
Jimi's musical colleagues. Additional events will be planned for
the 30th anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix, born in Seattle on Nov. 27, 1942, was one of the most
influential guitarists in rock 'n' roll. Though others had
experimented with feedback and distortion, Hendrix made them part
of a new musical vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Hendrix fans have complained the musician who dazzled
concertgoers at Woodstock and recorded the songs ``Hey Joe,''
``Purple Haze'' and ``All Along the Watchtower'' deserved a more
fitting memorial than the modest headstone that was placed at his
grave in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Other memorials have been erected around Seattle, but nothing as
over-the-top as the granite shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans have been asking, `Why don't you do more?' '' Al Hendrix,
80, said Friday at the groundbreaking ceremony. ``Jimi seems to be
more popular now than when he was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Groundskeepers estimate more than 15,000 Hendrix fans visit
Jimi's grave each year. The cemetery will install lighting at the
new memorial, but no fences or special security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's free to you,'' Janie Hendrix told fans.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the family regained the rights to Jimi
Hendrix's songs after years of legal wrangling and has since been
releasing his music on Experience Hendrix, a nationally
distributed, Seattle-based label.
</P>
<P>
   The Hendrix family was once aligned with Microsoft cofounder
Paul Allen, who is building the Experience Music Project museum at
Seattle Center and who owns one of the largest collections of
Hendrix memorabilia in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But because of disagreements that neither side will talk about,
Allen's interactive music museum will no longer focus on Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   Janie Hendrix, 38, said the time is right for a Hendrix
gravesite memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the old adage says, `If you build it, they will come,'''
she said. ``Greenwood is where fans come to see Jimi.''
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen fans cheered and yelled ``We love Jimi!'' when an
artist's drawing of the memorial was unveiled to the sounds of
Hendrix's ``Voodoo Chile.'' Among them was Dan Palmer, who drove
his 1948 Plymouth in Hendrix's 1970 funeral procession. ``I'm quite
impressed, especially with the symbolism of the architecture,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial will feature purple lights _ purple was Jimi's
favorite color _ and three shades of granite, providing a rainbow
of colors. The guitarist's favorite number, nine, will also be
reflected in the structure's nine granite columns.
</P>
<P>
   The life-size bronze statue inside depicts Hendrix at Woodstock
in all his guitar-playing glory.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-foot-high structure, which will rest on a recently
purchased plot at the cemetery's new seven-acre Family Heritage
Park, will be an eye-popping addition.
</P>
<P>
   Contractor for the project is Cold Springs Granite, which has
built memorials for Joe DiMaggio and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The family declined to say how much the memorial will cost, but
Janie Hendrix suggested the figure would exceed $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Family members will be able to purchase individual plots, which
will encircle the new memorial. ``As my father says, `We pay as we
go. It's like a layaway plan,'' Janie Hendrix quipped.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial fund has been established so that Hendrix fans can
participate in the project by purchasing granite bricks or time
capsules. Experience Hendrix will announce details next week
through a Web site at www.jimihendrixmemorial.com

<P>
   An operation that appears to have restored fertility to a young
woman whose ovaries had been removed has offered hope to thousands
of other young women facing infertility brought on by cancer
treatment or benign conditions like ovarian cysts.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has also touched off speculation _ some of it
farfetched, scientists say _ about whether ovarian transplants
might one day be used to help women ward off menopause indefinitely
and have babies well into their golden years.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, researchers revealed for the first time that
ovarian tissue worked normally after being removed from a young
woman, frozen and returned to her body two years later. The woman
is Margaret Lloyd-Hart, 30, a ballerina from Arizona whose ovaries
had been removed because of cysts and other noncancerous medical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lloyd-Hart, who had the tissue re-implanted last February,
has ovulated and had a menstrual period, which means that she may
be able to become pregnant, said her surgeon, Dr. Kutluk Oktay of
New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Her case is the first known success of an eagerly awaited
procedure that holds out the hope of restoring fertility to young
women who must have their ovaries removed because of noncancerous
disorders like cysts or endometriosis, or who face infertility as a
side effect of chemotherapy for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Women at a few other medical centers have also had ovaries
removed and frozen, but Oktay's report is the first case in which
the tissue was given back to the patient and found to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news, and important information,'' said Dr.
Jairo Garcia, director of the in vitro fertilization program at
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ``The application of this is
of tremendous value for younger patients who had malignancies and
are scheduled for radiation or chemotherapy, which jeopardize their
reproductive potential.''
</P>
<P>
   But the procedure cannot stop menopause in older women, and it
cannot be done for women with ovarian cancer, Oktay said, adding
that he was disturbed by press reports, particularly in British
tabloids, proclaiming that menopause could now be reversed and
women with ovarian cancer could give birth.
</P>
<P>
   The research was first reported in England because one of
Oktay's co-authors on a paper about the technique disclosed the
information to the British press. Originally it was to have been
released Monday at a Meeting of the Society for Reproductive
Medicine in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been swamped with people who are menopausal or
perimenopausal calling us, thinking they can freeze an ovary and
have it returned,'' Oktay said. ``This is not a procedure for
menopausal women. It's for women under age 30. It's meant for
preserving ovarian function in women who are otherwise going to
lose it, mostly because of cancer treatment or the ovaries coming
out for benign conditions. It's not meant for somebody with ovarian
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Women close to menopause are not candidates for the procedure
because their ovaries do not have enough eggs to restore fertility
after freezing and thawing, he said. And, he added, no doctor would
put a cancerous ovary back into a patient.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a young woman could have one ovary removed at, say, age
25 and given back later at 50 to ward off menopause and extend her
childbearing years, Oktay said that for now he would not perform
such an operation on a healthy woman.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, he said, it is not known whether removing an ovary
might harm her health or fertility. Second, doctors do not yet know
how long or well the transplanted tissue will survive and function.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts said Oktay's report suggested ``Brave New
World'' possibilities. Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the center
for bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said, ``If you
could freeze ovaries, you could give them back to other people.
It's when the ovary doesn't go back to the place where it started
that it gets very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Oktay said that transplanting ovaries from one woman to another
was not practical at present. Women who lack ovaries but want to
become pregnant can do so with eggs donated by another woman, he
said. They do not need an entire ovary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put in somebody else's ovary, the body would reject
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The immunosuppressive drugs needed to prevent rejection cannot
be taken during pregnancy, said Garcia of Johns Hopkins. But, he
added, that could change.
</P>
<P>
   Oktay said he did not see much point in an older woman's having
an ovary transplant just to prevent menopause, when she could more
easily take estrogen. ``Taking immunosuppressive drugs to keep an
ovary just so you don't have to take hormone replacement doesn't
make sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lloyd-Hart had had one ovary removed at age 17 because of
benign cysts. The other, thought to be diseased, was removed when
she was 28. But that ovary turned out to be healthy, and Ms.
Lloyd-Hart, hoping to have children some day, had segments of it
frozen at the University of Arizona. Two years later, she was
referred to Oktay.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Researchers in his laboratory, Dr. Guvenc Karlikaya and Dr.
Vulent Aydin, sewed bits of the tissue to a scaffold made of
surgical foam. Then, Oktay and Dr. Shavi Shapira implanted the
tissue into Ms. Lloyd-Hart's pelvis, where it soon began producing
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, she took hormones to stimulate eggs to
mature. The treatment worked: she ovulated, and then had a
menstrual period, like any fertile woman.
</P>
<P>
   If she wants to become pregnant, doctors will have to stimulate
the ovarian tissue again, retrieve eggs and perform in vitro
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he thought that the freezing and re-implanting
technique had great potential. But, he cautioned, doctors need to
study it to find out how much of the grafted tissue survives and
how many eggs it can produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go to make sure it's working and really
is therapeutic for the patient,'' he said.

FRESHMAN QUARTERBACK PRINTERS TAKES OVER AT TCU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Casey Printers was in high school, his ability to throw a
football eventually earned him a familiar nickname: ``The
Rifleman.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, recalls Stacy Printers, by the time her son finished at
DeSoto _ having thrown for 29 touchdowns and more than 3,800 yards
in his final two years _ the school had created a new T-shirt logo
reflecting his influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a hot quarterback,'' she says, ``that on the front
of the shirt they had a flaming football flying through the air.''
</P>
<P>
   In due course, various representatives of college football's
nobility began inquiring about his plans. Included on the list were
Notre Dame, Syracuse, Oklahoma, Arizona State, Texas A&AMP;M and
Baylor. But, through a helpful confluence of home, family and those
charmers on the TCU coaching staff, The Rifleman became a Horned
Frog.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he signed,'' Stacy says, ``he told them his goal was to
become the starting quarterback in his freshman year.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a medical miracle allowing injured senior Patrick
Batteaux to play, that's expected to happen tonight when the Frogs
(0-2) play at Arkansas State (0-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited,'' says Printers, who completed 9 of 13
passes for 109 yards against Northwestern two weeks ago after
Batteaux went out with a hand injury. ``This has been my dream, but
I really didn't expect it to happen in the third game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to help us win. ... Losing can make you or break
you, depending on how you respond to it, and I just want us to
start winning. That's the goal right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Printers has a few modest goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to break every record they have here,'' he says. ``And
win the Davey O'Brien Award. Also, the Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all in one weekend, mind you, but head coach Dennis
Franchione has already identified the 6-foot-4, 190-pound Printers
as ``the most advanced freshman quarterback I've ever seen.''
Franchione also said that after signing with TCU, Printers attended
all of the spring drills, except for the one he missed for his
senior prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really trying to ease the transition into college. This
is a very versatile offense, kind of unique, and I wanted to start
learning about it as quickly as I could,'' Printers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wants to start,'' Stacy said, laughing. ``That's why
he went to all those practices, because being the starter has
always been his goal. And he's a very focused individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that focus has been provided by Stacy _ a supervisor
with the Texas Department of Human Resources in Arlington _ who
raised Casey and older brother Kevin alone from the time they were
babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't had that much contact with my father through
the years,'' says Printers, speaking of Glen Printers _ a legendary
athlete, who was twice all-state at South Oak Cliff and was drafted
by the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We divorced when the boys were 2 and 3 years old,'' Stacy
says. ``I don't think Casey has anything against his father, he
just really doesn't know him. I doubt if he's ever seen Casey
play.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Printers says, ``I had several uncles who took an interest
in me and kind of took up the slack. They helped me a lot and
taught me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Jason Medlock, who played at Texas A&AMP;M, UNLV and
finally with Calgary in the Canadian Football League. He is now
working on a master's degree at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that flaming football stuff from DeSoto is the truth,'' he
says. ``We started working Casey out at an early age, and he was
throwing 70-yard touchdown passes when he was 12 years old, playing
in the kids' leagues. He quarterbacked a national championship team
once that was sponsored by Michael Irvin. In high school, he was
The Rifleman all right. His best pass is a 10-to-15 yard out, and
he has such arm strength that I've seen that pass bounce off
receivers' face masks. In fact, I've seen that pass get /stuck'' in
a guy's face mask.''
</P>
<P>
   To Medlock's knowledge, the only individual who ever intercepted
one of those missiles is Aaron Glenn, who normally provides that
service for the New York Jets. Medlock took Casey to work out with
former Aggies Kevin Murray, Kevin Smith and Glenn in the
summertime.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, Aaron got in that out route and picked the ball off,
and it stunned Casey _ so he's been working to improve it ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Printers' favorite target was brother Kevin, now at
Cisco Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great receiver but he got hurt in high school, and it
kind of put him behind,'' Printers says. ``Now, he's in good shape
and playing again, and I would like to see him come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Would it be worth it for the Frogs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin,'' Medlock says, ``can leap tall buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, Stacy says, is at Cisco working on his grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are more conscientious about that than others,''
she said. ``But I think he's learned a lesson about that and is
recovering nicely. Actually, I can't complain too much about either
of them. They're a lot alike, and they were great kids growing up _
very quiet and mild-mannered.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, however, there was one slightly loose cannon in
the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was me,'' Stacy said. ``I was a typical football mom, and I
would go to the games and scream and yell and just drive everybody
nuts. Finally, the coaches came around and they said, `Look, we'll
be glad to come by and pick Casey up _ and we'll feed him and
everything _ if you'll just stay away from the games.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On this, Casey is prepared to back Stacy up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time,'' he said, ``I got the wind knocked out of me in a
game ... and she came running out onto the field. I wasn't hurt bad
at all, but oh, it was embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the recruiting process began, selecting the right school
became a family project. Medlock put in a good word for the Frogs,
Casey ``liked the idea of being close to home and the family,'' and
Stacy pointed out ``that he might be able to start quicker at a
smaller school.''
</P>
<P>
   The clincher, she says, was the performance of the TCU coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were superb,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was being recruited, Syracuse was tempting,'' Casey
said, ``because they kept comparing me to Donovan McNabb, who is
one of my favorites, along with Akili Smith and Warren Moon.
Originally, I was thinking in terms of Michigan or Arizona or
someone like that, because just a few years ago, I wasn't even
aware of TCU.
</P>

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Almost unnoticed in the fuss over
fifth-ranked Texas A&AMP;M's new offensive might is that seven of the
defense's nine turnovers have led to 41 of the Aggies' 99 points in
their first two games.
</P>
<P>
   But then, of course, causing that kind of havoc has become
tantamount to the Wrecking Crew philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we do,'' senior free safety Brandon Jennings said.
``It's part of our tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the inception of Big 12 Conference play, A&AMP;M is plus-37 in
turnover margin. Four interceptions in last week's rout of Tulsa
extended the streak of at least one pick to 11 consecutive
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of expect that,'' coach R.C. Slocum said. ``Part of
playing good defense is expecting to knock balls loose, pick up
fumbles and make interceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crew has capitalized on the opportunities presented by
playing pass-first offenses favored by Louisiana Tech and Tulsa.
Jennings and cornerback Jason Webster have two interceptions each.
Ronald Patton, Jennings' backup, has one and strong safety Michael
Jameson has another. The Aggies also have broken up 13 passes.
</P>
<P>
   And while the theft opportunities this afternoon against
Southern Mississippi (2-1) at Kyle Field (2:30 p.m. kickoff) may
not be as great as in the first two contests, Jennings isn't
complaining about facing a more balanced, conventional-style
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly? I'm going into the Southern Miss game with a sigh of
relief,'' Jennings confessed. ``Our first two opponents were
throwing like 65 passes a game \R68 and 29 to be exact\S. We'll see
more running this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Eagles feature 223-pound running back Derrick Nix,
nicknamed ``The Baby Bull.'' But Southern Miss also has two
excellent receivers in Todd Pinkston and Sherrod Gideon. Nix is
averaging 112.3 yards a game. Pinkston, a 6-foot-2 speedster, has
362 yards on 20 catches. Gideon in two games has 12 receptions for
132 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run more of a typical offense, though they keep you on
your toes,'' Webster said. ``But we've gone over so many things in
practice the past few weeks, so we're always looking for something
weird. Now, we see three or four wideouts _ we're ready to
adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies another hidden benefit of the Aggies' two opening
games. Because of their use of extra defensive backs on passing
downs, the most experienced part of the defense has even more savvy
because of playing time already stockpiled by players like Patton,
sophomore Jay Brooks and freshman corner Sammy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy already has 100 plays under his belt,'' new secondary
coach Ron Milus noted. ``And a guy like Jay Brooks feels like he's
a starter because he's played like he is one.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said the offensive philosophies of the first two
opponents have actually kept the Crew from its traditional attack
mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get better at our pressure package, utilize it
more,'' Slocum said. ``We probably could have done that more
\Ragainst Louisiana Tech\S, but it's hard to second-guess yourself
when their longest completion was for 18 yards and you hold them to
17 points.''

GARCIA STRIKES FIRST BLOW VS. WOODS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Score the first face-to-face meeting between
golf's international glamour boys to Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish teen-ager combined with Jesper Parnevik to knock off
Tiger Woods and Tom Lehman, 2 and 1, in yesterday's most celebrated
alternate-shot match at the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it was Parnevik who made the match's most telling shots
at The Country Club. But history will record this as the first
competitive pairing involving Woods, 23, and Garcia, 19 _ the top
two finishers at last month's PGA Championship and a pair of
emotional performers described by U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw as
``two of the most exciting people in the world to watch play
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the youngest player in Ryder Cup history, always will be
able to say he helped knock off the world's top-ranked player in
his debut at the biennial event. Such a distinction had him
flashing his signature smile after Parnevik sealed the victory with
an 8-foot birdie putt at No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more could you ask for?'' Garcia said. ``It was very
good, and I'm happy to help Europe get a point. This was something
I was really looking forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   During his dream debut, Garcia and Parnevik rallied from a
2-down deficit by winning four of the final 13 holes and halving
the other nine. After a bogey by the U.S. team at No. 6, Parnevik
drilled a 5-iron within four feet of the pin at the par-3 seventh
hole. Garcia's birdie putt squared the match.
</P>
<P>
   A gaffe by Woods turned the match at No. 12. Woods faced a
55-foot, downhill putt for birdie that he rolled 15 feet past the
hole. When Lehman failed to convert for par, the Europeans led for
the first time in the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to give them a hole like that,'' Woods said.
``I blistered that putt ... and that turned the tide for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik slammed the door. He drained a 12-foot birdie putt to
halve the 14th hole and sealed the victory with his 8-footer at No.
17. Before Parnevik's final putt, Lehman missed a 10-footer for
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Both Woods and Garcia attempted to downplay the Tiger-vs.-Sergio
angle of their morning match. But Parnevik, who proved to be the
star, said the outcome provided a confidence boost for his young
partner that should help carry him through his remaining matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio might be 19 on his birth certificate, but he doesn't
play that way,'' Parnevik said. ``He hit a lot of great iron shots
and chip shots. This was a very exciting comeback. We definitely
needed that one, and I think it will help Sergio. He's off to a
great start.''

KEVIN SMITH TO TEST INJURED BACK, HOPING FOR OCT. 3 RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Deion Sanders is not the only injured veteran
Cowboys cornerback eying a possible return after this Sunday's bye.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith, who has been sidelined for the past five weeks with
a back injury, said he will practice with the team Monday and hopes
to be ready for the Oct. 3 game against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's announcement came a day after Sanders confirmed that he
and his surgically repaired left big toe would make their season
debut against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike Sanders, whose return is almost a certainty,
Smith's plans for Arizona are more of a personal goal than a
promise to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can go,'' Smith said. ``I feel better. I'll go
out there and see how it goes Monday. If I don't practice Wednesday
or Thursday, then quite naturally this is not the week. And I'll
just continue my therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who said there were times over the past few weeks when he
couldn't walk straight, drive a car or even sit through a movie,
said he wants to play but is not going to rush himself back on the
field. He said his absence has robbed him of his conditioning, and
he's rusty in his technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't covered anybody since training camp,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he's anticipating Smith's return
but wasn't sure when it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot closer to one week than six weeks,'' Gailey said.
DEION UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders finished a second day of full practice with no
problems, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Also important is that Sanders was able to practice; the
soreness from Thursday didn't have a bearing on yesterday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out of Thursday's practice better than he had in
previous days,'' Gailey said. ``It \Rhis return to field\S looks
like its real close to me.'' BYE-WEEK OBJECTIVES MET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Gailey said his team didn't have a crisp practice
yesterday, he said the Cowboys did accomplish what they had hoped
during the bye week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we wanted to do during the bye week was get
well,'' said Gailey, who expects to get tight end Mike Lucky
(stress fracture in his left foot) and tackle Erik Williams
(quadriceps strain) back on the practice field next week along with
Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said not having a crisp practice didn't bother him
because the environment wasn't suitable for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice was not crisp because we don't have that edge of
preparing for a game,'' Gailey said. ``They know we are not
preparing for a game.'' nn

MANY NAMED IN JOHN F. KENNEDY'S WILL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (rk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John F. Kennedy Jr.'s personal belongings will go to
his sister's children and his money to a multimillion-dollar trust
benefiting relatives, friends, longtime family employees and two
charities, according to documents filed Friday in Manhattan
Surrogate's Court.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's will does not describe the value of his estate, which
has been estimated at more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   The will was signed on Dec. 19, 1997, more than a year after his
marriage to Carolyn Bessette, who died with him in a plane crash
off the Massachusetts coast in July along with her sister, Lauren
Bessette. Had Carolyn Bessette Kennedy survived, she would have
received her husband's personal property and their apartment on
North Moore Street in the TriBeCa section of lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy named his cousin Timothy P. Shriver, the president and
chief executive of the Special Olympics and the son of Eunice
Shriver, a sister of President Kennedy, as executor of his estate.
John Kennedy Jr.'s first choice for executor of his estate had been
another cousin, Anthony S. Radziwill. But Radziwill, the son of Lee
Radziwill Ross, the sister of Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, died of cancer on Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the apartment, the only specific item mentioned in
Kennedy's will was ``a scrimshaw set previously owned by my
father.'' Kennedy directed that the set be given to his nephew,
John B. Kennedy Schlossberg, who is now 6. The boy and his sisters,
Rose Kennedy Schlossberg, 11, and Tatania C. Kennedy Schlossberg,
9, were also named beneficiaries of Kennedy's share of the real
estate he owned with his sister, including an estate on Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Bequests were also left to two other children, Phineas Howie, 7,
and Olivia Howie, 4, who were described by their mother, Alexandra
Chermayeff, as Kennedy's godchildren. Ms. Chermayeff, who lives in
Catskill, N.Y., said Friday that she and Kennedy were classmates at
Phillip's Academy in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy served on the boards of a number of nonprofit
organizations, but only two were named as beneficiaries in the
court documents. One was Reaching Up, a nonprofit group based on
East 80th Street in Manhattan that provides educational and other
opportunities for workers who help people with disabilities. The
other was the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library Foundation in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Others included in a list of 14 beneficiaries were Marta Sgubin,
who was Mrs. Onassis' cook for 25 years; Ephigenio Pinheiro, Mrs.
Onassis' personal assistant; RoseMarie Terenzio, Kennedy's
assistant at George, the political magazine he founded four years
ago; Robert Littell, a writer, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., another
cousin. No dollar amounts for the bequests were released.
</P>
<P>
   The will made no mention of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Peter C. Olsen, the lawyer who filed the probate petition and a
co-trustee of Kennedy's trust fund, did not return several
telephone calls Friday. Olsen, a partner at Battle Fowler, also
represented President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
in their recent purchase of a home in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, his wife, 33, and his sister-in-law, 34, died on
July 16 when the single-engine Piper Saratoga airplane he was
piloting plunged into the waters off Martha's Vineyard. The couple
had intended to leave Lauren Bessette on the island before heading
to Hyannis to attend the wedding of Kennedy's cousin Rory.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Anne M. Freeman, the mother of the Bessette sisters,
filed court papers in Manhattan asking to become the administrator
of her daughters' estates and seeking the right to file
personal-injury and wrongful-death lawsuits in the future against
``unknown'' people or parties.
</P>
<P>
   When the papers were filed, Constantine P. Ralli, Mrs. Freeman's
lawyer, would not disclose whether his client intended to file a
lawsuit against the Kennedy estate or any other party. Ralli did
not return a telephone call to his office Friday night.

COMMENTARY: THE LONG SHADOW OF THE TEXAS SNIPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another killing, another show. When Larry Ashbrook opened fire
in a Fort Worth church last week, this much was certain: the
tragedy would trigger a new flood of sound and fury signifying very
little. The mass murders of the past year have proved a fatal
attraction for cable news networks seeking ratings and politicians
seeking votes, and the Fort Worth installment might still be going
on had not the potentially more lethal Hurricane Floyd drowned it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Before the latest massacre did fade from view, plenty of
nonsense typical of all these incidents was committed in its name.
In the ritualized rhetorical shootout over gun control, Al Gore
said he was for it; the Bush campaign countered that ``not one
thing Al Gore proposed would have kept the Fort Worth tragedy from
happening.'' Whom do we root for? True, neither current laws nor
any of the modest administration-backed gun control legislation
before Congress would have denied Ashbrook his arsenal. But George
W. Bush, who parrots the NRA line of enforcing existing laws,
offers even less.
</P>
<P>
   As if this bipartisan posturing weren't enough, along comes
Jerry Falwell to designate the Fort Worth blood bath a hate crime,
and to make the statement in Time, now reverberating loudly in
conservative media, that ``most hate crimes in America ... are
directed at evangelical Christians'' rather than ``African-American
or Jewish people or gays or lesbians.'' Neither FBI statistics nor
the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate crimes, offer
an iota of evidence to support this assertion, whose only point
seems to be to pit groups against each other by turning
victimization into a contest of one-upmanship. It's not even 100
percent clear that hate was the sole or principal motivation of
Ashbrook, whom his neighbors called ``crazy Larry.'' He did
scatologically deride Christianity as he opened fire, but he came
from a religious family and had been part of a Church of Christ
young ministers' group as a teen-ager; the Fort Worth police have
found no evidence linking him to hate groups. Like Russell Weston
Jr., the schizophrenic man who shot up the U.S. Capitol last year,
Ashbrook had expressed no ideology publicly beyond paranoid screeds
fantasizing that he was being shadowed by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day as the horrors in Fort Worth, as nasty fate
would have it, the University of Texas in Austin was officially
reopening its long-closed 30-story tower _ the site of the
historical progenitor of Ashbrook's mass murder, the gunning down
of 45 people, 14 of them fatally, by the sniper Charles Whitman in
1966. The university was hoping it could put the memory of its
saddest day behind it, and it's hard to imagine how the timing
could have been worse. Yet by coincidentally reminding us of the
Whitman story at this juncture in 1999, the university may have
done us an inadvertent favor. That archetypal slaughter of three
decades ago offers a hugely valuable perspective that has been lost
as our leaders and loudmouths distort or oversimplify the new crop
of Whitmans.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the authoritative account of the Whitman case, ``A
Sniper in the Tower'' by Gary M. Lavergne _ which was published in
1997, before our recent mass murders _ one feels it's as much
prophecy as history. It may tell us more about the Ashbrooks in our
midst than any of the blather of last week.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whitman, for those who don't remember, was an
``all-American boy,'' the youngest Eagle Scout in the world as a
child, a former Marine, a product of Catholic parochial schools, a
young man of ``high values'' according to his professors. He was
the antithesis of the stereotype of a mass killer at the time.
Unlike the brutal murderers in Truman Capote's ``In Cold Blood''
(then a best seller) or Richard Speck, who had killed eight Chicago
nurses just three weeks before the Austin blood bath, Whitman was
not a tattooed, creepy drifter who looked like a thug. He further
broke the mold by committing his crime in a public place, in a
scenario that guaranteed his own death. ``Arguably,'' Lavergne
writes, ``he introduced America to domestic terrorism, but it was
terrorism without a cause.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Who was he, why did he do it, how could future Whitmans be
stopped? Then, as now, Americans struggled frantically to find
answers. Ralph Yarborough, the Texas senator, blamed television (in
the season of ``The Munsters'' and ``Bewitched''). Others thought
Whitman had been desensitized by the cultural atmosphere generated
by the Vietnam War (in which he hadn't served); some called for the
abolition of the Marines, since it had harbored both Whitman and
Lee Harvey Oswald. J. Edgar Hoover, of all unlikely advocates,
suggested more gun control as a preventative (though Whitman was a
legal, trained gun owner who could well have run a
government-mandated gun-training program). A university
psychiatrist to whom Whitman had mentioned his murderous fantasies
in a single consultation was pilloried for not locking him up (a
legal non-starter, given that Whitman's family and associates all
viewed him as a sane, solid citizen). Maybe, Lavergne writes after
sifting all the evidence and concluding that no psychiatric
diagnosis is possible, Whitman ``was just mean as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   When I spoke to the author this week, he said he had no
ambitions to predict this year's massacres, but was nonetheless
struck by the case of the day trader Mark O. Barton of Atlanta,
whose story he found almost identical to the Texas Tower massacre
``except for the Tower.'' (Among the similarities: Whitman, like
Barton, killed family members, including his wife, on the eve of
his spree and left behind notes saying he did so out of his love
for them.) Lavergne can't pinpoint the cause of Barton's explosion
any more than he can Whitman's. But he did add that it was as
absurd to attribute the Atlanta massacre to day trading or the
Internet as it would be to attribute Whitman's to the University of
Texas. ``Some of the pressure on Whitman was that he was taking too
many courses, but whose fault was that?'' he asked rhetorically, in
making the parallel to Barton's financial overreaching.
</P>
<P>
   Much of our speculation about other mass killers is similarly
useless. Salon magazine's Dave Cullen, who has been on top of the
Columbine story from the start, reported on Thursday that
investigators finalizing the official report on Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold now say they ``were never part of the Trench Coat
Mafia'' and ``didn't target jocks, minorities or Christians.'' In
the irrational ravings the boys left behind, they railed ``against
minorities  &UR; and &LR;  whites, praising Hitler's `final solution' _ and
then ranting against racism.'' Salon quotes the case's lead
investigator, Kate Battan: ``I've been working on this nonstop
daily since April 20th and I can't tell you why it happened.'' Now
we know that most of the other expert answers we've had are not
only pure speculation of the same sort that trailed the Whitman
case but are based on erroneous information to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Since we don't know why some of these cases happen, how do we
prevent them? ``It is part of being in a free and open society,''
says Lavergne, ``that people can, if they want to, do a fairly
large amount of damage in a fairly short time.'' He is echoed by
Mark Potok, spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, who,
while applauding law enforcement's improved record on preventing
extremist terrorist conspiracies since Oklahoma City, says he
doesn't know how you can stop some lone-wolf mass killers, whatever
their motivation, without a Draconian repeal of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   While many of us may agree with the need for far more effective
gun control and a far stronger mental health safety net _ desirable
reforms that could make a difference in some cases _ we can't
pretend that either could stop a mass killer with a will, a death
wish and easy access to any of the country's 200 million privately
held guns. Politicians and other public figures who pop up after
these massacres to imply otherwise are either manipulating us or
exploiting these tragedies for their own purposes at a time when,
paradoxically, most violent crime is on the wane. Arguing against
hate-crime laws in Sunday's New York Times Magazine, the writer
Andrew Sullivan observes that there's no way to eradicate hate in a
free country. The same, sadly, could be said of that indefinable
element in a Whitman, a Barton, a Harris and perhaps now an
Ashbrook that, if only for lack of a more precise term, we call
evil.

STRENGTH OF JIMENEZ-OLAZABAL GOES UNANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Four-ball Match 3 
Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria Olazabal, Europe, def. Hal
Sutton and Jeff Maggert, United States, 2 and 1. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The deficit was the same as they faced in
their morning match against Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke _ two
down after four holes _ before turning up the heat and winning, 3
and 2, to give the United States its first point of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, there was no comeback, no stirring run of
three straight birdies to jump-start them. This time, in their
afternoon duel against Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria
Olazabal, Hal Sutton and Jeff Maggert fell short and lost the
afternoon match, 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Sutton or Maggert made a shot that appeared to boost
them over the hump, Jimenez and Olazabal countered with nifty shots
of their own. And vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   To wit:
</P>
<P>
   --Olazabal drained a 10-footer for birdie just off the fringe on
the 6th hole that would have put the Europeans 3 up. But Sutton
birdied from 8 feet to halve the hole.
</P>
<P>
   --Sutton dropped in a 12-footer on the 8th for birdie, but
Olazabal answered from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   --Sutton hit a great approach on No. 9, just missed making
eagle, and Olazabal and Jimenez conceded the 2-footer for birdie.
Olazabal then answered with a birdie from 7 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks did pull within a hole on the par-4, 450-yard 11th,
when Sutton and Maggert parred and Jiminez watched his 3-footer for
par rim the cup and squirt out. Sutton and Maggert gave it back on
the next hole with bogeys, and the European lead was 2 up.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez was the difference, canning birdie putts on the first
(11 feet) and fourth holes after drilling a wedge from 67 yards to
within 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez , a European Ryder Cup rookie, along with Sergio Garcia,
Padraig Harrington, and Paul Lawrie, drew praise from captain Mark
James.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected them to play well and hold up under pressure, but
you never know if you're going to win matches or not. Point-wise,
we probably didn't expect them to get that many points, but I
expected them to play well and hold up under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez will be paired with Harrington this morning against
Tiger Woods and Steve Pate. The Jimenez-Harrington duo grabbed a
1/2-point against Davis Love and Payne Stewart in the morning
foursomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very good player,'' James said of Jimenez. ``He's
been improving his game steadily every year for a long time now.
He's turned himself into an all-around player.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton bemoaned the putts that got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to make a few more birdies this afternoon and we
couldn't quite get them,'' said Sutton. of the effort with Maggert.
``I felt like we were always trying to make par. Any time you play
the Spaniards, they're not going to give shots back to you. They
all play the same kind of game _ a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton commented on the 6-2 deficit the Americans are facing
heading into Saturday's matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to reach down inside and pull
something out. We're all going to have to play well. We can't have
one person play well and the others not. We're going to have to
reach down. We're good players, we can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Europeans) always have (the lead) after the first day. I
don't want to lay that off as an excuse, but it seems we always
find ourselves well behind after the first day. It's just a matter
of who wants it the worst.''

FRANCE CALLS U.S. INSENSITIVE FOR ALLOWING IRAQ TO SUFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France
accused the United States on Friday of insensitivity to the ``human
disaster'' in Iraq caused by economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is insensitive to the human catastrophe
under way in Iraq,'' Vedrine told reporters during a breakfast
meeting. ``Iraq is not just made up of Saddam Hussein himself,'' he
said. ``There are men, women and children, a whole society which is
being destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine, who is here for the General Assembly's annual debate,
said that Iraq does not pose any threat now, but could do so again.
He said a new monitoring system was needed so that Saddam, Iraq's
president, does not revive his programs to develop biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has not had inspectors working in Iraq since
last December, when they were pulled out before the United States
and Britain launched punitive airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi foreign minister, Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, speaking to
the General Assembly Friday, insisted that Iraq ha fulfilled its
obligations under the sanctions. He complained that a new
British-Dutch draft resolution circulating among Security Council
members would impose ``new obligations'' on Baghdad that went
beyond earlier measures.
</P>
<P>
   Sahaf did not identify the obligations. But he said that the
Security Council, in the course of 40 sessions reviewing Iraq's
performance, ``failed not only in taking a decision to lift the
comprehensive embargo, but to ease it by even 1 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He also accused the United States of ``doubling the sufferings
of the people of Iraq'' by refusing to end the sanctions. He
referred to a recent survey by the U.N. Children's Fund that found
that mortality rates have more than doubled among Iraqi infants and
children under 5 years old since 1989, the year before the Security
Council imposed the first sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that it was
not U.N. sanctions but Saddam who inflicted deprivation on ordinary
Iraqis. ``We are quite sensitive to their suffering,'' Rubin said.
``That is why we instituted the oil-for-food program that has
bought billions of dollars of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're also sensitive to the dangers that could come from
allowing Saddam Hussein and his mad military machine access to
additional funds,'' Rubin continued, ``and we hope that everyone is
as sensitive as they should be to that danger. It is that danger
that the U.N. sanctions are designed to contain.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell a limited amount of
oil to pay for food and other human needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council imposed the first sanctions on Iraq after
its forces occupied Kuwait in August 1990. Subsequent resolutions
made lifting of sanctions conditional upon Baghdad's compliance in
destroying its weapons of mass destruction and not making more.
Saddam has refused to open Iraq to unrestricted inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has refused to cooperate unless the sanctions are lifted,
a position that his foreign minister stuck to Friday. But Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz was quoted Friday in Baghdad as taking a more
conciliatory approach. According to Reuters, Aziz said Iraq would
consider accepting a ``serious easing'' of sanctions if a total
repeal could not be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists that Iraq give inspectors unimpeded
access before sanctions are suspended. But the draft resolution put
forward by Britain and the Netherlands, and backed by the United
States, reportedly envisions raising the cap on Iraqi oil exports
and suspending sanctions on some imports for periods of a few
months, under strict U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and China have generally balked at the resolution
as being too inflexible. But Vedrine seemed to be positioning
France to bridge the gap between the United States and Britain on
one side, and Russia and China on the other. If the United States
and Britain agreed on a joint position with France, Vedrine said,
``the Russians and the Chinese will agree with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister said that offering Baghdad the
prospect of suspending sanctions would give it an incentive to
cooperate with fresh teams of weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The United States insists that sanctions cannot end until the
inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of weapons of mass destruction.
The French foreign minister said that such proof could not be
found. ``You can check that there aren't any missiles anymore,'' he
said, ``but it is impossible to make sure that there isn't one
little flask of biological or chemical product left.''

GEORGE MAGAZINE PLANS TO CUT BACK NUMBER OF ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KENNEDY-WILL, which moved in ``a'' news file.) 
(th) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George magazine, the future of which seemed parlous
even before the death of its founder and editor, John F. Kennedy
Jr., will continue publishing next year, but will cut the number of
issues to 10 annually from 12.
</P>
<P>
   The news came in an announcement Friday from Jack Kliger, the
president and chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines.
George is a joint venture of Hachette Filipacchi and Random
Ventures. In a prepared statement, Kliger said, ``The change in
frequency reflects a need to insure that each issue receives the
maximum resources and attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's appeal for both readers and advertisers had
clearly faded this year. Total paid circulation, at 405,153 for the
first half of the year, was down 3.4 percent from the comparable
period in 1998; single-copy sales from newsstands declined 11
percent, to 90,058 from 101,200.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Kliger said that the magazine would now
guarantee advertisers a rate base, or circulation, of 450,000.
</P>
<P>
   George's total advertising pages in the first six months of 1999
fell to 247 from 360 in the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The indifferent performance had led to friction between Kliger
and Kennedy, who had approached other potential backers, like
Advance Publications' Conde Nast. Even so, Kliger and Kennedy had
continued discussions of how to continue their association; the two
men met Friday, July 16, only hours before Kennedy was killed in a
plane crash in the waters off Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came at the end of the week when the magazine
published an issue that was a tribute to Kennedy, who founded
George four years ago. It featured excerpts from interviews by
Kennedy with national and international figures from Vo Nguyen
Giap, the North Vietnamese general, to Billy Graham, the
evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying article, titled ``A Night in Havana,'' by Inigo
Thomas, recounted Kennedy's meeting two years ago with the Cuban
leader, Fidel Castro.

 &HT;    North Carolina relief continues
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINETOPS, N.C. _ Hurricane Floyd's devastation has given new
meaning to salvation across flood-ravaged eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of communities where churches are taking the lead in
distributing emergency supplies, the mission has shifted from
saving souls to providing for the most basic of earthly needs.
</P>
<P>
   Tons and tons of supplies _ food, water, clothing _ are pouring
in from state and federal agencies and from relief groups, churches
and private donors across America. Communities are consumed not
only by securing goods, but by distributing them once they arrive,
sometimes in nearly overwhelming amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Pinetops, a town of 1,500, a group of churches has
organized the distribution of goods to several hundred victims of
North Carolina's worst natural disaster. Hurricane Floyd has left
at least 42 people dead in the state and nearly 7,500 homes
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The state agriculture department estimated that 15 percent of
the state's 50,000 farms might never return to business. About
2,700 people are still being housed in 24 shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Pinetops Mayor Earl Coker has asked the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to open a disaster recovery center in the
two-stoplight town. So far, the agency has not granted his request.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA, which by Friday had distributed about $585,000 to victims,
has established centers in Wilson, Tarboro and Rocky Mount. Those
towns _ while 15 to 20 miles from Pinetops _ are too far away,
Coker said, because many of the flooding victims lost their cars
along with their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people here who have needs now, and we cannot wait for
FEMA,'' said the Rev. Peggy Owens, a Presbyterian minister and
treasurer of the Pinetops ministerial fellowship coordinating local
distribution of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The process begins at Deliverance Temple Church, where several
hundred storm victims have come through the narrow doorway at the
back of the church. Crossing the fellowship hall to fill out
vouchers, they pass over the baptismal pool, hidden underneath a
pair of trap doors.
</P>
<P>
   The vouchers they receive entitle them to supplies from two
downtown locations. Volunteers at Pinetops United Methodist
distribute food, water, toiletries and paper supplies. A recently
closed hardware store, F&AMP;T Supply, serves as a distribution point
for water, clothing, baby items and cleaning supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need food and clothes,'' Ethel Mayo said Friday as she
entered Deliverance Temple.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old woman was tired and shaken. Not only did
flooding destroy Mayo's home in the Dodge City subdivision east of
Pinetops, it also claimed the lives of her brother, Ben Mayo, his
wife, his daughter and three others in a boat that overturned last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayo wanted cleaning supplies to try to save what she can of her
furniture. She could never live in the house again, even if it
could be salvaged, she said: ``There are too many memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone to some degree lost something,'' said the Rev.
Johnnie Jordan, pastor of Deliverance Temple. She greeted flood
victims as they came to her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some seem sad and basically destroyed,'' the pastor said.
``They have lost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take months, or longer, to restore damaged lives. At
Pinetops United Methodist Church, the work has begun, box by box.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, volunteers were on the verge of running
out of food. A tractor-trailer truck arrived unannounced, loaded
with boxes of food and clothing from a Charlotte church.
</P>
<P>
   A tractor-trailer filled with bottled water arrived from
Kentucky, prompting Pinetops volunteers to turn away water offered
by the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the church's two fellowship halls, peanut butter and
bread, shampoo and deodorant, toilet paper and diapers covered
tables and filled boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A delivery of relief food boxes from the Churches of Christ in
Nashville, Tenn., contains ``everything from Bibles to pasta,''
said volunteer Dick Stallings, 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have any shortage,'' said Jackie Walters, 68,
another volunteer. ``Any time we think we are running low, a truck
will come and fill it back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice a day, Chris Douglas, 41, and two other volunteers
drive pickup trucks to the National Guard distribution center in
Tarboro. They return to Pinetops with a one-day supply of food for
200 to 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leading corporate donors to the flood relief effort in
the state are three North Carolina-based companies: Food Lion,
pledging $1 million; Lowe's, the home improvement company, pledging
$600,000; and tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds, pledging $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard has supplied cases of ready-to-eat meals,
stored along with tons of supplies throughout the red-brick
Methodist church. ``We've got canned green beans out the wazoo,''
Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the supplies go to the American Red Cross emergency
shelter at Carver Elementary School. The number of evacuees staying
there has dropped from about 230 to 66, as many have moved back
home or in with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Church work crews from Raleigh and other cities are expected to
arrive today to help clean up flooded Pinetops neighborhoods. A
local company, Cottonbelt Furniture, plans to donate furniture once
homes are repaired or rebuilt. The local Habitat for Humanity
affiliate also plans to donate furniture, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Methodist church, retired pastor Lloyd Edge paused from
pushing an orange wheelbarrow loaded with boxes. He said he wasn't
surprised by the outpouring.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the human heart, there is compassion for people who are
suffering,'' he said. ``It is unbelievable how people respond in a
crisis.''

CBS : `Everybody Loves Raymond' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are two pockets of major viewer indecision
this season, where the networks' schedules have an unfortunate _
and rare _ confluence of quality programming.
</P>
<P>
   One falls at 9 p.m. Wednesdays, when NBC's terrific new
presidential drama ``The West Wing'' goes up against the WB's
promising alien-teen saga ``Roswell'' and Drew Carey's
working-class-shlub sitcom on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The other is even more problematic _ 9 p.m. Mondays. Even if
there isn't a good game on ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' you
still have an embarrassment of riches _ NBC's spin-off ``Law &AMP;
Order: Special Victims Unit,'' Fox phenomenon ``Ally McBeal'' and
CBS' newly venerable sitcom, ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond'' surprised everybody _ including those who work on it
_ when it not only held its own opposite ``Ally McBeal'' last year
but actually beat it in the ratings. This year, NBC _ which was
pretty much a Monday no-show last season _ is mounting a strong
offensive, so all involved on each show will have to be at the top
of their game to survive the audience feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's episode, the second of the season, offers a solid
example of why ``Raymond'' is so beloved: Ray (Ray Romano) and
Debra (Patricia Heaton) have had an argument. Ray's resentful
brother, Robert (Brad Garrett), relishes hearing Debra slag her
husband, while Ray's mom (Doris Roberts) _ one of the most covertly
sinister characters on TV, who loves to foment familial discord _
goes moony hearing Ray complain about his wife. When she asks Ray
to go into detail over his woes, Frank (Peter Boyle), Ray's crank
of a father, answers her succinctly: ``He's married.'' Frank also
reveals the secret of an enduring marriage _ ``You can't get upset
with a crazy person.''
</P>
<P>
   From this setup, we go into a standard-issue ``Rashomon''
routine, with Ray and Debra giving their wildly contrasting views
on what started the tiff. The comic twist comes when Ray's parents
actually manage to supercede his argument with Debra with a fierce
clash of their own and and yet still manage to end the episode
conspiratorially sniggering at their children's distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' is the rare show that happily
accepts the conventions and limitations of a certain genre and
actually uses them to their best advantage. No one here speaks to
the camera or makes trendy pop-culture references, and even though
Ray's a sportswriter, there's never any self-reflexive commentary
about the media. The actors never wink at the audience. There are
no visual or audio pyrotechnics, or any cutting-edge technical
work, and the plots aren't willfully quirky _ indeed, as in
tonight's episode, they simply find gags in the banal minutiae of
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond'' simply tells a little story that puts a sunny face
on the darker side of family life and sprinkles in some smart punch
lines. Dispensing with the gimmicks that may date other shows in
the future, ``Raymond'' doesn't try to be trendy, which may be why
it's routinely snubbed at the Emmys (last year was the first time
it even got nominations). Rather than aspiring to be the sensation
of the moment, ``Raymond'' aims for TV Land immortality. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' &QL; 
What: Second episode of the season of the dysfunctional family
sitcom. &QL; 
Who: Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle, Brad
Garrett. &QL; 
Where: CBS (Channel 2). &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 3 1/2 stars &QL;

FAN CONTROL LEAVES SOME EXASPERATED

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Some spectators were fit to be tied Friday.
On each hole, marshals guarded paths that cut across the fairways,
allowing fans to keep up with the players. During breaks in play,
marshals are supposed to drop the rope that blocks the path and let
the masses walk through.
</P>
<P>
   But during the first day of competition, fans were blocked off
well after the foursomes had finished a particular hole. The angry
spectators voiced their anger, and were told they could not move
the rope before receiving the proper signal from the hole marshal.
The whole situation created a backlog of impatient people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The map shows where the crossings are and the good boys won't
let us cross at the crossings,'' said Edward Niplock of Dublin,
Ireland. ``There's no excuse. There are much bigger tournaments
where they manage much bigger crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   Niplock started the day following Colin Montgomerie and Paul
Lawrie, but lost the European pair after the 11th hole. He couldn't
cross to the 12th after the first foursome moved on. The gallery
following the next three groups was so tightly packed (in large
part because Tiger Woods, Tom Lehman, Sergio Garcia, and Jesper
Parnevik played so slowly) that Niplock waited for everyone to pass
before moving on. Many fans had difficulty navigating the course on
the first day, finding themselves stranded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been one or two places where I was boxed in,'' said
Jack Mosesso of Hanover, ``but other than that it's pretty good.''

<P>
   After flying over the practice range Thursday, the pilots of
fighter squadron 213 followed the morning matches before returning
home to Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The four-plane flyover marked the conclusion of the opening
ceremonies. Representatives of squadrons 213 and 32 performed the
maneuver at 1,400 feet and 350 miles per hour. The flyover was
designed to be more restrained than the flyover for the Major
League Baseball All-Star Game at Fenway Park, which drew complaints
from unexpecting Fenway residents. ``Because it's a golf event with
a lot of people in a suburban part of Boston, we wanted to make it
in line with the whole ceremony,'' said VF 213 Commander Mark
Adamshick. ``Now, we're just here cheering for the American team,
of course. There's a lot of similarity between teams and squadrons.
It's all based on teamwork. The only difference is the salary.''
</P>
<P>
   For two members of squadron 213, the festivities were a
homecoming. Lieutenant Chris Wiseman grew up in Weston, while
Lieutenant Larry Palmer was raised in Falmouth. Ryder Cupper Payne
Stewart has flown with figher squadron 102.

 &HT;    No choice: Crenshaw changes lineups
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ben Crenshaw doesn't think what he saw on the
course Friday matches what it said on the scoreboard. Because the
United States fell behind 6-2 Friday to Europe in the 33rd Ryder
Cup, Crenshaw says, there's no reason for panic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. captain's Saturday lineup, however, seemed to say
something altogether different. Crenshaw is still searching for
winning combinations and will send only one returning team out in
(alternate shot) foursomes _ the Jeff Maggert-Hal Sutton entry that
has provided the U.S. with its only win _ and three new ones.
European captain Mark James will use the teams that played Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very fine line of trying too hard and allowing
yourself to play,'' said Crenshaw, trying to explain how the U.S.
could perform so well at times, but fail in so many crucial
situations. ``The hardest thing to do in a Ryder Cup is to play
your game. The hardest thing to do is trust your game in this
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaking up things today, Crenshaw will play Mark O'Meara for the
first time, with Jim Furyk (0-1) against Darren Clarke (1-1) and
Lee Westwood (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods (0-2) will get his third partner, giving Steve Pate
an opportunity against Miguel Angel-Jimenez (1-0-1) and Padraig
Harrington (0-0-1). American Payne Stewart (0-0-1) and Justin
Leonard (0-0-1) will try against Europe's 2-0 team of Sergio Garcia
and Jesper Parnevik. Sutton and Maggert (1-1-0) play the 1-0-1 team
of Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the only rookie American, will sit out the morning
matches after two losses on Friday. So will Davis Love III, who
managed halves in both Friday matches. Three Europeans ignored
</P>
<P>
   James has one more chance to play three men who have yet to see
team action _ Frenchman Jean Van de Velde, Scotland's Andrew
Coltart and Jarmo Sandelin of Finland. ...After missing his first
match in six Ryder Cup appearances Friday morning, Spain's Jose
Maria Olazabal played in the afternoon best-ball, teaming with
countryman Angel-Jimenez to beat Sutton and Maggert 2 and 1. ``I
didn't know to expect when I stepped on the first tee,'' said
Olazabal, who sank three birdie putts on the front nine. ``I missed
a few tee shots, but I managed to make a few birdies that helped us
win the match. It was a tough decision for me not to play this
morning, but I thought it was the right thing to do.''

FOR THE US, THE 12TH PROVED FATAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The hill on hole No. 12 at The Country Club
rises up like a bunker-pocked green monster. It obstructs any view
of the green from the fairway and forces players to attempt a blind
second shot. If they're lucky, golfers find the sloping green
tucked away to the left. But even the best often miss their
intended target, falling victim to the tricky hole. Friday, the
486-yard par 4, which plays longer thanks to the steep hill,
spelled trouble for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning session, the US finished 3 over par at the 12th.
Only the Americans' lone winning twosome of Jeff Maggert and Hal
Sutton combined for par. Each of the European groups made par.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans posted improved results in the afternoon four-ball
competition, but their efforts were not enough to tilt matches in
favor of the home team. The US finished the first day of
competition 4 over on No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In order to succeed at the 12th, a player must position his
drive in the right-center of the fairway. Tiger Woods gave Tom
Lehman a perfect drive _ 280 yards in the right-center _ in the
alternate-shot competition, but Lehman's approach landed on the
back left fringe of the green, with the pin cut 10 paces from the
right-front edge. The problems for Woods and Lehman started there
as Sergio Garcia and Jesper Parnevik went on to a 2-and-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both played well, and it's frustrating when you play well
and don't win,'' said Woods. ``Granted, we did make a couple of
mistakes. I hit the putt past the hole on 12, and when you make a
mistake like that . . . they're looking at making bogey and they
end up making 4. You can't afford to give them a hole like that.
You have to have those type of holes. That's the way it goes
sometimes. It's match play.''
</P>
<P>
   But the young American made ammends in the afternoon. Again he
hit a perfect drive on No. 12, this one 336 yards to the end of the
fairway. He used an 8-iron to reach the green _ 8 feet from a pin
cut in the back right _ and drained the birdie putt. European Lee
Westwood, during the same match, also took only three shots to
reach the cup. Woods and Westwood were the only players to make
birdie Friday at the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1988 US Open at The Country Club, No. 12 ranked as
the second-toughest hole, yielding only 36 birdies in four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult hole,'' said Brendan Walsh, head pro at
The Country Club. ``I assume it's going to play the hardest of the
event. In 1998, 11 played the most difficult, but hole No. 12 is
now 30 yards longer than it was. Your first three holes of a
match-play event on the back nine are pivotal holes. They kind of
set the tone as you're coming down the stretch for the last six. If
you can get through this area here with all pars or birdies, you're
doing pretty good and you'll probably win a couple holes.''

 &HT;    Upsets put Bulldogs on guard for Knights
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Louisiana Tech over Alabama, Cincinnati over
Wisconsin, North Texas over Texas Tech, New Mexico State over
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Those upsets, pulled off last weekend, are fresh on the minds of
the 11th-ranked Georgia Bulldogs, who play host to winless Central
Florida today at Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (2-0) are four touchdown favorites over the Golden
Knights (0-3), and they're intent on not becoming college
football's latest upset victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be trendy and say Central Florida is the best
team on our schedule _ they're not,'' senior guard Steve Herndon
said. ``But we've seen them on tape, we've seen the type of
athletes they have, and we know what they're capable of. If they
play like they're capable, they can beat anybody. That's what you
saw happen with all those upsets last weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than going ahead 7-0 in each of its three contests, UCF
hasn't been able to put much of a scare in its opponents. The
Golden Knights faced top-ranked opponents in each game, but seemed
to get less competitive with each. They lost to No. 13 Purdue
(47-13), No. 3 Florida (58-27) and 10th-ranked Georgia Tech
(41-10).
</P>
<P>
   UCF's schedule is considered one of the toughest in the country.
The impetus of it is to raise funds for the athletic department
while also gaining exposure for its fledgling Division I football
program. The Golden Knights, who are building a state-of-the-art
athletics complex, will make $300,000 from Georgia today and close
to $1 million on its three-game, revenue-building tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to use our schedule,'' UCF coach Mike Kruczek said.
``We're not in a conference, and we're not tied into any bowl
games. So schedule is a big deal with us. These guys want to play
the best teams in the country and they have the opportunity to do
that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering their lackluster second-half performance against
Georgia Tech, there are indications the Knights may be growing
weary of their underdog role. They trailed the Yellow Jackets 14-10
late in the second quarter before falling apart .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that as a trait of this football team, to just go
through the motions against these people and not lay it on the
line,'' Kruczek said. ``I think they still have confidence and
believe in their ability to make things happen.''

FOR GARCIA, A WINNING OUTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA MATSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ He's young, he's good, and he's a harder
ticket than the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   He hands out hugs, he high-fives the gallery, and he jumps for
joy.
</P>
<P>
   And always, he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Sergio Garcia's first day at the Ryder Cup was more fun
than summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Bounding across the grassy green turf of The Country Club
Friday, Garcia dazzled the crowd and energized his teammates. More
than that, he won matches.
</P>
<P>
   In one day, the 19-year-old Spaniard won more matches (two) than
Tiger Woods has won in his Ryder Cup career. Woods, who was 1-3-1
in his first Ryder Cup appearance in 1997, lost both his matches
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and Jesper Parnevik did the damage in the morning
four-ball, defeating Woods and Tom Lehman, 2 and 1. European
captain Mark James sent Garcia and Parnevik back out in the
afternoon, and they dispatched Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk, 1 up,
in a furious few hours of shot-making.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Garcia rapidly became a crowd favorite, even
playing against everybody's favorite superstar, Woods. Outdriven by
Woods all morning, Garcia finally knocked his drive alongside
Woods's ball on the 14th hole. When Garcia came down the fairway
and spotted the two balls, his own just a few inches ahead of
Woods's _ but still ahead _ he walked over to Parnevik's caddie,
former PGA Tour player Lance Ten Broeck, and gave him a big smile.
His delight danced across his face and his thoughts were easy to
read: ``I got him this time!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed it,'' Garcia said after the morning match.
``Jesper was a great partner. We shot 2-under par in foursomes and
that is very good in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon best ball, Garcia and Parnevik again proved a
charismatic pair as they battled with Mickelson and Furyk. With the
match all square after seven holes, Parnevik holed out for an eagle
on No. 8, and a grinning Garcia ran across the green and hugged his
playing partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a great kid to play with,'' Parnevik said. ``I think
he lifted me up a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson and Furyk kept throwing superb shots at Garcia and
Parnevik and after the 13th, the match was all square. At the
534-yard par-5 14th, Mickelson dumped his approach deftly onto the
green, setting up a 4-foot birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, short of the green on a downslope and staring uphill at
the flag, took his chip. The ball flew at the pin. Garcia jumped
into the air, his feet still pumping.
</P>
<P>
   This has happened before. Remember the PGA Championship?
Remember Garcia hitting an impossible shot from behind a tree and
then running after his shot with the exuberance of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, he is a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio is a big, big talent,'' James said of his rookie, ``but
I have to pay tribute to Jesper because Jesper's the perfect foil.
He's a very, very clever guy, Jesper. And he knows exactly how to
play with Sergio and when to let him loose and when to rein him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I really do is feed him chocolate and watch him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is back for more this morning, paired again with Parnevik
_ captain James never would break up this dynamic duo _ matched
against Payne Stewart and Justin Leonard. More fun for the kid. But
his first day of the Ryder Cup was a blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was something I was really looking forward to,'' said
Garcia after earning his second victory of the day. ``I really
enjoyed it. It was great playing with Jesper.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more could you ask for? To come out and play well and win
the match.''

NO. 18 UCLA AT STANFORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
No. 18 UCLA (2-1, 0-0) AT STANFORD (2-1, 2-0) 
__ Kickoff: 2 p.m. at Stanford (capacity: 85,500) 
__ TV/Radio, etc.: Fox Sports West 2 on tape-delayed at 3:30;
XTRA-AM 1150.) 
__ Series history: UCLA leads 38-28-2 and has won five of the last
six, including three straight at Stanford Stadium. Four of those
six have been decided by four points or less; UCLA won 28-24 last
year. 
__ Injury update: UCLA: QB Cory Paus (bruised ribs), WR Brian
Poli-Dixon (broken wrist), G Mike Saffer (sprained ankle), CB Jason
Bell (sprained heel) and reserve LBs Billy Pieper (sprained knee)
and Asi Faoa (back) are out. DT Pete Holland (back) is probable. 
__ Keep and eye on: UCLA receivers Danny Farmer and Freddie
Mitchell, who are hobbled by injuries but must make big plays. . .
. Stanford receivers Troy Walters, DeRonnie Pitts and Dave Davis,
who will look to exploit UCLA's freshman cornerbacks. . . . UCLA
defensive end Kenyon Coleman, who must generate a pass rush against
Cardinal quarterback Todd Husak. . . . Stanford defensive tackle
Willie Howard, who will try to contain the Bruins' ground game. . .
. UCLA's secondary, which cannot duplicate the coverage breakdowns
it incurred against Fresno State. 
__ Stanford update: The Cardinal stunned Arizona 50-22 last weekend
and has scored 104 points its two Pac-10 games. Stanford is third
in the league in total offense (430 yards per game) and ninth in
total defense (450). However, it's allowing just 3.2 yards per rush
and shut down Arizona's Trung Canidate. Stanford placekicker Mike
Bisselli has made 3 of 3 field goals, including a 52-yarder. A
crowd of 45,000 is expected.

 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was late one night in 1995 when Glenn Tullman came
up with a sure-fire idea to build a theme restaurant chain around
the universal appeal of magic and the legerdemain of David
Copperfield, whose barnstorming world tours take in $50 million a
year as he makes the Statue of Liberty vanish, defies the teeth of
a silver-bladed death saw and escapes from a safe in an exploding
building.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Tullman, a Chicago entrepreneur and venture
capitalist, signed up Copperfield, along with the nation's leading
architect of entertainment-retail complexes and a renowned chef. He
got $20 million from Conseco, the giant Indiana insurance company
whose flamboyant chairman had become enamored of Copperfield's
magic.
</P>
<P>
   First, they would build in a newly reviving Times Square. Walt
Disney Co. offered them a premier location at the front of the MGM
Studios Theme Park in Orlando for a second restaurant _ and there
was talk of outlets at Disney parks in Anaheim, Calif., Paris and
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The partners named their company Latenite Magic, after Tullman's
nocturnal brainstorm, and all the investors looked forward to a big
payday when it would go public. Construction on the flagship
Copperfield's Magic Underground began three years ago in New York,
with Copperfield designing an awe-inspiring set of illusions that
could be viewed from 360 degrees, not just from the front of a
stage.
</P>
<P>
   But in what is perhaps the greatest magic trick of all, the
investors' $34 million has _ poof _ disappeared. The Magic
Underground in Times Square, though 85 percent complete, will never
open. Disney canceled the lease in Orlando. And millions of
dollars' worth of illusions for the project are gathering dust in
an upstate New York warehouse. Tullman has gone back to running
Allscripts, a medication-management company.
</P>
<P>
   The story has a familiar ring in an era in which the stock
market seems to rocket ever skyward and there is no end of
investors willing to put their money into an Internet company that
has yet to make a dime, let alone a venture like Latenite, with a
good story and a celebrity pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enormous flaws from the very beginning, nearly everyone
involved in Latenite still contends that they came close to
``completing an entertainment concept,'' as one put it, ``that
would have set the industry on its ear.''
</P>
<P>
   But bad blood abounds among the one-time partners. Last month,
Conseco seized control of the Times Square property, and executives
in Conseco's camp said they might sue Copperfield for what they
called a failure to adhere to either a budget or a timetable. In
Copperfield's camp, there are still hard feelings about an
attempted coup in which some investors tried to dump Copperfield
for Lance Burton, a Las Vegas magician whom they presumed would be
more compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Copperfield, in turn, may throw Latenite Magic into bankruptcy
court in a bid to block Conseco and grab the company's only asset:
the Times Square property. Supporters of the beetle-browed
illusionist contend that Copperfield was intent on creating
something worthy of his name, rather than yet another theme
restaurant that would be dismissed as schlock.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was not a bad one, said Ron Paul, president of
Technomic Inc., a restaurant consulting company based in Chicago,
but the execution was hurt by divisions among the partners. ``It is
always difficult to get anything done when you have an inherent
conflict between the business perspective and the creative
perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``I can't think of another single
restaurant-entertainment disaster of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney refused to discuss the project, and Conseco, like many
other investors, was reluctant to go into any detail. Copperfield
also declined to be interviewed. But it is clear, from interviews
with 19 participants, ranging from subcontractors to investors,
that the problems with Latenite were far greater than the struggle
between artistic vision and commercial viability.
</P>
<P>
   For one, construction started before the conceptual planning was
finished, which is almost always a miscalculation in Manhattan, one
the most unforgiving real estate markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no margin for error,'' said James Cafarelli, a
former executive at the House of Blues, another chain of
entertainment-theme restaurants, who was brought in by the
investors last year to salvage the Latenite project. ``It was a
highly technical project that was launched in New York City, where
you're working under a magnifying glass on a difficult site in a
very aggressive real estate market. On top of that, the project
continued to be improved throughout the process, and that
compounded the problems. It was a challenge no matter how good the
team was.''
</P>
<P>
   Latenite was born in 1995, during what can only be described as
the golden age of theme restaurants. The Hard Rock Cafe was still
extending its then highly profitable mix of hamburgers, merchandise
and memorabilia around the globe. Overexpansion, a reputation for
bad food and static decor had not yet turned Planet Hollywood into
a penny stock.
</P>
<P>
   Tullman and his partner, Robert Compton, another venture
capitalist who saw magic as appealing to all ages and
nationalities, spent months pursuing Copperfield, its most
successful practitioner, meeting with him after shows in Memphis
and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A gaunt man who safeguards the world's largest collection of
magic and oddities in a warehouse in Las Vegas, Copperfield remains
aloof from other magicians and is extremely protective of his
reputation. Yet Tullman and Compton gained the magician's trust,
raised $2.2 million and threw themselves into the project's
details.
</P>
<P>
   They hired David Rockwell, who had created 60 Planet Hollywood
outlets and chic restaurants like Nobu in New York, to design the
prototype, and enlisted the restaurateurs Joseph H. Baum and David
Emil and the chef Waldy Malouf, then of the Rainbow Room and other
celebrated New York dining places, to organize the restaurant side
of the business.

 NEW YORK: the business.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financially, the breakthrough came early in 1996, when Compton
pitched the concept to the Private Capital Group at Conseco, a
company he knew from years of living in Indianapolis to be hardly
the nation's most hidebound insurer. The deal was clinched after
Stephen C. Hilbert, Conseco's chairman _ who met his sixth and
current wife, Tomisue, when she leaped out of a cake at his
stepson's 21st birthday party _ saw Copperfield's show in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days later,'' Tullman said, ``we had a check for $20
million.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to put together the deal, Copperfield, Conseco and
the Tullman group each got a third of the company, an arrangement
that would come back to haunt everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the money was Copperfield's,'' said the magician's
longtime lawyer, Albert Rettig, who is also a director of Latenite
Magic. ``He committed himself to being the creative force, not the
financial force, behind the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Latenite announced its plans in April 1996, and construction
started that fall with the demolition of two adult theaters on a
site at Broadway and West 49th Street, at the north end of Times
Square. Meanwhile, Disney, which had long sought to work with
Copperfield, signed a lease for an Orlando restaurant, seeing the
project as a cheap test ride for what could be a lucrative
attraction for all its theme parks, people involved in the project
said.
</P>
<P>
   In between some 500 shows a year, Copperfield designed the
illusions that would go into the restaurants and worked on the
overall visual concept with Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are developing the next generation of entertainment
experiences,'' Copperfield said when the project was announced,
``not a themed restaurant, more like an interactive entertainment
experience from which you won't want to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the designs for the Times Square restaurant called
for a heroic, 45-foot figure to stand astride the front entrance,
flanked by a pair of 18-foot gas torches. Neon signs mounted on the
exterior of the building were to erupt every hour in a 90-second
light show, with lights proclaiming the site Copperfield's Magic
Underground emerging from the display.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there would be a 70-foot atrium with gargoyles perched
on steel trusses in a style Rockwell called industrial gothic.
Diners were to sit on terraces nestled around a model of the Statue
of Liberty's torch. To the eye, banquettes and a bar would
levitate, while a section of diners would suddenly disappear and,
once an hour, the death saw would appear to cut a diner in half.
Everywhere, there would be what became known as Davids, large-scale
likenesses of Copperfield.
</P>
<P>
   But there were many changes in work orders for the fast-moving
project, as the design evolved and the fabricators built the
multimillion-dollar illusions. Costly structural adjustments pushed
the budget well beyond its original $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   A measure of the magnitude was in the lighted signs and the
pneumatic and hydraulic systems for the illusions: They would
require the same volume of electrical power as a 40-story
skyscraper, one contractor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a link between construction and the illusions,''
said Chris Nolan, who ran the project for AJ Construction, the
Manhattan company that served as construction manager for Magic
Underground. ``As the illusions developed or the design was
clarified, things had to be moved. But if you move an illusion that
is structured in steel or supported by some mechanism, you get a
ripple effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1996, the rising costs, along with the potential for
selling magic tricks and other merchandise associated with the
restaurant, prompted Ngaire E. Cuneo, president of Conseco's
Private Capital Group, to suddenly demand a greater stake in
Latenite, according to William Underhill, then Latenite's chief
executive. After all, the insurer argued, it had put up the bulk of
the capital. Copperfield also wanted a bigger share and more
control.
</P>
<P>
   It would take nearly a year to hammer out a new arrangement _
and by then, the bickering among the partners had eroded whatever
trust had existed.
</P>
<P>
   There were late-night meetings after Copperfield's
record-setting Broadway performances during the 1996 Christmas
season, as well as 3 a.m. conference calls that only fueled the
frustration felt by some executives in dealing with the peripatetic
Copperfield.
</P>
<P>
   When he threatened in the fall of 1997 to quit unless his
financial partners acquiesced to his demands, some of the investors
considered dumping the illusionist in favor of Burton, the featured
performer at the Monte Carlo Casino in Las Vegas. Tullman said Ms.
Cuneo and Underhill initiated that effort, though Underhill
disputed that account.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, no one disputes that Tullman and Underhill met
with Burton and his manager, Peter Reveen, after a performance by
Burton at the Monte Carlo. ``They said David had quit or
something,'' Reveen recalled. ``We told them that Lance Burton was
nobody's clone. He would want to put his own stamp on anything he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tullman and four other people involved in the
project, when Ms. Cuneo and Underhill later approached a Disney
executive in Orlando to discuss replacing Copperfield, Disney blew
the whistle on the suggestion. The entertainment company, these
people said, was not about to jeopardize its alliance with the most
popular magician in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, nothing came of the discussions, but the incident
still causes Copperfield's lawyer to sputter in outrage. ``It would
have been a horrendous mistake,'' Rettig said. ``There's nobody in
the U.S., or internationally, who has Copperfield's stature.''
</P>
<P>
   The factions ultimately agreed to a new deal that gave
Copperfield more than 45 percent of the company and control of the
board. Conseco also increased its stake, while the Tullman group
was reduced to a very minor investment.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, Latenite was running out of money. The Times
Square project was $6 million over budget. Construction ground to a
halt in January 1998. Within a few months, contractors filed liens
against the project for more than $11 million. Latenite had also
spent millions on a headquarters in Las Vegas and hiring a crew of
executives, marketing agents and publicity representatives before a
single restaurant was open.

 NEW YORK: was open.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The partners, however, were still hoping to amortize the
enormous cost of the prototype in Times Square over restaurants in
Orlando and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Underhill flew to Saudi Arabia in search of new investors;
Conseco also tried to round up more money. It did not help matters
that Latenite's owner's representative on the project, Bennis &AMP;
Reissman, and the construction manager, AJ Construction, entered
guilty pleas in June 1998 in an industrywide bid-rigging scandal.
Or that Planet Hollywood's sales figures and stock price plummeted,
ending Wall Street's fascination with theme restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, eager to have the New York project finished so that
Latenite could concentrate on Orlando, now put up $5 million. Bud
Dare, the Disney executive in Orlando who directed the company's
involvement in Magic Underground, recommended that Latenite hire
Cafarelli, prompting Underhill and his staff to depart. Last fall,
Cafarelli settled with most of the contractors, but Latenite was
still bleeding profusely. Even standing still, the rent and other
obligations in Times Square were eating up $300,000 a month,
according to former executives at Latenite.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco persuaded the Union Labor Life Insurance Co. of
Washington, known as Ullico, and another union-linked insurer from
Canada to invest $7.5 million, taking a fee for its efforts,
according to Tullman and others. (Conseco would not comment.)
Ullico said it was told by Underhill that more money was on the
way, including an infusion from Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi
Arabia, who has major stakes in both Euro Disney and Planet
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a high confidence level that we weren't dealing with
fly-by-night guys,'' said an executive at Union Labor Life, who
declined to be identified because of the possibility of lawsuits
over the project. ``We wanted all the effort to go into one gala
opening in New York. Instead, our money disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September and again in December, Tullman told reporters,
investors and contractors that construction would resume within a
month. It never did because, Tullman said recently, Conseco was
engaged in ``an elaborate game of chicken'' with Copperfield.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Times Square project could have been completed in
six weeks, Conseco and Ullico refused to put up more capital unless
Copperfield contributed some of his own money or gave up some stock
in the company to attract other investors. They blamed his
obsession with the expensive, unprecedented illusions for pushing
the costs beyond endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refused to put in more money without some limits on
`artistic control,''' Underhill said. ``David didn't want to do
that. He didn't want to give up equity or control.''
</P>
<P>
   Tullman said the problem was not . Copperfield, whom he compared
to James Cameron, the director who persevered in his artistic
vision for the movie ``Titanic'' despite enormous criticism for
spending $190 million in the process. In the end, Cameron created
the highest-grossing film of all time. Conseco, on the other hand,
strangled Copperfield's vision, Tullman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their view was: We'll just build it; it doesn't have to be
perfect,'' he said. ``David said: I'm not going to have magic where
everyone can see behind the curtain. My reputation is on the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   All the investors were well aware of the terms of the original
deal, including Copperfield's insistence on retaining control of
the product, Tullman said. Others involved in the project point out
that the magician's position as one of the top-earning entertainers
in the world was a result of, not in spite of, his obsession with
developing the most sophisticated illusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone going out into a rainstorm and complaining
he got wet,'' Cafarelli said. ``He's a perfectionist who travels
around the world. That's no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Latenite spent $34 million. The partners reached an
impasse, and when the company defaulted last month on its rent for
the building in Times Square, Conseco swooped in and took control.
The insurer is now trying to find a tenant, any tenant, for the
site.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of reaping some return on its ill-fated investment,
Conseco is asking for more than $2 million a year in rent and
another $1 million for the signs, said real estate brokers who have
toured the site. For now, the talk of Magic Underground restaurants
elsewhere has ended, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deal that should have worked,'' Ms. Cuneo said. ``We
are disappointed, as are many of the other investors, that it
didn't come to fruition. But it might be early for a post-mortem;
we are considering litigation.''

CLINTONS SAID TO HAVE SOUGHT HELP FROM EX-AIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the tense days and hours before and after they
signed an agreement to buy a white house in Chappaqua, N.Y., for
$1.7 million, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton sought
financial assistance from former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and two former White House chiefs of staff, according to several
people with knowledge of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin, as well as the chiefs of staff, Mack McLarty and
Erskine Bowles, declined to help the Clintons buy the first home
they will have owned since 1983, several people with knowledge of
the requests said Friday. They said that Bowles had originally
committed to being the guarantor but declined on Sept. 1, just
three days after the Clintons signed an agreement to buy the house
under the condition that their loan would be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The couple then quickly put out feelers to Rubin and McLarty
before finally asking Terry McAuliffe, the prolific Democratic
fund-raiser, who agreed to guarantee the Clintons' mortgage by
depositing $1.35 million in the bank as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The McAuliffe guarantee was criticized by Republicans and public
watchdog groups because McAuliffe is also raising millions for the
Clintons' legal defense fund, the Clinton presidential library to
be built in Little Rock, Ark., and the first lady's all-but-certain
Senate campaign in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three people knowledgeable about the matter say, the
Clintons are considering seeking a mortgage from a different lender
who would not require collateral. That would eliminate McAuliffe's
role.
</P>
<P>
   It had not been known publicly that the Clintons, apparently
through intermediaries, had sought help from both Rubin and
McLarty. The Washington Post previously reported that Bowles had
agreed and then refused to assist the Clintons, before McAuliffe
stepped in earlier this month to put up his own money to cover the
full value of the Clintons' mortgage with Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three would comment on the matter and it was not
clear why they all turned the Clintons down. McAuliffe also would
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, indebted by $5 million in legal bills, have
slightly more than $1 million in assets, according to their most
recent financial disclosure report, made public in May.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of several public watchdog groups said that the refusals
by McLarty and Rubin demonstrate that the favor done by McAuliffe
was even more important to the Clintons than anyone had realized at
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a president who has never had any compunction about
going around with a tin cup,'' said Charles Lewis, the founder and
executive director of the Center for Public Integrity. ``Most
people would have a very, very difficult time asking someone to
write a check for $1.3 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The approaches to Clinton's friends were deliberately indirect.
Rubin, for example, was never asked outright to help the Clintons
finance the house. Instead, according to one person familiar with
the delicate dance, he received a quiet inquiry about whether he
would be receptive to a direct appeal. But he demurred, and the
subject never came up again.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin declined to discuss the matter, except to say, ``I spent
six and a half years in the administration and I never discussed
the president's business during that time, and I'm going to stick
to that policy now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the chief architect of the Clinton administration's
economic policy, resigned from the Cabinet in July. Before joining
the administration, he was co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the
investment banking firm, and reported making $26.5 million in 1992.
Several years ago, his net worth, mostly in family trusts, was
estimated to be $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   McLarty, a close friend of Clinton since they attended
kindergarten together in Hope, Ark., declined through a spokesman
to comment on the matter. Using McLarty's nickname, his assistant,
Carl Lingenfelter, said, ``Mack does not want to comment on any of
his private conversations with the president or the first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   McLarty's net worth was recently estimated to be $107 million.
Last year he sold a 51 percent interest in his 19 auto dealerships
in Arkansas to Asbury Automotive Group of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles did not return several calls this week. A longtime
confidant of Clinton, he is a general partner at the New York
buyout firm of Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. In his 1997 financial
disclosure report, Bowles estimated his family's net worth at $30
million to $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two people close to the Clintons said Friday that the couple was
now considering taking out a mortgage with another bank that would
not require collateral. The Clintons intend to put down $350,000 as
a deposit, or more than 20 percent of the cost. Jim Kennedy, a
spokesman for the White House counsel's office, declined to
comment.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clintons' unorthodox financing arrangement has drawn harsh
criticism from several Republicans, including Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York, who, like the first lady, is considering a
bid for the U.S. Senate next year. ``A million-three is a lot of
money; somebody putting it in the bank for you is quite unusual,''
Giuliani said last week on his radio show.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the first family said that the Clintons,
especially Mrs. Clinton, had been genuinely concerned that they
might not qualify for a mortgage. In August, several mortgage
lenders contacted by The New York Times said that despite the
Clintons' enormous legal bills, the couple would have no problem
qualifying for an unsecured mortgage, because they would almost
certainly earn millions of dollars from book contracts, speaking
engagements and service on corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   The white-shingled, five-bedroom house in Chappaqua that the
Clintons are buying had been shown to the public only three days by
its owners, Dr. Jeffrey Weisberg and his wife, Cheryl. They then
invited closed bids, which were opened at 3 p.m. on Sunday, Aug.
29. Not long afterward, the Clintons, who were at the time on
vacation in the Hamptons, N.Y., were informed that the Weisbergs
were prepared to sell the house to them.
</P>
<P>
   But of the eight bids submitted on the house, the Clintons had
tied with another bidder for the highest price, $1.7 million, one
person with knowledge of the deal said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the following Wednesday, Sept. 1, that the
Clintons learned Bowles had decided not to back the loan. The
Clintons then quickly tried to find someone else to back the
mortgage. As they put out feelers to Rubin and McLarty, the
Clintons worried that they might not find a guarantor and could
lose the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It weighed very heavily on Hillary,'' said one person close to
the Clintons. ``She was very worried that they were going to lose
the house. She was distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sept. 2, the Clintons, who were vacationing just
outside Syracuse, N.Y., asked McAuliffe for his help. McAuliffe and
the president had played golf together that day. McAuliffe did not
hesitate to help, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry would do anything for them,'' this person said. ``He
clearly knew there were consequences to helping them and that he
would put himself in harm's way, but he was ready to take the
heat.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day after President Clinton vetoed the $792
billion, 10-year Republican tax cut, the House Ways and Means
Committee on Friday approved a far smaller package of routine tax
provisions, but immediately ran into further opposition from the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sent by the committee to the full House would extend a
number of expiring tax breaks for companies and individuals, most
of which have bipartisan support. The package would cost nearly
$1.5 billion in anticipated revenues next year and $23.3 billion
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was passed on a party line vote of 23 to 14 after the
committee rejected a Democratic alternative that would have added
other tax breaks and paid for them by clamping down on corporate
tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's centerpiece is a five-year extension of a credit for
corporate research and development costs, an item avidly sought by
technology companies, a constituency avidly courted by both parties
in their efforts to raise campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also extend for two years credits for companies
that hire workers from welfare rolls, and make permanent a
provision that exempts from the alternative minimum tax several
credits claimed by low- and moderate-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's fate could be a test of whether the White
House and the Republican majority in Congress have any hope of
compromising on a variety of tax, spending and other budget issues
over the next few months. Clinton on Thursday called for the two
sides to work together, but offered no specific new proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The way the new tax proposal's provisions are structured shows
just how hard it has become for Republicans to pursue even a very
modest tax bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because Republicans are having difficulty passing next year's
spending bills without breaking their pledge not to dip into excess
Social Security revenues, the party's leaders have not allocated
any money next year for a tax cut. As a result, Rep. Bill Archer,
the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, had to hold down the bill's costs and come up with a way
to offset the anticipated revenue loss to avoid making the budget
squeeze worse.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, he wrote the provisions for the corporate research
credit in a way that postpones for a year any loss of revenue,
making research undertaken next year eligible for the credit but
postponing the resulting reduction in corporate tax bills until the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   But Archer still had to come up with $1.5 billion next year to
pay for the bill's other provisions. So he proposed temporarily
tightening the rules governing when high-income individuals can
defer their estimated tax payments, generating a $1.5 billion surge
in tax revenues next year that would be reversed the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   Archer then proposed that the costs of the bill starting in 2001
be financed out of projected budget surpluses, a provision that
drew an immediate veto threat from the administration.

GLF-RYDER-CRENSHAW-BOS, 9-24 -- Ben Crenshaw, 47, the U.S. Ryder
Cup captain, couldn't stomach the squabbling between the PGA of
America and some touring pros over the charitable distribution of
revenues from the matches. So, without prompting on the eve of the
PGA Championship at Medinah, Ill., last month, he publicly
castigated four of his players -- Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, David
Duval, and Phil Mickelson -- for making too much of the matter for
too long, as if they were trampling upon sacred ground. (Frank O'

FINALLY, A MICHAEL JORDAN SIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Michael Jordan was present and accounted for
at the first day of Ryder Cup competition. The 6-foot-6-inch former
NBA star and golf fanatic followed Tiger Woods's foursome in the
afternoon. Wearing black slacks, a white shirt, a white Air Jordan
baseball cap, and sunglasses, the most eagerly anticipated
celebrity was easy to spot in the gallery as he smoked a
super-sized stogie on the fourth hole and chatted with former
Bruins star Cam Neely.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan declined interview and autograph requests, but when asked
about the Americans falling behind after the first day, he said,
``Oh, we'll be all right.'' He added that the attention newspapers
paid to his imminent arrival amused him and said Friday was his
first at The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   On a hill between the 12th green and 13th tee, he chatted with
former president George Bush and wife Barbara. Then, watching Woods
tee off on No. 13, a fan complained Jordan was blocking his view.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan looked over at the fan and crouched as low as possible.
As the gallery moved in pursuit of both Jordan and the golfers, a
fan joked, ``If we're going to have celebrities here, why can't we
have Heather Locklear.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the course, Jordan good-naturedly handled fans who chased
him down and shouted his name. He smiled and shook a few hands.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHO'S NO. 1? PARNEVIK AND PRODIGY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Ever since Ben Crenshaw was named the U.S.
captain, his sermon has been the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win the Ryder Cup,'' he often said, ``by making your putts
and getting up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Never was that more true than in the opening alternate-shot and
better-ball matches at The Country Club Friday as the European
team, notably Jesper Parnevik of Sweden and Sergio Garcia, the
19-year-old Spanish prodigy, put an overlapping grip on the cup by
soaring to a 6-2 lead that embarrassed what are supposed to be the
world's best golfers.
</P>
<P>
   On the 17th hole of their morning duel with Tiger Woods and Tom
Lehman, Garcia spun his approach shot to 10 feet below the cup and
when Parnevik made the putt, they had stunned the world's No. 1
golfer and the 1996 British Open champion. From the nearby
grandstand an annoyed American voice yelled, ``Show up this
afternoon, will ya?''
</P>
<P>
   Woods showed up with David Duval, the world's No. 2-ranked
golfer, but they lost, 2-up, to Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood, who
made their putts.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson didn't make his putts. If he had made a 4-footer
for a birdie on the 186-yard 16th hole, he and Jim Furyk would have
been all square with Parnevik and Garcia, but he missed. And if he
had made a 6-footer for a birdie on the 436-yard 18th, he would
have evened the match and salvaged a half-point. But he missed
both.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at Valderrama in Spain, Mickelson missed several
crucial putts. And in his duel with Payne Stewart over the final
holes of this year's U.S. Open Championship at Pinehurst, he missed
a 6-foot putt on the 17th green that was the eventual difference.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's misses Friday enabled Parnevik, the Swedish
comedian's son with the bill of his cap turned up, and Garcia, the
baby-faced teen-ager who looked as if he sneaked in here from a
local high school golf team, to be the day's only double winners.
It recalled the first time Garcia met Crenshaw earlier this year
during the Memorial,
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Crenshaw,'' Garcia said with that boyish mischief in his
face, ``I have played well enough to be on the U.S. PGA Tour. Would
you pick me on your Ryder Cup team?''
</P>
<P>
   The kid was kidding, but at the time, two months before he
finished second to Woods in the Professional Golfers' Association
Championship after hitting that 6-iron from the base of a tree onto
the 16th green at Medinah, he had yet to make the European team.
But Friday he and Parnevik, who was 7-under par in their afternoon
match, were the difference.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Garcia's par-saving chip at the dreaded 486-yard
12th hole provided a 1-up lead when Woods' long downhill putt slid
below the cup and Lehman missed the putt. In the afternoon, Garcia
chipped in from 50 feet for an eagle-3 at the 534-yard 14th hole.
Suddenly 1-up again, he jumped, hopped and leaped in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio's a big, big talent,'' said Mark James, the European
captain, ``but I have to pay tribute to Jesper because Jesper's the
perfect foil. He's a very, very clever guy, Jesper, and he knows
exactly how to play with Sergio, when to let him loose and when to
rein him in. All I really do is feed him chocolate and watch him
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Garcia's eagle chip-in, Parnevik pulled his tee
shot on the 15th onto hard gallery-trampled grassless ground to the
left of the fairway. As soon as Garcia hit his approach onto the
green, he hurried over to check Parnevik's lie. On his haunches, he
peered at it until Parnevik, laughing, pretended to pick him up by
the collar.
</P>
<P>
   As Garcia walked away, he noticed that the spectators' long
late-afternoon shadows were moving over Parnevik's ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful with the shadows, please,'' Garcia said to the
spectators and to Parnevik's caddie, Lance Ten Broeck.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday morning's last alternate-shot match, Parnevik and
Garcia will go against Payne Stewart and Justin Leonard before
pairing together again in the afternoon better-ball format.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't win the Ryder Cup in the singles,'' Seve
Ballesteros, the spiritual leader of the European team for so many
years, has said. ``You win it in the two-man team matches.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not always true, but unless the Americans suddenly find
their putting strokes in Friday's eight matches, the cup may
already be lost.

HOT-PUTTING LOVE BETRAYED BY IRONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Maybe his putting was pretty good, admirable
in fact. Davis Love wouldn't agrue that point.
</P>
<P>
   But he struggled with his irons, mostly second shots that
repeatedly 20 or so yards off the mark, leading to a Ryder Cup
opening day that left him in uncomfortable spots to attempt birdies
or pars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some good putts down the stretch of both matches,''
said Love, after wrapping up a day in which he halved two matches,
helping to account for 50 percent of America's disappointing point
total. ``I just feel if I had done my part, we could have won both
matches.''
</P>
<P>
   To begin the day, Love teamed with Payne Stewart and halved a
round of alternate-shot foursomes. After a short respite, he took
to The Country Club fairways again with partner Justin Leonard and
rolled in two key putts--the last on the 18th hole--to salvage yet
another half-point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the team gets some confidence out of the way
Justin and I finished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Love and Leonard fell a hole behind on the 17th--the only time
they trailed all afternoon--and were perilously close to losing the
round when Europe's Colin Montgomery drove his second shot 20 feet
from the pin. But Love, who drained a dramatic put on 14 to keep
the round all square, calmy rolled in a 20-footer to capture the
18th with a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks finished in a 6-2 deficit for the day. All week in
practice rounds, the Americans appeared uptight and stoic, while
the Europeans seemed relaxed, embracing the crowds that lined the
fairways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Love, ``I didn't see guys I was playing
against having a whole lot of fun. It seems like they raise their
game in the Ryder Cup, and our team seems not to play to its
capabilities. I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Love will get a well-deserved break Saturday, at least in the
four morning rounds. After his a.m. bye in the foursomes, he could
be brought back for another round of four-ball (pairings announced
after the first four rounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good at the moment,'' said Love, recapping how he
felt when each of his key putts dropped in on 14 and 18. ``But then
you think, `Golly, I never should have been in that situation to
begin with.'''

   KURCHATOV, Kazakhstan _ Here under the desolate Degelen
Mountains in the wind-swept Central Asian steppes, the Soviet Union
detonated more than 400 nuclear explosions during the Cold War that
helped it perfect the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, at noon on Saturday, Sept. 25, the earth is
expected to reverberate once more with the seismic shock waves of
an underground blast with the force of 100 tons of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the explosion in the next-to-last tunnel of an
underground maze that once crisscrossed the world's largest nuclear
test range will be conventional, not nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   And its goal is to insure that this site will be used for war no
more. Scientists say the blast will also help them identify and
measure secret underground nuclear tests conducted by, say, India,
Pakistan and China or by rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea is full of tunnels,'' said a senior Pentagon
official.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the United States and Kazakhstan have quietly
collaborated on a series of ambitious projects worth more than $170
million, financed by Washington, to help the now independent
government of President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev carry out his
pledge to forswear the nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
that Kazakhstan inherited from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But this security relationship, which American officials
describe as the closest they have with any former Soviet republic,
is now roiled by recent disclosures of the sale of more than 30
MIG-21 fighter jets to North Korea for $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   While Kazakh officials lobby to dissuade Washington from
imposing economic sanctions that would cost their country $75
million in annual foreign aid and jeopardize the close security
ties, scientists here at the Semipalatinsk test range, roughly the
size of Indiana, are struggling to stop impoverished Kazakh
scavengers from stealing copper and other precious minerals from
the radioactive tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   A large amount of irradiated copper was sold to China by a
private Kazakh company three years ago, prompting a formal protest
from Beijing, Kazakh officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told people in surrounding villages a hundred times how
dangerous it is to touch this metal, but what can we do when people
are hungry?'' said Murat Akhmetov, director of the Institute of
Radiation, Safety and Ecology in Kurchatov, the once secret nuclear
city of 30,000 that has shrunk to one third its former size.
``Scavenging irradiated copper is as self-defeating as selling
MIG's to rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary ``calibration'' experiment scheduled for
Saturday is the second of three tests intended to accompany the
closing and sealing of the last of 181 tunnels here at the Degelen
Mountains, where the Soviet Union conducted hundreds of underground
blasts after atmospheric testing was banned in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people have been involved in preparing for Omega 2,
as the blast is known. In addition to implanting seismic monitors
in a tunnel on the eastern side of the mountain range and its
drift, Kazakh and American scientists painted rocks and joints
inside the tunnels bright red, green, yellow and white.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Kovalev, director of the Degelen Mountain complex, said
the paint will enable scientists to assess how the blast shatters,
moves and distributes the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are standing in one of only 15 `clean' tunnels where
nuclear tests were not conducted,'' said Kovalev, as he walked
carefully through a part of the tunnel that will soon become
rubble. ``So we were able to work eight and nine-hour days
preparing the tunnels for the blast.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most heavily radioactive tunnels, by contrast, miners
were able to work shifts of only an hour and a half a day.
</P>
<P>
   More than five miles of copper-lined cable was laid to provide
power to the electronic sensors and monitors buried deep inside the
shafts. Sandbags were placed along the tunnel walls to protect the
instruments from the blast's full force. Near the end of the
tunnel, the scientists scooped out a huge cavity some 20 feet in
diameter that now holds the explosives and the detonation charge.
The test chamber's floor has been painted blood red.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through these vast underground passageways, whose
multi-colored coats of paint are illuminated by slightly iridescent
lamps affixed to the rock walls, is like exploring a surreal mine
shaft decorated by a mad finger painter. The air is dank and moldy.
The railway track that carried equipment and construction materials
deep inside the mountain is now covered with gravel and loose rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for us at first to do this work,'' said Kovalev,
who came to Kurchatov 30 years ago to build these channels of
death. ``It's not psychologically easy to destroy what you helped
build.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week before the blast, Kovalev supervised the loading of
100 tons of chemical explosives into the test chamber. The
instruments placed in 11 bore holes that were dug from or near the
chamber into a lower tunnel, the drift, were re-checked. The video
cameras situated just inside the tunnel portals, or openings, were
switched on to ensure that they, too, functioned properly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On ``D-Day,'' or Detonation Day, police and army units sent to
aid the hundreds of engineers, scientists, technicians and guards
who prepared for this test will fan out through the site, insuring
that the area immediately around the tunnel is clear of people
except the scientists and security guards charged with detonating
the explosives and monitoring the test from stationary and mobile
control centers at designated control points.
</P>
<P>
   For this test, as for the first one, called Omega 1, at another
tunnel in August 1998, scientists from Kazakhstan's National
Nuclear Center, their 20 American counterparts _ including
participants from the U.S. nuclear test site at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in Nevada and from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
of Columbia University _ as well as observers from Russia and
France, will be on hand to help monitor or interpret test results.
</P>
<P>
   Given the low labor costs here, American and Kazakh scientists
agreed that conducting similar tests at the Nevada site would cost
10 times as much as the $2.3 million that these calibration tests
are expected to cost.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Kluchko, a Pentagon program manager for the test, wrote in
an in-house Defense Department newsletter that the last Omega test
produced high-quality seismic records as far as 3,700 miles away.
Yuri Cherepnin, director general of the National Nuclear Center,
where some 2,000 former Kazakh nuclear scientists and technicians
now work on nonproliferation, said he expected seismic stations in
the same range as those in the Omega 1 test to be able to detect
the Saturday blast.
</P>
<P>
   The ``calibration'' experiment is rooted in a series of
Kazakh-American agreements signed in 1994 to help Kazakhstan get
rid of not only its weapons of mass destruction but also the
infrastructure that supported them.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Kazakh and American officials have quietly removed
more than a thousand nuclear weapons, closed the giant missile
silos once occupied by SS-18 Mirved Soviet ICBMs, converted key
biological weapons production centers, and moved more than 1,300
pounds of highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium out of the
country. Other major projects are under way or being planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kazakhstan has taken unprecedented steps to advance
nonproliferation and become a model of arms control for Central
Asia and other regions,'' said Vladimir S. Shkolnik, the minister
of science, a Russian physicist and veteran of the old Soviet
nuclear program here.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, Washington agreed in October 1995 to
spend $20 million blowing up and sealing the 181 horizontal
tunnels, each a mile and a half long on average, as well as
numerous vertical-bore holes, each 1,000 to 1,650 feet deep, that
are situated on the Balapan test site, near the granite-filled
Degelen Mountains, whose hard rock geology made them perfect for
underground weapons tests. So far, 179 tunnels have been blasted
and sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In closing the tunnels in which the Soviets conducted hundreds
of tests, Washington sensed opportunity. So did the international
agency created to monitor compliance with the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Washington pledged an extra $1.2 million for the first two
calibration experiments in the last remaining tunnels. The
independent monitors of the test ban treaty, whose Vienna based
organization is affiliated with the United Nations, provided
another $80,000 to see whether an international team of inspectors
who are expected to arrive at test site nine days after the blast
will be able to identify the precise location of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Don A. Linger, a deputy for technical programs at the Pentagon's
Defense Threat Reduction Agency outside Washington, said the
measurements from the tests would enable seismic stations
throughout the world to ``calibrate'' their equipment and help
scientists distinguish between a natural event, like an earthquake,
and a bomb test.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is not always obvious, he added, noting that
seismologists were divided, say, over what kind of nuclear test
India conducted last year, as well as its strength.
</P>
<P>
   Cherepnin said he hoped that the United States and other
observers would eventually support research to measure
contamination levels at this sprawling test range. Soil samples
taken at different areas of the test range, he said, ``show the
existence of plutonium residues that exceed the acknowledged levels
by 100 times.'' But Kazakhstan, he added, cannot afford to conduct
such tests.
</P>
<P>
   While the precise levels of contamination have not been
measured, Kazakh scientists are painfully aware of some of the
adverse health and environmental effects of some four decades of
nuclear tests in the Semipalatinsk region, the first decade of
which were conducted above ground.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1998 U.N. report, much of the test site is
contaminated by cesium 137 and strontium 90. Local studies
attribute several lethal and debilitating illnesses, including high
rates of cancer, to radiation from the tests. Kazakhstan estimates
that 1.2 million people in and around the test site received above
normal doses of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.N. team that visited here last year had difficulty
distinguishing between adverse health effects produced by the
tests, limited to underground explosions after 1963, and those
stemming from the impoverishment of Kurchatov and other towns and
villages in the Semipalatinsk area due to the end of nuclear
testing in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Half the buildings in Kurchatov, named for the father of the
Soviet atomic bomb, now stand abandoned or crumbling. The once
elegant, tree-lined streets are filled with potholes and buckled
pavement. For much of the harsh winter, there is neither reliable
heat nor electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Given this region's dependence on foreign assistance and
technical cooperation with the West, Kazakh scientists here were
particularly furious about recent disclosures that some senior
Kazakh officials either approved or failed to stop the sale of
30-year-old Soviet jet fighters to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a freaky accident that does not reflect government
policy,'' said Shkolnik, the science minister, who noted that two
senior officials had lost their jobs over the incident. ``But it
has undoubtedly hurt our country's image. I hope it will not
jeopardize tests like these and the close cooperation that benefit
both Kazakhstan and America.''

AFRICAN VIRUS MAY HAVE CAUSED MOSQUITO-BORNE ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to add new material at end, starting with graf that begins
``The discovery of ...'')  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mosquito-borne illness that has killed three
people in New York City may not have been St. Louis encephalitis,
as experts thought, but may have been a similar disease that has
never been diagnosed in the Western hemisphere, government
scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, West Nile virus, was discovered this week in dozens
of birds that died in and around the Bronx Zoo this summer. The
virus is indigenous to north and east Africa and Asia, and
occasionally makes its way to Europe, but it has never been found
in birds or humans in the Americas, said Duane Gubler, the director
of the division of vector-borne infectious disease for the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, the illness that has infected at least 14 people
in New York City and four in Westchester County was believed to be
St. Louis encephalitis, which was surprising enough, because that
disease is rarely found outside the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of tests will be needed before health officials are sure
whether the people stricken were infected by some type of West Nile
viruslike illness or St. Louis encephalitis. Officials at the CDC
said they hope to complete the tests next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery of the West Nile strain in the birds has cast
doubt on the original diagnosis, officials said. ``West Nile virus
is closely related to St. Louis encephalitis, the virus we thought
was causing the outbreak,'' Gubler said. The discovery of the dead
birds, he added, ``has caused some confusion as to whether that is
true now.''
</P>
<P>
   If officials confirm that the disease that sickened New Yorkers
was the West Nile virus, it would have no practical effect on those
who have become ill, or on the efforts to prevent the disease from
spreading. Both illnesses are transmitted from birds to mosquitoes
to people, via the same type of mosquito. The insecticide used to
kill those mosquitoes is exactly the same.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of both illnesses are virtually the same and are
usually mild, though in rare cases they can cause neurological
disorders and even death. Experts said those severe cases _ which
generally involve the elderly, children under 5 and those with
compromised immune systems _ are even less frequent with West Nile
virus. With both illnesses, there is no cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important message to get across is that all the public
health and responsive measures implemented are the same,'' said Tom
Skinner, a spokesman at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   But from an epidemiological standpoint, the discovery of West
Nile virus in New York is stunning. ``This is exciting,'' said
Gubler. ``We prefer it didn't occur, but it is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing in the waning years of the late 20th
century is the transport and movement of these viruses in new
areas,'' he added. ``And you get a virus moving into a new area,
the entire mosquito population is susceptible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday, two elderly women were added to the list of confirmed
cases of the mosquito-borne illness. One of the women, who is 90
years old and in critical condition, was the first case to be
confirmed in Manhattan since the outbreak began in August.
</P>
<P>
   Now, old and new blood samples from humans and roughly 450
birds, as well as trapped mosquitoes, will be examined by the CDC,
which will try to determine whether the West Nile virus found in
the birds was what caused the New Yorkers to become ill.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the diagnosis of those who are ill may
have been mistaken, experts said _ the two illnesses are very
similar, and few would have thought to look for an illness whose
closest brush with this country was in France in the 1960s. The
worst modern outbreak of West Nile disease was in Romania in 1996,
when 90,000 cases were confirmed and 17 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the West Nile virus came about in large part as
a result of some dogged sleuthing by a head of the department of
pathology at the Bronx Zoo, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That pathologist, Tracey McNamara, said she became concerned in
late July when she heard that a large number of crows had been
dying around the zoo. By August, 40 crows had died. Then birds at
the zoo began to die. Over Labor Day weekend, the zoo lost a Guanay
cormorant, three Chilean flamingos, a pheasant and a bald eagle.
Because these deaths followed those of some crows, experts strongly
doubt that the disease originated in the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies of the birds revealed streaking in the heart and brain
hemorrhages. An equine encephalitis was suspected, but Dr. McNamara
was skeptical, because the emus in her care, which are very
susceptible to that illness, were thriving.
</P>
<P>
   When two more flamingos died on Sept. 9, she sent samples to
laboratories of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in Ames, Iowa,
which ruled out all the common bird viruses. Stymied, they called
in an equine virologist from vacation to do further testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was becoming more and more suggestive that this was not a
regular bird disease,'' Dr. McNamara said. The CDC was also sent
samples, as were doctors at an Army lab in Fort Detrick, Md.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the CDC discovered the West Nile virus link.
``Everyone was shocked,'' she said. ``It's possible it came in with
a human being or a smuggled bird, and I am not at all certain it
will ever be established how it got here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, which has been in
charge of the spraying, would not comment on the CDC news Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   As Westchester County prepared to continue its spraying Friday
night, many Jewish residents voiced concern that such efforts would
interfere with the start of the Succoth holiday, which requires the
observant to sit in an open-air tent or hut to take their evening
meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about having these insecticides come down on me
while I am trying to exercise my religious obligations,'' said
Bradley Scher, an investment manager who lives in New Rochelle.
``We are not looking forward to this falling into our food and on
our tables.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Jewish residents had asked that the spraying be done
during the day or later at night.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Hochman, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County
executive's office, said that the agency was aware of the holiday
and had contacted regional Jewish centers, ``but we have decided it
is a health emergency and we have to go with the spraying for the
good of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials said they would not spray any more until
receiving results from recent mosquito testing. New York City
completed its second round on Thursday night and will also wait to
see when and if it needs to spray again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A cache of stolen uranium was intercepted by Georgian
officials this week, underscoring the continuing danger of nuclear
theft in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials said they confiscated a kilogram (2.2 pounds)
of Uranium-235 on Monday night just miles from the Georgian-Turkish
border.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the nuclear material seemed to be low-enriched
uranium and that the smugglers had not acquired nearly enough to
help an aspiring nuclear power make a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Low-enriched uranium is far less of a worry than highly-enriched
uranium, which can be used to make nuclear bombs. But low-enriched
uranium can be processed to make high-enriched uranium. And the
shipment of low enriched uranium could be dangerous if there was
enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the episode indicates trafficking in nuclear materials
remains a major worry. It also suggests there has been a breakdown
in controls at a nuclear power plant or fuel fabrication factory,
probably in Russia or Ukraine. Georgian scientists insist the
nuclear material did not originate in their country and that
Georgia was simply being used as a transit point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that the Georgian authorities were paying
attention to the problem of nuclear smuggling and did something
about it,'' said a U.S. official. ``The bad news is that the
uranium found its way into the black market. It is important to
keep this material locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been an
enormous concern about nuclear theft but relatively few documented
cases of diversions of nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant incidents occurred in Prague in 1994
when authorities there confiscated 2.7 kilograms of highly-enriched
uranium, which is believed to have originated in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no major smuggling cases in recent years,
Western officials have been concerned that the economic crisis in
Russia and neighboring republics would lead to a new series of
thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian authorities said the case began with Valiko Chkmivadze,
a 60-year-old Georgian. Georgian authorities said on Friday that
they have kept a close watch on Chkmivadze because he was
previously detained by Turkey on suspicion of trading in nuclear
material.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian police followed him and two other Georgians as they
drove to Batumi, near the Georgian-Turkish border on Monday. They
were caught with the uranium and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In the last day or so, the uranium was taken to a shut-down
research reactor outside the Georgian capital of Tbilisi for
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The Tbilisi reactor has a storage area equipped with a
sophisticated alarm system. That security system was installed by
the United States several years ago to protect highly-enriched
uranium previously stored there.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the concern about keeping nuclear material in the
volatile Caucasus, the highly-enriched uranium and a cache of spent
radioactive fuel was flown by U.S. Air Force planes to Britain in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The material confiscated in Batumi this week has not yet been
analyzed. But it appears to be low-enriched uranium fuel pellets
for a nuclear power plant, according to Georgian and U.S. experts.
</P>
<P>
   Zurab Salaridze, the deputy director of the Institute of Physics
in Georgia, said in an interview that the cache consisted of 219
small dark-color tablets, which are cylindrical in shape. The
tablets are one centimeter high and seven millimeters in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nuclear weapon cannot be made with low-enriched uranium,''
said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard University. ``But a
sufficient quantity of such material could greatly reduce the
amount of work required to make weapons-grade uranium.''
</P>
<P>
   Added a U.S. official: ``If Iran somehow managed to obtain 100
or 200 kilograms of lower-enriched uranium we would have something
to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the confiscation of one kilogram has prompted
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One question is whether the Georgians have seized all of the
stolen supply or whether other material is still available on the
black market or had seeped out of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is the origin of the uranium and whether its
appearance on the black market indicated that nuclear controls in
the former Soviet Union were fraying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that it came from Ukraine or Russia,'' said
William C. Potter, the director of the Center for Nonproliferation
Studies in Monterey, California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Low-enriched uranium fuel does not constitute a significant
proliferation hazard,'' Potter said. ``The significance of this
case is that it indicates there is traffic in radioactive
materials.''

A STRUGGLE OVER CULTURE AND TURF AT AUTO GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp. merged nearly
a year ago, a buzz of excitement went through Detroit on the report
that Thomas Stallkamp, the president of Chrysler, would become the
president of the new company, DaimlerChrysler AG, and might someday
become the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But as the weeks passed, it emerged that Stallkamp was really
only the president of another entity, DaimlerChrysler Corp. This
consisted of nothing more than the former Chrysler operations _ and
did not even control the American divisions of DaimlerChrysler AG's
Mercedes and commercial truck subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The narrower job description now appears to have been an early
omen of what happened Friday, as DaimlerChrysler AG announced that
Stallkamp, 53, was retiring from the company. Stallkamp's departure
came after a meeting of DaimlerChrysler AG's German-dominated
supervisory board in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisory board removed another American executive and two
German executives from the management board while adding another
German executive to it. The supervisory board also reorganized the
company's operations on a more hierarchical model.
</P>
<P>
   James Holden, the executive vice president for sales and
marketing and a longtime Chrysler executive, will replace Stallkamp
as president of DaimlerChrysler Corp. on Oct. 1. Stallkamp, who was
not available for interviews Friday, will serve as vice chairman of
the corporation until his retirement at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp's departure was widely received here Friday as
confirmation that former Daimler executives were in charge of the
combined company, and that Daimler had really acquired Chrysler
last year, although the deal was presented at the time as a
``merger of equals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Eaton, Chrysler's former chairman and chief executive
and now a co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler AG, disagreed with this
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to look at it that way at all. This is a merger
of equally strong companies,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message sent Friday to DaimlerChrysler Corp.'s
North American employees, Stallkamp said that he had ``excellent
relationships'' with his German colleagues on the management board.
Stallkamp said that differences in management styles and corporate
cultures had been worked out, and added that, ``The fact remains,
at my age and position, this is the best time for me to make a
change and to take advantage of new opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stallkamp also seemed to hint in the message that leaving
had not been his idea. Referring to Eaton and Juergen. Schrempp,
the co-chairmen of DaimlerChrysler AG, Stallkamp wrote that, ``Bob
and Juergen believe, and I concurred, that as the company moves
into this new phase this is the appropriate time for me to move
beyond this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto officials who insisted on anonymity said this week that
Stallkamp's departure might have been inevitable. A quiet,
informal, even gentle man with a wry sense of humor, his hallmark
at Chrysler had been his willingness to trust others absolutely.
Unlike other auto executives, who favor sports cars and sport
utility vehicles, Stallkamp is famous for sometimes driving a
minivan around town. His easygoing ways appear not to have
impressed some of his German colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't willing to fight for turf,'' said a supporter of
Stallkamp involved in the two companies' integration. ``Tom's
demise is that he wasn't willing to buy into the Daimler culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp had become Chrysler's president a few months before
the merger by working his way up through the company's purchasing
department, where he avoided the sharp elbows of the auto
manufacturing side of the business. His greatest accomplishment, a
new purchasing system that asked suppliers to figure out ways to
reduce costs, was a dramatic departure from Detroit automakers'
tradition of dictating to suppliers precisely how a part should be
designed and at what cost.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of Stallkamp's influence, Chrysler had an
unusual, so-called matrix management structure that was designed to
encourage teamwork and produced surprisingly harmonious results.
His subordinates at Chrysler each had overlapping responsibility
for two departments of the company _ a structure that has now been
largely scrapped in favor of clearer lines of authority.
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp's informality seems to have cost him dearly in dealing
with Daimler executives. In a meeting with reporters a month before
the merger was completed, Stallkamp had contended that job titles
were unimportant.

<P>
   ``I really believe an organizational chart is static and doesn't
really reflect'' how decisions are made in big companies, he said
then.
</P>
<P>
   But Stallkamp's supporter said that by then a turf battle had
already been fought. Stallkamp had expected to become president of
DaimlerChrysler AG, but instead wound up as president only of
DaimlerChrysler Corp., although this was not announced at the time
and never attracted much attention even when it became known.
Juergen Hubbert, the head of Mercedes, refused to report to
Stallkamp and prevailed to such an extent that DaimlerChrysler
Corp. ended up with no control even over Mercedes operations in the
United States, the Stallkamp loyalist said. DaimlerChrysler AG
officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp's position deteriorated quickly in the last week for
reasons that are not entirely clear. While automotive trade
publications have been reporting for two months that
DaimlerChrysler AG planned to shrink its management board and adopt
a more hierarchical structure, the first sign of Stallkamp's
departure came in leaks last weekend to the German press.
</P>
<P>
   German executives, while insisting on anonymity, became
increasingly critical of Stallkamp over the last several days,
suggesting that he was overrated and not up to his job. Stallkamp
and other American executives said nothing to counter these
comments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eaton said Friday that he had felt ``frustration over the
leaks.'' Eaton, the co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler AG, agreed at
the time of the merger to step down within three years, leaving the
other co-chairman, Schrempp, as the company's sole chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The only top DaimlerChrysler AG executive from the Chrysler side
of the business who commented publicly this week was Holden. At a
press conference on Monday to announce a new advertising campaign,
Holden insisted that Germans and Americans were working well
together in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Meyers, a former chairman and chief executive of American
Motors Corp., who was among the first to predict cultural clashes
when the DaimlerChrysler merger was announced, said that Friday's
reorganization might actually help.
</P>
<P>
   While a few more managers might follow Stallkamp out the door,
enough talented executives will be left to run the company and they
will clearly understand that the Germans control it, Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the beginning of the end of the cultural
problems,'' he said. ``The charade of the merger of equals is
starting to fade and the stark reality that one company bought
another has become clear.''

MAN FOUND GUILTY OF PUNCHING A POLICE HORSE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A member of the jury called the case ``ridiculous,''
a ``waste'' and a ``big joke,'' but he and his peers found James
Hornacek, a 35-year-old union electrician, guilty on Friday of
punching a police horse named Snewser in Midtown Manhattan last
June.
</P>
<P>
   The juror, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
panel was bound by law to seriously weigh the charge _ ``attempted
killing or injuring of a police animal'' _ and not to decide if the
crime merited prosecution. If it had been up to him, the juror
said, the case would have ended long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should've just fined him,'' the juror said.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek, who was visibly dismayed by the verdict, repeated his
mantra that he was a horse lover, not a horse fighter. ``I'm
totally taken aback by the verdict. I never did it. There is no
proof that I did it,'' Hornacek said. His lawyer said he planned to
appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek, who chose to go to trial instead of accepting a plea
bargain that involved community service, was acquitted of the
charge of obstructing governmental administration.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ruth Pickholz of Manhattan Criminal Court will have until
Hornacek's sentencing on Nov. 9 to decide what a proper punishment
for horse punching is. Hornacek, who has no criminal record, could
be sentenced to anything from probation to 90 days in jail and
receive up to a $500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The jury did not believe that Hornacek walked up to Snewser and
boldly punched him in the nose, as prosecutors alleged, the juror
said. But it did believe that he hit the horse across its hind
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the panel did not believe the account of Officer John
Reilly, Snewser's rider, who used the judge's swivel chair during
his testimony to demonstrate how he maneuvered Snewser that fateful
afternoon, the juror said. Reilly said Hornacek resolutely stood
his ground when Snewser approached and then popped the horse in the
nose.
</P>
<P>
   But the juror said the panel found Capt. Robert Mednick, who
said he saw Hornacek repeatedly strike the horse's rear end, more
credible. A police video of the scene supported Mednick's account,
the juror said.

ERIC GLEACHER: INVESTMENT BANKER RETURNING TO THE FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BANK-SCOTLAND-NATWEST) 
(th) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't expect executives of National Westminster Bank to shake
hands with their former colleague Eric Gleacher anytime soon. They
may have to wait for the bite marks to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Just five months after Gleacher bought his merger-advisory
boutique back from the big British bank _ pocketing a handsome
profit, some Wall Street executives say _ he is serving as a key
adviser to the Bank of Scotland on its unsolicited $34 billion bid
for Natwest.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations pit Gleacher, a pugnacious veteran of some of
the most hostile takeover battles ever waged on Wall Street,
against the bank that paid $135 million for his firm, now known as
Gleacher &AMP; Co., and owned it for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   In April, after Natwest decided to end its foray into investment
banking and concentrate on commercial banking, Gleacher and his
partners bought their firm back with the help of the Bank of
Scotland. Bank of Scotland now owns about 10 percent of Gleacher &AMP;
Co., a stake it acquired for an undisclosed sum that it put up to
help finance the repurchase of Gleacher from Natwest.
</P>
<P>
   A Natwest spokesman, David Outhwaite, said the bank had not
divulged how much it received in the sale of Gleacher. But
investment bankers in New York who know Gleacher are confident that
Gleacher gave much less than he got.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview Friday, Gleacher declined to discuss his
involvement in the takeover bid or how much it cost to buy back his
firm. ``We want the focus to be on the business deal and not on
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt turn of events has landed Gleacher in the odd spot of
helping to start a hostile takeover attempt on a company he worked
for only recently. Some investment bankers and experts on the
industry questioned the propriety of Gleacher's role, while others
took an all's-fair view of his change of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much Yiddish, but I think the word chutzpah
applies,'' said one investment banker who knows Gleacher. ``You'd
have to say it was quite aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Perella, head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co., another firm that is advising Bank of Scotland,
defended Gleacher's presence. ``I don't have any problem with what
he's doing,'' Perella said. ``He's got a new partner and he's
working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Hayes, a longtime professor of investment banking at
Harvard Business School, said that he probably would have advised
the Gleacher firm to recuse itself from the takeover bid, even
though the firm is now allied with Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't erase the possible conflict of interest, it only
makes it more understandable why it might arise,'' Hayes said. ``As
a general rule, you don't do that. Investment bankers are very
sensitive to the perception of something inappropriate because
their imprimatur is so much the sizzle on the steak and not the
steak.''
</P>
<P>
   People are buzzing about Gleacher, 58, for the first time in a
while. The bid for Natwest is a bigger deal than any he has been
involved in lately, though probably not the most lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Gleacher, a former Marine, made his name on Wall Street by
leading bold charges, such as Ronald O. Perelman's hostile takeover
of Revlon in 1985. But he has kept a lower profile since he left
Morgan Stanley in 1990, working from offices on Madison Avenue
decorated with sculptures of birds of prey.
</P>
<P>
   One unorthodox tack his firm has taken in recent years has been
to accept equity in young companies in exchange for advice and
financing. For example, Gleacher &AMP; Co. accepted a warrant in
January from WebMD Inc., an Internet-based company, that gave it
the right to buy up to 750,000 shares of WebMD's stock for $20
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD is merging with Healtheon Corp. in a deal that puts a
current value of about $72 on each of the shares Gleacher &AMP; Co. had
claims on. That makes Gleacher's compensation for its services to
WebMD worth almost $40 million.

<P>
   Jenna Paxton is an educated consumer. Never, before last year,
had she hesitated to toss a store-brand food into her shopping cart
to shave her grocery bill. Like many Americans, she buys cheaper
generic drugs instead of the brand names, too.
</P>
<P>
   But during a routine trip last year down aisle 16A of an HEB
supermarket in Austin, Texas, she hesitated at buying a product she
had never thought of before: generic infant formula.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of saving $3 a can piqued her interest. Still, her
first child, Aaron, had started out on Similac, the national brand
known to generations of parents. And when her second son, Cameron,
was born, she stayed loyal.
</P>
<P>
   She studied the yellow label on the store-brand formula, Ms.
Paxton remembered, and concluded that the ingredients were
identical. Still wary, she bought a can and took it to the doctor's
office where she is an administrative assistant. The doctor agreed
that it appeared to contain the same ingredients as the name-brand
formulas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I questioned it, most definitely,'' Ms. Paxton said. ``But
that was strictly because it was a brand I hadn't heard of
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people have. Across the country, supermarkets and drug
stores are just beginning to stock generic baby formulas. But the
economics makes them promising. For retailers accustomed to selling
brand-name formulas for little or no profit, the generics represent
a potential cash cow. For new parents, they represent substantial
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Paxton is not the only one who is nervous.
Pediatricians have fundamental concerns about lower-priced formula
_ whether it will cost them industry-backed research funds, for
example, or whether it will persuade more mothers to turn away from
breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   And the makers of brand-name formulas _ Enfamil, from the Mead
Johnson Nutritionals unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb, is the market
leader, followed by Similac, from the Ross Laboratories unit of
Abbott Laboratories _ must worry about this latest threat to their
business, which has been tarred by accusations of price-fixing and
condemnations of the formula makers' exports to the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
   The formula makers have nurtured intense brand loyalty through
aggressive giveaways to new parents and pediatricians, along with
big rebates to state welfare programs. Their message is simple, if
vague, and it can be found in doctors' offices everywhere, on
leaflets like one distributed by Ross Laboratories: ``All infant
formulas are not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, the Food and Drug Administration requires that
all formulas, including generics, meet the same rigid nutritional
requirements and contain virtually identical ingredients. While the
manufacturers are constantly tinkering, advances cannot be
patented. So this seems like a marketplace ripe for an upstart that
is ready to strip away the fancy marketing and sell formula for
less.
</P>
<P>
   That, indeed, is how the marketer of the yellow cans on Ms.
Paxton's grocery store shelf presents himself. In 18 months, Paul
B. Manning, 44, the founder of PBM Products in Gordonsville, Va.,
has made just a tiny dent in the $1.9 billion American retail
market for formula: sales are running at $30 million a year. But
Manning says that is just a start for his product, sold under store
brands and under the names Babymil and Babysoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that has large barriers to entry or difficult markets
_ if you're willing to put the effort in _ offers up the biggest
opportunities,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   But the story is more complicated than the David-and-Goliath
match of Manning's generics versus Similac and Enfamil, which still
command 86 percent of the American market, according to A.C.
Nielsen, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Cans of generic formula do not bear the name PBM Products.
Instead, they name the manufacturer, Wyeth Nutritionals, a division
of American Home Products, the global medical company that pulled
out of the domestic formula business in 1996 but remains the
second-ranked seller of formula worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   After Wyeth withdrew from the American market, Manning offered
to buy its factory. His plan was to keep SMA and Nursoy, Wyeth's
flagship formulas, on the market as midpriced products and to
introduce lower-priced powdered formula in generic packaging as
well. Instead, Wyeth agreed to supply Manning in an arrangement
that is for the moment exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he must persuade pediatricians and family practitioners _
as well as parents _ that his no-name formula is good enough for
America's infants. His plan is to take on the name brands directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to bring the message to the mothers,'' he said.
``We really believe that parents will be shocked when they find out
how overpriced Similac and Enfamil are.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in the United States in 1911, infant formula became
wildly popular in the 1930s and '40s as new mothers sought to raise
their children by the methods prescribed in so-called scientific
parenting manuals. By 1970, fewer than one-fourth of American
infants were breast-fed, according to figures collected by Ross
Laboratories that also counted as breast-fed any babies who
received both formula and breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1952, however, the Journal of the American Medical
Association published an article describing the health benefits of
breast milk. By 1979, when a Carter administration commission
listed the promotion of breast-feeding as a national health goal,
the breast-feeding rate had rebounded to 50 percent. It peaked at
62 percent in 1981 before starting another decline; the latest
figure is 59.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By 1981, the formula market was controlled by a handful of
companies, and the economics of the market was distorted by the
fact that the federal government was by far the biggest customer.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all formula sold in the United States went to parents in
the federally financed, state-administered Women, Infants and
Children nutrition program, which distributes coupons to buy
household basics in grocery stores, and which continued to
subsidize formula use despite the government policy in favor of
breast-feeding.

DAVIS GETS WEEK TO MAKE PAYMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Marvin Davis, the elusive billionaire who could
be Los Angeles' last hope of acquiring the next NFL expansion
franchise, received a slim extension Friday on the Hollywood Park
property at which he is considering building a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis is not believed to have made the $250,000 payment
to pick up the option on the nearly 100 acres across from the
Forum, but was simply granted another week by Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Davis at first refused any comment on Friday's option deadline,
then later released a statement that simply said he had ``received
an extension.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is uncertain how serious Davis is about acquiring a team
but is pushing for a $625 million franchise fee and might need to
keep Davis in the expansion game to help push up Bob McNair's bid
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL expansion committee is scheduled to meet Oct. 5 in
Atlanta and is expected to make a recommendation to the league
owners, who will likely vote on the 32nd franchise the following
day.
</P>
<P>
   Unless big money suddenly emerges from Los Angeles, Houston is
expected to get the bid.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known what Davis, who has tap-danced around the
purchase of several other professional sports teams through the
years, hopes to accomplish with the extra week, but if he does pick
up the option, he would have until March to close the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Park property is the vacant site where a hotel
previously was located, across the street from the Forum.

 UNDATED: breast-feeding.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starting in 1980, formula makers raised their prices 18 times in
13 years, for a total of 207 percent, court records later revealed
_ almost three times the overall inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's troubles with the government began in August
1986, when the Tennessee WIC program asked the formula makers to
cut their prices through rebates and other states followed quickly.
Ross Laboratories and Mead Johnson offered rebates of around 20
cents a can. But Wyeth raised eyebrows with offers like one in
Florida: a $1.01-a-can rebate on formula for which the state had
been paying $1.28.
</P>
<P>
   Such episodes led retailers _ joined in Florida by the state
attorney general _ to accuse the formula makers of antitrust
violations in the early 1990s, contending that there was a secret
scheme to raise prices in lockstep. Ross, Mead Johnson and Wyeth
settled a series of lawsuits in 1992 and 1993, with the companies
reportedly paying a total of $230 million but admitting no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   After the smoke of the lawsuits cleared, the General Accounting
Office studied whether the companies were using price increases in
the retail market to subsidize the WIC rebates. In a 1998 report,
the GAO said that to subsidize the losses in WIC sales, retail
prices should have climbed four times as much as they did from 1989
to 1996. The fact that they did not persuaded the government
auditors that the formula business was already highly rewarding for
the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wholesale prices of infant formula appear to be high in
relation to the cost of production,'' the report concluded,
``indicating the likelihood of high profit margins and the
associated possibility of significant rebates.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics of the industry say bluntly that the mark-up on
formula was and is excessive. ``Formula prices were ridiculously
sky-high,'' said Kiran Saluja, chairman of a committee of the
National Association of WIC Directors, which promotes
breast-feeding. ``Basically, formula is cow's milk that you monkey
around with a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Formula makers, of course, dispute that view. That ``monkeying
around'' costs a lot of money, they say _ and makes formula much
more digestible than cow's milk, or any other alternative to breast
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if formula is overpriced, Peter J. Paradossi, a spokesman
for Mead Johnson, replied, ``We feel it's a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's three bucks a day,'' he said. ``It's less than a Happy
Meal. At no time during a baby's life can you feed a child all the
nutrition it needs for that little.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, half of the infant formula business still consists of WIC
contracts, but the math has changed. For the companies, the welfare
program has become a money-losing proposition, but one that
guarantees shelf space and credibility. Plus, many parents veer in
and out of the program; during periods when they pay cash, they
often stick with whichever formula has been recommended by state
health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, however, did a little math of his own and concluded
that the economics were not as unfavorable as the big companies
maintained. In effect, he found that a baby could be fed for less
than the price of a small order of french fries, let alone a whole
meal at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   He knew the economic power of no-name products from 20 years of
marketing generic prescription drugs through Able Labs, a South
Plainfield, N.J., company that he sold for $20 million in 1992.
Once a drug's patent expired, he could sell a generic equivalent
for a tiny fraction of the brand-name product's price, and still
make a tidy profit.
</P>
<P>
   And the formula business, he quickly learned, was even more
attractive, with no patents to worry about, plenty of manufacturing
capacity in the form of Wyeth's factories _ and a ready customer
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retailers in the United States had really wanted someone
to introduce a formula,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   Here is why: The national brands sell for $8.99 to $11.99 for a
16-ounce can, usually just a few pennies above the grocers'
wholesale cost, which varies widely. Manning's generic formula
sells at retail for $6.58 to $7.99, with a wholesale price that
hovers around $6. When parents buy the generic formula, they save
money _ and the stores earn bigger profits.
</P>
<P>
   Why the huge difference in wholesale prices? According to
Manning, it represents selling and administrative expenses _ not,
as his larger competitors would have it, research and development
costs. ``We don't have 500 sales people out selling to
pediatricians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet retailers say that, despite the savings, customers have been
slow to embrace Manning's product. ``It didn't respond as quickly
as we thought it was going to,'' said Kari Caruso, brand manager
for Albertsons, the Boise, Idaho-based grocery chain that began
selling PBM's products in 1997. ``I think it's a category that's
going to take a long process of educating new moms.''
</P>
<P>
   In marketers' parlance, ``educating'' is a form of selling. With
generic formula, that means stores using brochures and newspaper
advertisements to inform customers that, as far as nutrition is
concerned, all infant formulas are the same. (Other major retailers
that sell generic formula include A&AMP;P, Safeway, Vons, Finast, Tom
Thumb, Copps and Wegman's Food Market.)
</P>
<P>
   But the market leaders have spent decades building their ties to
pediatricians and new parents _ and building the mystique of their
brands. The formula makers rely mainly on ``ethical marketing,'' a
concept that includes maintaining Web sites and phone lines to
answer parents' questions, sponsoring seminars and conferences for
pediatricians and showering doctors and new parents with gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do promote our products primarily through the health care
professionals,'' Roland Tuley, a spokesman for Mead Johnson, said.
``Sales reps call on pediatricians. They're out there in those
offices every day.'' And it is a two-way street, he said, since
physicians' counsel helps in development of improved formulas.

 UNDATED: improved formulas.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last few years, the companies have begun advertising in
parenting magazines and on TV following a Federal Trade Commission
lawsuit that led to a somewhat paradoxical 1993 agreement. While
formula makers _ in this case, Ross, Mead Johnson and Wyeth _ did
not admit to having conspired to ban consumer advertising in the
past, they pledged that they would not conspire to avoid
advertising in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, many families are loyal to Similac or Enfamil for
generations. And while the companies are careful to chant the
pediatricians' mantra _ that breast milk is best _ they routinely
send new mothers home from the hospital with diaper bags filled
with cans of formula.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's enterprise turns on the belief that when those diaper
bags are empty and new parents go to the grocery store, the price
of his product will catch their eye. So PBM is advertising in
parenting magazines, too.
</P>
<P>
   He also expects that nervous parents will, like Ms. Paxton, take
the product to their pediatricians. That is why Manning will be at
the American Academy of Pediatricians conference next month in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their stronghold is the pediatric office,'' Manning said of
his competition. ``We're going to hit the pediatricians hard.'' Not
with 500 sales people, but with ads in medical journals and
meetings with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   All of this troubles some doctors, who believe that
breast-feeding faces more than enough competition already.
Pediatricians want parents to consult with them on infant
nutrition, and they fear that developments like the big companies'
television ads and formula marketed on the basis of price make
parents feel more confident in making those decisions alone.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also worry that the rise of generic formulas could
deplete funds for research. Formula studies are performed by the
manufacturers internally and through grants to doctors, hospitals
and the American Academy of Pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing of generic formulas will drive the cost of formula
down,'' said Dr. Michael Georgieff, a professor of pediatrics and
child development at the University of Minnesota. ``There will be
no incentive for research and design.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, that has not been the case. Last year, Abbott, Mead
Johnson and Wyeth all augmented their formulas with nucleotides,
the molecules that compose nucleic acids like DNA and that are
found in breast milk. Mead Johnson takes credit for that
innovation. So does Abbott. On behalf of his supplier, Wyeth, so
does Manning, who adds that worries about generics cutting into
research dollars are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the same comment the pharmaceutical companies made back
in the '80s,'' he said. ``It's a great thing to tell the
pediatricians _ `we won't have money to do research and
development.' It's absolutely not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant worry is that if Manning's generic
formula is a big success, brand-name formula makers will have less
revenue to subsidize the development of special products for babies
with various disorders that prevent them from digesting standard
formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott sells 23 different special formulas _ like Phenex, for
babies with phenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder found in one of
every 10,000 births that keeps infants from absorbing the amino
acid phenylalinine. Mead Johnson markets 25 varieties.
</P>
<P>
   While many doctors agree that there is no difference _ other
than price _ among the basic versions of Similac, Enfamil and
Babymil for a healthy child like Ms. Paxton's son, the generic
formula comes in only two varieties, milk-based and soy-based.
</P>
<P>
   ``God forbid should you have a child who can't digest protein,''
said Bill Wolfson, spokesman for Ross Laboratories. ``You can't go
to generic companies for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning said he was considering sales of generic versions of
specialized formulas from Wyeth, which makes five varieties for
sale outside the United States. While there is little profit in it,
he said, he will provide the specialized products if retailers ask
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's road to riches is bound to be bumpy. Wyeth concluded
that it could not compete in the formula business in the United
States. Nestle, bigger yet, has been able to win only a tenth of
the American retail market for its Carnation-brand formulas after a
decade of trying.
</P>
<P>
   But he is prepared to be patient. After all, this is a man who,
when he was in the generic drug business, set up a lawn chair in
the FDA's lobby to wait out approval of a medication. Now, Manning
says that for him to score big, his giant competitors just need to
keep doing business the way they always have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott made the opportunity,'' he said. ``It's truly an
unbelievable situation.''

OUSTED CHIEF OF STAFF ACCUSES MONTANA SENATOR OF SEXUAL
HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Max Baucus was accused of sexual harassment
Friday in a complaint filed by a woman he dismissed last month as
his chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus, a Montana Democrat, denied the accusation and said he
had discharged the woman, Christine Niedermeier, because she acted
abrasively toward other staff members and constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus' lawyer, Jean Manning, said 36 staff members had signed
and delivered a petition to the senator complaining about how they
were treated by Ms. Niedermeier. Many senior staff members
threatened to resign if Ms. Niedermeier remained, Ms. Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint by Ms. Niedermeier, 47, was filed with the
Congressional Office of Compliance. It says that Baucus, 57, made
sexually related comments to her and suggested that they have a
relationship and take a trip together. There was no accusation that
Baucus had improperly touched her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Niedermeier also said the senator would not give her access
to some personal belongings that were in the office when she was
dismissed, including e-mail messages that she said would prove her
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manning, the Senate's chief counsel for employment, said of
these accusations: ``She is absolutely false. She makes up her
facts as she goes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Baucus, who has been married for 16 years, is in his fourth term
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Niedermeier became the senator's chief of staff in May 1998.
A Democrat, she ran twice for Congress from Connecticut. She was
defeated in 1986 by Stewart McKinney, a Republican, and after
McKinney died, she was defeated in 1987 by another Republican, Rep.
Christopher Shays. Ms. Niedermeier had never run a congressional
office before Baucus hired her.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, said Ms. Niedermeier, who
is single, had never before filed a sexual harassment complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Niedermeier's complaint against Baucus was filed under the
Congressional Accountability Act, which went into effect in 1996.
The law calls for a mandatory mediation period. If the case cannot
be resolved, Ms. Niedermeier can then sue in U.S. District Court or
request arbitration by a neutral party, typically a retired judge.
</P>
<P>
   R. Gaull Silberman, executive director of the Office of
Compliance, said that complaints were confidential and that she
could not say how many other lawmakers had been accused of
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent case that has come to light involved Sen. Bob
Packwood, an Oregon Republican who resigned in 1995 in the face of
sexual harassment charges.

EUROPEANS MAKE THEIR POINT, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The little team that couldn't warmed up to
the bright autumn sunshine, rising breezes, and emotion of the
moment of Friday's first day of the 33d Ryder Cup Matches at The
Country Club. This was a European team laced with rookies stacked
up against a US team thought by many to be the best to ever suit up
for this biennial international spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   What unfolded as darkness set in after 12 hours of splendid
match-play competition was astonishing. This rag-tag band of
Europeans, widely regarded as interlopers on the world stage
dominated by the likes of Tiger Woods and David Duval, reared up to
seize a 6-2 lead entering Saturday's second go in the
foursome/four-ball matches before Sunday's 12 singles showdowns
determine whether Euro captain Mark James has the grandest time of
it in Greater Boston since the Tea Party.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this for openers. Sergio Garcia, the precocious teenage
Spaniard, earned 2 points in his partnership with Jesper Parnevik
of Sweden. Woods had played in seven matches in his two Ryder Cup
appearances and has earned just 1 1/2 points. The Spanish armada of
Garcia, Miguel Angel Jiminez, and Jose Maria Olazabal accounted for
more points (3 1/2) than the entire US team. Jiminez was an
assistant captain two years ago, Garcia was 17, and Olazabal was
returning from a foot ailment that nearly did him in.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Darren Clarke, who once won the All Ireland
championship as a rising amateur out of the border town of
Dungannon. When he holed a 7-foot birdie putt on the historic 17th
hole to send partner Lee Westwood and himself on the way to a 1-up
victory over Woods and Duval, it said it all. Westood proceeded to
ice it on the 18th when chipped within a foot for a gimme par.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago at Valderrama, Spain, the Europeans built a 4
1/2-3 1/2 edge after the rain-interrupted first day. But 6-2? This
was reinforced humiliation for a team split apart by questions of
where the money goes in this PGA of America event. Duval was the
leader of the dissent, and even referred to the matches as little
more than an exhibition. ``Some exhibition,'' Duval heard more than
once from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   There was one moment to arouse the American partisans in a crowd
that exceeded 30,000. Davis Love, whose father played in the 1963
US Open the year before his son was born, made a 30-footer for
birdie on the 18th to halve the Love-Justin Leonard/Colin
Montromerie-Paul Lawrie four-ball match. ``This is the first day of
the proceedings,'' said US captain Ben Crenshaw. ``We're 4 points
down, but they know it's infinitesimally close.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a putting contest, right? This was the consensus at
Valderrama two years ago. The Americans couldn't hit the chips and
sink the putts. This was it again Friday. Phil Mickelson, who made
five birdie putts in his round, missed very makeable birdie putts
on the 16th and 18th holes in the afternoon, and he and Jim Furyk
were beaten 1-up by Garcia anhd Parnevik. The putt on 18 simply
stayed to the right when his blade turned in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no complacency in the camp,'' said James, who played
on seven Ryder Cup teams between 1977 and 1995 and threatened to
make it his eighth trip this time around. ``But it was a day's job
well done. To win 6 points is obviously a big bonus. The matches
were extremely close. Match play is a very volatile type of golf. I
certainly wouldn't dream of suggesting we were the superior side.''
He was asked about the mood of his team. ``I would think,'' said
James, ``we're somewhat chuffed.''
</P>
<P>
   There were three of the captain's picks who didn't play. Steve
Pate of the US, and Andrew Coltart of Europe out of Scotland.
Ireland's Padraig Harrington was sit down to enable Olazabal to
play. The US sat down Tom Lehman after he and Woods bowed to Garcia
and Parnevik, 2 and 1, in the alternate-shot competition. Of the
European rookies, Coltart, Jarmo Sandelin of Sweden, and Jean Van
de Velde of France didn't play and aren't in this morning's lineup.
Pate and Mark O'Meara were the only US players not to participate,
but they are in this morning's alternate-shot pairings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to instill a belief in ourselves,'' said Crenshaw.
``Our guys played well. Things will happen in match play.'' They
did. Parnevik holed from 135 yards on the eighth hole, and Woods
just saw his putt for eagle break the wrong way for an eagle on the
Par 5 14th. ``Things are going our way,'' said Olazabal. ``There
aren't much I can make about it. We tried to play our best. I think
most of the guys were relaxed or have been very relaxed all week
long. There was no change this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed to be walking in each other's footsteps,'' said
Montgomerie, who was the hero of the 14 1/2-13 1/2 victory at
Valderrama that was the Europeans' second straight in the
competition that began at Worcester CC in 1927. ``We were enjoying
the experiencee. What an event this is. Is there anything else like
it in sport? I've never known a team to be so tegether as this one.
There are still two days to go however, and the Colonialists did
wind up making the most noise at the Tea Party, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was inspired play on our side,'' said Crenshaw.
``I was very confident of our pairings. I'd do the same thing
again. They played wonderful golf. The bottom line is 6-2 doesn't
indicate, really, what I saw today. I think all of us who know this
game, know the hardest thing for any Ryder Cup participant to do is
to play your game. That's what makes it so special. The hardest
thing to do is trust, trust your game in this arena.''

NOVELISTS GET BACK AT HOLLYWOOD, MOSTLY GENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The idea of the work of a great novelist being
destroyed by Hollywood is something of a cliche in American
culture. But in fact, most of the writers on an Authors Guild
Foundation panel at the Ethical Culture Society on Thursday night
seemed quite happy to take the money and run.
</P>
<P>
   They included Scott Turow, Russell Banks and Walter Mosley, as
well as the screenwriter Stephen Schiff, who adapted Vladimir
Nabokov's ``Lolita'' for the screen and has made a career of
performing that kind of surgery. The lone holdout of the group was
E.L. Doctorow, the author of ``Ragtime,'' which Milos Forman turned
into a film in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Doctorow arrived with ``a bill of indictments,'' as he put it.
There was his novel ``Welcome to Hard Times,'' made into a movie
starring Henry Fonda, ``the second-worst film ever made,'' Doctorow
said. (The worst, said Doctorow, was ``Swamp Fire,'' with Johnny
Weissmuller.) Then there was ``Ragtime,'' ``a brilliant movie for
the first 10 minutes, but unfortunately it goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   The only film of his novels that he ever liked, Doctorow said,
was ``Daniel,'' made into a movie by Sidney Lumet in 1983, for
which Doctorow wrote the screenplay. But ``that was one of the
great commercial disasters of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, the author of the Easy Rawlins detective-novel series,
whose book ``Devil in a Blue Dress'' was made into a movie starring
Denzel Washington, confessed that he didn't mind the little
violations of his creative work, because of the money he has made.
``I guess to me everything is about money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devil'' was made at a cost of some $35 million, he said. So
when he was told that a darker-skinned Denzel Washington could not
kiss the lighter-skinned female lead, Jennifer Lopez, ``for fear
we're going to lose Alabama,'' Mosley said: ``I would think, `Maybe
Denzel could think about kissing her.' He's a good actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Turow, whose novel ``Presumed Innocent'' was turned into a movie
starring Harrison Ford in 1990, didn't feel he had been mangled at
all by Hollywood. ``There are many novelists who live on movie
options,'' he said. ``God bless 'em. I'm glad somebody's supporting
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are the art form of capitalism,'' Turow said. ``If you
don't like it, don't cash the check.'' Still, he acknowledged,
there is always that little sinking feeling when you see your work
adapted by another person up on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered seeing the trailer of ``Presumed Innocent,'' which
was directed by Alan Pakula. ``The sense of it was very much as I
had imagined it,'' he said. ``The dialogue was lifted straight out
of the novel. The players were really good.'' Still, ``a little
voice went off inside me _ `No! No! The camera's on the wrong side
of the room!'''
</P>
<P>
   The novelist whose book becomes a movie should feel lucky, not
only to get the money, Turow indicated, but also because in the
end, ``every writer dreams of telling a story that moves a vast
audience,'' and film, of course, is the medium for that.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, ``speaking as a serial mangler,'' said he wanted to
point out that in adapting a screenplay from a novel, ``99 percent
of the time'' the premise is taken from a mediocre work. Sometimes
when he adapts a novel for the screen, Schiff said, he feels like
an old-fashioned book editor, the kind that used to actually edit
novels. He condenses things, he gives the book more of a plot. And
then, he said, he gets to watch his own artistic production get
mangled by the director.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he said, the screenplay doesn't belong to the
screenwriter at all. It belongs to the director. ``Somewhere a
dear, brilliant novelist is saying, `What are you doing to my
novel?' I want to say, `The sausage factory is worse than you
think.'''
</P>
<P>
   All the writers on the panel were candid about liking the
considerable money they have earned by selling their books to
Hollywood. Ernest Hemingway advised novelists to drive to the
California border, ``and let them throw the money over the line,
then throw the book back,'' said Russell Banks, whose books
``Affliction'' and ``The Sweet Hereafter'' have been turned into
films. But ``I'm a writer of fiction who likes money and loves
movies,'' he said. Banks has reason to be happy. Both movies were
critical successes and earned money.
</P>
<P>
   The key to a successful adaptation of a novel into film, several
members of the panel said, may lie in the budget, but not the way
one might think. ``The reason I think those films turned out to be
successful was because they were made for as little money as they
were,'' Banks said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled Paul Schrader, the director of ``Affliction,''
telling him that ``somewhere around $14 million you put white hats
on the good guys and black hats on the bad guys.'' But with a lower
budget, he said, ``you can still have ambiguity, explore things
that are painful to many people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The critic Molly Haskell, the evening's moderator, said she
believed that the difference between high and low art was not as
great as it once was in American culture. The climate in the movie
industry is more receptive to good adaptations, she said. Gone are
the days when movies had to have a happy ending, like that of the
1927 film ``Love,'' an adaptation of ``Anna Karenina'' starring
Greta Garbo in which Anna doesn't throw herself under a train at
the end, as she does in Tolstoy's novel.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final analysis, books and film are two different
languages, Banks said. To compare the two is ``like comparing
pottery and stained glass.'' Besides, he added, ``one exists in
real time, the other exists in mental time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Books think and films behave,'' Doctorow said. ``You're always
looking in on a film, watching people think. As a moviegoer, it is
an act of inference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear some acceptance among my cherished colleagues about the
demands of film,'' he said. ``I don't think we should agree so
readily that this is the way it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As he looks into the future, Doctorow said, he feels quite
gloomy. ``I can see a culture of pictograms rather than of
language.'' Still, he said, ``if people ask, `When your new book
comes out, will you sell it to the movies?' _ of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very little personal character,'' he said, and ``almost
no morality.''

CAR'S GAS PEDAL TO BE EXAMINED AFTER FATAL MIDTOWN CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The gas pedal of the car that plowed into a midtown
Manhattan restaurant on Thursday night, killing one and injuring
21, might have been stuck, investigators said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Marcia Feltingoff, 51, of West New York, N.J., has
not been charged. She tested negative for alcohol on Thursday
night, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual involved said her accelerator was stuck,''
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Friday at a news conference.
``We are having a mechanical inspection done of the car to
determine if that is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who was killed, Siril Trucl, 62, of Fort Lee, N.J., was
at Arno Ristorante at 141 West 38th St. for a business dinner at
8:20 p.m. when the car crashed through the plate glass window and
continued 30 feet into the restaurant, striking people at the bar
and at tables, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Trucl, the owner of a textiles company, moved to the United
States in the early 1980s from Slovenia, which was at the time a
part of Yugoslavia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Trucl died on the way to St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical
Center of New York, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city Medical Examiner's
office, said Trucl died of blunt impact trauma to his torso and
internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Examiner's office has ruled Trucl's death an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   If police investigators find evidence of negligence, Ms.
Feltingoff could be charged with vehicular homicide, but officials
said that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Ms. Feltingoff's car, a 1993 Mercedes, shot
through the wooden arm of a gate in the parking garage across the
street as soon as Ms. Feltingoff released the parking brake, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Trucl, the car struck 21 other people who were sitting
at tables and in the bar of the restaurant before crashing into a
concrete planter at the back wall of the restaurant, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Accident Investigation Unit of the Police Department test
drove Ms. Feltingoff's car Friday and did not uncover any problems,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics are scheduled to examine the car on Monday. &QL;

AMERICANS' CHANCES APPEAR DIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The Europeans not only far outscored the
Americans Friday, they did so much psychological damage that US
captain Ben Crenshaw may have to play the role of psychiatrist if
the hosts are to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who look so good on paper, seemed to wilt under
the pressure. The problems were epitomized by the failure of Tiger
Woods and David Duval, ranked No. 1 and 2 in the world,
respectively, to contribute any points. Indeed, as darkness
enveloped The Country Club, Woods and Duval seemed to be worn out
physically and mentally, hitting some poor shots on the final
holes.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, by contrast, seemed to thrive on the pressure and
team aspect of the Ryder Cup. With six birdies, Darren Clarke
almost singlehandedly defeated Woods and Duval. When he temporarily
faltered on the back nine, his struggling partner, Lee Westwood,
stepped up with a birdie and two crucial pars to hold Woods and
Duval at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw seemed stunned by the lopsided 6-2 score. ``I can't
believe we're looking at a 4-point difference here,'' he said. ``I
just don't think, at least from my position, that it indicates how
people played today. My team thought that they played very well.''
</P>
<P>
   At a team meeting after play, Crenshaw said the players were
unified. ``This team is together,'' he said. ``It's great to see.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear the Americans were struggling to come up with a
way to turn things around. Crenshaw scrambled for Saturday's
morning matches, trying to find a chemistry that might work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crenshaw insisted the tide could turn if some putts would
just drop. ``It's just frustrating,'' he said. ``I don't think it
would take much at all for it to go the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   European captain Mark James said Friday's match wins boosted his
team's confidence, but acknowledged the tide could shift. ``Six to
2 sounds like a lot, but it's only a 4-point lead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the psychological impact of the Clarke-Westwood victory
over Woods and Duval, James said, ``I don't think they're ones to
suffer lasting psychological damage.''
</P>
<P>
   While Crenshaw's decisions for the morning pairings were
difficult, James made it sound as if selecting partners was a snap.
``It's an easy team to pair,'' he said. ``None of their countries
are at war with each other, which is a big help.''

GIRL, 10, HOPES FLAVOR WILL PROVE (ICE) CREAM OF THE CROP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Her flavor shook out California CheeseQuake. It
86'd 49er's Gold Nugget Crunch. And it made mincemeat of Mother
Lode a la Mode.
</P>
<P>
   Now all 10-year-old ice cream inventor Elysa Hill has to do is
outsell one more newly minted ice cream and her frozen homage to
California will be enshrined in freezer cases from Redding to
Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery stores began selling Gold Miner's Dream this week,
straight from the recipe Elysa submitted to Dreyer's Grand Ice
Cream earlier this year. It's made of mountains of chocolate and
vanilla swirl blazoned with trails of rich milk chocolate and
caramel with hidden toffee nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's has shipped tens of thousands of quarts of Gold Miner's
Dream to stores across the state, where it will stay until November
as the public decides whether it is among the creme de la creams
and worthy of being immortalized by being added to Dreyer's
half-gallon line.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Elysa's cream, if it rises, will also become
Dreyer's official flavor of the California Sesquicentennial. ``This
is !ital!really!off! cool,'' said Elysa, a fifth-grader at Woodlake
Avenue Elementary School in suburban Woodland Hills in L.A.'s San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Elysa's career as an ice cream developer started in the spring,
when her teacher at Woodlake, Verdell Gurnee, passed out contest
entry blanks to her class, which had been studying the California
Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   All entries had to include a creative name and description of
the flavor, somehow based on how the flavor represents the state of
California, and it had to be a flavor the company could produce on
a mass scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea was to have Californians of all ages participate,''
said Jenifer Howard, spokeswoman for Union City, Calif.,-based
Dreyer's. ``But we were really surprised by how many children
submitted entries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elysa brought the sheet home,'' said her mom, Doreen Hill,
``and it looked pretty interesting. We're big ice cream eaters.''
</P>
<P>
   With a half-scoop of encouragement from mom, Elysa sat down on
the family computer and batted out the recipe _ no rewrites, no
corrections. ``I just kinda sent it in and forgot all about it,''
Elysa said.
</P>
<P>
   Doreen Hill had forgotten, too, until a Federal Express letter
jarred her memory. It arrived two days before school let out for
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it had to be good news,'' said Doreen Hill. ``I saw who
the sender was. I drove to her school with it and we opened it
together in her class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Elysa,'' the letter read. ``Congratulations. We at
Dryer's Grand Ice Cream are thrilled to inform you that your recent
flavor submission in our Flavor of California program was selected
as one of the ten finalists. Now the fun really begins.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Oh my God,' I thought,'' said Elysa. ``We're going to San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer flew Elysa and her mother to the Bay Area for a bake, er,
freeze-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was thrilling,'' said Doreen Hill. ``They put us up at the
Waterfront Plaza Hotel in Jack London Square. They held a reception
for us where we met the company's marketing people and Dreyer's
official taste-taster.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 finalists _ five kids and five adults _ were presented
with personalized lab coats and fitted with hair nets and hard
hats. Then they were loaded into a special bus and whisked to the
company's Union City plant where the mother and daughter were given
a tour and put through a tasting seminar, where they were given
tips from the taster.
</P>
<P>
   After a special luncheon, the inventors were handed their
individual ingredients. Small batches of ice cream were made and
judged.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for the judging, no punches were pulled, said
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judging did get a little intense,'' said Howard. ``People
are very serious about this. One of the things we stressed was
balance, a flavor shouldn't be screaming caramel, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   When they announced the final results at a banquet that evening,
said Elysa, ``they started with No. 10, and when they reached No.
5, I was like, `OK, when are they going to call me?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When they announced No. 3, since I hadn't been called yet, we
were like, `Oh my God! I won!'''
</P>
<P>
   The first- and second-place winners are now having their flavors
test-marketed throughout the state. A telephone and Internet voting
survey, along with sales figures, will determine which flavor is
cream of the crop.
</P>
<P>
   Elysa has been exchanging e-mails with second-place winner
Jessica Lack, 12, creator of Hooray for Hollywood, a star-studded
Vanilla ice cream swirled with caramel, star-shaped semi-sweet
chocolate pieces and loaded with nuts. Jessica lives in Walnut
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Gold Miner's Dream and Hooray for Hollywood) flavors have
been selling like mad,'' said Dreyer's spokeswoman Diane McIntyre.
``We just ordered a new run. We foresee between 90,000 and 100,000
quarts will be sold through the end of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dreyer's sent her family a shipment, packed in dry
ice, of what her ice cream would look, feel and taste like as it
went to supermarkets throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be in the stores,'' she said. ``Before
that, my best friends were looking out for it whenever they went to
the store. They were, like, `We can't find the ice cream!'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, everyone she knows is helping her reach the peak of ice
cream immortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends and everyone in my family are all voting once a day
(the maximum allowable),'' says Elysa.
</P>
<P>
   To vote, click on the carton on www.dreyers.com or call your
vote in at (877) 358-7225. Otherwise, just buying the flavor will
automatically trigger a vote.

Four-ball Match 4 
Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke, Europe, def. Tiger Woods and David
Duval, United States, 1 up. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The putt on the 17th hole had a right-to-left
break and needed to cover seven feet of pure pressure. Which must
have been news to Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood, those golfing
mates from Northern Ireland and England.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at the line together, somehow found humor in it, and
laughed heartily. To the side, Tiger Woods and David Duval stood
side-by-side, stone-faced and somber as Clarke stroked his birdie
attempt. When it fell, America's dynamic duo grew even more
stone-faced and somber, one down going to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood made that lead stand up with a brilliant third shot at
the 18th, pitching to the lip of the cup from heavy rough above the
left, front bunker. The 1-up, four-ball victory completed a
shocking 6-2 first-day advantage for the Europeans, and sent the
world's two best players to the locker room a battered and beaten
duo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a long, grueling, and most miserable day for
Woods and Duval, who had been counted upon to anchor an outstanding
four-ball session. Instead, the anchors went down with the ship in
a falling darkness that brought out a loud, boisterous crowd. They
were not showering Woods and Duval with hugs and kisses, either.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they would have expected them, for a day of promise had
ended with stunning disappointment for America's dynamic duo. While
Clarke was responsible for most of the punishment (he made six
birdies, one matching a Woods birdie at the eighth, one matching a
Duval birdie at the ninth, and that winning birdie at 17), the
Americans never made things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Woods did make five birdies, though one of them didn't feel like
one. It came on the par 5 14th, a hole that was being eaten alive
in the four-ball. ``My missed eagle putt,'' said Woods, when asked
about the key to the match. He had it inside of 10 feet, with the
match even _ and Westwood already conceded a birdie _ but missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make the putt, we go 1-up and things might have turned
out a little differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, though that could bring us down a road that would
have to offer this: If Duval had been on his game, things might
have turned out a little differently, too. Unfortunately, he
wasn't, not in the morning, and not from the opening bell of the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It started inexplicably on the first hole, Duval missing the
green with a 6-iron from 160 yards and it ended in even more of a
mystery, his indifferent approach to the 17th green from 122 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Duval was still smarting from the short putt he had
missed at 16, like Woods's at 14, a putt that could have produced a
lead, but his balloon of a 9-iron into the 17th is yet another
entry in a litany of mishaps at that marvelous dogleft left.
Duval's shot hit in the middle of a dastardly slope, and spun back.
Which would have been OK had the pin not been up on the back tier,
45 feet away, a spot Clarke got to with a wedge from 90 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``David tried as hard as he could try today,'' said captain Ben
Crenshaw, an hour after Duval had stumbled his way up 18 in a
desperate attempt to salvage at least a half-point. But he drove it
well right, pushed his approach into the thick stuff right of the
green, and fluffed his third shot.
</P>
<P>
   As Crenshaw spoke, he had already made the decision _ most
likely with Duval's blessing _ to keep the embattled star out of
Saturday's matches. ``He was just a beat off. It just didn't happen
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, not when Woods needed him to jump in.
</P>
<P>
   At the 11th, for instance, when Woods plugged his approach into
jail, the thick grass over-hanging a brutal bunker 10 yards from
the green. Duval, who made just two birdies (one of which was
matched, one of which came on a hole Woods also birdied) then
ripped a 5-iron into that same grass.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dinging and donging, they had plugged and plugged
deeper, and as they tried to figure out whose ball was whom's,
Woods and Duval were slapped by Clarke's fifth birdie of the day on
No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   That more than offset the brilliant shot by Woods at the 10th,
an impossible chip-in off hardpan from behind a green that ran away
from him.
</P>
<P>
   Woods's birdies at 12 and 14 (matched by Westwood) couldn't even
inspire Duval, whose drive at the 15th crossed the road and settled
in rough, 120 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   It may as well have been 1,120 yards away with the way things
were going, for Duval's approach drifted right into a greenside
bunker. Another bad shot in a day that had too many of them for the
US players to comprehend.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has chosen one of the
nation's leading experts on AIDS policy to run Medicaid, the health
insurance program for poor people and the disabled, administration
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The expert, Timothy Westmoreland, a 45-year-old lawyer, said he
would begin work on Oct. 18 as director of the Center for Medicaid
and State Operations, a unit of the Department of Health and Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid finances health care for more than 35 million people,
using $107 billion of federal money and $82 billion in state money
this year. But the program has often been neglected by federal
policy-makers, who devote far more attention to Medicare, the
health insurance program for elderly people and some of the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland will also supervise the Children's Health Insurance
Program, created in 1997 to provide coverage for uninsured children
not eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1995 Westmoreland worked for Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., on the staff of the health subcommittee of the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce. Westmoreland worked on
legislation affecting a wide range of programs and agencies,
including Medicaid and Medicare, family planning, mental health,
childhood immunizations and the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But his most important role was to make lawmakers aware of the
AIDS epidemic and to get money for AIDS research at a time when few
people understood the disease and the Reagan administration
resisted additional spending
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get members of Congress to respond to AIDS as
public health authorities and biomedical researchers encouraged
them to do,'' Westmoreland said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Shilts, a historian of the epidemic, wrote in 1987 that
Westmoreland had worked on AIDS ``longer than just about anyone on
Capitol Hill,'' starting with reports of the first cases, in 1981,
in Waxman's district. Westmoreland recently wrote a treatise on
Medicaid and AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid now finances care for at least half of all people with
AIDS in the United States and is the largest source of money for
that purpose, providing $3.9 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Westmoreland may help the administration expand
Medicaid to cover low-income people who have been infected with the
virus that causes AIDS, but have not shown symptoms of the disease.
Vice President Al Gore said in 1997 that such coverage could save
lives and might save money.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid pays medical bills for two-thirds of all nursing-home
residents, for most welfare recipients and for millions of people
who recently left welfare. In addition, it pays for one-third of
all births in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Westmoreland's biggest challenge is to get more children
enrolled in Medicaid and in the new health insurance program for
children. Administration officials said that more than 6 million
children were eligible for the two programs but had not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Clinton said he was disappointed with the slow pace of
enrollment in the new program. Gore said this month that he wanted
to expand the program to cover many more children and uninsured
working parents as well.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Westmoreland, by the secretary of health and
human services, Donna Shalala, was cleared by the White House and
does not need Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland, a graduate of Duke University and Yale Law School,
has been a senior policy fellow at the Georgetown University Law
Center since 1995.

CITY TO COMB FILES IN BID TO MAKE WELFARE APPLICANTS GET
TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is
planning to search thousands of medical billing records for
evidence it can use to place welfare applicants in drug and alcohol
treatment programs as a condition of receiving public assistance,
city welfare officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be culled from computerized Medicaid
insurance bills submitted in the past on behalf of applicants who
have voluntarily sought treatment for drug and alcohol problems.
The record search is for the applicants' own good, welfare
officials said this week, and will be used to push them to finish
treatment and to get jobs faster.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that record checks are needed because the city's
current system of drug screening and testing is finding
unrealistically low rates of substance abuse among welfare mothers
who need help.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy experts and lawyers for the poor say the record
search may violate a federal law protecting the confidentiality of
drug and alcohol treatment records. They contend that the city's
plan will frighten poor people from seeking treatment or benefits
and will send a chilling message to anyone considering help for
drug or alcohol problems.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, privacy experts say, is a classic example of the
conflict between public concern over the loss of privacy,
especially in health care records, and public support for using
computer databases to monitor or track suspect groups, like welfare
recipients, illegal immigrants and parents who fail to pay child
support.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they have not received official
notification of the plan. ``But there are confidentiality
provisions in New York's Medicaid plan, and we expect them to be
followed,'' said Christopher Peacock, spokesman for the Federal
Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid
records.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Turner, commissioner of the city's Human Resources
Administration, said no breach of confidentiality would be involved
because the billing records to be checked are submitted by drug and
alcohol treatment providers to the city's Medicaid office, and both
Medicaid and public assistance fall under his agency. ``These are
our own records,'' he said. ``We are not interfering with the
doctor-patient relationship. We're helping poor people here.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the poor who support treatment as a condition
of aid say the record search crosses the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people go into treatment thinking their records are
confidential and then, lo and behold, the information is illegally
disclosed, that will upset just about everybody,'' said Paul
Samuels, a lawyer and the director of the Legal Action Center, a
nonprofit advocacy organization. ``Violating confidentiality is an
ambush that will drive many people away from treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   No starting date has been set to search the records. The plan is
one of several new measures introduced by Turner as he is striving
to meet a deadline set by Giuliani, who vowed last year that by the
year 2000, ``New York will be the first city in the nation, on its
own, to end welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, whose welfare overhaul is expected to be a centerpiece
of his likely campaign for the U.S. Senate, did not mean an end to
public assistance, Turner stressed. The mayor meant that all adult
recipients would be moving from welfare to work through a variety
of steps, including treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, which is
a barrier to employment, Turner said.

YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY IN OREGON SCHOOL SHOOTING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Just days before his trial was to begin, Kipland P.
Kinkel, the Oregon teen-ager who went on a shooting rampage last
year, killing his parents and then two students at his school,
abandoned his insanity defense on Friday and pleaded guilty to the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted at a trial, Kinkel, who was 15 years old at the
time of the shootings and is now 17, could have faced life in
prison without any chance of parole.
</P>
<P>
   He will now be sentenced by a judge, who could give the
teen-ager as little as 25 years in prison or add on 7{ years for
each of the 26 counts of attempted murder he faced for shooting up
his school cafeteria a year ago last May and later attacking a
detective.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, in a courtroom in Eugene, Ore., Kinkel signed a
plea agreement, initialing ``KK'' next to each paragraph. One read,
in part: ``My mind is clear and I am not sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkel thus confessed to killing 16-year-old Ben Walker and
Mikael Nickolauson, 17, wounding 22 students and shooting at three
other students at Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore., after
he had killed his parents, Bill and Faith Kinkel, at his home. He
also confessed to attacking the detective after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, 1998, minutes before the morning bell rang, Kinkel
started firing a semiautomatic rifle, spraying the cafeteria with
about 50 rounds in a minute and a half before some of the students
managed to wrestle him to the floor. There were 300 to 400 students
in the cafeteria at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Taken to jail, Kinkel attacked the detective with a knife taped
to his leg, and later begged police officers: ``Just kill me. Just
shoot me.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings in Oregon were part of a series of killings in
schools by students in the last two years that have shocked and
sickened people across the country. It followed similar shootings
in Pearl, Miss., West Paducah, Ky., and Jonesboro, Ark., and
preceded by a year the killing of 12 students and a teacher at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. The two gunmen, both
students, then killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkel was briefly placed on suicide watch after the Columbine
shootings, with law-enforcement officials at his jail saying he
blamed himself for what he believed was a copycat crime.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom in Eugene on Friday was full of survivors of the
shooting and relatives of the two students who were killed. Among
those attending was a Thurston student, Tony Case, who was shot
twice in the back and once in the leg during the rampage, and who
later told a throng of reporters outside the courtroom that he was
partly relieved to be spared the ordeal of a trial, and partly
disappointed to be deprived of the answers it might have brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'd like to know, you know, why he did it,'' Case
said. ``Really, we're never going to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what sentence he believes his former schoolmate deserved,
Case said: ``Anywhere over 75, 80 years, he's probably not going to
live to get out of prison. So anything along that line is quite
enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   F. Douglass Harcleroad, the Lane County district attorney, said
outside the courtroom Friday morning that the plea was ``the best
thing for the community'' but he declined to discuss specifics of
how the plea was reached, citing a judge's order preventing lawyers
from discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Harcleroad said survivors would be able to speak in court before
Kinkel was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon has a death penalty law, but because Kinkel was only 15
at the time of the shooting he was not eligible to be sentenced to
execution.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the teen-ager's reasons for his violent rampage
remain unfathomable. According to court papers, he told police
investigators that he felt he had ``no choice'' but to kill, and he
later elaborated to psychiatrist: ``I had to be 100 percent. No one
is perfect, though. Lots of times, life sucked. With my parents, if
I didn't do the best, I was an embarrassment to my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   And at a court hearing earlier this year, Alan Warthen, a police
detective, said: ``When he was explaining how he killed his mother
_ he just went off. He started talking about a voice in his head.
He started banging his head against the wall a couple of times. I
put my hand on his shoulder and said, `Kip, calm down.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkel's lawyers had indicated that they planned to argue in
court that he bore diminished responsibility for the shootings
because he was mentally deranged. With his signature on the plea
Friday, Kinkel abandoned that defense. Had he been found not guilty
by reason of insanity, he would have been committed to a mental
hospital until he was no longer deemed a threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing, which has not yet been scheduled, will be determined
by Judge Jack Mattison of Lane County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing, which has not yet been scheduled, will be determined
by Lane County Circuit Court Judge Jack Mattison. In the plea
announced Friday, prosecutors said they would recommend that the
murder sentences run concurrently, and that they would take no
position on whether the sentences for attempted murder should run
consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   With the trial scheduled to start next Monday, lawyers for
Kinkel had argued in recent days that tapes of Kinkel's jailhouse
conversations with relatives, friends and ministers should not be
allowed as trial evidence. Prosecutors had defended the recordings
and their use in a trial: ``There is no expectation of privacy in a
jail setting,'' Assistant District Attorney Kent Mortimore argued.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the judge did approve a defense motion for a
delay in the trial until September, saying he wanted to ``get it
done once and get it done right.''

BENNETT TRIES FOR PROPER MINDSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ Drew Bennett, UCLA's
starter-turned-reserve-turned-starter-again, leads the Bruins today
in their Pac-10 Conference opener against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But which Bennett _ the inconsistent, anxiety-filled quarterback
of Boise State and Ohio State, or the calm, effective quarterback
of Fresno State?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really settled down,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
``He's feeling a little more relaxed, a little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, a junior, was ineffective in his starts against Boise
State and Ohio State, then lost his job to freshman Cory Paus, then
played the game of his career against Fresno State in replacing the
injured Paus and leading the Bruins to a comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's inverted performances _ nervous as the starter, calm
as the reserve _ actually make perfect sense. In the most chaotic
season of Toledo's reign, why should Bennett's psyche be any
different?
</P>
<P>
   Bennett believes Fresno State was a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``To everybody watching, I definitely feel I proved I can be
effective and run the team,'' he said. ``It gave me confidence as a
backup. Coach Toledo told me (after his demotion) that no matter
what happened, I was still valuable to the team. I showed that when
Cory got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins need Bennett at his backup best today against the
first-place Cardinal. UCLA's running game has been ineffective, its
young offensive line has been inconsistent, and its receivers are
hobbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bennett) knows the offense, but now he needs to execute the
offense,'' Toledo said. ``He can't get us beat by throwing bad
interceptions or fumbling. He needs to read the coverages, hit the
open guy and do all the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he needs to imagine himself as the backup.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting foes: Last year, UCLA recruited a talented
tailback from Ontario named Kerry Carter, an elusive 225-pounder
who reminded Toledo of former Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Carter picked Stanford and he'll be in the backfield this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't interested in us,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins and Stanford often compete for prospects. In fact,
two of UCLA's top recruits are from the San Jose area and expected
to attend today's game: receivers Craig Bragg and Tab Perry.
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster stuff: With Brian Poli-Dixon's season-ending injury,
sophomore Jon Dubravac becomes the fourth receiver and walk-on
Devon Reese the fifth. Reserve Cody Joyce is out with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tape delayed: This is the first UCLA game not televised live
since a 35-17 victory over Cal in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: There are two regional broadcast windows available
today, ABC's at 12:30 and Fox Sports Net's at 7:15. As expected,
ABC last week picked the Washington-Colorado game, which left
Oregon-USC for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins then asked Stanford to move kickoff from 2 p.m. to
3:30 so Fox Sports West 2 could show the game in Los Angeles. The
Cardinal declined, because without a local broadcast _ the game is
not available in the Bay Area _ there was no incoming cash to pay
for temporary lights.

RED SOX HEXED BY ORIOLES, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Blame it on the full harvest moon, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   But a year to the night after the Sox clinched a wild-card spot,
a debatable decision by manager Jimy Williams and a base-running
blunder by rookie Donnie Sadler left the Red Sox in neutral Friday
night in their quest to close in on a playoff spot for the second
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a season-high eight strikeouts in seven innings by Bret
Saberhagen, the Sox fell, 1-0, to the Baltimore Orioles at Fenway
Park, stranding a runner on third in the eighth and wasting Jason
Varitek's leadoff double in the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' magic number to clinch a wild-card spot remained at
six, pending the outcome of the Oakland-Texas game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also had some startling news after the game, announcing
that the club had released pitcher Mark Portugal with just eight
games left in the season. Portugal wasn't going to make the club's
postseason roster anyway, but the timing of the decision was highly
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an organizational thing, the best thing to do,''
Williams said tersely. ``I just talked to him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate, Williams said: ``I just told you I released
him, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams elected to send rookie Brian Daubach, the Belleville
Basher who has been on life support for the last five weeks, to
pinch hit for Darren Lewis with Jon Nunnally on third and two on
and two out in the eighth. Nunnally, who pinch hit for Wilton
Veras, reached safely on a third-strike wild pitch to open the
inning, the kind of opportunistic play that often turns a game
around.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, who has just two hits in 30 at-bats this month and nine
hits since he last showed a flair for the dramatic with a
game-winning double Aug. 16, battled Orioles reliever Scott
Kamieniecki through a nine-pitch at-bat. But he was rung up by
third-base umpire Doug Cederstrom, who ruled Daubach swung at a
1-and-2 pitch when he tried to hold up.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, after Varitek hit an 0-and-2 pitch from Mike
Timlin high off the wall in left-center for a double, Williams
inserted Sadler to pinch run. The next batter, Nomar Garciaparra,
hit a ball sharply to shortstop Mike Bordick. Sadler, however,
sprinted for third and was an easy out for Bordick, who flipped to
third baseman Jeff Reboulet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a critical base-running mistake,'' Sadler said. ``The
next guy didn't get a hit, but he could have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake on my part. I can score just as easily from
second as I can from third.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said he watched Reboulet break for the ball (``I looked
him in the eye,'' Sadler said) and credited the Orioles third
baseman for retreating to the bag when he saw Sadler break.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things you have to think about,'' Williams said of
Sadler's decision. ``You learn those things from experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who threw 90 pitches in his longest outing since he
went eight innings Aug. 11 at Kansas City, came up a loser when
B.J. Surhoff doubled to open the fourth _ his 200th hit of the
season _ took third when Albert Belle lined out to right, and
scored on a single by Derrick May.
</P>
<P>
   A terrific running catch by Troy O'Leary in left-center with
Ryan Minor on second in the fifth kept the Orioles from adding to
their lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-0 loss was the first suffered by the Red Sox at Fenway
Park since June 6, 1998, when Bobby Jones of the Mets beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played good tonight. We just didn't score,'' Williams said.
``Two outstanding performances, a 1-0 game in Fenway, you don't
find too many like that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had one chance. A double, a fly ball to right, and a base
hit. I thought Saberhagen pitched great. He pitched his heart
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the eighth, the Red Sox, losers of three in a row, failed
to advance a runner as far as third. Orioles starter Mike Mussina
held the Sox to four hits and a walk in six innings, striking out
eight. His only nervous moment came in the third, when singles by
Reggie Jefferson and Veras gave the Sox runners on first and second
with no out.
</P>
<P>
   But Trot Nixon, after failing to bunt the runners over, struck
out, and Jose Offerman hit a smash that Bordick turned into a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams defended his decision to bat Daubach, even though Scott
Hatteberg, whom he has been using as the designated hitter in the
last week, was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heck of an at-bat,'' Williams said. ``How many did he
foul off, six or seven? I just felt he was the right guy to put up
in that situation.''

EUROPEANS' `WELL DONE' AMERICANS' COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It was a long, long, long day's journey into
golfing hell.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, not if you were a European.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day's job well done,'' declared European captain Mark
James.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well done,'' huh? Such a nice, polite, oh-so-British way to
describe a pistol-whipping.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, ``well-done'' might likewise describe the shaken
Americans in more ways than one. Falling behind, 6-2, in the first
day of Ryder Competition does smack of being left on the grill too
long. And being behind, 6-2, might actually mean done, period,
since a quick perusal of the ol' record book reveals that under
this particular Ryder Cup format (installed for the 1977
get-together) no one has come back from that big a deficit to win
the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's time for all of us holding American passports to
sober up. We have probed and analyzed and theorized about all the
cultural and psychological reasons why the underdog Europeans have
won the 1995 and '97 Cups and are now in possession of this
astounding 6-2 lead after Day One of the '99 affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans can deal with those funny toilets. The Europeans
don't mind paying four bucks a gallon for gas and they cheerfully
ride in those teeny-weeny cars. (They don't know from SUVs). The
Europeans speak about six languages apiece. The Europeans eat
breakfast together, lunch together, dinner together, midnight snack
together and they never forget to send birthday cards to each
other's kids. The Europeans have developed an incredible attraction
to the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it just may be that we have over-thought this. Could it
simply be that these guys are great golfers?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I forgot. The world rankings. We like, you know, dominate.
We have more golfers than everybody else put together. It's right
there _ on paper. Damn. That's the problem. Ben Crenshaw can't get
this thing played on paper. He's got to roust these guys out of
their sumptuous suites at the Four Seasons and drag them here, to
The Country Club, all 7,033 undulating, rock-bound yards of it.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, Captain Ben's boys find themselves facing these
rankings-deprived Europeans. They may not look like much in some
cases. They might be a bit shy of legal drinking age in other
cases. They might not have quite the bulging stock portfolios of
our guys in just about every case. But these guys can play a little
golf.
</P>
<P>
   The standard-bearer is Colin Montgomery. ``I think our players
look to him for leadership and inspiration,'' suggested James, the
deadpan dispenser of one-liners. Monty really does bear a startling
facial resemblance to Bill Parcells, and he's not all that far
behind our beloved Tuna in the waist-line department, either. Monty
kicked the USA butts up and down the course in Valderrama two years
ago, and he picked up 1 1/2 points Friday in the company of fellow
Scot Paul Lawrie, one of James's stable of nerveless Ryder Cup
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Monty isn't even the jiggliest Euro. Take a good look at Darren
Clarke. That's a 38-inch waist if ever there was one. It didn't
seem to impede his swing much in his afternoon match, though. The
Ulsterman hit Tiger Woods and David Duval with six birdies.
Teammate Lee Westwood didn't have to do much more than simply not
screw up, as the rotund Clarke carried the team.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger was 0-2 Friday. He and Tom Lehman also lost a morning
alternate-shot match to Jesper Parnevik and Sergio Garcia. It
wasn't as if Tiger played badly. He did a lot of Tigerish things.
But he certainly didn't intimidate anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing intimidates Sergio, who is now 2-0 lifetime
in Ryder Cup competition. And don't think he doesn't have the
potential to get under Tiger's occasionally thin skin, either. In
just, what, six short months or so Sergio has become the toast of
two continents. Check out the reception he gets stateside. Judging
from the reaction of the local crowd when he walks up a fairway,
you'd think he'd been born in West Roxbury and went to Catholic
Memorial. It was the same thing at Medinah. You would have thought
he had just committed to Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio never allowed Tiger to upstage him in the morning, and
neither did Clarke in the afternoon confrontation. In what had to
be a microcosm of the entire day's proceedings, Tiger sank a rare
(for the day) money putt on No. 8, charging after the ball when it
was approaching the hole and then giving it the patented Tiger
fist-pump as it went in. Clarke responded by sinking a birdie putt
of his own for a halve, embellishing his feat with a modified
Chi-Chi sabre-thrust of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to No. 10. Tiger holes out from atop the green. He gets a
high-five from Clarke's caddie. He gets a handshake from Lee
Westwood's caddie. Clarke observes the whole scene and then birdies
the 11th to negate the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   That typified the day. It was a day of incessant European
one-upsmanship, not to mention a day in which the Europeans
showcased their great skill. Go ahead, laugh at Jesper Parnevik and
his silly up-turned brim and his bizarre diet (you know, the
volcanic dust business). The problem is that Mr. Laugh-Riot sank
the killer clutch putts that eliminated Tiger and Lehman in the
morning and then went out in 29 (with five birdies and an eagle in
the round) during the afternoon. Hah-hah, huh? Oh, yeah, these
Europeans are really fortunate we allow them in this country with
their silly little golf games.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the take-no-prisoners Captain. No
sentimentalist, he. Mr. James doesn't agonize over his selections.
What works, works. He will be sending out the same pairings
Saturday morning he did Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   When will any of us ever learn? We should know: when in doubt,
get back to basics. The reason the Europeans do so well when they
play against the Americans is that they are very, very good.

ROBERT G. HEATH, 84, RESEARCHER INTO THE CAUSES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert G. Heath, a physician and medical researcher at
Tulane University who was best known for his ground-breaking work
on schizophrenia, died on Tuesday at his home in St. Petersburg,
Fla. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, Heath found a protein antibody called taraxein in the
blood of schizophrenics that was capable of inducing
schizophrenic-like symptoms in monkeys and healthy human
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The finding was controversial because it was early evidence that
schizophrenia is of biochemical origin and not, as was widely
believed at the time, related to childhood or other emotional
traumas.
</P>
<P>
   Heath also provided a footnote to investigations in the 1970s
concerning the Central Intelligence Agency's use of private
institutions in a secret effort to develop mind-control techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Heath said, a doctor for the agency approached him
while he was doing experiments on pleasure centers in the brain,
and asked if he would be interested in exploring the ``pain
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath called the request ``abhorrent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to be a spy, I'd be a spy,'' he said in an
interview in The New York Times in 1977. ``I wanted to be a doctor
and practice medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Galbraith Heath was born in Pittsburgh on May 9, 1915. He
earned bachelor's and medical degrees at the University of
Pittsburgh. He also trained in neurology and was chief resident at
the Neurological Institute in New York and in psychiatry at the
Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. After two years in the
military, he returned to New York to the College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Columbia University, where he earned a doctorate in
neurophysiological research and certification in psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, he founded and became the first chairman of the
department of psychiatry and neurology at Tulane, a post he held
until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Tulane in 1985, and the
Heath Chair in Psychiatry and Neurology was established at Tulane
the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Heath was the author of numerous books, including ``Exploring
the Mind-Brain Relationship'' (Moran Printing, Baton Rouge, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Eleanor; four daughters, Anne
Stronach, of Wilson, N.C., Sharon King, of Scituate, Mass., Barbara
Boucek, of St. Petersburg, and Carole Brammer, of Baton Rouge, La.;
a son, Robert G. Heath Jr., of Tampa, Fla.; 12 grandchildren; and
one great-grandchild.

BAPTISTS' EVANGELISM CONCERNS JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a polite but pointed exchange of letters over the
last two days, a Jewish organization in New York has protested the
decision by the president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the
nation's largest Protestant denomination, to help convene a
conference in Manhattan on evangelizing Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, between the convention president, the Rev. Paige
Patterson, and Philip D. Abramowitz, director of the Task Force on
Missionaries and Cults, of the Jewish Community Relations Council
of New York Inc., were exchanged as Patterson arrived to take part
in the conference, titled, ``To the Jew First in the New
Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering has disturbed Jewish groups like the task force
because the event brings together prominent evangelical Protestant
academic figures and leaders of ``messianic Jewish'' organizations,
who say one can be Jewish and accept Jesus as the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the controversy is concern by the task force and
other groups about the use of Jewish religious symbols and a
Christian message by messianic synagogues and other organizations,
a small but increasingly visible movement of Jews and non-Jews who
proclaim a belief in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Abramowitz wrote Patterson to say that the
conference on evangelism was disturbing to Jews, primarily because
it ``promotes the misuse of our most sacred themes and symbols to
the cause of conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the task force understood that Southern Baptists felt a
biblical imperative to convert all people, but he asked the
denomination ``to repent of its embrace of deceptive tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Patterson said it was ``false and reckless'' for the
task force to charge that deception was used as a conversion tool.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 15.8 million-member Southern Baptist denomination
did not support ``deceptive tactics'' to convert Jews, and that
Southern Baptists and other evangelicals were ``about the only
groups on earth who fight for and pray for absolute religious
liberty and freedom from coercion in religious matters,'' a stand
that he said benefited Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the conference comes from a New Testament verse,
Romans 1:16, in which the apostle Paul says, ``For I am not ashamed
of the gospel; it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who
has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussing his participation, Patterson said, ``We can hardly
be faulted for citing the Bible, which we take very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The same verse was printed in a booklet instructing Southern
Baptists on ways to pray for conversion of Jews, which was
distributed by Southern Baptists' International Mission Board
before the Jewish High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   The messianic Jewish movement has its own spiritual leaders,
houses of worship and national associations. David L. Chernoff, the
rabbi of a messianic synagogue in Philadelphia, said there were 250
to 300 messianic synagogues in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The task force has compiled a list of more than 230 such groups
in 37 states. ``If you go into one of these places, you think
you're in a synagogue,'' Abramowitz said. ``They use prayer
shawls.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Miller, the council's executive vice president, said:
``Part of the deception is their interpretation of messianism is
the Christian interpretation. The object is to fog the difference
so that people think they are part of authentic Judaism, but Jesus
is their Lord and Savior.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitch Glaser, a prominent figure in the movement, said its
members believed they had a right to wear skullcaps and use other
religious items in worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we use Jewish symbols is we identify as Jews,''
said Glaser, president of Chosen People Ministries Inc. ``I have as
much a right to the symbols as any other Jewish person.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaser convened the New York conference with Patterson. The
event, which concludes Saturday night, is at Calvary Baptist
Church, 123 West 57th St.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That it is taking place in New York, home to the nation's
largest Jewish population, and overlaps the Jewish festival of
Sukkot has irritated Jewish organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a spiritual salvo that's aimed at the Jewish people,''
said Rabbi A. James Rudin, interreligious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that the Southern Baptist Convention did not want
to offend Jews or anyone else, and that its evangelism was directed
to people worldwide. But, he added, ``if you have real religious
liberty, you have real open marketplace of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that I love the Jewish people and I have long been
a defender for the right of the Jewish people, for example, to have
a land of their own in Israel,'' he said. ``They may accept or
reject that love; that's their prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
   To Abramowitz, he wrote: ``One group of Jews insists that I must
desist from praying that my Jewish friends will understand that
Jesus loves them, died for them and is the fulfillment of all
messianic prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Jew,'' he added, referring to Jesus, ``has told me
that I must do these very things out of the love and gratitude of
my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Abramowitz said Friday that the task force should ``educate our
community better,'' adding, ``we have to really make our community
aware around the world that they are targets'' of missionaries.

HUE TO MAKE THE CALLS, OR WILL HE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ It appears a major change in philosophy has taken
place with USC offensive coordinator Hue Jackson expected to assume
control of the play-calling for tonight's game against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, USC coach Paul Hackett decided earlier in
the week to allow Jackson to call the plays, although nothing has
been officially announced. Hackett and Jackson were mum on whether
the change took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that's the case, but I don't know,'' was Jackson's only
remark.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the situation, Hackett has said he is in
control of the play-calling and reserves the right to call plays.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hidden weapon: Oregon wide receiver Marshaun Tucker, a
junior-college transfer, has been a pleasant surprise for the
Ducks, with a team-high 10 receptions and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really helped,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Another player who worries Hackett is tight end LaCorey Collins,
who has three touchdown catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing with the tight end is really different,''
Hackett said. ``They've gone from a heavy-legged blocker to a
pass-receiver type.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Keep it cool: Hackett has tried to tone down any celebrating
after linebacker Sultan Abdul-Malik was assessed a 15-yard penalty
for excessive celebrating against San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he doesn't ``combat penalties,'' such as when
Abdul-Malik roughed the passer in the same game, but draws the line
with celebrations. He brought Abdul-Malik out of the game for one
play after the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have celebrating on this team,'' Hackett
said. ``We've got to get it resolved or it's going to cost (people)
playing time. I don't want to take people out because they're
playing hard and are emotional, but there's a control factor that
has to exist. I've told the team, `Act like you've done that.' We
don't have names on our back and we don't need them. It's your play
that sets you out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ How's Ho-Ching? Oregon coach Mike Bellotti was encouraged by
the performance of tailback Herman Ho-Ching, who gained 77 yards
last week after serving a one-week suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played last week with great resolve to change people's
minds about him and his performance,'' Bellotti said. ``I'm hopeful
that that's a big step and a springboard back into a more active
role for him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Close ties: Hackett and Bellotti are both UC Davis graduates,
and Hackett served as head coach of the freshman team in 1970 when
Bellotti was team captain. Oregon assistants Bob Foster and Neal
Zoumboukos were assistants at Davis when Hackett played in 1968.

 &HT;    Guillen's HR pushes lead to 5
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Braves got their most unlikely victory of the
year Friday night. And the New York Mets lost one of their worst.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen, a forgotten man at the end of the bench, hit a
two-out home run in the 10th inning, only the 26th of his career,
as the Braves came from behind in the last three innings to beat
Montreal 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the night, the Mets sustained a 3-2 loss to
Philadelphia, absorbed by closer Armando Benitez in the Phillies'
last at-bat. The Braves' magic number to clinch the NL East shrank
to four games.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, who went hitless throughout August, remained a perfect
4-for-4 in September by taking a 2-2 fastball over the right field
wall, his first homer since June 24, 1998, and his first RBI in
almost nine weeks. Sean Bergman picked up his first win as a Brave
while Mike Remlinger recorded his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood (18-7) failed in his attempt to win his 19th,
allowing no earned runs but leaving after seven innings trailing
3-2 because of Rondell White's three-run homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tied it 3-3 in the eighth, which pinch-hitter Keith
Lockhart led off with a single. Pinch-runner Otis Nixon moved into
scoring position on the next pitch with his 24th steal of the year.
Gerald Williams' flyout moved Nixon to third, and Chipper Jones
drove in his second run of the night on a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves appeared to have something going in the seventh, but
two hard singles couldn't advance a runner past second base. Jose
Hernandez singled but made a running mistake when he attempted to
take two bases on Brian Hunter's single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Orlando Merced easily gunned down Hernandez at
third. Hunter took second base on the play and began running hard
when Eddie Perez sent a hard liner into center field. But Rondell
White made a fine diving catch and was able to double Hunter off
second base to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood sailed into the fifth, having allowed only two singles
and no one past first base. But Chipper Jones opened the inning by
booting a Geoff Blum check-swing grounder (his second error in two
games) and Millwood compounded the mistake by walking Mike Mordecai
(.237) two batters later.
</P>
<P>
   After a Ted Lilly sacrifice moved both runners into scoring
position, Millwood served up a high 2-1 fastball to Rondell White.
He drove the ball over the wall in left for a 3-2 lead, his 21st
homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves claimed a 2-0 lead in the third inning. Gerald
Williams curved a line drive around the left field foul pole for
his 15th homer of the year. Following a Bret Boone single, Chipper
Jones sent a hopper past third, just off the tip of diving third
baseman Mordecai's glove.

PARENTS FEAR MAN AT PARK WAS GUNMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAs JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A group of parents became concerned shortly
before last week's church shooting when a man who closely resembled
Larry Gene Ashbrook appeared on the sidelines of a nearby park and
watched silently as children practiced soccer, police have been
told.
</P>
<P>
   After the practice, the man, whom some believe to be Ashbrook,
disappeared, said Fort Worth police homicide Detective Michel
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes to an hour after the mysterious stranger left the
practice Sept. 15, gunfire erupted less than a block away inside
Wedgwood Baptist Church. Seven people were killed and seven others
wounded before Ashbrook fatally shot himself inside the church.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said a new round of police interviews will begin next
week in an attempt to determine if the stranger at Wedgwood Park
was Ashbrook.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor said he saw Ashbrook leave his home _ about a
10-minute drive from the church _ about 6:30 p.m. the day of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting inside the sanctuary at Wedgwood Baptist began about 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said police have received three telephone calls from
people who were at the children's soccer practice. They were almost
certain that the man at the park was Ashbrook, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The man sat alone on the grass, kept his distance from parents
and stared silently at the children playing soccer, Carroll said
witnesses told him. Some in the group said they were worried that
the stranger was a pedophile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one recognized him. No one knew who he was. It made them
concerned,'' Carroll said. ``He was there through the end of the
practice. As far as I know, he didn't talk to anyone. He just sat
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The tree-shaded, rolling park is just south of Bruce Shulkey
Elementary School, which is across the street from the church.
Yesterday, children played in the park and on the school grounds as
parents kept close watch.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Bruce Shulkey have not been told of the stranger's
appearance at the park, a secretary at the school said. And several
people living near the park said Friday that they do not remember
seeing anyone who fit Ashbrook's description on the evening of
Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he will interview the soccer team coach next week,
along with other people who were at the practice. He did not
disclose their names.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, police have taken statements from Justin
Laird, 16, who was paralyzed from the chest down by one of
Ashbrook's bullets, and from Jeremiah Neitz, a young man who
reportedly confronted Ashbrook seconds before the gunman killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator said Neitz told police that he approached
Ashbrook and said: ``I know where I'm going; I'm going to heaven.
You can kill me. Do you know where you're going? You really need
Jesus in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who did not want to be identified, said that
instead of shooting Neitz, Ashbrook sat down in a pew, shouted an
obscenity and killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Police have returned the two videotapes of the shooting to the
families that own them, said Lt. Ric Clark, a spokesman for the
Police Department. The recordings include one made by 17-year-old
Justin Ray moments before Ashbrook killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he has been told that the families destroyed the
tapes and that authorities do not have any copies.

(ATTN: N.C.)  
 TAKING TY COBB DOWN A PEG OR TWO _ TO .340 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ty Cobb played baseball 80-some years ago, he tyrannized
pitchers. Since then that sharp-spiked outfielder has intimidated
generations of hitters, none of whom have been able to match his
proficiency at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   His greatness is founded mostly on a single number, the ratio of
his hits to his number of times at bat. Cobb's overall batting
average was .366. Today the best hitters in baseball rarely hit the
ball with such consistency in a single season, much less as a
career average. Of the 10 best hitters of all time, only Ted
Williams (lifetime average, .344), played the game after 1950.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably the main reason baseball fans tend to wallow in
nostalgia. But Michael J. Schell, a biostatistician at the
University of North Carolina and a lifelong baseball fan, has tried
to rewrite history. He argues that raw batting averages are
meaningful only to compare hitters playing in the same park at the
same time with the same competition, not to rank superstars in the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Schell's new book, ``Baseball's All-Time Best Hitters''
(Princeton University Press, $22.95), is a trenchant attempt to
reorder the hierarchy using methods like those he applies to cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   He submitted batting averages of history's top baseball players
to a gantlet of tests. He makes adjustments for the changing
baseball talent pool, in part because blacks and other minorities
were once excluded from the major leagues. He also tries to
eliminate the distorting effects of quirky ball parks,
end-of-career slumps and rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting list rocks conventional wisdom. It also takes the
numerology among baseball fans to a new level of obsessiveness.
Schell focuses more on P-values, chi-squares and other statistical
minutiae than on singles and strikeouts, making his reasoning seem
a little pedantic when applied to the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   His calculations produce a new all-time greatest hitter,
revealed in sometimes breathless prose. The winner: Tony Gwynn, the
39-year-old San Diego Padres star whose polished hitting style
already earns him the No. 16 spot on the batting average list.
Gwynn's Schell-adjusted average of .342 bests Ty Cobb's rejiggered
total by .002 points. The difference amounts to 20 hits in 8,000
times at bat, the number Schell uses for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Other modern players also fare better after their averages pass
through Schell's calculator. Rod Carew leaps from 28th to 3rd
place, with an adjusted average of .332. Wade Boggs comes in 23rd
the old way but jumps to 9th on the revised list. Babe Ruth falls
out of the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that baseball stars in the Gilded and Jazz Ages might
have had some advantages over their modern descendants is not new.
Some baseball historians have long argued that pitchers have
improved more than hitters, so that the pitching mound had to be
lowered and the strike zone narrowed in 1968 to give suffering
batters a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jay Gould, the Harvard geologist, zoologist and baseball
pundit, has offered an evolutionary theory of baseball's hitting
drought. Hitters do not have .400 seasons anymore because an
overall improvement in standards shrinks the space available for
batters to surpass the mean, Gould argued in magazine articles and
in his 1996 book ``Full House'' (Harmony Books).
</P>
<P>
   The natural evolution of the game is that batters will tend to
converge on a mean statistical average of about .260, with fewer at
either extreme, Gould reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Schell's thinking is less abstract. He treats the question as an
epidemiologist might, arguing that he can filter out all the major
factors that influence a hitter's performance to isolate individual
talent. Several factors are straightforward to control. He
handicaps ball parks _ Red Sox hitters are penalized, for example,
because of Fenway Park's hitter-friendly left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   He also lops off any hits in excess of 8,000 at-bats to free
hitters of what might be called the Hank Aaron curse. Aaron played
the game so long that his deteriorating skills in later years in
some ways undermined his record-setting early years.
</P>
<P>
   The more complex part of the Schell formula takes a page from
Gould. Schell agrees that hitting talent has tended to vary less
over the years. In recent decades, he finds, a talent plateau has
emerged. The best hitters tend to surpass the average by a
predictable margin _ perhaps 80 batting-average points _ suggesting
a maturing of the game and a reduction in the wild variables that
skewed the spread of averages in the game's youth.
</P>
<P>
   So Schell applies the standard deviation of modern batting
averages to those in earlier years, in effect forcing Ty Cobb to
bat against Pedro Martinez. The result reduces the batting averages
of top players before 1950 or thereabouts, though Schell's
best-hitter list is still heavily populated with the heroes of old.
</P>
<P>
   Some rival statisticians question Schell's effort. Bill James, a
leading baseball expert and publisher, does not dispute that Tony
Gwynn would stack up well against hitters from any era. But he
questions the emphasis on batting averages as a prime measure of
achievement in the game. ``A weakness in many analytical approaches
in baseball is to grind some questions into a fine meal while
ignoring others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Ty Cobb's place on the pedestal may not depend on
one number alone.

 CITY TO COMB FILES IN BID TO MAKE WELFARE APPLICANTS GET
TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (resending to correct slug to NY-WELFARE-PRIVACY, sted(mk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is
planning to search thousands of medical billing records for
evidence it can use to place welfare applicants in drug and alcohol
treatment programs as a condition of receiving public assistance,
city welfare officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be culled from computerized Medicaid
insurance bills submitted in the past on behalf of applicants who
have voluntarily sought treatment for drug and alcohol problems.
The record search is for the applicants' own good, welfare
officials said this week, and will be used to push them to finish
treatment and to get jobs faster.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that record checks are needed because the city's
current system of drug screening and testing is finding
unrealistically low rates of substance abuse among welfare mothers
who need help.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy experts and lawyers for the poor say the record
search may violate a federal law protecting the confidentiality of
drug and alcohol treatment records. They contend that the city's
plan will frighten poor people from seeking treatment or benefits
and will send a chilling message to anyone considering help for
drug or alcohol problems.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, privacy experts say, is a classic example of the
conflict between public concern over the loss of privacy,
especially in health care records, and public support for using
computer databases to monitor or track suspect groups, like welfare
recipients, illegal immigrants and parents who fail to pay child
support.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they have not received official
notification of the plan. ``But there are confidentiality
provisions in New York's Medicaid plan, and we expect them to be
followed,'' said Christopher Peacock, spokesman for the Federal
Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid
records.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Turner, commissioner of the city's Human Resources
Administration, said no breach of confidentiality would be involved
because the billing records to be checked are submitted by drug and
alcohol treatment providers to the city's Medicaid office, and both
Medicaid and public assistance fall under his agency. ``These are
our own records,'' he said. ``We are not interfering with the
doctor-patient relationship. We're helping poor people here.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the poor who support treatment as a condition
of aid say the record search crosses the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people go into treatment thinking their records are
confidential and then, lo and behold, the information is illegally
disclosed, that will upset just about everybody,'' said Paul
Samuels, a lawyer and the director of the Legal Action Center, a
nonprofit advocacy organization. ``Violating confidentiality is an
ambush that will drive many people away from treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   No starting date has been set to search the records. The plan is
one of several new measures introduced by Turner as he is striving
to meet a deadline set by Giuliani, who vowed last year that by the
year 2000, ``New York will be the first city in the nation, on its
own, to end welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, whose welfare overhaul is expected to be a centerpiece
of his likely campaign for the U.S. Senate, did not mean an end to
public assistance, Turner stressed. The mayor meant that all adult
recipients would be moving from welfare to work through a variety
of steps, including treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, which is
a barrier to employment, Turner said.

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The quality of golf was superb, but the
outcome was shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1 of the Ryder Cup was a demoralizing day for the U.S.
players. They started with high spirits, high confidence, and high
expectations. They ended the day stunned and disappointed, in deep
trouble against an underdog European team that played with boldness
and brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Taking control in the afternoon matches, and putting even more
pressure on a U.S. team that may be rattled by the results, Europe
raced to a 6-2 lead after a memorable day at The Country Club.
Europe was lifted by the tremendous play of Jesper Parnevik, the
shot-making skills of Sergio Garcia, the leadership of Colin
Montgomerie, the steadiness of Paul Lawrie, and the toughness of
Miguel Angel Jimenez, Jose Maria Olazabal, Lee Westwood and Darren
Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were sunk by the shaky putting of Phil Mickelson,
the disappointing play of David Duval, the inability of Tiger Woods
to win either of his matches and an overall inability to make key
shots, especially putts, at key moments.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the beginning of a familiar Ryder Cup story _ a
favored U.S. team finding different ways to lose, and a resourceful
European team finding different ways to win. Having lost the past
two Ryder Cups, the United States entered this competition with
motivation, the home-course edge and the stronger team on paper.
But Europe was the stronger team on the course, and unless the
Americans quickly change the momentum, the Ryder Cup will not
change hands when the competition ends late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw some outstanding golf from the Europeans,'' Ben
Crenshaw, the American captain, said. ``I can't believe we're
looking at a 4-point differential.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it. There were many unexpected developments, and many
down moments for the Americans, as a partisan gallery of more than
30,000, ready to cheer, watched in disbelief. By late afternoon,
the atmosphere had changed from festive to passive. It seemed that
whenever the U.S. fans had reason to chant ``USA USA', either a
superb shot by a European, or a poor shot by an American, would
quickly give the U.S.fans a reason to quiet down. Consider these
facts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woods and Duval, the world's No. 1 and No. 2-ranked players,
respectively, were both 0-2. Paired together in an afternoon match,
Woods and Duval were beaten by Clarke and Westwood, 1-up, a major
blow to the United States, and a major lift for Europe. Woods'
combined Ryder Cup record is 1-5-1.
</P>
<P>
   _ Europe's four Ryder Cup rookies who played, Garcia, Jimenez
Lawrie and Padraig Harrington, had a combined record of 4-0-3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the eight matches played Friday, the United States won just
one, when Hal Sutton and Jeff Maggert captured a morning foursomes
match. And it took a great 30-foot birdie putt by Davis Love 3rd on
No. 18 in the afternoon to win that hole, earning Love and Justin
Leonard a half-point against Montgomerie and Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   Europe took a 2{-1{ lead after the morning foursome matches, in
which players hit alternate shots. But the afternoon was when
Europe really put its foot on the Americans' throats. Europe won
three four-ball matches, in which golfers play their own ball and
the better score wins, and earned a half-point in the other. Two
defeats were particularly gut-wrenching for the United States _
Westwood and Clarke's victory over Woods and Duval, and a loss by
Jim Furyk and Mickelson to Parnevik and Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson had a nightmarish experience, missing a 6-foot putt
for par at No. 18 in the afternoon that would have halved the
match. He had already missed a 4-foot putt birdie attempt at No. 16
that would have won the hole, and during his morning loss,
Mickelson missed three putts from eight feet or less.
</P>
<P>
   But Mickelson's final putt of the day was the most poignant and
most deflating. After everything that had happened, Mickelson had a
chance to earn a half point by making his six-footer at No. 18. But
with many of his teammates and their wives watching from just off
the green, and a hushed gallery holding its breath, Mickelson
missed the putt to the right, the same way he had missed most of
his putts. Ben Crenshaw, kneeling near the 18th green, dropped to
all fours in agony. Mickelson had no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' he said. ``It's certainly
disappointing. I needed to make those putts on No. 16 and No. 18
and I just didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When the day ended, Crenshaw and his team met behind closed
doors, hoping to find a way to regroup. Asked to describe the mood
of his team, Crenshaw said: ``Frustration. That's the best word I
can say.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting ended, Crenshaw had changed his lineup for the
Saturday morning foursome matches, hoping to start a comeback. He
will use Mark O'Meara and Steve Pate, both of whom sat out Friday's
play. Pate will be paired with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly enough golf left for the Americans to win,
but not if Europe continues to play at such a high level. Parnevik
was sensational, shooting 7-under par in his afternoon match, and
taking the pressure off his partner Garcia, who at 19 years old, is
the youngest player in Ryder Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Parnevik holed out from the fairway for an
eagle at No. 8, then hit a beautiful approach shot at No. 10 that
led to a birdie which won that hole. But after Furyk chipped in for
birdie at No. 13 to even the match, Garcia put his team ahead for
good, chipping in for eagle from 50 feet at No. 14. When the chip
went in, Garcia leaped in the air, much as he did after his
now-famous recovery shot from beside a tree at the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was another special moment for Garcia, who was 2-0 for the
day, proving Ryder Cup experience is not that important when you
have tremendous talent. After all the things Garcia has done at age
19, what will he do for an encore at age 20?
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I had to do something, because I couldn't let
Jesper play all 18 holes against two players,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik was more than happy to carry the load, going 2-0 with
his charismatic partner, and playing great golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had everything going for me today and I had to, because Jim
and Phil played so well,'' said Parnevik, who had six birdies and
an eagle in the afternoon. ``I thought Phil was going to make that
last putt, and I actually wanted him to make it, because nobody
deserved to lose that match.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Woods and Duval reached No. 17 Friday afternoon,
they knew the United States trailed, 5-2, and their match with
Clarke and Westwood was all square. This was an opportunity for the
world's top-two ranked players to step up, to win the match and
give their teammates a lift heading into Saturday. Instead, Clarke
and Westwood stepped up. Clarke birdied No. 17 to put his team
1-up, hitting a brilliant approach shot to within five feet, then
making the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Now the best Duval and Woods could do would be a half-point by
winning No. 18, and they didn't get that either. Duval hit a
terrible drive at No. 18 way right, while Woods hit his drive into
the right rough. The match ended when Westwood chipped his third
shot from the rough right of the green to within three feet of the
hole, after Woods and Duval had already taken their third shots.
Duval and Woods conceded the par to Westwood and the match as well,
and the United States ended the day seeing its best two players
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   How the United States would respond Saturday and Sunday remained
to be seen. But there was no doubt that the Ryder Cup began far
differently than the United States had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always find ourselves well behind after the first day,''
Hal Sutton, who went 1-1 today with Jeff Maggert, said. ``We're
going to have to reach down inside and pull something out.''

REFORM PARTY UNSETTLED BY QUEST FOR A NOMINEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Maine, N.H., Fla., Calif., Md.)   (af)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After struggling to create the most successful third party in 80
years, many longtime members of the Reform Party say they are
growing more fearful by the day that they will be left as virtual
bystanders if Patrick Buchanan or another famous person decides to
flood the party with supporters in pursuit of its presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the party, determined to become more than an asterisk
in presidential politics, say they are willing to overlook their
differences with Buchanan in return for the attention and success
that his candidacy could bring.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, party leaders agree that their nominee is almost
certain to be determined by people who are not current members of
the party, portending a frantic and expensive organizing contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pat Buchanan brings enough people, we become the Pat
Buchanan Party and there's nothing we can do about it,'' said
Robert K. Pavlick, 52, of Bridgeport, Conn., a member of the
party's National Rules Committee. ``Their votes will far outweigh
those of the indigenous Reformers. They can put all our issues on
the back burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell B. Kinney, 64, the state chairman for Maine, said many
founding members fear they would be no match for Buchanan's forces.
``They've been around politics a long time and we're mostly
novices,'' Kinney said.
</P>
<P>
   In the most dramatic evidence so far of this concern, the Reform
Party of New Hampshire canceled a state convention that had been
scheduled for Saturday because officials said they feared a
takeover by Buchanan supporters during elections for the state
party's six offices.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Talbott, a spokesman for Reform Party in New Hampshire,
said officials learned on Wednesday that supporters of Buchanan
planned to pack the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting our introduction to power politics,'' Talbott
said. ``We were not happy that we had to do this, but we thought it
would be best in the long run to preserve an independent and
unbiased organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party has never been about size: just 50,000 people
voted in its nominating contest in 1996, and one leader said that
Florida, for instance, has 60 active members. But because of the
success of Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, the party has automatic
slots on the ballot in 20 states and is eligible to receive $12.6
million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman-elect, John J. Gargan, 68, of Cedar Key, Fla., said
the party was vulnerable to a takeover because of what he called
its ``blank-check provision,'' a rule that allowed any registered
voter to write in and get a ballot for the presidential nominating
contest, scheduled for next July.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots can be cast by mail, telephone or the Internet. The
results will be ratified at the party's national convention, to be
in Long Beach, Calif., from Aug. 10 to 13.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the voters who might be recruited by Buchanan or by
old-guard members of the party, others might be recruited by Gov.
Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who has said he will work to promote a
centrist candidate to counter Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, a political consultant who is advising Donald
Trump, the developer, on a possible Reform Party bid, has said
Trump might use his database of 6.5 million gamblers, renters and
hotel guests to reach out to potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan, an ally of Ventura who will take over as national party
chairman in January, said that he welcomes all comers for the
nomination, but he that he had been warning other leaders that the
nominating process seemed tailor-made for exploitation by anyone
with a big mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party's membership is very thin and it's spread out,''
Gargan said. ``We have nowhere near the resources we would need to
cope with an outpouring of requests for ballots.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargan's concern is that some other group with a lot of
supporters _ say, a gun-control group _ will decide that Buchanan
should not be allowed to get the nomination, and would mobilize its
own ballot drive.
</P>
<P>
   The party's departing officers, who were deposed at the party's
national convention in July after Ventura endorsed Gargan, defended
the rules as the sort of open process that they see as sorely
lacking in the two major parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If millions of people get up off their couch and write in for
our nomination ballot, that probably means we're going to win the
general election,'' said Michael H. Farris, 30, of Los Angeles,
chairman of the Presidential Nominations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In Buchanan's case, a hostile takeover may not be necessary.
Already, some Reform Party members are offering reasons they could
support Buchanan, who reflects the party's views on many economic
issues. But Buchanan is a vocal opponent of abortion while the
Reform Party platform intentionally ignores social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said that our members and our candidates can
follow their conscience on abortion,'' said Elizabeth A. Christman,
35, the Maryland state chairman, who favors abortion rights. ``He
agrees with our economic and government reform issues, and that's
what people in this party care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Donovan, the party's national press secretary, also favors
abortion rights, but was eager to defend Buchanan, saying, ``The
media is already starting to Perotize him _ picking on little
things and finding quotes they can kind of hang on him and spin in
a negative way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides legions of supporters, qualifying for the nomination
will require a lot of money and manpower. To be listed on the
Reform ballot, a candidate must have made what the party considers
significant progress toward qualifying for the general-election
ballot in the states where the party does not have a slot. That can
be as easy as paying a filing fee, or as complex as gathering
37,380 signatures in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said the process would probably require 600,000
signatures, and, without volunteers, would cost about $6 million.

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ While the United States was being whipped at
The Country Club on Friday, Mark O'Meara and Steve Pate watched
helplessly from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, last year's Masters and British Open champion, was not
used by the captain Ben Crenshaw on Friday, and O'Meara was
disappointed. Because he has struggled with his driver recently, it
was not surprising that O'Meara did not play in the foursomes. But
O'Meara hoped that he would at least see action in the afternoon
four-ball matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always frustrating when you can't play, but that's the
captain's decision,'' O'Meara said. ``I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't disappointed. It's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara will get his chance Saturday morning, when he teams with
Jim Furyk in a foursome match against Darren Clarke and Lee
Westwood. Meanwhile, Pate will also play in the morning, teaming
with Tiger Woods in a match against Miguel Angel Jimenez and
Padraig Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Meara and Pate hope to provide the United States with a
spark, the European captain Mark James will continue to ride his
top players. Three Europeans have not played _ Jean Van de Velde,
Andrew Coltart and Jarmo Sandelin _ and none of those three will
play Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if Europe's top players begin to
feel fatigued as the Ryder Cup progresses. Friday's matches were
exhausting, both mentally and physically, and if Colin Montgomrie,
Westwood, Clarke, Paul Lawrie, Jimenez and Sergio Garcia are not
rested at some point, they may be drained by Sunday, opening the
door for an American singles domination.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, James has pushed the right buttons. And after
Friday's fast start, Europe needs to win only eight of the next
available 20 points to retain the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no complacency in the camp, but it was a day's job
well done,'' James said. ``To win six points is obviously a big
bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   James did not promise that Van de Velde, Lawrie and Coltart
would see action before Sunday. All three are Ryder Cup rookies.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S DRIVING OLAZABAL?
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Olazabal, Europe's most experienced Ryder Cup player,
will sit out foursomes again on Saturday, but expect to see him in
afternoon four-ball. Still having problems off the tee, Olazabal is
wary of playing alternate shot and leaving his partner in constant
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect when I stepped on the first
tee,'' Olazabal said. ``I missed a few tee shots, but I managed to
make a few birdies that helped us with the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark James trusts Olazabal's judgment on how much he should
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite happy with what Jose tells me,'' James said. ``He's
an intelligent fellow, and there's no secrets about your game in
that team room.''
</P>
<P>
   A CAPTAIN'S MODEST CALLS
</P>
<P>
   The European captain continued to play down his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his best decision was Friday, Mark James said: ``I
had a hamburger and for lunch instead of a turkey sandwich, and I
did enjoy it. I also took a lot of chocolate out, and the boys
liked that as well, because they do seem to snack well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But any other decisions are team decisions. They're ready to
play. I just make sure they wake up at the right time.''

NBA COACHES BRIEFED ON NEW RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The no-harm, no-foul National
Basketball Association is on the verge of becoming a ticky-tack
league. And depending how soon players and referees adjust, the
game may get uglier before it gets prettier.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Crawford, the veteran referee, was asked Friday how the
new rules to kick-start offense and cut down on physical contact
would influence the way he called a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players have to adapt, because we're going to blow,''
Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid mixed reviews, Rod Thorn, the league's senior vice
president for operations, presented the changes at the league
meetings Friday in a hotel conference room full of coaches. After
more than a decade of declining scores, unimaginative offense and
borderline thuggery, a committee last week approved four changes to
be implemented for the 1999-2000 season:
</P>
<P>
   _ A five-second rule to stop players who isolate themselves on
one side of the court and then take another 10-15 seconds off the
shot clock to back their defender into the post. With only five
seconds to make a move, players like Charles Barkley and Mark
Jackson will no longer be able to monopolize the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   _ A contact rule to stop defenders from continually re-routing
offensive players with their hands and elbows. From the baseline to
the foul line, defensive players can no longer initiate contact
with their forearm. Impeding progress in any way will be considered
a foul. Basically, a player's forearms will be considered
liabilities instead of assets, and open-court players like Latrell
Sprewell and Allen Iverson can go anywhere they want.
</P>
<P>
   _ A change in the illegal-defense guidelines. Subjective at
best, these have been clarified so that a player on the same side
of the court as the ball can play anywhere in that area. The league
hopes that coaches will stop trying to dump the ball in the post
with the hope of getting a call against the defense, and start
creating easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 14-second rule. Instead automatically resetting the shot
clock to 24 seconds in the front court after a foul or a violation,
the clock will be reset to 14 seconds if the amount of time left on
the shot clock is less than 14 seconds. If 20 seconds remained on
the shot clock, then the clock would reset to 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant, if subjective, change involves the contact
rule. The idea behind the change was to eliminate the chucking and
grabbing that slows down offenses and does not allow players to
penetrate or receive the ball where they want on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're redefining contact, and it will help out our game,''
said Thorn. ``We're hoping the rule gives us a more free-flowing,
fluid offensive game.''
</P>
<P>
   But several coaches who listened to Thorn deliver his
presentation and watched a video prepared by the league to showcase
how physical the league has become over the past 20 years were not
convinced the changes will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they're presented, they look like they can be an
enhancement,'' Nets coach Don Casey said. ``But we have to see how
the players react and coaches react to style of play. The question
is, how are you going to cover baseline screens, which were used
for holding up the screener and wedging a guy out? How about a pick
and roll, where you can't hold the guy and now the defender has to
go over the top?''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers president Donnie Walsh said: ``I think if you compare the
game in 1987, when Larry Bird was playing _ and I thought it was
physical then _ and then you compare that to the films of today,
it's four times as physical today. It's not even close. I don't
expect scores to shoot up right away. But I hope it's a better
game. I hope there's more freedom, there's more flow, there's more
fast-breaking _ parts of the game that aren't being done right
now.''

FINESSING A CONFLICT ON HOMOSEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten weeks ago, the Vatican ordered an American priest and a nun,
the Rev. Robert Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick, known in Roman
Catholic circles for their ministry to homosexuals, to halt that
work.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,
the body responsible for safeguarding church teachings, said the
two had allowed ``errors'' to creep into their discussions of what
the church says about homosexuality. In particular, the
congregation said Nugent and Sister Gramick had not emphasized the
church's position that homosexual acts are ``intrinsically
disordered'' and evil.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent made his response known immediately. On July 13, when the
directive was made public, Nugent said he would abide by it. He
later said he would interpret the directive narrowly so that he
could speak publicly about his former ministry and about the
Vatican investigation. He did so in an academic forum in Boston in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gramick had kept her intentions to herself, saying she
needed time to reflect and to consult officials in her religious
order, the Baltimore Province of the School Sisters of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for the first time, she responded publicly. In a
telephone interview on Friday, she said she would also abide by the
directive, but she would work to get it rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gramick called upon ``the wider church to come up with
creative and collaborative ways to rectify what I perceive and many
perceive to be an unjust directive. That's for the betterment of
the whole church.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was concerned that the directive would hurt the
church's credibility, particularly among parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, what is most beneficial for lesbian and gay people
is to be included and welcomed in the Catholic community at all
levels,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gramick also put her thoughts in writing, in a long,
nuanced statement that she released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I thought about ceasing to speak the concerns of lesbian
and gay Catholics to the institutional church,'' she wrote, ``I
understood what Jeremiah meant when he said: `It becomes like a
fire burning in my heart, imprisoned in my bones. I grow weary
holding it in. I cannot endure it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of Jesus impels me to try to show lesbian and gay
persons the loving, compassionate face of God and our church.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote that while her passive acceptance of the directive
offered ``no benefits to lesbian and gay Catholics and their
parents,'' it would be ``more beneficial to minister on their
behalf with the blessing of church leadership than without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, she wrote, she would work within the church to
get the decision reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   What she would like, she said, is for all Catholics _ including
theologians, canon lawyers and biblical scholars _ to discuss
issues related to the directive, such as its impact on homosexuals,
and what the church teaches about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nugent, Sister Gramick said the Vatican had not technically
silenced them but rather had prohibited them from continuing to
minister to Catholics who are homosexuals. In that, she said, she
saw a certain leeway to continue a public presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to speak to anyone who invites me to speak on the
issues,'' she said, adding that she had been invited to a forum on
Oct. 11 at DePaul University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an academic lecture,'' she said. ``I will speak about the
case and the implications of the case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sister Gramick also said that both she and Nugent were allowed
to write, although the directive specified that they must seek
approval from their religious superiors before publication. (A
statement about the case, written by both of them, is scheduled to
be published by the Jesuit magazine ``America'' in its Oct. 9
issue, officials at the magazine said.)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Sister Gramick said she was encouraged by the
way the church resolved a recent case involving a Catholic
theologian in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tissa Balasuriya, a priest in Sri Lanka, had been
excommunicated by the Vatican in January 1997 as punishment for his
writings on salvation and the Virgin Mary. But the excommunication
order was lifted 14 months later after mediation by church
authorities in Sri Lanka and the priest's religious order.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was lifted,'' Sister Gramick said, ``so that gives us
hope.''

SPOTLIGHT ON BUSH MAKES TEXAS TARGET OF NEW BARBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Move over, Arkansas. There's another state to
beat up on.
</P>
<P>
   With Gov. George W. Bush running for president, Texas is fast
becoming a target of campaign rivals, editorial writers and joke
peddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read My Lips, No New Texans'' screams the latest example of
Texas-bashing _ a political button that simultaneously pokes fun at
Bush, his father and the Lone Star state.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Clemons, owner of Kansas City-based Market Vision, said
the item is so popular she can hardly keep it stocked. ``This one
has outsold everything else,'' she said. ``It's sold faster than
anything we've ever featured.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating up on Texas is not new, of course. Critics have long
found fertile ground in Texans' famous egos, their love affair with
guns, the state's stingy welfare payments and its record-setting
execution rate, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   But these traits _ a badge of honor to some, shameful to others
_ have come into sharper focus in the glare of presidential
politics. The klieg lights were shining on Texas again last week
after the shootings at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians wasted little time in turning the tragedy into a
campaign opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you allow guns in churches?'' asked Vice President Al
Gore, who is running for the Democratic nomination and would face
Bush, a Republican, if both are successful in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's wisecracking Conventional Wisdom column issued a
similar rebuke, giving Texas a thumbs-down for the ``Bush-backed
law that allows guns in church.''
</P>
<P>
   That law, which the governor signed in 1997, lifted an automatic
prohibition against concealed weapons in places of worship. It now
allows churches to decide whether to ban them.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Fort Worth Police Chief Ralph Mendoza said he doubted
that stricter gun control laws could have stopped Larry Gene
Ashbrook, who fatally shot seven and wounded seven others before
killing himself at Wedgwood. Ashbrook began firing after he walked
into the church during a youth rally Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   He did not have a concealed handgun license.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from the vice president, described by the Bush
camp as opportunistic and ill-timed, was the latest in a long
string of slaps that Gore has delivered to Texas in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At a National Urban League conference in Houston last month,
Gore took a swipe at Bush's education policies, asking, ``Here in
Texas, can we be satisfied when African-Americans can be twice as
likely to drop out of school?''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Gore went to San Antonio to highlight the
Clinton administration's proposal to fund new school construction.
From the library of dilapidated Crockett Elementary, Gore said the
problem of crumbling, outdated buildings is ``particularly bad here
in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   (Gore did not mention that the National Education Association
study from which he pulled the data found that school buildings in
the vice president's native Tennessee are in worse shape than those
in Texas.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore also cited a report _ prepared by a Republican-aligned
group _ on the college preparedness of Texas Latinos. He said it
showed ``a massive failure of education in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly Beth Malcolm, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party,
took issue with that description.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not agree that we are a failure in the public schools
in our state,'' she said. ``I see many successful people in Texas
that are ... doing very well in life, who received their education
in the public schools and the public universities of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not the only state to suffer presidential campaign
jibes.
</P>
<P>
   Governors Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton relied heavily on
state accomplishments when they ran for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of their respective races, Dukakis'
``Massachusetts Miracle'' became better known as ``Taxachusetts,''
and Clinton-the-education-reformer was branded a ``failed governor
from a small state.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas will be lucky if it gets off that easily, said Allan
Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed almost overbearing to attack Arkansas. It was sort
of like piling on. But Texas ...'' he said, chuckling. ``You can
think of big, fat, smug Texas with its nasty underbelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   There are some unpleasant statistics, to be sure. Among the
categories in which Texas ranks No. 1 nationwide: the amount of
pollution released by factories, alcohol-related auto crashes and
the prisoner incarceration rate, according to a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also executes more people than any other state, by a long
shot. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert has written extensively
about the criminal justice system here, criticizing the execution
of mentally retarded inmates and the meager legal help given to
poor criminal defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, he wrote, ``compassion is virtually illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Lone Star state led the nation in the
growth of personal income between 1996 and 1997, and Texas' strides
in student performance have gotten national attention.
</P>
<P>
   And despite its image as the shoot-'em-up capital of the world,
Texas ranked 22nd in gun-related homicides per capita (4.5 per
100,000 population in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people do tend to stereotype us,'' Malcolm said.
``Texans have so much to be proud of that it comes across as
bragging to other people.''

   PHOENIX - It would be easy enough to just call Freaks and Geeks
the new fall season's best show and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a critic's job to tell you more. You shouldn't just
know that the show, set in a Michigan high school in 1980, is good.
You should know how good.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how good: It will make you like a Styx song.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. It may even make you love it. It will definitely make you
hum Come Sail Away, that awful an them from one of corporate rock's
big gest hack acts.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it is the dead solid perfect choice for the first
episode's closing scene, a scene so painfully perfect you'll wish
you were 16 again.
</P>
<P>
   Without all the acne, apprehension and all the rest that go
along with being a high school sophomore, of course.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember those and other hu miliations from your high
school years. That's another great thing about Freaks and Geeks _
it makes no attempt to beau tify your memories. The actors, while
not unattractive, don't all look like finalists in a nationwide
model search.
</P>
<P>
   A conscious decision?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so conscious you can't even believe it,'' Paul Feig,
the show's creator, said earlier this month. ``All along, it had
always been written to be for a very real-looking cast. That was
the whole motiva tion for me putting pen to paper on this . . .
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to do a realistic show that looked like the kids I
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, because the show is about the non-cheerleading,
non-jock outcasts who populate the majority of desks in high school
classes, that kind of casting makes sense. That doesn't mean it
always happens _ you've watched shows on the WB network _ but
happily, NBC complied with Feig's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cardellini plays Lindsay, a sopho more ``mathlete'' geek
reeling from an emotional upset that leaves her flirting (lit
erally and figuratively) with inclusion in the slightly dangerous
freak crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Sam (John Daley), is the classic high school
freshman _ he's smaller than the other kids, unsure of him self in
just about any situation and so hi lariously inept around girls
that you wince just watching him.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's friends are equally funny, especially Samm Levine, who
plays Neal; his Capt. Kirk impression is tragically perfect _ he's
the geek of all time.
</P>
<P>
   It's so refreshing to watch a show about high school that
downplays angst and gets right the real worries that kids that age
suffer. Sex? With beautiful classmates? Please. (That's an
exclamation, not a plea.) Feig knows how unrealistic that is, and
it shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasy becomes reality because it's all you're seeing (on
other high school shows), and you just feel terrible about
yourself,'' he said. ``You go, `That's not my life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids try to readjust their problems to fit what they're seeing
on TV. So suddenly, you've got kids obsessed with sex and dat ing.
They're being forced to make it part of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Not when he was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of getting to kiss a girl or hold her hand was a
mind blower.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the high school I remember.
</P>
<P>
   Freaks and Geeks gets nearly everything right, from the clothes
and haircuts to the slang to, most im portantly, the atti tude. You
know what high school was like. So does Feig. It was a daily bat
tle for survival, emotional and even physi cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, is the entire motivation of high school,'' Feig
said, ``trying not to get your ass kicked and avoiding
humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Well said. And if the fabulous dodge-ball scene doesn't hit you
where you live, you don't need to be watching television anyway.
You need to be getting embalmed.
</P>
<P>
   Or listening to Styx records. &QL;

C. TRINKAUS, RENAISSANCE SCHOLAR, 87
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (rk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Trinkaus, a leading scholar of the Renaissance and a
longtime history professor at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville,
N.Y., died on Sept. 15 at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 87 and
lived in Bronxville.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus was one of the scholars who in the 1940s and '50s
``launched the wonderful flowering of Renaissance historical
scholarship in North America,'' said John O'Malley, president of
the Renaissance Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially influential, O'Malley said, in re-evaluating
the religious aspects of the Italian Renaissance in his two-volume
work, ``In Our Image and Likeness: Humanity and Divinity in Italian
Humanist Thought'' (1970).
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Trinkaus' doctoral dissertation, which became his first
book, ``Adversity's Noblemen: The Italian Humanists on Happiness''
(1940), was acclaimed by scholars for deftly criticizing past
academic views of Renaissance humanism.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus was also noted for examining Erasmus and the
16th-century religious conflict between humanism and the
Reformation in his book ``Collected Works of Erasmus:
Controversies'' (1999).
</P>
<P>
   A former colleague, Nicholas Steneck, a professor of history at
the University of Michigan, said: ``What set him and the tradition
of Renaissance studies he represented apart from the scholarly
tradition that followed was a deep belief that past writers and
their texts could not be understood without careful historical
study.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He, therefore,'' Steneck added, ``had little patience for the
post-modernists and deconstructionists who preached that texts had
to be separated from their pasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 25, 1911, and received a
bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University and a Ph.D. from
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He began teaching at Sarah Lawrence College in 1936 and stayed
until 1970. He spent the next 12 years at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus was a past president of the Renaissance Society of
America and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Pauline Moffitt Watts; a son, Dr.
Peter M. Trinkaus of Irvington, N.Y.; a brother, John, of Guilford,
Conn., and three grandchildren.

NASA IS IRATE THAT FLECKS OF THE MOON ARE FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the untrained eye, the black plastic desk set
resembles a tacky paperweight: a glob of plastic stuck on top is
speckled with brown spots, and peeling strips of foil border a
photograph of men on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   To John Reznikoff, a dealer in rare objects, the desk set could
bring bids of $1 million or more, since the brown flecks in the
plastic are most likely parts of American moon rocks, which cannot
be privately owned or sold, according to a policy of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   To the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, moon rocks
are a national treasure, to be used only for science, research and
education. So on Friday, it sent an agent to seize the desk set
from Reznikoff's office in Westport, Conn., and it plans to test
the flecks to determine their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very careful inventory of all the lunar samples that
have ever been in our control,'' said Douglas Blanchard, a NASA
spokesman. ``No one has ever been authorized to remove samples from
a mission, and so somewhere in the line there is a felony.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale of how the rocks came into private hands starts in 1970
at a NASA retirement party. The rocks were given to Joseph Healy,
an electrical engineer in the space program, as a parting gift. To
decorate the desk set they were giving him, Healy's co-workers
rummaged through the rock boxes from the Apollo 11 and 12 missions,
and emerged with some scraps, said Healy's daughter, Margaret, an
Oregon social worker. The foil strips were part of the Mylar outer
skin from the Lunar Excursion Module, Ms. Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, the flecks were from moon rocks, soil samples
presumably collected by none other than Neil Armstrong, that her
father's colleagues had melded into a resin replica of the first
moon rock displayed from the Apollo 11 mission.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, NASA officials were not pleased, Ms. Healy said. ``A
memo was circulated telling space-center employees the moon rocks
and space vehicles were `national treasures' and could not be
privately owned or given away,'' she recalled. But her father was
never asked to return the gift, the only one ever made, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Healy tried to have the desk set appraised, several
insurance companies described it as priceless and refused to set a
value. Not content to be idle, he began toting it to schools and
talking to children about the space program. One day his wife
snapped the pen off the top, needing one for her purse.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, after her father died and her mother became
ill, Ms. Healy put the desk set in a safe deposit box. But in
August, needing money to pay for her daughter's law school
education, Ms. Healy packed the desk set in bubble wrap and sent
it, by Federal Express, to Reznikoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd say, `It's a piece of junk,' and then I would
have donated it to the local museum,'' Ms. Healy said. Reznikoff,
who has sold pieces of Abraham Lincoln's hair and a Confederate
flag that was used at the surrender at Appomattox, said that he
initially thought the desk set was a hoax. ``A lady calls me and
says she has a piece of the moon,'' he recalled. ``I was like:
`Yeah, right. What else do you have? A piece of the Brooklyn
Bridge?'''
</P>
<P>
   But when he unwrapped the desk set, read Ms. Healy's letter and
did some research, he was convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a piece of another world that a man
brought home to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he needed more evidence of its authenticity, the reaction of
NASA officials helped: They went ``ballistic,'' he said, and soon
he was on the phone with the agency's inspector general,
negotiating whether the desk set would be handed over without a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Healy, meanwhile, described herself as enraged by the
seizure of her father's desk set. ``This is so dumb,'' she said.
``My dad's office mates said that this was leftover stuff. They
didn't think they were doing anything inappropriate and it's
itsy-bitsy bits.''
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff, trying to describe the value of a piece of the moon,
said that it was akin to ``the home-run ball hit by Mark McGwire.''
By contrast, Russian moon rocks gathered during unmanned retrieval
missions are less valuable because they have been privately owned
and sold _ the last chunk to go on the market was auctioned in 1993
at Sotheby's for over $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   NASA, for its part, has cataloged and kept all its moon rocks,
except for small ``diplomatic samples'' that it distributed in 1970
to select government officials, Blanchard said. Last year, federal
officials said that a man tried to smuggle into the United States a
piece of moon rock from Honduras that President Richard Nixon had
given to an official there. The man could face charges, Blanchard
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a special agent from the Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md., arrived at Reznikoff's office to get the desk
set. The sample will be tested for authenticity at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Healy said: ``It's not like NASA didn't know all along that
Dad had it. I'm angry.''

THOUGHT I HAD IT MAID - BUT I CAN STILL LIFT A FINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURIE NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I felt the weight of my Big Girl body begin to lean
heavily forward.
</P>
<P>
   I felt my right hand come up, trying to brace the fall.
</P>
<P>
   I felt it smash into the door jamb of the bathroom before it had
a chance to open fully, palm up.
</P>
<P>
   I felt my left hand drag along the wall, trying to grab hold of
any thing.
</P>
<P>
   I felt the thud as I hit the floor, face down.
</P>
<P>
   I felt the dust settle around me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God!'' I heard my husband yell, standing in the bath
room not two feet away from me. ``Are you all right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you all right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you all right?''
</P>
<P>
   I have told him before not to attempt communication if it
appears I am in pain, because I cannot be responsible for what
flies out of my mouth. I guess he just forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``SHUT UP, YOU STUPID ID IOT DUMMY MAN!'' is apparently what I
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think I'm mean. He has that rule, too. I learned it one
day after he was lying on the couch and our special-needs dog
jumped on him and almost popped the family jewels like they were
ripe little figs.
</P>
<P>
   He suddenly looked as if he had inhaled a golf ball, staggered
off the couch, threw a matchbook at the dog, uttered the words
``Kill the bad thing'' and then stumbled into the kitchen. I
followed quickly behind in case I needed to get the bag of frozen
peas, but as I turned the corner, I saw him squatting on the floor
with his hands on his head, pulling out his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Without turning his head, he growled, ``Don't look at me! Don't
look at me!'' and continued to rock back and forth like Dustin
Hoffman in Rain Man.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathetically, I tried to feel his agony. I guessed that it
came kind of close to the time my friend fell down and her
cigarette flew over and burned a big hole in my Kate Spade purse,
but then again that was pretty painful. When I curled up like a
little jarred fetal pig in the corner of her patio, I didn't want
anyone looking at me like I was some curiosity, either.
</P>
<P>
   So I understood, and just whis pered, ``Peas are in the freezer
under the 10-pound brisket you were going to take on that camping
trip and eat off for six days but couldn't fit into your backpack
and is now costing us $10 a month to keep frozen,'' and tiptoed
back into the living room to watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   I am a great wife.
</P>
<P>
   But as I was sprawled on the floor, face-down like a drunk, my
husband wasn't being as understand ing, even though he saw the
whole thing and didn't even laugh, which I guess means he loves me.
</P>
<P>
   However, as my hand throbbed, the only thing that ran through my
mind was that I should immediately _ and with great force _ rip out
his throat with my teeth. He's 6-foot-3, so I don't know who I
thought I was kidding when I made that first lunge, but he got the
point and took a couple of steps back.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my fingers. They were starting to swell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peas!'' I gasped as my husband stood there. ``Peas!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh honey, don't worry about it!'' he said as he came forward.
``I knew you wouldn't bite me! Peace to you, too!''
</P>
<P>
   Then I said something they won't let me print in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   When my husband returned with green beans, my middle fingers _
one of which often comes in very handy _ had grown to both the size
and the color of uncooked, spicy Italian sausages. I could bend
both a little so I knew they weren't broken, but were probably
sprained pretty badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did I trip over?'' I asked, looking behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sheet,'' my husband said simply, crouched down and holding
the green beans on my hand. ``I was doing laundry and I guess I
forgot to put the dirty stuff back in the hamper.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm no fool. Opportunities like this happen once in a lifetime.
I've wanted a maid for three years, and now that my husband had
rendered my extremities useless, this was prime time to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   ``My WHOLE HAND is bro ken!'' I cried, holding it up. ``These
hands are my livelihood! I type with these hands! I make my living
with these 10 instruments!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you only typed with the two pointer fingers,'' my
hus band answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I WAS LEARNING,'' I growled. ``Yes, those are the pri mary
typers, but I was beginning to incorporate other helper fingers on
a one-by-one basis!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to go to the emergency room?'' my husband asked,
and I really did think about it, even if just for the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a doctor going to do?'' I asked, mostly to myself.
``He's going to put a splint on my finger and wrap it with tape,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I ate a Fudgsicle last night so I have a stick, and we
have tape,'' I said. ``Pioneer women would have just bandaged their
hand and went back out to work the crops! I don't need a doctor!
I'm from strong stock! What I really think we need to do is
immediately call a maid service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all,'' he started, ``The only strong thing about your
stock is the New York accents. Second, pioneer women regularly died
in childbirth and pulled rotten teeth out with their bare hands,
but we don't live on the prairie in South Dakota. The hospital is
right across the street. And third, if you think you can pick a
crop right now, you can jiggle a dust rag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was speaking in metaphors!'' I protested. ``Besides, you
broke my finger! Why can't you put things away?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke your finger?'' he ques tioned. ``Why can't you watch
where you're going?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put that finger down,'' he said harshly. ``Put that finger
down!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' I said, smiling. ``I have a feeling it's going to
be like this for the next six weeks, or until I get 10 more helper
fingers.'' &QL;

SAAB PUTS SPORT INTO STATION WAGON 
</HEADLINE>
 REVIEW-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Suddenly, station wagons are cool. Not the big, beefy
Ranch Wagons, Custom Cruisers and Roadmasters that once hogged the
highways before being displaced by minivans and sport-utility
vehicles, but a new generation of trim, even sporty four-door
wagons, mainly from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo wagons have been transformed from boxy haulers into svelte
fashion statements. Audi wagons are renowned for their refined road
manners. Even haughty BMW has a couple of ``Touring'' wagons for
the horsy set.
</P>
<P>
   There's Subaru, which managed to carve out an entire new niche
with its Outback series of all-wheel-drive wagons; another wagon is
being introduced for Saturn's new midsize LS car; and Ford
continues to score decent sales with its Taurus/Sable wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Saab is jumping into the fray with a midsize wagon based on
its 9-5 (say ``nine-five'') sedan. The 9-5 wagon really is a fine
piece, and anyone who likes driving will appreciate the balance,
power, steering and braking of this car. The interior is hand some
and businesslike, with an aircraft-style cockpit that reveals
Saab's aeronautic roots.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of creature comfort, what could be better on a hot,
sticky day than a seat that incorporates an electric fan to blow
cool air through ventilating holes in the seats? Or how about a
cargo floor in the rear deck that slides out on rollers to make
loading easy or provide an impromptu desk or picnic table?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the optional equipment to keep your dog happy and
safely buckled up. Also, the passen ger-side mirror that's cleverly
designed with two con vex parts, providing a panoramic view to the
rear. And the ``catcher's mitt'' head restraint that fights
whiplash injuries in the event of a rear-end collision.
</P>
<P>
   The new Saabs may not be as quirky as the old ones (this from a
guy who once owned a 1960s-era 96 model with a corn-popper
two-cycle engine), but they are beautiful, well-designed cars that
will appeal to driving enthusiasts and the fashion-conscious, as
well as engineering nerds.
</P>
<P>
   Two models from Trollhatten, Sweden, are now in the showrooms,
the smaller 9-3 _ which doesn't in clude a wagon but does have a
four-door hatchback and a spiffy convertible _ and the 9-5. The new
models seem to have struck a chord, and Saab is hav ing a decent
sales year, for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Saab-ophiles will be glad to note that the 9-5 still has the
signature feature of the ignition key in the center console, a
piece of ergonomic design that mystifies most people. The idea, as
I understand it, is to put your right hand down where all the
starting procedure happens _ ignition, parking brake and gearshift.
</P>
<P>
   The test wagon was powered by an aggressive 3-li ter V-6,
turbocharged and sparkling with 200 horse power. This engine comes
on with a rush and keeps on pulling with a flat, even load of
torque through out its range. Saab was also a pioneer in engine tur
bocharging, and this smooth, efficient power plant shows the
decades of development that went into it.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is not solely a Saab product, but comes from General
Motors, which owns a majority share in the Swedish automaker and
provided an en gine produced in England and used extensively in
Europe. Now, that's world economics at work.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 comes only with an automatic transmis sion, a decent
unit with smooth upshifts and predict able downshifts. The Saab
wagon is not offered with all-wheel-drive, unlike some of the
competition, such as Volvo, Audi and Subaru.
</P>
<P>
   If you want stick, you can opt for the turbo charged
four-cylinder engine, a classic Saab unit that churns out a clean,
quick 10 horsepower. That en gine also can be fitted with
automatic. In some of Saab's more aggressive models, the four is
boosted to 230 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the horsepower, it's put down to the pavement through
the front wheels with hardly a hint of torque steer. That's the
result of good front-end geometry from a company that's been making
front-wheel-drive cars for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag on the 9-5 SE is fairly steep, although it doesn't
break the $40,000 barrier and un dercuts some of the competition.
The base price includes all the elec tronic and comfort features on
any one's wish list, as well as Saab's advanced safety features.
</P>
<P>
   A base model 9-5 wagon with the four-cylinder and stick shift is
about $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the wagon are few and simple. The styling is
sharp but not really distinctive, as every Saab should be. I would
like stick shift made available for the V-6. I'd also like an
in-between model with the V-6 but with less content that's not so
pricey.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first station wagon Saab has offered in nearly three
decades, coming at a time when wagons are making a surprise
comeback. For those who prefer driving sporty cars rather than
clumsy trucks, the Saab has the per formance and refinement plus
the cargo space to make it function in the real world. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vehicle type: Five passenger, four-door wagon, front-wheel drive. &QL; 
Base price: $37,250. &QL; 
Price as tested: $39,270. &QL; 
Engine: 3-liter turbocharged V-6, 200 hp at 5,000 rpm, 229 lb-ft of

HERBERT SCHUSTER, FOOD SCIENTIST, 75 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.) (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbert V. Shuster, a food scientist who founded one of the
nation's oldest consumer product testing companies, died Monday at
a nursing home in the Brighton section of Boston, where he had been
for several days. He was 75 years old and lived in Waban, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a recent stroke, according to
James Shuster, one of Shuster's sons.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Boston, Shuster formed his company, Herbert
V. Shuster Inc., in 1955, and built it into one of the leading
independent companies involved in research and development of
consumer products. The consulting company specialized in product
testing for the food and drug industries.
</P>
<P>
   Through his company, Shuster became a pioneer in the field of
manufacturing private-label products, which are made for stores to
sell in competition with national brands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the company was acquired by Hauser Chemical Research of
Boulder, Colo. At that time, it had a professional staff of more
than 100 people and worked with many manufacturers and marketers
that were among the nation's 500 largest industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster graduated from the Boston Latin School and served as a
meteorologist with the U.S. military during World War II. He later
graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and
received his doctorate in food technology from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster is survived by his wife, Roseanne; two sons, Mark of
Newton, Mass., and James of Providence, R.I.; a daughter, Amy
Muscott of Amherst, N.H., and three grandchildren.

HEROIN SMUGGLER SUES OVER SURGERY TO RETRIEVE DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In March 1998, William Meequaye Kanyi arrived at
Kennedy International Airport from his home country, Ghana, and
immediately aroused the suspicions of customs agents. Under
questioning, he admitted that he had swallowed 51 small,
heroin-filled balloons before boarding his flight. He was arrested
and taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   This week Kanyi, now a federal prisoner after pleading guilty to
drug smuggling, filed a lawsuit against the federal government and
Mary Immaculate Hospital. The suit asserts that doctors, acting
under customs officers' ``direction, control and/or supervision,''
removed seven of the balloons in an unnecessary operation that
grievously harmed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiff had passed 44 out of 51 bags,'' his complaint in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn says, and he ``begged and pleaded
with the defendants not to operate on him'' but to allow him a
little more time so that he could pass the remaining seven bags
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the court papers say, Kanyi was cut open and the
doctors ``milked the remaining seven bags through the plaintiff's
alimentary tract.'' His lawyer, Velly Polycarpe, added in a
telephone interview on Friday that one of the bags had been in his
client's stomach, four had been in his colon and the others had
been in his small intestine.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client, who is about 40 years old, was sentenced to
over two years in prison for his guilty plea in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In most such cases, law-enforcement officials say, the
contraband is retrieved in what they call monitored bowel
movements. But some swallowers have died when the condoms or
balloons leaked.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Polycarpe said in the court papers, ``this
unconsented surgery was totally unnecessary'' because none of the
swallowed bags had torn or leaked. Among the permanent injuries to
Kanyi from the surgery, the lawyer said, were disfiguring scars,
the loss of control of his abdominal muscles, constant nausea and
vomiting, and digestive difficulties. He also mentioned continuing
psychological effects.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service and hospital officials said they could not
comment on the lawsuit. But Susan Mitchell, the service's acting
area director for Kennedy Airport, said that, in general, whether a
swallower required surgery or other invasive procedures was a
medical matter decided by doctors, not customs officers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Phelps, director of public relations for the Catholic
Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens, which operates Mary
Immaculate Hospital, said that generally in such a case, surgery
would be performed only if the contraband ``was obstructing the
intestine or it was thought there was an impending rupture of the
material holding the drugs, which could be fatal.''

 SIGRID DE LIMA, 77, WHIMSICAL NOVELIST OF THE '50s  
(rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sigrid de Lima, a writer whose early works won praise but who
withdrew from public life in midcareer, died on Sunday at a
hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 77 and lived in Valley Cottage,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Alison de Lima
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Lima burst upon the New York literary scene in 1950 with
``Captain's Beach,'' the first published novel to come out of the
editor Hiram Haydn's prestigious workshop at the New School for
Social Research. The tale of a handful of threadbare survivors in a
shabby rooming house on the New York waterfront, the book met with
mixed reviews with critics simultaneously proclaiming Ms. de Lima
the next Hemingway, Dostoyevsky or Woolf, or calling her writing
``painfully studied and even windy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Lima fared better with her second work, ``The Swift
Cloud'' (1952), about the murder of a disabled child in a
California town. The book was well received.
</P>
<P>
   Her slim body of work won her a Prix de Rome in 1953, with a
fellowship in literature at the American Academy of Arts and
Letters in Rome. There she met and married a fellow winner, Stephen
Greene, an artist.
</P>
<P>
   With her ``Carnival by the Sea'' (1954), described in The Times
as ``the moving story of a lovely lost Eurydice, wandering in the
gaudy hell of a modern amusement park,'' critics were generally
agreed on her considerable skills. After only two more works,
``Praise a Fine Day'' in 1959 and ``Oriane'' in 1968, both of which
met with acclaim, Ms. de Lima ceased writing for publication,
preferring instead to spend time with her family, Ms. Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughter, of Houston, she is survived by her
husband.

 (REMOVES ``ever'' from 1st graf , ``in schools where they are not

<P>
   Under threat by the rapidly growing online industry that helps
students prepare for and select colleges, the College Board, the
nonprofit organization that administers the SAT, voted Friday to
create its first for-profit subsidiary in a move to establish a
flashy full-service Web site of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote of the College Board's 24 trustees is a
radical shift for a staid 100-year-old group best known as the
objective overseer of college-entrance exams, thrusting an
institution honored for its dispassionate conservatism into the
big-money world of Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   It follows a spate of new advertisement-driven online ventures _
including an upgrade just this week of the Princeton Review's Web
site _ focusing on the lucrative high-school and college market, a
trend that has raised concerns about the commercialization of
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not willing to give up our not-for-profit expertise to
somebody who's just in it for the money,'' said Gaston Caperton,
who took over as president of the College Board in July. ``We have
the right values. We have the right goals. What we have to do is
have the right capital and expertise to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan for a Web site to cater to a college applicants' every
need, from financial aid forms to SAT tutoring, marks the
convergence of two major trends in education in the 1990s: the
expansion of for-profit enterprises, and the explosion of
electronic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in a world of piranha economics in regard to
education,'' said Arthur Levine, a scholar of higher education who
is president of Teacher's College at Columbia University. ``Every
Wall Street firm, seemingly, has an education department. Venture
capitalists are moving into this very quickly. Any nonprofit that
fails to recognize both the opportunities and the challenges that
come from the digital world is destined for extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   While most experts, including Levine, admired the College Board
for diving into a wave they see as inevitable, some said the
venture presents a conflict-of-interest. The plan calls for
Caperton to serve as the new company's chief executive, and the
trustees to retain majority-control of its board.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a pure educational mission, the organization would
now have the added motivation of money. That means trying to sell
products to students lured to the site, say, to register for the
Scholastic Assessment Tests, with the knowledge that a successful
Website could eventually go public and make everybody involved
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Caperton said it had to be a for-profit subsidiary in order to
entice the $10 million he has lined up in initial investments, and
to attract technological talent in a sphere where stock options are
essential to any job offer. But critics were more cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is drawing on their reputation and the
institutional endorsement they've had over the years and using that
to turn a dollar,'' said Scott Rice, an professor of English at San
Jose State University who is writing a book about the influence of
money in schools. ``A testing agency should be purer than Caesar's
wife. That's hardly the case if they're going to enter the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed site, www.collegeboard.com, would offer free or
low-cost tutoring for the tests the College Board sponsors and
guidance in navigating the admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   It would be funded in part by advertisers hawking computers,
cars and credit cards, with commercial links for everything from
opening a bank account to buying and selling furniture for dorm
rooms. Eventually, Caperton believes the new site could be used to
train teachers for Advanced Placement courses, or even to teach
those classes to students.
</P>
<P>
   The organization hopes to unveil the Web site by late spring.
Viewers who log on to the .com address now are logged into the
College Board's current .org site.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed venture comes at the conclusion of the most
competitive college-admission season in history. It would join a
flourishing cyber-crowd _ including the test-preparation giants
Princeton Review and Stanley Kaplan _ attempting to cater to that
throng.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to www.kaplan.com and www.review.com,
collegeboard.com would also compete with CollegeQuest.com,
embark.com and CollegeNet.com, all Web sites trying to serve as a
kind of electronic guidance counselor holding students' hands
through the college-selection process _ and making money along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's student loans or computers, a lot of people are
starting up these sites because advertisers want to reach these
kids,'' said John Katzman, the president of Princeton Review, whose
site charges colleges $2,000 to post their sales pitches, and plans
to eventually offer $800 test-prep courses online. ``You're hitting
the most achievement-oriented, brightest high-school seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar trend, some 500 colleges and universities have
contracted with a new company, Campus Pipeline, to run Web sites,
complete with advertising, on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   And Harvard University is currently pondering five paths it
could pursue in cyberspace, including a harvard.com venture that
would attempt to exploit for profit the school's platinum name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rule nothing out,'' Harvey Fineberg, Harvard's provost, told
the Boston Globe earlier this month. ``The boundaries between
for-profit and not-for-profit are much more flexible than they ever
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that the 56 million Americans between the ages
of 10 and 24 have some $278 billion of disposable income. About 5
million students are currently online, a number projected to
quadruple in the next three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The College Board's current Website, www.collegeboard.org, gets
about 50 million hits a month, officials said, and if current
trends hold, online registration for the Oct. 9 Scholastic
Assessment Tests will attract about 1 million students, or one out
of every three test-takers.
</P>
<P>
   But the current College Board site _ which will remain active
for guidance counselors and admissions officers _ is
``old-fashioned,'' Caperton said, filled with ``written stuff that
is put on the net.'' Plans for the new site are far more
interactive, with all the bells and whistles of the dot-com world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be innovative, aggressive, and use the same
kind of resources our competitors are using,'' Caperton said.
``This is an aggressive step. You've got to be aggressive in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The venture is a somewhat natural brainchild for Caperton, the
former Democratic governor of West Virginia, whose political legacy
was bringing computers to his state's impoverished schools. After
leaving office in 1996, he also focused on technology when he ran
the Institute on Education and Government at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a departure for the College Board, a membership
organization of some 3,300 schools and institutions that meets its
$250 million budget mainly through test-registration fees, dues and
sales of practice-exam books. It remains unclear what the role of
the colleges and other member institutions will be in the new
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to change the culture,'' said Donald M. Stewart,
Caperton's predecessor at the College Board, who ran the
organization for more than 12 years. ``Rather than having people as
volunteer educator-consultants, they'll have to be paid. If their
information and talent and ideas are being tapped for commercial
purposes, then this is a different culture. It's a different set of
incentives to participate.''

STANFORD WAKES UP UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ They did not highlight it on their schedules. They
did not talk about it during the long offseason hours in the weight
room. As recently as last weekend, in fact, the Bruins assigned
little significance to today's game at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late last Saturday night, a score arrived from Tucson _
Stanford 50, Arizona 22 _ and everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Bruins offensive tackle Brian Polak said.
``It really opened our eyes. It gave the game a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bruins coach Bob Toledo, Stanford's victory over Arizona
provided the best kind of motivation: external. He doesn't need to
conjure concern. It's written on the scoreboard above Arizona
Stadium and in the Pac-10 standings, which have Stanford, at 2-0,
in first place.
</P>
<P>
   With a victory today, the Cardinal would take early command of
the Rose Bowl race and the Bruins, in their conference opener,
would fall two games behind. In other words, they'd need help _
something they didn't get after losing the conference opener at
Washington State two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Stanford had lost (at Arizona), our guys would have looked
at it like, `They lost,' '' Toledo said. ``They definitely got our
attention. It's a big game for both teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on injuries and recent performance, it's also a bad
matchup for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (2-1) are without four of their top players:
quarterback Cory Paus, receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, guard Mike Saffer
and cornerback Jason Bell. Their quarterback, Drew Bennett, did not
play well in prior starts. Their big-play receivers, Danny Farmer
and Freddie Mitchell, are hobbling. Their offensive line hasn't
created running lanes and their cornerbacks are freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 60 players on the travel squad, the Bruins have seven
walk-ons, 15 freshmen and 25 sophomores. That means 78 percent of
Toledo's personnel has no scholarships, minimal experience, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stanford is the Pac-10's most experienced team, with
19 returning starters and 15 senior starters. The Cardinal has a
fabulous set of receivers _ including Troy Walters, the league's
best _ to exploit UCLA's rookie cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   It has a solid run defense (3.2 yards per carry) to smother
UCLA's inconsistent running game.
</P>
<P>
   And it has a veteran offensive line to protect quarterback Todd
Husak against UCLA's pass rush. If the Bruins don't pressure Husak,
he'll pick them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lead the league in (fewest) sacks allowed, and we lead
the league in least amount of sacks,'' Toledo said. ``We've got to
get pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Cardinal isn't as bad as it looked in a 69-17 loss
at Texas. But no one's quite sure if it's as good as it looked in
outscoring Washington State and Arizona 104-39.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word our writers used was enigma,'' Cardinal coach Tyrone
Willingham said. ``I think it's well-placed. I'll be very happy, if
we continue to win, to be an enigma.''
