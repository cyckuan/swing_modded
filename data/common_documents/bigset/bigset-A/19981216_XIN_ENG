<HEADLINE> Dole Urges Bipartisan Ending to Replace Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Bob Dole, the Republican
presidential candidate in 1996, is making a proposal to end the
impeachment battle, using a joint resolution of Congress to
censure U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for a tough but responsible conclusion," Dole
writes in an op-ed article in Tuesday's New York Times.
</P>
<P>
Dole says his plan blends responsibility and justice to bring
the matter to an end before the new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
Dole, the former Senate majority leader, says the House of
Representatives should vote on its proposed articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee last week.
</P>
<P>
However, Dole adds, "there is scarcely anyone who believes that
the required 67 senators would vote to convict the president on
any of the four articles of impeachment approved by the House
Judiciary Committee."
</P>
<P>
So, he suggests, regardless of the House vote later this week,
the Senate should take up a resolution containing the essence of
the impeachment articles, with no amendments allowed. Vice
President Al Gore should preside at the debate, Dole says, rather
than Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who would preside at a
Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
After action by the Senate, the resolution would then be sent
to the House of Representatives, where it would also be considered
without amendments.
</P>
<P>
Dole proposes that Clinton announce his intention to support
the resolution in advance. Clinton has already indicated he would
accept censure.
</P>
<P>
Once passed by both chambers, Dole says, the joint resolution
would be signed by Clinton at a public ceremony.
</P>
<P>
However, working out the legal and procedural detail for such
action would be complex, Dole writes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Insists Libya Meet Obligation on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States
reiterated Tuesday that Libya "meet its obligations" to try two
Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"Libya's clear obligation is to turn over the Lockerbie
suspects to the (U.N.) secretary general so they can be
transported to the Netherlands for trial before a Scottish court,"
White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to reports that Libya's People's Congress,
the country's top legislative body, said Tuesday that it was
satisfied with a plan to try the two suspects in the Lockerbie
bombing in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said he could not comment specifically on the news
reports about the Libyan People's Congress' response to the
U.S.-British suggestion that Lockerbie trial be held in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, that is what they need to do. Justice has been
delayed for almost 10 years in this case. It is time for Libya to
meet its obligations," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and the United States had made clear to Libya that
it must communicate through U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to
arrange the surrender of the two Libyan suspects in connection
with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
which 270 people died.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan People's Congress also called on the three parties
involved in the case, Libya, Britain and the United States, to
"remove any obstacle" preventing the trial going ahead as soon as
possible.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran will release a group of
Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) captured during their 1980-88
conflicts, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Public Relations Office of Iran's Prisoners Commission said
the Iraqi POWs are to be freed Wednesday at Iran-Iraq joint border
under an agreement recently reached in Tehran between officials of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the International Committee of Red Cross
and the two countries will attend the ceremony, IRNA said. But it
failed to give the number of POWs to be set free.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq reached an agreement in January to step up their
efforts to solve the remaining issues between them.
</P>
<P>
In April, 5,584 Iraqi POWs were swapped with 319 Iranians. They
also have exchanged the remains of several hundred Iranian and Iraqi
soldiers killed during the war since May.

<HEADLINE> Britain Launches Major Shake-up on Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government
announced its long-term sweeping reform on the pension system
Tuesday, encouraging everyone earning more than 9,000 pounds
(15,200 U.S. dollars) a year to have a secure, funded private
pension.
</P>
<P>
Social Security Secretary Alistair Darling told parliament that
5 million people would get a decent retirement income from the new
stakeholder Pension Scheme.
</P>
<P>
The State Earning-Related Pension Scheme would be abolished,
and replaced by the State Second Pension which would double the
SERPS's worth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The stakeholder pension was aimed at giving incentives to
moderate earners to save for their retirement, without being
subsidized by the better off.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme on pension reform was particularly keen on
encouraging the young to start planning their pensions as soon as
possible to help avoid poverty in old age.
</P>
<P>
According to the new plan, pensioners will get a Minimum Income
Guarantee of 20 percent of average earnings.
</P>
<P>
Carers and the disabled will get credit in the State Second
Pension.
</P>
<P>
Welfare reform has been trumpeted as a centerpiece of the
government's agenda. As the population ages, and national
insurance payments by the workforce fail to cover the state
pension, the bill has climbed to account for the lion's share of
the 100 billion pounds (168 billion dollars) Britain spends on
welfare each year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Lesotho Jointly Probe Border Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A joint operation
between Lesotho and South African police was established Tuesday
to investigate the killing of three South Africans on the border,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry said the South African High
Commissioner to Lesotho, Japhet Ndlovu, chaired a meeting in
Maseru on Tuesday between representatives of the Lesotho and
South African police.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides expressed their concern at the continuation of
cross border incidents and undertook to form a joint operation to
investigate these latest killings," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho police Tuesday confirmed that Lesotho Defense Force
(LDF) members were involved in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho police spokesman, Sekoateng Serabeli, said LDF members
killed three South Africans in the Quthing District in southern
Lesotho, after they allegedly stole livestock.
</P>
<P>
Serabeli said that a group of armed men from Matatiele in
South Africa's Eastern Cape reportedly crossed the border into
Lesotho on Saturday night and raided a cattle post.
</P>
<P>
The armed men seized about 64 sheep and goats and drove them
in the direction of Matatiele, he said.
</P>
<P>
Basotho villagers alerted members of the LDF who were on
patrol in the area.
</P>
<P>
The LDF patrol followed the alleged stock thieves and before
they left Lesotho territory there was an exchange of gunfire in
which the three South Africans were shot dead, Serabeli said.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers captured the animals and returned them to their
owners.
</P>
<P>
Serabeli said the rest of the group fled.
</P>
<P>
South African police, however, said they had received reports
contradicting Serabeli's claims that the farmers were stealing
livestock.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bertie von Litsenborgh said a group of about
23 farmers crossed the border in an attempt to retrieve stolen
livestock.
</P>
<P>
He said the bodies of three men had been recovered on the
South African side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Von Litsenborgh said post mortems would be conducted to
determine the cause of death.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Gulf War Syndrome to Tastes of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Tastes, sounds and smells of
the 1991 Gulf War may trigger the so-called Gulf War Syndrome,
British scientists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Smells of diesel fumes, oil, fire or anything linked with the
war, and traumatic memories could set off the the sickness
response in veterans, said Dr Eamonn Ferguson and colleagues from
The University of Nottingham.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that some of the symptoms associated
with Gulf War Syndrome could be based on an associative learning
mechanism, but that's not to say they are not real symptoms," they
said in a report presented to a meeting of the British
Psychological Society held in London.
</P>
<P>
Although the theory cannot fully account for Gulf War Syndrome,
the scientists said it could explain the recurring symptoms
veterans report years after they returned from the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
It may also help to treat the mysterious illness, which can
lead to chronic fatigue, asthma, depression, skin ailments and
other symptoms. The cause of the sickness has not yet been
identified.
</P>
<P>
"If it is an associative mechanism and people associate certain
memories, smells and tastes with feeling ill, then you can try to
identify and pair them with other pleasant stimuli to overcome
that link," the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 6,000 of the 51,000 British troops served
in the Gulf War are now found ill.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches "Crusade" Against Corrupt Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's police headquarters,
Scotland Yard, launched Tuesday one of the toughest ever
crackdowns against corrupt police officers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his new Corruption and Dishonesty Prevention
Strategy, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon said,
"This has been a crusade for me over the years."
</P>
<P>
He believed that up to 250 of his officers were corrupt and he
wanted to "break the cycle of corruption for ever," comparing
cycles of police corruption to economic cycles.
</P>
<P>
Sir Paul described the plan as "the most comprehensive
anti-corruption strategy that any force has ever had."
</P>
<P>
Part of the strategy includes expanding the work of undercover
officers within the force. Undercover officers are already used to
uncover dishonesty among colleagues, with members of the Yard's
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) offering bribes to other
officers.
</P>
<P>
This will be widened to include "integrity tests," aimed at
deducing an officer's honesty and ascertaining whether he or she
has racist or sexist attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Suspect officers will be tempted with financial or even sexual
inducements in a bid to test their integrity.
</P>
<P>
Sir Paul said that one officer had already been convicted of
theft using this method.
</P>
<P>
A confidential hotline will be set up to receive information
about suspected of stealing, drug-dealing or lying. But the Met's
chief stressed that honest officers had nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the alleged mischief or malpractice, we will
ruthlessly find ways of testing and establishing the truth and we
have the support of all our staff associations to do that."

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Summit Reached Agreement on Formation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on the modalities
for the formation of a government of national unity in Guinea
Bissau has been reached at the mini-summit of the Economic Community
of the West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar told
reporters in Togolese capital of Lome Tuesday, "We have
reached an agreement on the interim government of national unity"
in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, who left here Monday for the summit, said the
participants of the summit ended discussions in the early hours
of Tuesday and worked out a formula for sharing the positions of
the defense and interior ministries.
</P>
<P>
The two parties to the seven-month political crisis in the
west African country are expected to return to their country and
prepare for the implementation of the outstanding aspects of the
Abuja peace accord signed on November 1, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said the summit called by ECOWAS
Chairman, Togolese President Ghassingbe Eyadema, was aimed at
resolving the disagreement over the composition of the government
of national unity as provided for by the Abuja accord signed by
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Contentious areas include control of the defense and interior
ministry portfolios between President Bemard Vieira and rebel
leader General Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
Details of an interposition force of the west African
peacekeeping forces ECOMOG to replace Guinean and Senegalese
troops already in the country are to be worked out, said
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit reviewed the progress in the implementation
of the Abuja peace accord under which a government of national
unity will be formed and an ECOMOG special task force will be
deployed in Guinea Bissau to take over from Guinean and
Senegalese troops.
</P>
<P>
Four west African countries of Niger, Togo, Benin and Gambia
have pledged a total of 1,450 troops for the peacekeeping mission
in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief of Army Staff General Mane led a rebellion
against President Vieira in June after he was sacked by the
latter for alleged involvement of senior army officers in arms
smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls For U.N., World Bank Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- One of the challenges for
Nigeria's foreign policy in the 21st century is to continue to
demand for the reform of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods
Institutions.
</P>
<P>
Nigerias Permanent Representative to the United Nations
Ambassador Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, was speaking Monday at the
Ahmadu Bello University in Kaduna State, northern Nigeria, the
New Nigerian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigeria needed to remain actively engaged with
the United Nations and utilize the opportunity for fashioning a
new and just world order as we enter the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that Nigeria would work with others to
ensure that the United Nations became "a more credible agent" for
the promotion of development.
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, the world organization has recorded more
success in political matters and peace keeping than in the
development agenda.
</P>
<P>
"This is due, in part, to the structural deficiency in the
United Nations system whereby the Bretton Woods Institutions (IMF
and World Bank) are allowed to dominate global economic and
financial agenda and policies," Gambari stressed.
</P>
<P>
Gambari maintained that these international financial
institutions are "long over due for radical reform", adding that
the institutions have been less than effective in dealing with
the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Nigeria are advocating for the reform and
democratization of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods
Institutions as the sole reform of the Security Council is
incomplete, he argued.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the Security Council acts on behalf of the
entire members of the United Nations, its composition is now
"clearly unfair, unjust and out of date".
</P>
<P>
African is the only continent without a permanent seat in the
Security Council, said Gambari. The Organization of African Unity
has adopted a common position on the issue with a demand for two
permanent seats allocated to the continent, he added.

<HEADLINE> French Report Denies Involvement in Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A French parliamentary mission
in charge of investigating the role played by France before and
during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda Tuesday rejected accusations
that Paris was involved in the killings against Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by the president of the mission, former
Socialist minister Paul Quiles, said that France was "not at all
involved" in the genocide, in which nearly a million Tutsis and
moderate Hutus were massacred by the militias and soldiers
supporting the former Hutu regime of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
But the report admitted that France "found itself trapped by
its own strategy and manipulated by the (Rwandan) power" under
President Juvenal Habyarimana, who was killed when his helicopter
was shot down on April 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The death of Habyarimana triggered waves of massacres against
Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
"They were the Rwandans who, during several weeks, killed other
Rwandans in atrocious conditions that we know," said the report.
"At the moment they came out, France is not at all involved in
this outburst of violence."
</P>
<P>
Pierre Brana, one of the two drafters of the report, said that
France "underestimated the threats of a possible genocide in
Rwanda" while there were clear signs about it.
</P>
<P>
Brana, who is a Socialist deputy at the National Assembly, said
France had also failed to call for "with sufficient strength" the
democratization of the regime of Habyarimana.
</P>
<P>
He said France read the situation in Rwanda "through an
anti-Tutsi curtain" as Paris considered the Tutsis to be the
"flagship" of Uganda and American-British influence in the Great
Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the French military of supporting a
"mono-ethnic Rwandan army" in the military cooperation between
France and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Italian Figure Criticizes U.N. Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The head of an Italian
humanitarian organization Tuesday described the U.N. sanctions
clamped on Iraq as an organized genocide against the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference, Fabio Alberti, President of the "Bridge
to Baghdad" organization said that the eight-year-long
U.N. sanctions against Iraq had caused severe problems in raising
the children's mortality rates and had deprived the Iraqis of
their life-sustaining needs.
</P>
<P>
Alberti said that his non-governmental organization has been
conducting humanitarian activities in Iraq since 1992 in the
fields of health, education and water treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people's hardships should be mitigated, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait, which cannot be lifted unless U.N. arms
inspectors verify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Alberti headed a 14-member delegation which is composed of
medical and scientific personnel from an Italian university.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, the organization signed an agreement with Iraqi
al-Mustansiriyah University regarding their educational, medical
and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of another Italian university is expected to visit
Baghdad next February, he added.

TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday protested the recent
remarks by German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping on Iran's
threat to international security.
</P>
<P>
Scharping said recently in an interview with Munich-based
daily Suddeutsche Zeitung that some countries including Iran have
posed a serious threat to the international security.
</P>
<P>
Asefi termed Scharping's remarks as "baseless hostile charges"
against Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that a minister of an European country, which
is member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), does
not differentiate between a popular government and a dictatorial
one and made hostile statements against Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi believed that Scharping's remarks aimed to justify the
NATO expansion, which he said is against Islamic states.

<HEADLINE> French PM Calls on Youths in Toulouse to Calm Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin Tuesday called on the youths of Toulouse, who rioted over
the past two days after a 17-year-old was shot dead by police, to
calm down and keep faith in the judicial authorities of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with RTL radio, Jospin said that Interior
Minister Jean-Jack Queyranne has the "impression that things
should not have happened as they did" when Habib Muhammed was shot
dead by police who tried to stop him from stealing a car before
dawn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that police are doing a very difficult job making
people respect the law.
</P>
<P>
Outraged youths rampaged through the working districts of
Toulouse Sunday and Monday evenings, burning buses and cars and
throwing rocks and gas bombs to stop anti-riot police forces.
</P>
<P>
They accused police of deliberately letting Habib die by
leaving him uncared for hours before sending him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
One of the unidentified policemen involved in the shooting was
accused of "involuntary homicide" by the authorities Tuesday, and
the family of Habib's has launched a judicial suit against "X."
</P>
<P>
Another policeman was detained and a head of the police unit
involved in the accident suspended.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are awaiting the results of an autopsy on Habib to
decide whether the shooting was deliberate or accidental.
</P>
<P>
Police officers said the shot which killed Habib was a stray
bullet.

<P>
ATHENS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos will visit the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia later this month, said a Foreign Ministry statement
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, which will start on December 22, Pangalos
will have talks with Macedonian government officials on relations
between the two neighboring countries and the situation in the
Balkan region as well as international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Macedonia have been strained since
the latter's independence from Belgrade in 1991 because Athens and
Skopje failed to reach agreement on the name of Macedonia, which
Greece says implies Macedonia's territorial claims for one of its
provinces of the same name.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disputes between the two countries concerning the
name of Macedonia, both Greece and Macedonia have in recent years
made efforts to improve their bilateral ties, especially in the
economic field.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the forthcoming visit by Pangalos to
Macedonia is a major step made by Athens in improving its ties
with Skopje.

<P>
HARARE, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National AIDS
Coordinating Program (NACP) Tuesday said its intensive campaigns
against HIV/AIDS have achieved 90 percent awareness about the
pandemic currently claiming 700 lives each week.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report released in Harare, NACP said it used a
variety of radio channels and mobilized different organizations
to create an effective awareness about the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 25 percent of Zimbabwe's 12 million population is
believed to be infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
To intensify its campaigns on the need for people to change
their sexual behavior, NACP launched an AIDS action program to
cater for students in primary, secondary and tertiary
institutions throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The organization also collaborated with some government
departments which included the Ministry of Information, Posts and
Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture to
strengthen communication about AIDS among farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Currently the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture runs an
sexually transmitted diseases education program in all the six
agricultural colleges and consultations are in progress with the
Zimbabwe Farmers Union to try and explore feasible ways of
enhancing awareness among small and communal farmers," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
There are over 90 non-governmental and AIDS service
organizations and 50 support groups for people living with AIDS
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Plan to Ban Elderly Drivers Dropped in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's government dropped proposals to ban elderly drivers
Tuesday amid massive opposition from senior German citizens,
automobile clubs and the Free Democratic Party (FDP).
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Franz Muentefering had said there should be
a maximum age for driving a car just as there was a minimum age
for getting a driving license.
</P>
<P>
But this proved hugely unpopular in the nation which invented
the Autobahn highway and produces Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz
cars.
</P>
<P>
"This is a totally nonsensical idea which treats elderly people
like underage children," raged Roswitha Verhuelsdonk, chairwoman
of Germany's Federal Association of Senior Citizen Groups, which
has 10 million members, said media reports here.
</P>
<P>
The German Automobile Club said the plan amounted to "house
arrest" for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the storm, Muentefering swiftly dropped the idea.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to set an exact year.... Everyone must just ask
themselves if they are fit for driving," he told Deutsche Presse
Agentur.
</P>
<P>
The opposition FDP), which calls for a reduced state role, had
also opposed the senior citizen driving ban and cheered the
center-left government's reverse.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal showed how the Red-Green coalition understands
the role of the state and society: the state takes over almost all
authority from its legally incapacitated subjects," said an FDP
statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan minister has
resigned for being politically responsible for the impropriety in
the country's privatization process of parastatals.
</P>
<P>
Mathrw Rukikaire, state minister in charge of privatization,
made the announcement at the parliament Tuesday afternoon after
defending himself before a select committee.
</P>
<P>
In his defense, Rukikaire denied the charges of impropriety in
the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
In the sale of Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB), he said, only
Westmont Holdings, a Malaysian company, should be held
responsible for its wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with the Ugandan government, the Malaysian
company as a buyer is not allowed to sell the 49 percent shares
in the UCB to a third interested party unless approved by the
Ugandan authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian company sold the shares it had bought in the UCB
to Greenland Investments, a company in which Salim Saleh,
President Yoweri Museveni's younger brother, was a shareholder
and which was disqualified by Bank of Uganda as a bidder for the
UCB.
</P>
<P>
In a privatization probe report by the parliamentary select
committee, some ministers were found to be complicated with the
matter, triggering a public outcry for the exposure of the UCB
sale process and the sacking of the ministers involved.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Encouraged by Libyan Response on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Tuesday he was encouraged by reports that Libya's
top legislative body voiced its satisfaction with plans for a
trial of two Lockerbie bombing suspects in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
But Annan told reporters that more details were needed and he
was waiting to speak to Libya's U.N. Ambassador Abuzed Omar Dorda,
who is currently in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is encouraging. I think it is in the right
direction. But I won't say more until I have spoken to the
(Libyan) ambassador," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When I hear from the ambassador, I will discuss with the
ambassadors from the key countries involved and also give a
briefing to the Security Council," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman told a news briefing that Annan,
who learned the positive Libyan response only from press reports
at the moment, said he would like to have some clarification from
the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan General People's Congress stated it was satisfied
with plans for a trial of two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, due to be held in
the Netherlands, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Congress also called on the three parties involved --
Libya, Britain and the United States -- to "remove any obstacle"
preventing the trial from going ahead as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London led the way in getting the U.N. Security
Council to impose sanctions on Libya in 1992 for its failure to
hand over the two accused for trial in either country on charges
of planting a bomb aboard Pan Am flight 103 which exploded over
Lockerbie on December 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
But in August this year, the two countries agreed to Libya's
stated willingness for a trial to be held under Scottish law,
before a Scottish judge, in a neutral country and agreed to a
venue in the Netherlands. This was seen as a positive development
around the decade-long issue.
</P>
<P>
Libya then sought clarification of a number of issues and said
that the two Libyans, if convicted, should serve their sentences
in the Netherlands, rather than in Scotland, as Britain and the
United States continue to insist.
</P>
<P>
Annan visited Libya 10 days ago to try to settle remaining
issues with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. But Libyan news media
reports said it was the Congress, not Gaddafi, whose approval was
needed.

<TEXT>

DAR ES SALAAM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has not
completed investigating the case of bombing United States embassy
in Dar es Salaam four months ago, Tanzanian police said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Inspector of Police, Fulgence Ngonyani, told the Kisutu
Magistrate Court in Dar es Salaam that the police force is still
investigating the two suspects in connection with the bombing
which took place on Agust 7.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, an Egyptian
national, and Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian, who are alleged to
have participated in the bombing in which 11 people were killed
and more than 70 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
Adjourning the case, the Principal Resident Magistrate Gabriel
Rwakibarila told the court that the original file of the case is
still at the High Court following an appeal made by the first
suspect's defense advocate, Abdul Mwengera.
</P>
<P>
Mwengera had appealed to the High Court to object the Kisutu
Magistrate Court's decision of allowing his client, Mustafa
Mahmoud, to be handed back to the police for further
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
He has also objected to the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI)'s participation in interrogations as there is
no law that allows them to operate in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, both of the suspects have already been interrogated
by the police and the FBI. The case will come up for another
mention on December 28.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Parties to Respect DRCongo Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa urged all parties involved in the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCongo) to honor the ceasefire
reached last month and called for withdrawal of foreign troops
from the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that all the parties abide by a ceasefire and
that foreign troops withdraw from DRCongo," Moussa said Tuesday
before leaving for Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to attend a meeting
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The 16-member mechanism of OAU for controlling, preventing and
settling disputes will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss ways of
ending the four-month fighting between troops loyal to DRCongo
President Laurent Kabila and the Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the country "remains serious," especially
after the failure to convene a summit on the issue in Lusaka,
Zambia as scheduled, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 12 African countries had been scheduled to meet in
Lusaka on Tuesday in a bid to find a solution to the issue.
However, the meeting was postponed, reportedly because of the
objection of South Africa, which insisted on the participation of
DRCongo rebels in the summit.
</P>
<P>
The African mechanism will discuss the ceasefire, its
monitoring and prospects for the withdrawal of foreign troops and
the security guarantees, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, leaders of
DRCongo, Rwanda and Uganda reached a ceasefire in Paris on
November 28 to end the crisis. The agreement is expected to be
signed before the Ouagadougou meeting of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has repeatedly accused Rwanda and Uganda of sending
troops into his country to fight against him and called on them to
pull back troops.
</P>
<P>
But Rwanda and Uganda have denied the charges, saying they are
just supporting the rebels, who are trying to topple the "corrupt
government" of Kabila.

<HEADLINE> France Arms Rwanda But Does Not Violate Embargo: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- France regularly and legally
provided arms and ammunition to the former Hutu regime of Rwanda,
but did not violate the U.N. arms embargo on the central African
country, which was imposed in early April 1994, said a
parliamentary report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The French authorities held to it that the Rwandan armed
forces be always regularly provided with ammunition during the
serious offensives launched by the RPF (Tutsi-led Rwandan
Patriotic Front)," said the 370-page report, which contributed 10
pages to this subject.
</P>
<P>
France provided the Hutu armed forces of Rwanda with weapons
and ammunition from 1990 to 1993, when the RPF launched its first
offensive on October 1, 1990, which was followed by two other
major offensives in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
In February 1993, the chief of staff of the French armed forces
stopped providing "sensitive ammunition" to the Rwandan Armed
Forces, the Hutu-led government troops, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The last cargo of French weapons was sent on April 6, 1994, the
day when Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in an
attack on his helicopter, it added.
</P>
<P>
From January 1990 to April 1994, France sent three Gazelle SA
342 military helicopters equipped with rocket-launching cannons,
two missile launchers, six radars and a lot of weapons and
ammunition, said the report, presented Tuesday afternoon by the
president of the parliament mission on Rwanda, former Socialist
minister Paul Quiles.
</P>
<P>
The report said that France was not the only country which
provided Rwandan government forces with arms, as South Africa,
Egypt, Russia and Israel were also among the weapon providers.
</P>
<P>
The report said that there was no evidence that France ever
violated a U.N. embargo on Rwanda by sending weapons after April
8, 1994.
</P>
<P>
"No evidence of a violation of the embargo and the illegal
exports of arms... has been shown," said the report.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Cyprus' Sides Not to Increase Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan has urged both parties in Cyprus to avoid any actions which
might increase tension, in order not to jeopardize possible
progress on Cyprus issue, Cyprus News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated December 14, addressed to the president of
the U.N. Security Council, Annan welcomed the progress achieved so
far in efforts for finding a solution to the Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Annan describes progress in "shuttle talks" undertaken by the
resident representative Dame Ann Hercus, as "a significant
contribution to the maintenance of peace and security in the
region."
</P>
<P>
He says that "he is encouraged by the constructive manner" in
which both sides are engaging in these talks" and considers
"positive that both leaders have respected the confidentiality of
the talks."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup. The U.N.-led efforts
to reunite Cyprus have so far yielded no results.
</P>
<P>
Annan points out that the elements which are being discussed
include a commitment to reject the use of force or the threat of
use of force, a commitment to the prevention of further expansion
of military forces and armaments as well as the consequent
principle of substantial reciprocal reductions.
</P>
<P>
They also include "a confirmation of agreement to the
U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus package of measures aimed at
reducing tensions along the ceasefire lines and further possible
steps, including demining."
</P>
<P>
The process of "shuttle talks" began on October 16, 1998 after
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash agreed at separate meetings in New York with the
U.N. chief to cooperate in this effort.

<HEADLINE> French Report on Rwanda Raps U.S. "Obstruction" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A French parliamentary report on
the 1994 genocide in Rwanda published Tuesday criticized the
United States for "obstructing" the United Nations from
intervening in Rwanda when a genocide was taking place there.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by a French National Assembly
investigation mission on the role played by France in Rwanda
during the genocide, said Washington opposed intervention by the
U.N. in Rwanda out of "both political and budgetary reasons."
</P>
<P>
"The United States militated, in the wake of the event of April
6, 1994, for a pure and simple withdrawal of the United Nations
Intermediary Mission in Rwanda, and delayed as long as it could to
introduce the word `genocide' in a resolution of the Security
Council, in fear of a massive U.N. intervention," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in an attack
on his helicopter on April 6, 1994. This triggered the waves of
killings committed by Hutu militias and soldiers against Tutsis
and Hutu moderates.
</P>
<P>
Describing the role played by the U.S. in the solution to the
Rwandan crisis as "above all negative," the French report said
that the United States did not have its national interests in
Rwanda, as no American company ever invested in the country in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Parliament Conditionally Approves Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Libya's parliament on Tuesday
said some obstacles must be overcome before the country would hand
over the two suspects of the Lockerbie bombing for trial.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Libyan legislature gave conditional
approval for the trial of the two Libyan suspects, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
A statement read at the televised session of the General
People's Congress, which concluded its eight-day session Tuesday,
welcomed the agreement with the United States and Britain on
trying the two Libyans in a third, neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on all sides to "work on removing any
obstacles preventing the two suspects from standing trial as soon
as possible." It did not explicate what the obstacles were.
</P>
<P>
Libya has accepted in principle a plan to try the two suspects
before a panel of Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Hague,
the Netherlands, but demanded that the two men, if convicted,
serve the prison terms in Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain insist, however, that the two men, Abdel
Basset al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, be jailed in Britain
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Libyan media earlier suggested that only the parliament has the
authority to make decisions on the transference of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 blast of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland
killed 270 people, including all the passengers, crew and other on
the ground. Both the U.S. and Britain accused the two Libyans of
involvement in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed arms and travel embargo on
Libya in 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects for
trial. The council adopted a resolution early this year to lift
sanctions once the suspects were transferred to the Netherlands.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday hailed the talks between Cyprus's Greek and
Turkish communities which were aimed at reducing tensions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the Security Council, Annan
said he was encouraged by the talks and he also urged both sides
to avoid any actions which might increase tension, including by
further expansion of military forces and armaments.
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the constructive manner in which both Mr.

in the region. I commend the two leaders for the statesmanship and
vision which they are showing," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said both sides had made clear their commitment to
avoiding tension, building peace in Cyprus and the region, and
achieving an overall settlement of the Cyprus problem by peaceful
means.

and in order not to jeopardize possible progress, he was urging
both parties to promote a climate of reconciliation and genuine
mutual confidence and, in particular, to avoid any actions which

former New Zealand government minister Ann Hercus, began on
October 16. She has been holding separate meetings with President
Clafcos Clerides, as head of the Greek Cyprus community, and

<HEADLINE> Tornado Kills 13 in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people were
killed and more than 150 others injured when a freak tornado
swept over the town of Umtata in South Africa's Eastern Cape
Province Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, who was visiting the
town when the tornado hit, narrowly escaped the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The storm came without any warning and trees were uprooted and
building roofs blown off, South African television SABC said.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit was the main taxi rank in Umtata, where cars
were hit by falling trees and people were forced to seek cover
from flying debris.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was trapped in a pharmacy where he was on a shopping
trip at about 3:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
He was told to lie on the ground by his security personnel and
they covered him with their bodies while the storm ravaged the
pharmacy and surrounding buildings.
</P>
<P>
The door and windows of the pharmacy were shattered by the
force of the storm and part of the roof caved in, according to
Mandela's spokeswoman, Priscilla Naidoo. Mandela was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
The casualties were expected to rise as rescue workers were
sifting through damaged houses to search people who were
reportedly missing.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people injured streamed to the Umtata General
Hospital, which was itself seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
Police were deployed to stop the looting of shops and four
looters were arrested outside a shop Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Clinton Achieves No Obvious Progress in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
wrapped up his three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas
Tuesday afternoon without breaking the stalemate in the
implementation of the peace accord he helped broker in October.
</P>
<P>
He achieved his main goal of the trip when the Palestine
National Council agreed in his presence Monday to revoke the
clauses in the Palestinian national charter calling for
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
But on a broader sense, the trip can hardly be seen as a
success.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's visit came at a time when Israel and the
Palestinians ran into a dispute over the release of Palestinian
prisoners, which has incurred violent clashes and the Israeli
suspension of the implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has turned his trip from an originally-designed
celebration of the peace accord to a salvage mission.
</P>
<P>
In his talks and speeches in Israel and in the
Palestinian-rule Gaza, Clinton appealed to both sides to implement
the difficult decisions they made two months ago, urging them to
stick to what they have agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
He managed to bring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
together for a three-way meeting at the Erez border crossing
Tuesday morning, but failed to iron out the outstanding disputes
between them.
</P>
<P>
After the 90-minute meeting, Clinton said that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been put back on track, but
added that there are still several issues to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
Amid widespread violence, which was sparked by Israel's
refusal to release Palestinian political prisoners, and other
alleged Palestinian violations, Netanyahu ordered to suspend
further troop withdrawal last week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton apparently failed to persuade the prime minister, who
faces strong pressure from the hardliners in his coalition, to
agree to carry out the second stage of three withdrawals
stipulated by the agreement on Friday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
On the prisoners issue, which he described as "difficult and
sensitive," Clinton said the two sides has agreed to set up a
formal channel to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu reiterated after the meeting that Israel will
never release those jailed Palestinians who killed Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He also listed a series of demands which he said the
Palestinians have to meet before any further Israeli withdrawal,
vowing that Israel will not bow to external pressures, an
apparent reference to Washington.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the meeting, several steering committees on
various issues in the Wye agreement have been established and
their heads, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, began their first meeting
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But gaps on issues such as the collection of illegal weapons
and the halting of alleged anti-Israel incitement, remain
huge. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will return to
the region in a few weeks to help narrow the differences.
</P>
<P>
For the Palestinians, however, Clinton's visit will surely be
remembered as a historic event.
</P>
<P>
Landing at the newly-opened Gaza international airport Monday
morning, Clinton became the first sitting U.S. president who has
ever set foot on the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Most Palestinians believe that his visit to Gaza and the West
Bank town of Bethlehem symbolizes a tacit U.S. recognition of
their aspiration for an independent state. Israeli officials also
acknowledged this, although they reacted bitterly.
</P>
<P>
In a further evidence to this belief, Clinton said at a
luncheon with Arafat Monday that it was time for the Palestinians
to determine their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to hundreds of Palestinians Monday, Clinton did not
discourage statehood hopes. He said that he sought "legitimate
rights for Palestinians" along with "real security for Israel."
</P>
<P>
To put a good face on his trip, Clinton said after the
three-way summit Tuesday morning that he has achieved what he
came here to achieve. But observers hold that this was in fact a
vague assessment which can be interpreted very differently.

<HEADLINE> Proposal for DSP Minority Government Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
designate Bulent Ecevit failed to secure adequate support for his
second proposal for a minority government.
</P>
<P>
The failure came after he held talks with Republican People's
Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal Tuesday afternoon on the proposal
to form a minority government of his Democratic Left Party (DSP).
</P>
<P>
After nearly two weeks of trying to come up with an acceptable
government formula, Ecevit's new proposal was rejected by the CHP,
whose support for the DSP minority government is vital.
</P>
<P>
After the True Path Party (DYP) led by former Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller rejected the first proposal for a coalition to be
formed by the Motherland Party (ANAP), the DYP and the DSP, Ecevit
met with Baykal at the parliament building to discuss the
possibility of the DSP minority government.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was charged by President Suleyman Demirel on December 2
to form a 56th government after the government of Mesut Yilmaz
collapsed in a no-confidence vote in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Although Ecevit had managed to gain the support of his former
coalition partners ANAP and the Democratic Turkey Party (DTP),
Baykal refused to back the minority government.
</P>
<P>
However, Baykal submitted a proposal for the "CHP-DSP left
bloc" minority government. But Ecevit said that Baykal's proposal
would lead to a left-right polarization that could be
counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish constitution requires a designated prime minister
to form a new government within 45 days.

CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Ministry of Health
is taking precautionary measures against possible cholera spread
in the country via travelers from Iraq, an official said Tuesday.

WHO has demanded to beef up checkup for the people coming from
Iraq via Damascus, Syria or Amman, Jordan after the outbreak of
cholera in northern Iraq, the news agency said.

An official at Cairo international airport said the doctors in
the airport quarantine submit the passengers from Damascus and
Amman to medical examinations and dispose of all their food.

<HEADLINE> More Namibians Seek Refuge in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of Namibians
fleeing from the northeastern Caprivi Strip into Botswana has now
increased to 1,200 from 849 two weeks ago, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Many of the asylum seekers, most of whom were being housed in
the Dukwe refugee camp north of the Botswana's capital Gaborone,
told Botswana officials they were fleeing harassment and
intimidation by Namibian security forces.
</P>
<P>
About 100 of the refugees claim to be members of a military
movement fighting for the secession of the Caprivi territory from
the rest of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan government said it hoped Namibian officials, who
were due to visit the camp this week, would convince the majority
of the refugees who have not formally sought asylum that it would
be safe for them to return home.
</P>
<P>
Those who have crossed the border since last October include
the former leader of the opposition Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, Mishake Muyongo, Senator Francis Sizimbo, Caprivi Strip
Governor John Mabuku, and a traditional leader, Boniface Mamila.
</P>
<P>
Branded as "terrorists" by the Namibian government, they are
currently in Gaborone after being released on bail, pending
charges of entering the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan President Festus Mogae was quoted as saying earlier
this week: "None of the refugees will be forced to go back, and
each case will be dealt with individually."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Cancels Visa for Qataris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- In a further step to improve the
bilateral relations, Cairo has decided to cancel the visa imposed
on the Qatari citizens who want to visit Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister for Arab Affairs Sayyed Abu
Zeid said on Tuesday that the Qataris are allowed to enter Egypt
without prior entry visas, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid did not say when Egypt made the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Qataris will be granted a six-month residence once they
arrive at the airport, an official at Cairo international airport
said on Monday, adding that they will be treated in the same way
as other Arabs who visit Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The fees imposed on the visas for Qataris will also be
canceled, an official at Cairo international airport said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian authorities welcome the Qatari nationals in Egypt,
their second homeland," the official said. "They are accorded a
special treatment at the airport," he added without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Qatar soured in November last
year after Cairo joined other countries in boycotting the Middle
East and North Africa Economic Conference hosted by Doha.
</P>
<P>
Egypt imposed entry visa on Qataris after Qatar expelled
Egyptian workers in the Gulf sheikdom.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have expressed readiness to contain the
disputes and taken steps aimed at improving the ties. Qatar has
allowed Egyptians to resume work in the Gulf country.

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Hesitates at Ratification of START-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma should
consider the ratification of the START-2 treaty, Russian First
Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov stressed Tuesday immediately after
the Duma Council put off the discussion of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Duma Council on Tuesday again postponed the decision on the
ratification of the START-2, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov said the START-2 is a touchstone for Russian foreign
policy strategy in the world community. "Americans have not been
speaking of the treaty at all during the past six months, while
the communist Maslyukov has been advocating its speedy
enforcement."
</P>
<P>
Russia needs speedy ratification of the treaty, he said,
because in the next 10 years it will be incapable of maintaining
nuclear parity with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"Due to chronic underfunding, Russian nuclear deterrence forces
and auxiliary systems have degraded to the point that they may
fully disappear by the year 2010," Maslyukov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has not been updating its nuclear missile potential for
almost ten years, he noted. In 2007 Russia will have 1,500 nuclear
warheads on combat duty compared to 5,500 in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The first deputy prime minister pointed out that for the U.S.,
Russia's failure to ratify START-2 is a stimulus for withdrawing
from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty (ABM), so Russia should
not only speed up ratification, but also immediately begin talks
on START-3.
</P>
<P>
He said after ratification Russia will be able to concentrate
on the development of the elements of its nuclear triad which will
guarantee the maximum effectiveness of its nuclear umbrella.
</P>
<P>
However, the dominating in the State Duma Communist group wants
to get answers to at least two questions: how Russia is going to
be guaranteed against the loss of its nuclear potential as a
result of arms cuts, and how the program is going to be financed.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax quoted chief commander of the Russian Strategic
Missile Force Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev as saying the arguments
were related to technical matters and opponents to ratification
spoke against the early withdrawal of missiles from combat duty.
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev said "We are not withdrawing a single missile
prematurely and will withdraw them as their service life expires
before January 1, 2007."

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy to Revive in Three Years: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight percent of
Japanese businessmen who replied on a survey predicted that the
Thai economy will recover in three years.
</P>
<P>
The survey, made public here Wednesday, said Japanese
businessmen believe that the textile, retail, finance and
securities, as well as insurance sectors will recover within two
years.
</P>
<P>
Hajime Kuwata, president of the Japan External Trade
Organization, and head of the Survey Committee of the Japanese
Chamber of Commerce, said 39 percent of the respondents believed
that the Thai economy would improve next year, compared with 26
percent who had expected the economy to improve in the second half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one percent forecast a continued decline in 1999,
compared with 49 percent who thought the slide would continue
until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent predicted a recovery in five years.
</P>
<P>
Hajime said confidence was boosted mainly by the stability of
the baht, declining interest rates, as well as measures to
stimulate domestic consumption and promote exports.
</P>
<P>
He said that next year Japanese companies in Thailand would
increase their exports earnings to 70 percent from 69 percent of
total revenue.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that most Japanese businessmen believed
Thailand's largest export market for all types of goods next year
would remain Japan, followed by Southeast Asian nations, Europe
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hajime said the rise in exports to Japan was because parent
companies in Japan had reduced domestic production and had
switched to imports from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed more than 50 percent of respondents
believed their companies would report profits for 1998, while 34
percent forecast losses.
</P>
<P>
About 58 percent expected profits to decline next year, while
47 percent had difficulty in raising money for business purposes
because of tight credit and flagging sales, as well as delays in
receiving payments and refunds of value-added tax.

<HEADLINE> Building Collapse Kills Nine in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Nine people have been officially
confirmed killed by a five-story apartment building which
collapsed here early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
A child was among the victims pulled out of the razed building,
which housed five families with a total of 38 people. The number
of victims is expected to rise because no one has been found alive
in late morning.
</P>
<P>
The building, located in southwestern Rome, collapsed shortly
after 3:00 a.m. (local time) Wednesday. Neighbors of the building
said they heard no explosion, only a prolonged thud.
</P>
<P>
Police and firemen have rushed to the scene and begun
searching for any possible survivors. All gas pipelines in the
vicinity were closed to avoid any risk of explosion.
</P>
<P>
Police said they ruled out explosion because the building
appeared to implode rather than explode. This was backed up by
the fact that all the automobiles in the area, although covered
with dust, had their windshields intact.
</P>
<P>
Rome's Fire Brigade General Inspector Salvatore Fiadini
described the collapse as "unusual" and believed it was caused by
a settling of the ground beneath the building.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I've never seen anything like that," he said. "It
is unusual because it is normal that at least some of the
structure remains standing. Instead, here the whole structure
gave way."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the whole five-story structure, was reduced to rubble
measuring only two meters in height.

<HEADLINE> Historians Commemorate General Chang Hsueh-liang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Historians gathered in
Shenyang today to commemorate the 70th anniversary of General
Chang Hsueh-liang's December 28, 1928, vow of subservience to the
Nationalist Regime.
</P>
<P>
The group of over 100 historians from China, Japan, the United
States and the Republic of Korea attended the commemoration
ceremonies held the capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Chang's vow of subservience to the Nationalist Regime led by
Chiang Kai-shek marked an end to China's 20 year period of
separation, and brought an end to rampant warfare waged by feudal
warlords, according to Professor Zhang Deliang, chairman of the
China Zhang Xueliang Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Chang (1898-) carried the nickname "Young Marshal" and was the
son of Zhang Zuolin who was once known as the "King of Northeast
China".
</P>
<P>
The younger Chang graduated from the Mukden Military Academy
and served as Commander in Chief in Manchuria after Japanese
militarists assassinated his father 1928.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek promoted Zhang the rank of general and assigned
him to command the Dongbei Army. Chang was ardently anti-Japanese
and joined General Yang Hucheng in launching the Xi'an Incident on
December 12, 1936. The two generals arrested Chiang Kai-shek and
held the Nationalist leader prisoner for over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He was relieved of command and was placed under house arrest
in Taipei between 1946 and 1961. Zhang is currently 98 years
old and lives in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
He also worked diligently to accelerate modernization in
northeast China in order to strengthen resistance against invading
Japanese forces.
</P>
<P>
General Chang was not only instrumental in the establishment
of China's first international radio station and production of the
nation's first heavy-duty truck, but also played an important role
in the construction railways and the development of education.

<HEADLINE> Russian Pensioners Struggle for Survival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-eight-year-old veteran
Fedor Nikolaevich has long stopped counting on his meager pension
of 400 rubles. It usually comes, if at all, several months late.
</P>
<P>
Every day in the early morning, Fedor trudges from his home in
suburban Moscow to a city market with a big basket, by bus, then
electric train and metro.
</P>
<P>
In the market, Fedor sells his homegrown vegetables and
handpicked mushrooms in exchange for a few rubles to make ends
meet. When night falls, he goes back, hungry and cold, with more
hard days ahead.
</P>
<P>
Like the country's other 34 million pensioners, Fedor's lot has
worsened since August, when the government gave up propping up the
ruble and effectively defaulted on some domestic and foreign debts
in the worst financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Their 400-ruble pensions, already below the official poverty
line of 663 rubles (September figure) and used to worth over 60
U.S. dollars, has dropped to 20 dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Statistics Committee, the number of
people living below the poverty line has jumped 42 percent to
44.3 million from last year's 31 million.
</P>
<P>
Life is no better for retired intellectuals like 72-year-old
Peter Usdzin and his wife, who used to work with Russia's
Asia-Africa Institute. Their two monthly pensions of 818 rubles
(about 40 dollars) can hardly sustain them and an invalid son, who
was brain-damaged from early childhood.
</P>
<P>
"We pay 170 rubles for gas, water, electricity and other fees
every month. After that, our money is only enough for some food,"
Peter said, "We live frugally, almost buy no meat or fruit."
</P>
<P>
Peter, recuperating from lung cancer, also has to worry about
how to pay for his medicine.
</P>
<P>
Russia imports nearly 70 percent of its medicine, including all
of the insulin required by diabetics and most of its heart drugs.
As the ruble has collapsed, the costs of imports have soared.
</P>
<P>
Since August, Moscow has been unable to keep up with the
spiraling cost of imported medicine and has reduced its subsidies
to the city's pharmacies, making it rough for the elderly to find
drugs they can afford.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Science Institute, 43 out of every 100
pensioners need medical attention. Though pensioners can see
doctors for free, they cannot afford the ever more expensive
medicine.
</P>
<P>
For 75-year-old Lidia Chemiakova, who worked all her life as a
loader in the local House Building Complex, life is a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
"Do you ask me how I'm living? Very bad!" she said.
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it? I haven't bought for myself even a
handkerchief since 1991."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN Leaders Focus on Economic Recovery at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis afflicting
Southeast Asia and ways to address the resulting economic woes
were the focus of the discussions among the ASEAN leaders at their
two-day summit which ended here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting under the theme of "unity and cooperation for an ASEAN
of peace, stability and equitable development," the leaders from
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam vowed to "move ASEAN onto a higher
plane of regional cooperation in order to strengthen ASEAN's
effectiveness in dealing with the challenges of growing
interdependence within ASEAN and of its integration into the
global economy."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai of Vietnam, the host of the
summit, described the meeting as "of paramount importance" as it
was the last summit in the 20th century, making preparations for
ASEAN to enter the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference Wednesday night that the Hanoi
summit "strongly demonstrates our determination to further enhance
our cohesion in conformity with 'unity in diversity'."
</P>
<P>
Khai noted that the leaders had devoted a great deal of time to
discussing measures to overcome the current economic and financial
crisis and agreed to intensify consultations on macroeconomic
policies, strengthen the financial systems and capital markets,
improve existing regulations to better monitor the flows of
capital and mitigate the social impact of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The summit also paid special attention to the issue of
sustainable development, including poverty alleviation, job
creation and social equity for the immediate future, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Begins Evacuating Relief Workers From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. relief workers have
begun to evacuate from Iraq following the withdrawal of
U.N. weapons inspectors, a reliable U.N. source said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. source told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that the
first group of U.N. humanitarian staff had already left
Baghdad. However, the number is not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. relief workers have been asked to leave Iraq on
Wednesday following the evacuation of all U.N. arms inspectors
from Iraq, said the source.
</P>
<P>
This move came after chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler
presented a report saying Iraq was not cooperating fully with the
inspectors as promised one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has accused Bulter of
falsifying facts that aimed at providing a pretext for
U.S. military attacks against his country.
</P>
<P>
George Somerwill, spokesman of the U.N. Humanitarian Office in
Iraq said earlier Wednesday that U.N. relief workers had been
asked to be prepared to leave Iraq "as a precautionary measure."
</P>
<P>
He said that U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Hans von Sponeck
was closely monitoring the situation and had been in close
contact with U.N. secretary-general in New York."
</P>
<P>
There are about 440 U.N. humanitarian staff working in
Iraq. About 240 staff work in the Northern Iraq's three
Kurdish autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Somerwill said U.N. relief workers in Kurdish autonomous
region will stay in place and will continue their normal work.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. arms inspectors of about 120 people evacuated from
Iraq Wednesday morning, a move many observers believe indicates
that possible U.S. air strikes against Iraq is on the way.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Hold talks With Advisers on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton is
expected to discuss with his foreign policy adviser how to respond
a UNSCOM report that said Iraq was not cooperating on weapons
inspections, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"UNSCOM has delivered its report to the Security Council and I
think you can expect that the president will be having discussions
with his advisers on their conclusion," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The president has said that if Iraq is not cooperating we are
prepared to act," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to say whether the United States has
warned the UNSCOM to leave Iraq, just saying: "I don't think
UNSCOM needed any advice from anyone on making a judgment on what
they should do."
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler said in his report to the
Security Council issued late on Tuesday in New York that Iraq's
lack of full cooperation made it impossible for inspectors to
determine that Baghdad had eliminated its prohibited weapons, a
key requirement for lifting stringent U.N. sanctions imposed after
the Gulf War in 1991.

ousted China's number two pairs of Liu Yong and Yu Jinhao 15-10,
15-11.

World champions Ge Fei and Gu Jun from China met a strong
resistance from South Korea's new team of La Kyung-Min and Chung
Jae-Hee before taking the tussle with a score of 15-11 and 15-9.
</P>
<P>
"The South kroean pair will be our toughest rivals in the
coming years, especially in the Sydney Olympics, " said Tian

</P>
<P>
The Chinese is going to take on Indonesia's new-formed team of

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice President Hopes to See Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
expressed the hope here Wednesday that the various parties in
Cambodia will build their country into a country of peace,
stability and development under the leadership of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the Chinese vice
president, who is here to attend the Second Informal Summit

A new coalition government was formed at the end of November
this year, with Hun Sen serving as the country's sole prime
minister and Ranariddh chairman of the national assembly.

<P>
Hu said the establishment of the Cambodian government and
national assembly indicated that the country has entered a new era
of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government appreciated the Cambodian
government's active attitude toward developing relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the Cambodian government for its consistent
"one-China" position.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokeswoman, Hun Sen valued highly the
relations between Cambodia and China, which have a long history.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian prime minister expressed his government and
people's thanks to China for its precious and selfless assistance
in their efforts to safeguard peace and develop economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the "one China" policy is not only a policy of the
Cambodian People's Party which he leads, but also the policy of
the coalition government and this policy will never change.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Rome Appeals Court Wednesday
lifted travel restrictions on accused Kurdish leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The restrictive measures imposed on the Kurdish Worker's Party
(PKK) leader, forbidding him from leaving the Rome metropolitan
area, had in fact been based only on international warrant issued
by Germany. But Germany said that it will not seek to extradite
Ocalan to Germany, due to the problem of Kurdish immigration in
the country.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the court reserved the right to decide on the
extradition request forwarded by Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is currently under house arrest in Rome and Italy has
refused Turkey's extradition request because Italian law bars
extradition to countries where defendants could face the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
Italy's rejection of Turkish demands for Ocalan's extradition
has caused a rift between the two countries.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton's chances of fending off impeachment
deteriorated dramatically on Tuesday as nine key uncommitted
Republicans and even one of his few GOP supporters declared that
they will vote against him when the House opens its historic
debate this week.
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. arms inspectors set a fresh collision course with Iraq
Tuesday night, reporting that the Baghdad government failed to
honor the promises of cooperation that prompted President Bill
Clinton to call off a major military attack against it a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton was returning from his Mideast trip
facing the near certainty that the House of Representatives will
vote to impeach him later this week unless he can find some
dramatic means to reverse the Republican tide running against him.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton, concluding a three-day trip to the
Mideast, pronounced the mission a success in putting the derailed
peace effort "back on track." But Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel made clear that he was unlikely to abide by
the timetable of the agreement signed on October for another
troops withdrawal from the West Bank on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton flew home from the Middle East to
face likely impeachment in the House, where Republicans are
falling in line behind their leadership in the drive to remove the
president from office.
</P>
<P>
-- Foreshadowing a major shift in Germany's financial
landscape, Deutsche Bank AG signaled that it would cash out of its
industrial assets, including DaimlerChrysler AG, by announcing
plans to place 40 billion marks (24.3 billion U.S. dollars) of
holding into a separate corporation.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Suspend Implementing Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) will suspend the implementation of the Wye
agreement, a senior official said after the Israeli cabinet
reaffirmed Wednesday its decision to postpone the pending troop
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the PNA will hold an
emergency meeting to come up with a concrete plan to stop
carrying out its part of the latest deal, stressing that the
commitments must be mutual.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after the Israeli cabinet reiterated at a
special meeting Wednesday morning that Israel will not begin
implementing the second stage of three withdrawals stipulated by
the Palestine-Israel agreement on Friday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who held the meeting
to report on the three-day visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton
to Israel and Palestinian areas, repeated that Israel will not
carry out its part of the agreement until the Palestinians fulfill
all their obligations.
</P>
<P>
He put the troop withdrawal on hold last week amid widespread
violence in the West Bank and other alleged Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai reported to the
cabinet on the violence, which was sparked by Israel's refusal to
release Palestinian political prisoners, saying that he has
ordered the troops on alert for possible new clashes.
</P>
<P>
The violence, which left four Palestinians killed and some 300
others wounded, let up during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Clinton failed to persuade Netanyahu, who
faces strong pressure from the hard-liners in his coalition, to
stick to the timetable set in the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Netanyahu and PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat at the White House in October, calls on Israel to
relinquish 13 percent more of the West Bank in exchange for
tougher Palestinian measures on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu repeated at the cabinet meeting that the Palestinians
have to meet a list of demands before Israel agrees to carry out
the troop withdrawal, including curbing violence, confiscating
illegal weapons and abandoning the intentions to declare a
Palestinian state unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA said it has fulfilled all its obligations,
including abrogating the anti-Israeli provisions in the national
charter as demanded, and accused Netanyahu of shifting his
internal pressure on the Palestinian side.

Lukashenko, who is here for a three-day visit, will meet with

<P>
He urged the two sides to be serious in implementing the
charter and treaties of the union, which was founded in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
All economic decisions, including those on mutual repayment of
debts, were made many years ago. Now there is no problem in our
relations, he said.

<P>
He also said that the union is the only viable mechanism for
cooperation between the two countries, considering the falling
apart of the four-nation Customs Union of Russia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

We should not count too much on the slow and "amorphous"
Commonwealth of Independent States, Lukashenko said.

way forward to contribute more to the two countries' relations.

A recent circular jointly issued by The Ministry of Finance,
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)

(NPC) Standing Committee stipulates that excessive payments would
be refunded within five years ending in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The recent circular noted that the old policy will be
discontinued at the end of this year.

Foreign-funded enterprises approved before December 31, 1993,
will be exempt from export duties, but will not enjoy exemptions
or tax refunds until the end of the year 2000.
</P>

Enterprises approved after that date will be subject to the
existing system concerning export duties, according to the
circular.

<HEADLINE> Officials Punished for Illegally Occupying Cultivated Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight government
officials have been seriously punished for illegally occupying
cultivated land, according to the Ministry of Land and Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Guo Yongxiang, the ministry's spokesperson, said at today's
press conference that these officials include six county leaders,
16 township leaders and 16 local land bureau directors.
</P>
<P>
These 38 officials have been involved in seven serious illegal
land-occupying cases which have resulted in the damage of large
areas of cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
"These people have been or are being severely punished," Guo
said, adding that some have been handed over to judicial
departments to have their criminal acts investigated.
</P>
<P>
China has dealt with some 30 illegal land-occupying cases this
year, and as a result, a number of city, county and township
leaders have been punished and many local land bureau directors
have been moved from office.
</P>
<P>
China has been suffering from a decreasing area of cultivated
land, with more than six million hectares of cultivated land
occupied for non-agricultural use in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Land and Natural Resources said that it will
further enhance law enforcement efforts and will not let any
person breaking the land law escape punishment.

<HEADLINE> Iran Beat China to Meet Kwuait in Asiad Soccer Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran edged China 1-0 in a
heavyweight semifinal of the Aisan Games soccer tournament here on
Wednesday, securing a final clash with another Middle East country
of Kwuait.
</P>
<P>
Striker Hasanzad Mosavi scored the sole goal in the 49th minute
on a blocked freekick, handing Iran their fourth straight win over
China in 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Kwuait followed Iran's win in the other semifinal when they
trounced the hosts 3-0.
</P>
<P>
But it was the Iran-China battle that gripped more attention
and promised more interest, for these two teams were both
favorites.
</P>
<P>
China, who lost to Iran 1-2 in a group match, suffered a lot up
front as they could not field their ace striker Hao Haidong, who
was banned for two international matches for spitting at referee
in the quarterfinals against Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chen, who plays in Frankurt, Germany, took Hao's place,
but he could seldom found the ball before Iran's goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
"Yang Chen is new of us, and has rarely played in our games,
for we had Hao Haidong and Li Jinyu as starters for most games,"
said China's Coach Bobby Houghton.
</P>
<P>
"But I think he is a good player, and has a bright future in
Germany," the Englishman said.
</P>
<P>
But China's another forward Li Jinyu held the weak midfield of
the Chinese eleven led to their loss.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's strikers are not much better than ours, but our
midfielders are not as strong as theirs," said the 21-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Both sides played tentatively in the first half as they failed
to score. But things changed when the burly-built Iranians got a
freekick in the 49th minute.
</P>
<P>
Ali Daei, who played in Beryern Munich, curved the ball toward
the goal, which was blocked out by China's goalie Jiang Jin.
Mosavi raced to the ball and scored the winner.
</P>
<P>
China stepped up their attack, but could find no way to
penetrate Iran's dogged defence anchored by veteran N.
Mohammadhkai, with their long shot always flying wide.
</P>
<P>
With a lot of promising younger player at hand, Houghton sent a
warning signal to Iran: "The young players starting here can be
very useful in the next World Cup qualifiers, but Iran will have
got to find them, for they will lose some of the veterans, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Houghton's Iranian counterpart Hans Gedeh also thought China
become stronger.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are a little different compared with the past,
they were much better and more experienced."
</P>
<P>
China lost to Iran 2-4 and 1-4 respectively in the France World
Cup qualifiers last year.
</P>
<P>
Iran would be pleased to see off China and meet a weaker rival
of Kwuait in the final.
</P>
<P>
Kwuait snapped Thailand's giant-killing run when they beat them
3-0 after leading 1-0 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Nine-people Thailand disposed of South Korea with a golden goal
after a 1-1 tie in the quarterfinals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea Prime
Minister Bill Skate expressed hope here today for increased Chinese
investments in his country.
</P>
<P>
Skate visited the Beijing New Building Materials Co. Limited in

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Israeli Prime Minister at Crossroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Having surviveding a series
of crises with skillful maneuvering in his two and a half years of
office, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is approaching a
new cross road again.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu failed to muster the necessary votes to defeat an
early elections bill early last week and only managed to stave off
the defeat by a parliament maneuvers which gave him a two-week
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the ploy, he faces a no-confidence vote
Monday. Opposition legislators believe that they will have the
necessary majority to pass the vote.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said Netanyahu will need to decide by Monday
whether to go ahead with a non-confidence vote and take his
chances of being toppled, or to withdraw the no-confidence motion
and go back where he was last week to face a bill to dissolve the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz said chances that the coalition government
withdraws the no-confidence motion are strong since this move
will buy Netanyahu at least one month to continue his attempt to
stablize the coalition.
</P>
<P>
But many Likud sources said the prime minister may make another
choice of initiating an early elections himself, which will enable
him to be in charge of setting the elections timetable. Some say
the earlier he does this, the better his chances of being
reelected.
</P>
<P>
There is rampant speculation here that if Netanyahu concludes
that he is unable to muster a majority for Monday's vote, he may
well decide to resign Monday and call for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Providing further evidence for the impression that an election
is imminent, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has called in three
top media experts from the United States Tuesday to help him run
for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Actually, when Netanyahu made a tough speech Tuesday after a
three-way summit with Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at the Erez border crossing, some said he has started his
election campaign already.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government led by Netanyahu has been showing
signs of falling apart in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman has decided to resign from his
post and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is threatening to
leave.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that Netanyahu has agreed to
accept the resignation of Neeman after failing to persuade him to
stay on. Neeman will submit his resignation at a cabinet meeting
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister has expressed frustration over coalition
disarray which has prevented passage of the 1999 national
budget. It seemed unlikely that the budget will pass by the end
of the year since it has only passed one of three readings
required before it goes in effect.
</P>
<P>
Although his resignation might open the way for Netanyahu's
effort to bring Gesher leader David Levy back to the coalition,
Levy made it clear Tuesday night that he will not rejoin the
government, which he said "should be sent home."
</P>
<P>
A local daily, the Jerusalem Post, reported Wednesday that
Mordechai may announce at the end of the weekend that he is
either distancing himself from the government or even leaving it.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, a moderate in the right-wing government, is
reported to be increasingly displeased with the hardline positions
Netanyahu has been adopting over the last few weeks on the recent
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu frozen the pending troop withdrawal stipulated in
the agreement last week amid violent clashes in the West Bank,
which were sparked by Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
political prisoners, and other alleged Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
He played tough during Clinton's visit by intransigently
sticking to his previous position that the Palestinians have to
meet a series of demands before Israel begins to carry out its
part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
His muscle flexing is widely seen as a gesture to the
hard-liners in the coalition who vehemently oppose the peace
agreement and vowed to topple his government down if he goes
ahead with it. But the far rightists said they were not
unimpressed.

<HEADLINE> Lost Rare Bird in Beijing Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A two-year-old pelican that
slipped out Monday afternoon from a bird park in Beijing was
discovered today in a suburban county and returned to its home at
the Beijing Hundred Birds Garden.
</P>
<P>
A young man named Tian Gang found and caught the bird at noon
time in Changping County, 20 kilometers north of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the bird flying listlessly for a while and dropped to
the ground, maybe it was too hungry," said Tian over the telephone
to the bird park.
</P>
<P>
He learned about the lost bird from media on Monday and dialed
the hotline set up by the bird park which said Tian's description
of the pelican fitted into the features of their lost bird.
</P>
<P>
The little bird flew out of the garden on Monday while a group
of workers were busy clearing silt in the small river where the
pelicans live.
</P>
<P>
The pelican is a species on China's second-class protection
list. This male bird was introduced into the garden last year
from the Shanghai Zoo, according to the workers with the bird
garden.
</P>
<P>
It was last seen flying in the direction of the Asian Games
Village in the northern part of the city. Workers of the garden
later drove to nearby rivers and lakes in search of the lost bird.
</P>
<P>
The bird keepers called on residents to keep an eye for the
young pelican, and also announced that a hotline had been set up
to receive information from the public.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice President Urges Stable Sino-Japanese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
on Wednesday called for "a healthy, stable and lasting
relationship" between China and Japan, according to a Chinese
foreign ministry spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi here, Hu noted
that the historic state visit Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
recently paid to Japan was very successful and "the whole visit
was filled with the spirit of drawing lessons from history and
looking into the future."
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed and summed up the experiences and
lessons they should learn from their relationship and confirmed
that a correct attitude toward history is an important basis for
developing Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Both Vice President Hu and Prime Minister Obuchi pledged to
work jointly for forging a partnership of friendly cooperation
devoted to peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that the important thing at present is to carry out
what had been agreed on during President Jiang's visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
To do this, he noted, the two countries must abide by the
principles set out in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the Sino-Japanese
Joint Declaration, and maintain a correct attitude toward history
and the question of Taiwan. Only by so doing, can the two
countries "bring a healthy, stable and lasting Sino-Japanese
relationship into the new century."
</P>
<P>
Hu also briefed Obuchi on China's views on the Asian financial
crisis and the responsible measures China has taken to overcome
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said China has taken note of Obuchi's pledge to revive his
country's economy after he came to office in July this year and
hopes that Japan would further expand domestic demand, revive its
economy and make its due contributions to the stabilization of the
financial and economic situation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said President Jiang's state visit to Japan was very
successful and it was of great significance for the two sides to
exchange views in a frank and profound way.
</P>
<P>
Japan is ready to further strengthen its friendship with China
by learning from history and looking into the future, the Japanese
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the two countries should make joint efforts to
further implement the consensus reached by the two sides during
President Jiang's visit.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Vice President Hu on Japan's economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi praised China for the fact that it may still achieve its
economic growth target this year despite the heavy flooding. He
also commended China's policy of not devaluing the RMB in an
effort to stabilize the financial situation in Asia.

<HEADLINE> PBOC Tianjin Branch Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Branch of the
People's Bank of China (PBOC), opened here today, as one of the
central bank's nine regional headquarters, after the former
provincial branches are abolished.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC Tianjin Branch is responsible for four
province-level areas in north China, namely, Tianjin
Municipality, Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, and the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The branch will also establish three financial supervisory
offices in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei, Taiyuan, capital of
Shanxi, and Hohhot, capital of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Liu Congming, head of the PBOC Tianjin Branch, said today that
the branch will start performing functions of the central bank from
January 1, 1999, and the former provincial branches of the bank in
the four places will continue to operate until the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the branch will also make efforts to support the
opening-up and healthy economic development of the region, to
improve the performance of local commercial banks and financial
institutions, to lower the risks of payment, and to establish a
modern supervisory system in north China.
</P>
<P>
Yan Haiwang, deputy governor of the central bank, pointed out
today that the four places are considered "cradle of the financial
industry of the new China", with their combined gross domestic
product accounting for 10.38 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
He said that the region's total banking
deposits in Renminbi account for 9.79 percent of China's total,
with nearly 400,000 employees working for local financial
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Relaxed Li Xuemei Gets Ready for 200m </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Li Xuemei, who struck two gold
medals in the women's 100m and 4X100m relay, appeared quite
relaxed on Wednesday as she played cards in her room with her
teammates.
</P>
<P>
The women's 200m final will be held on Thursday and Li, who
overcame a fever and stomach problem to win the 100m on Monday,
appeared relaxed, laughing and talking with her teammates Li Yali,
Liang Yi and Yan Jiankui, with whom she took the 4X100m gold
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"I did not train the whole day," she said. "I just went out to
scratch myself."
</P>
<P>
Li, who had a fever running as high as 39 centigrade on the
night before the 100m showdown, said that there will be no problem
for her to win a third gold medal from the 200m event.
</P>
<P>
"After winning the two events of 100m and 4X100m, I've been
more confident," she said.
</P>
<P>
Her coach Zhang Rongwei said that Li has recovered from the
fever but she is still suffering from the stomach complaints.
</P>
<P>
"She proved herself a strong-willed person in battling the
illness, " Zhang said. "She has suffered a lot from that."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said he has always believed that Li can win at least two
gold medals in the Asian Games even if Sri Lanka's Susantika
Jayasinghe is here.
</P>
<P>
"Li Xuemei has kept her time in the 100m around 11 seconds in
the past few months. Jayasinghe can never beat her in the Games,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Jayansinghe, who pulled out of the women's 100m finals because
of a "hamstring injury", has returned home at Colombo on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> China to Train Professional Business Managerial Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China will try to build a
contingent of professional managerial personnel and introduce a
better management system for such personnel in the next five
years, Minister of Personnel Song Defu announced today.
</P>
<P>
"The business managerial personnel is quite different from
civil servants or technical personnel, and these three kinds of
people must be managed in different ways," Song told a national
conference on personnel work attended by heads of provincial
personnel departments across the country.
</P>
<P>
Under a planned economy, China used one name, "the
cadres", to call the three different kinds of people, and manage
them in the same and one way.
</P>
<P>
"The task of the business managerial personnel is to seek
maximum profits for the enterprises while abiding by all laws and
regulations of the country," said Song. "So their performance must
be judged by their enterprises' economic returns and by whether
they have helped maintain or increased the value of state assets."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it is necessary to develop a rewarding
system that will encourage all business managerial personnel to
improve their performance, and managerial skills must be regarded
as an element related to the distribution of profits.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, he said, enterprise managers who have
exhibited a strong competence should no longer be transferred to
leading positions in government or Party departments, but should
be sent to lead a larger and more important enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"Those who can't get promotion in Party and government
departments may not be offered a leading position in the
enterprises," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to supervision on the business managerial personnel,
Song said that sending special inspectors to major state-owned
enterprises to exercise supervision on behalf of the
state has been proved to be an effective way.
</P>
<P>
"Medium-sized and small enterprises should try to find
competent and reliable managers from special job markets for the
business managerial personnel," he added.

BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- India tied Japan 1-1 on
Wednesday to set up a title clash against hot favorite South Korea
two days later in the Asian Games women's field hockey
competition.

in the fourth minute.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who needed a win to qualify, launched an all-out
attack in the second half. But Kieko Miura's equalizer through a
penalty corner two minutes before the final whistle came a little
too late.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines moves to speed
up the formulation of the comprehensive employment plan to address
the unemployment problem, the Philippines News Agency said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bienvenido Laguesma, Secretary of Labor and Employment, was
quoted as saying in a speech that the plan will be incorporated in
the medium term Philippine development plan which will lay down
the macro policies and strategies of the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the employment plan will center on four areas including
employment preservation, generation, facilitation and enhancement.
</P>
<P>
The employment plan shall encapsulate job security and job
expansion in line with the government's goal of providing support
and security to the poor and the disadvantaged, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan would be validated and submitted to Philippine
President Joseph Estrada during the high level conference on labor
and employment in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1998, unemployment rose to 10 percent
over 8.7 percent in the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Peace Prevails Over War, Tension in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 was eventful
with many conflicts escalating to the brink of war. But
thunderous threats finally gave way to calls for peace.
</P>
<P>
A review of international developments clearly shows that peace
continued to be the main theme around the world in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi crisis over arms inspections surfaced three times,
bringing dark clouds of war over the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, eager to rid itself of U.N. sanctions, challenged the
manipulation of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction by the United States
and Britain. In return, the United States and Britain twice
spearheaded the threat of military strikes against Iraq. In the
face of imminent war, most countries insisted on giving a peaceful
settlement one more chance.
</P>
<P>
At the most critical moment in the first crisis, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan personally went to Baghdad and
defused the tension by talking Iraq into accepting U.N. conditions.
</P>
<P>
When the second and third crises broke out, China, France and
Russia firmly opposed the use of force and persuaded Iraq to
unconditionally cooperate with the U.N. arms inspectors. The
clouds of war vanished once again.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a Serbian province of the Federation of Yugoslavia, was
another hot spot which almost triggered international conflict.
Prolonged clashes between armed ethnic Albanian separatists and
government troops drew worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
While the United Nations called for an immediate ceasefire
there, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) repeated
threats to use force against Yugoslavia. On October 13, NATO
announced that it would launch air strikes against Yugoslavia in
four days. But Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic averted the
attack at the 11th hour by striking a peace deal with U.S. special
envoy Richard Hoolbrooke after eight rounds of tough negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia agreed to accept international supervision of its
military pull-out and offered to work out a timetable for
negotiations on Kosovo's autonomy, and NATO suspended its plan for
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
September saw a worsening relationship between two Muslim
neighbors, Iran and Afghanistan, which almost brought them to
war. The tension stemmed from the Afghan Taliban militia's
killing of nine Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Vowing to retaliate, Iran massed 200,000 troops along its
border with Afghanistan and staged large-scale military
exercises. The Taliban militia also deployed more than 20,000
troops on its side of the border.
</P>
<P>
The tension eased only after the Taliban returned the bodies of
Iranian diplomats and agreed to release other Iranian captives
under international mediation.
</P>
<P>
Another flashpoint was Turkey and Syria. The two countries
have long wrangled over the Kurds, border demarcation and water
resources. Turkey's signing of military cooperation agreements
with Israel in recent years further infuriated Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria claimed Turkey was a potential threat to its security,
and Turkey accused Syria of supporting armed Kurdish separatists
in Turkey. However, the two countries reached an agreement on
October 20, averting another armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The year also saw a historic agreement which ended 30 years of
bloody conflict in Northern Ireland, progress in
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, a peace deal between Ecuador and
Peru ending a century-old border dispute, and the eventual
formation of a coalition government in Cambodia. The list could
be much longer.
</P>
<P>
All these dramatic developments provide some hope and
inspiration for the future, particularly the growing worldwide
trend towards peace and development. Most countries are
preoccupied with economic endeavors which can succeed only in a
peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the world is fast moving towards multi-polarization.
In face of resistance from other countries, some world powers find
it difficult to act at their own sweet will. This is indeed good
for world peace.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Customs Gets Tough on Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Traders smuggling goods to
Dubai in order to avoid tax payment can be imprisoned and be
fined, the Gulf News daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Their goods would be confiscated and trade licenses could be
possibly canceled," the daily said, quoting a new Dubai Customs
law issued last week.
</P>
<P>
Those who bring in or take out banned goods will be fined as
much as 100,000 dirhams (about 2,730 dollars) and jailed for a
maximum one year.
</P>
<P>
A three-month imprisonment term and a maximum fine of 30,000
dirhams (about 8,197 dollars) will also be imposed on those
attempting to land planes or dock ships in non-customs zones as
well as anybody transporting or unloading goods in such areas or
removing customs stamps on goods without Dubai Customs'
permission, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The law also granted Dubai Customs inspectors the judicial
authority to replace police in customs inspection operations at
the Dubai International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The change could be done within three months, Dr. Obeid Saqr
Busit, UAE Customs Council chairman and Dubai Customs
director-general, said Tuesday. Customs inspectors are already
stationed at the sea ports to oversee the implementation of the

<HEADLINE> Quebec Feels Betrayed for 2002 Games Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
0TTAWA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Members of the delegation for
Quebec City's 2002 Winter Olympics bid feel cheated in light of
the scandal surrounding the successful bid by Salt Lake City,
according to reports from Toronto, Canada on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"You have to be disappointed when you realize that not all the
players were playing by the same rules," Quebec City 2002 bid
chief Rene Paquet was quoted as saying."
</P>
<P>
Quebec City lost out to its American rival for the 2002 Games.
The vote wasn't close, but it since has been revealed that Salt
Lake City used nefarious means of winning the favor of some
International Olympic Committee members.
</P>
<P>
A 500,000 U.S. dollars "humanitarian aid'' program was set up
by the Salt Lake City bid committee, part of which paid for the
education of six relatives of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
One has been identified as Sonia Essomba, daughter of Rene
Essomba, an IOC member from Cameroon who died August 31, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Swiss IOC executive committee member Marc Hodler called the
fund nothing more than a bribe, and Salt Lake City organizers
have since apologized for the "embarrassment" caused by the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
What is particularly frustrating to Paquet and his colleagues
is that the Quebec City group long held suspicions that some
rival bids were using underhanded methods to sway IOC voters.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government
is planning to introduce a new bill in parliament to deal with
pollution and waste management.
</P>
<P>
Proposals are to be submitted to the National Assembly at the
beginning of next month, Southern African Broadcasting
Association (SABA) reported Wednesday.

<P>
SABA quoted Michaela Figueira, the project coordinator in

their contributions before a final workshop in March to discuss
the proposals.
</P>
<P>
Figueira said that the Directorate of Environmental Affairs
was reviewing pollution, waste management and other
environment-related legislation, which was meant to eliminate
loopholes in existing regulations.
</P>
<P>
A consultation paper, called Strengthening Namibia's Legal
Framework for Pollution Control and Waste Management, has already
been circulated and discussed.
</P>
<P>
The document said that most of the laws on environment were
passed before modern understanding of natural resources and other

<HEADLINE> Australians Spend Longer Time in Sleeping, Drinking: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Australians spend nearly half
of their days in sleeping, eating and drinking, the latest figures
released from the official sources Wednesday show.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) study found
Australians are sleeping longer, spending more time on their
computers and watching more TV.
</P>
<P>
They are socializing less, but talking more, and spending more
time eating.
</P>
<P>
While reporting the figures from the study, Australian
Associated Press commented: the Australian adults are becoming
lazier, with a marked decline in those playing sports to 9 percent
for men and 4 percent for women.
</P>
<P>
The ABS study of "How Adults Used Their Time in 1997" found 46
percent were taken up with sleeping, personal hygiene, eating and
drinking.
</P>
<P>
Of the rest, 15 percent was used in employment or education, 22
percent social interaction and recreation and 16 percent unpaid
work, such as caring for children or cleaning the house.
</P>
<P>
The study said Australians spent 98 minutes each day on eating
and drinking.
</P>
<P>
Looks were also a factor, with women spending 51 minutes a day
grooming themselves, while men spending 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Adults were also sleeping longer than they did in 1992, for an
extra 20 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
On average, adults now slept eight hours and 36 minutes each
day and 40 minutes longer on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Women spent two hours a day watching TV, while men spent an
extra half a hour.
</P>
<P>
Men were twice as likely to spend free time on the computer or
playing computer games, while women continued to bear the brunt of
the domestic load.

BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji today
hosted a meeting of the Executive Committee of the State Council
which examined and approved the draft regulations on unemployment
insurance and the draft provisional regulations on
administrative and disciplinary punishment for illegal foreign
exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
Participants said the regulations on insurance for workers
laid-off from state-owned enterprise, promulgated in April 1993,
fails to meet the needs of the social security system under the
socialist market economy. They stressed the urgent need to
formulate an improved regulation.
</P>
<P>
A number of cases involving fraudulent practice to purchase
foreign exchange have jeopardized the nation's financial and
economic stability. The goal for formulating the new regulations is
to effectively halt illegal activities.

<P>
The two sets of regulations will be promulgated after being
approved by the State Council.

<HEADLINE> No Age Limits on Asian Games Soccer, Says Thai Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The men's soccer competition
of the Asian Games has no age limits for competitors, however the
Olympic Games competition is solely for players under 23 years
old, a Thai soccer official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Voravi Magudee, Secretary General of the Football Association
of Thailand, said there has been no age limits for soccer players
at the SEA Games or Asian Games because it depends on each
country's decision although many teams already send young players.
</P>
<P>
"South Korea and China have sent soccer players who are under
23 years old and more than half of Japan's players are also
under 23," said Magudee, also an executive board member of the
world soccer ruling body FIFA.
</P>
<P>
The age limit was first brought in at the 1992 Olympic Games in
Barcelona, when FIFA and the International Olympic Committee
decided it would give young players the opportunity to compete in
a world-class competition.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations decided that without the age limit, the
standard of soccer at the Olympic Games would be no different
from the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Voravi said the World Cup is organized in the same year as
the Asian Games with a gap of only six months.
</P>
<P>
Some people believe that soccer players who have played in the
World Cup would enliven the matches in the Asian Games. Others
suggest young players should be allowed to show their skills in
major tournaments to gain experience.
</P>
<P>
Voravi believes soccer in the Asian Games is second to none
in regional tournamens.
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that the Asian soccer governing body AFC will
seek a formal talk on an age limit for the Asian Games among AFC
members and the Olympic Council of Asia, to be in line with the
Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> India Not to Compromise its Security Interests: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee Wednesday asserted that India would not compromise its
security interests or submit to threats and pressures from the
United States and other key countries on the nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
Replying to clarifications in the Upper House of Parliament on
his Tuesday statement on the Indo-U.S. dialogue here, Vajpayee
said, "No country can compel India to do things not in its
security interests."
</P>
<P>
"Having conducted the series of nuclear tests that were
necessary, we are currently guided by the assurance that our stand
does not constrain our research and development program or the
ability to maintain the safety and effectiveness of our deterrent,
now and in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two Houses of Parliament are holding two-day discussions on
the Prime Minister's statement on Indo-U.S. dialogue following
India's nuclear tests in May this year which had drawn strong
condemnation from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the operational aspects of the minimum deterrent,
Vajpayee said that it was not a "question of numbers" but of a
policy approach which grew out of national experience and was
based on the consensus that existed on these matters.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the deterrent and India's sovereign right to
determine its nature were the fundamental premises on which
discussions with all interlocutors, including the United States,
were based, he further said.
</P>
<P>
India and the United States started their dialogue since June
11 this year and they have held several rounds of talks so far on
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation.

<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen met
today with U.S. Senator Tim Johnson and expressed hope that China
and the United States will conclude negotiations on China's entry
into World Trade Organization (WTO) at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed appreciation for Johnson's support for the
U.S. government decision to grant unconditional most favored
nation (MFN) status to China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Johnson's visit coincides with the 20th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
the two countries. He pointed to China's monumental
reform and opening achievements, as well as the marked progress in
Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he has closely followed events in China throughout
his 12-year tenure in the U.S. Congress, and pointed to the
satisfactory progress in trade and cultural ties.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, said the U.S. government and
Senate fully affirm there is only one China in the world, and that
the Taiwan issue is an internal affair which can only be solved by
Chinese themselves.

<HEADLINE> Reunification Presents No Threat to Democracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The democratic claim made by
Taiwan authorities is in fact an excuse to hinder reunification of
the motherland, with cross-Straits disagreements centering on
state sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The assertions came in today's Xinhua News Agency release
authored by Qun Yan. Qun points to the groundless of claims that
Taiwan-style "democracy" is the only true democracy in the world,
and notes that different countries and regions have their own
democratic systems.
</P>
<P>
Modes of democracy depend on the economic growth, level of
education, history and traditions of individual countries,
according to the new release.
</P>
<P>
For example, small countries can easily select their presidents
in nationwide elections. However, the fact that China is a nation
with a huge population and vast territory makes it thus
unnecessary and indeed impossible to hold direct elections to
select leaders from the national down to the village level.
</P>
<P>
Candidates running in Taiwan's 1994 elections for "provincial
governors and mayors," as well as for "provincial and municipal
councillors," spent campaign funds equivalent to 14 billion
yuan (1.68 billion US dollars). Funds spent during the campaign
could have easily provided clothing for a million impoverished
people.
</P>
<P>
Inland Chinese citizens would in no way benefit from the
expensive pursuit of "trading ballots for dollars", according to
Qun.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wang Most-Crowned Athlete in Asiad (Day 11) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Wang Nan snatched her fourth
table tennis gold and the sixth for China on Wednesday, becoming
the most crowned athlete in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
China remained runaway leader in the medal standings with 96
golds, 64 silvers and 44 bronzes after posting a 4-2-1 record on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
World No. 3 Wang paired up with No. 2 Li Ju to add the women's
doubles gold to her titles won from the team, mixed doubles and
singles events. China's other table tennis gold was from the men's
team.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Wang, twice World Cup winner, combined with Li
to beat Song Ah-Sim and Chan Tan-Lui from Hong Kong, China, 21-7,
21-8.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Taek Soo ruined an otherwise perfect day for
the Chinese paddlers, winning the men's singles title clash
against dual Olympic champion Liu Guoliang.
</P>
<P>
The world 11th-ranked Kim upset China's world No. 3 Kong
Linghui in the semifinals and then steamrolled over world No. 2
Liu 21-16, 21-14, 22-20 in the final.
</P>
<P>
It was Liu's fourth straight loss to the extremely aggressive
South Korean, whose nerves and forehand drives are arguably the
strongest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast-attacker said Kim had got used to his serves
and style.
</P>
<P>
"I am no longer a secret to Kim," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
"It was very important to fight because the Chinese are very
strong," Kim said after the match.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua said he was happy with the
Chinese six-gold haul.
</P>
<P>
"We set the target of four or five gold medals before we came
here," Cai said. "I feel very good now."
</P>
<P>
Chinese fans have got used to winning and will accept nothing
less. The Chinese top men's aborted singles run faces harsh
criticism back home.
</P>
<P>
China swept all the titles in the 1995 world championships and
1996 Olympic Games. In the 1997 world championships in
Manchester, England, the Chinese won all but the men's singles
title, causing an uproar from their supporters.
</P>
<P>
China also struck gold in cycling, fencing and softball.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yan led fellow Chinese Jiang Cuihua to a 1-2 finish in
the women's sprint, the Chinese fencers triumphed in the women's
team epee and its women's softball squad downed Japan for the
gold.
</P>
<P>
South Korea consolidated its second position by winning four
golds against Japan's two on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans won golds from the men's individual archery,
men's handball and baseball, and table tennis, while Japan landed
golds in the men's karatedo and men's sprint cycling.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has registered a 49-34-41 record with Japan in
third place overall with 44-44-53.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, India, Iran, Kuwait and Chinese Taipei has
each won a gold on Wednesday, from billiards and snooker, kabaddi,
men's under-75kg karatedo, men's over-75kg karatedo and Wushu
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Reunification Presents No Threat to Democracy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has worked diligently to refine socialist democracy and
rule by law since the founding of the People's Republic of China
in 1949, especially since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The nation has established a "self-government system for
villagers," and continually worked to perfect systems governing
civil servants and the supervision of officials.
</P>
<P>
Building a socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics
requires inheriting the finer points of traditional Chinese
politics and culture, while at the same time learning the rational
aspects of western democracy, according to Qun.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China affixed its signature to the International
Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1997 and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1998,
readily proves its sincerity and determination for international
cooperation and determination to perfect socialist democracy.
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the Taiwan Straits have their unique experience
and advantages in developing democracy, said Qun, adding that the
mainland fully respects the desire of Taiwan compatriots to be
masters of their own destiny and supports their demands for
developing democracy.
</P>
<P>
Qun refers to the "one country, two systems" principle and
notes that "one country" refers to the pursuit of national
reunification, while "two systems" indicates there is still space
for the development of democracy in Taiwan following
reunification.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" principle is a reunification
formula which complies fully with democratization, with "two
systems" indicating that the two sides can learn from each other
to ensure common development, said Qun.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Boosted by Commodities Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was
given a boost Wednesday by improved commodities prices, putting on
about a third of a U.S. cent from Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poor's MMS currency strategist Alex Douglas said
the gains came in the Tuesday night session and the Australian
dollar had spent most of the day "chopping sideways" in quiet
trading.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished at 62.37 U.S. cents from 62.05 late
Tuesday, after spending the day between 62.44 and 62.17 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index closed Tuesday night
at 191.67 points, up 1.00.
</P>
<P>
The CRB Index is an index of 21 U.S. futures markets and
although it is not weighted to Australia's exports, traders follow
it as an indicator for the commodity price-sensitive Australian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the federal government's mid-year fiscal and
financial outlook, to be released Thursday, had the potential to
impact on the market depending on what it revealed.
</P>
<P>
"There's likely to be a bit of an increase in growth forecasts
for 1998-99," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was buying 72.46 Japanese
yen from 72.48 and 1.0339 German marks from 1.0271.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Credit Takes Off In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Only a small number of urban
Chinese people now think that buying consumer goods on credit is a
bad idea while the majority are in favor, according to a recent
survey.
</P>
<P>
The China Business Climate Monitoring Center questioned almost
a thousand residents in China's two major cities of Beijing and
Shanghai and discovered that 64 percent were fully au fait with
consumer credit and loan facilities.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally Chinese shoppers were inclined only to spend
within their budgets but the survey disclosed that 56 percent of
people now fully accept credit as a means of buying what they want.
</P>
<P>
Some people, 31 percent, were a little hesitant and only 13
percent of those surveyed said they wouldn't choose the method.
</P>
<P>
However, amongst those claiming they are happy with credit
facilities nearly 50 percent say they would even buy a house in
that way and 16 percent that they would use credit to buy cars and
expensive household items.
</P>
<P>
And 12 percent of people said they would even consider
spending more than they earned with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
Amongst those who reject the facility, 25 percent admitted it
was because they are unsure of their future earning
capacity. Another 17 percent said they would watch the development
of credit facilities while 15 percent said, simply, that they were
too poor to even consider doing it.

MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado said here Wednesday that his department is
investigating two air mishaps involving Philippine Air Force (PAF)
aircraft in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Mercado said that he expects the results

The helicopter sustained damage in its tail and main rotor,

Meanwhile, the government said that it grounded all S-211
trainer jets for a maintenance checkup, and will no longer buy

<HEADLINE> Delay in Privatizng ZCCM Costs Zambia Dear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The delay in the privatization
of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) is likely to cost
the country's economy a loss of more than 1.5 billion U.S.
Dollars, according to a release from the Stanchart.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Wednesday quoted the bank's report as saying
that the impact on the ZCCM finances and Zambia's foreign and
external debt has already been severe, inflicting lasting damage
on the economy.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of the ZCCM, especially in the Nchanga and
Nkana mines, has remained the reversing factor of Zambia's
renewed economic decline, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) has dropped by two percent
this year from the intended forecast of 5.5 percent in the 1998
budget.
</P>
<P>
And the inflation rate had rebounded to 27.6 percent in
October year-on-year from a February low of just over 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the 28-day treasury bills, which drives bank
prime lending rates, had risen to over 32 percent last month from
a 1990 low of 12 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration on the balance of payments supports are
likely to cause the local currency to fall further.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the balance of payments estimates indicate a sharp
current account deficit of 430 million Dollars in the first three
quarters of this year, of which 300 million Dollars were incurred
in the third quarter itself.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter deficit increased at the rate of 100 million
Dollars in a month compared to the mid-year 100 million Dollars,
suggesting that the annual figure will not be different from last
year's 230 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
And the total exports are expected to decline by 20 percent
from its projected 600 million Dollars for minerals and non
traditional exports of 300 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Stanchart indicates that the current account deficit is
projected at some 550 million Dollars compared with last year's
230 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both trade accounts and the current account deficits are
forecast to widen further in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Exports will continue to be constrained by weak demand and
depressed prices for both copper and cobalt, but growth in non
traditional exports is expected to regain its buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
Imports will rise sharply in the copper industry and, although
exports will recover slightly, this will be more than offset by
strong import expansion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deficit before transfer is projected at 900
million Dollars, up 50 percent from an estimated 600 million
Dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
In May this year donors pledged to give Zambia an aid of 530
million Dollars at the Consultative Group meeting held in Paris.
However, the donors have not released the pledged aid while
pressing for a quick completion of the privatization of the ZCCM,
which earns more than 80 percent of Zambia's foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Painter's Works On Show In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A major exhibition of the
works of the important contemporary modernist Romanian artist
Corneliu Baba will be staged in Beijing from December 19 to
January 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The show is the ninth in a series of exhibitions sponsored by
China's Ministry of Culture as part of the '98 China Year
of International Fine Arts and will feature 73 of Baba's paintings.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1906 Baba died last year and was devoted to his art
since childhood.
</P>
<P>
His dark and serious style was particularly Romanian in mode
and was frequently described as melancholic, which became his own
distinctive style although he preferred to describe it as noble.
</P>
<P>
Baba adapted many modern art techniques which are renowned for
their simplicity and yet expressiveness.
</P>
<P>
He managed to combine the traditional and modern styles which
made him acclaimed internationally as well as becoming an artistic
icon in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Jianjun, vice-chairman of the China Artist Association,
commented that the Chinese artistic community is now pondering how
they can integrate the traditional styles of China with western
traditions, but cited Baba as a good example of how this could be
achieved.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Further Cooperation With ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday pledged to
further "consolidate and develop its partnership of
good-neighborliness and mutual trust" with the ASEAN countries,
calling this "an important component of China's foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the China-ASEAN Informal Leadership Meeting here
Wednesday afternoon, Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao said: "On
the basis of the approach of equal participation, seeking common
ground while shelving differences, consensus and incremental
progress, we have promoted the sound development of multilateral
dialogue and cooperation in the region."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever changes may take place, or however tough the
development process may be, we shall always share weal and woe,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that as important forces making for peace and
development, China and the ASEAN countries "need to close their
ranks even more intensely and make due contribution to Asia's
revitalization and development by overcoming the temporary
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice president listed the aspects in which China
will continue its efforts.
</P>
<P>
The first is to maintain friendly exchanges with ASEAN
countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, "at all levels, in
all fields and through different channels within the framework of
all-round dialogue and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, China will persist in giving priority to
economic cooperation and trade, open up diversified channels for
cooperation and expand the scope of bilateral economic contacts
and trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The third aspect is to step up cooperation in regional economic
and financial fields. "To stabilize the regional economic
situation and take precautions against financial risks are where
our common interests lie," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He said China "will persevere in its reform and opening-up,
maintain sustained, rapid and sound development of its economy,
keep a stable exchange rate of the RMB yuan and continue to
provide what assistance it could to the ASEAN countries
concerned."
</P>
<P>
He announced that China has decided to contribute 200,000 U.S.
dollars to the ASEAN Foundation to support the ASEAN countries in
their efforts to promote economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The fourth aspect Vice President Hu mentioned is that China
will strictly abide by the political consensus reached with ASEAN,
continue to maintain the favorable atmosphere and momentum of
dialogue and cooperation and persist in the settlement of the
existing differences and disputes through friendly consultation on
an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed the belief that "as long as China and ASEAN
countries join hands in sincere cooperation, we will certainly be
able to write an even more brilliant chapter in the annals of our
friendly and good-neighborly relations and create a still better
future for our countries and the entire Asia."
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that China and ASEAN held an informal
leadership meeting. The first one took place last year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Face Shortfall of Revenue Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's revenue
collection is likely to face a shortfall of 36 billion rupees (783
million U.S. dollars) against the target in the first half of the
1998-1999 fiscal year starting from July 1.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall is due to a huge plunge in the Customs duty, its
related taxes and heavy clearance of refunds, according to
official sources here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the past five months (from July to November), the
Central Board of Revenue (CBR) recorded a shortfall of 26 billion
rupees (565 million dollars) in revenue collection, which is
likely to deepen further to 36 billion rupees by the end of
December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the target of 334 billion rupees (7.26 billion
dollars) for the 1998-1999 financial year (agreed with the
International Monetary Fund), the CBR is supposed to net 160
billion rupees (3.48 million dollars) of revenue in the first half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the entire collection might not exceed the mark of 124
billion rupees (2.69 billion dollars) in the first six months as
only 102 billion rupees (2.22 billion dollars) were realized till
the end of November.
</P>
<P>
The government of Pakistan has set dual target for the revenue
collection, 334 billion rupees external (agreed with the IMF) and
354 billion rupees (7.69 billion dollars) internal target for the
CBR.
</P>
<P>
In line with the policy of the government, the CBR has carved
out a contingency plan to achieve the target.
</P>
<P>
Initially the tariff of sales tax has been elevated to 15
percent (against 12.5 percent) from December 1 to increase the
additional revenue per annum to the tune of 14 billion rupees (304
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The other steps set in the plan are to auction goods seized by
the customs, minimize smuggling, plug leakage and realize arrears
through a vigorous drive.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Vows to Fight Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic vowed Tuesday to step up measures for fighting against
terrorism and protecting citizens' lives and properties.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the remarks in a meeting with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia Robert Hill, the Tanjug
news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president said that separatist-minded ethnic Albanian
terrorists in Kosovo, a southern province of the Yugoslav
Federation, had never stopped the attacks on Serb soldiers,
policemen and civilians.
</P>
<P>
Six Serb youths were shot dead Monday evening by ethnic
Albanian terrorists in a cafe in downtown Pec, western Kosovo,
which has triggered a great wrath across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has implemented the accord on the Kosovo issue

<HEADLINE> India Wins Kabbadi Title For Third Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- India captured the third
straight Asian Games kabbadi gold medal on Wednesday, but Sri
Lanka and Bangladeshe had a tough battle for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
India secured the gold on Tuesday after winning six out of six
wins in the round robin tournament, but the other medals were
still up for grabs on the final day.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's games, Pakistan set themselves up for silver
with a 24-7 win over Japan, leaving Bangladesh needing a clear win
over Sri Lanka to take it from them in the last match of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the end Bangladesh had to battle to a dramatic last minute
draw against Sri Lanka to take the bronze.
</P>
<P>
To the unitiated, kabaddi can seem like a complicated version
of playground tag. In it teams send a player or "radar" into the
opposing half of the court who must attempt to tag each of his
opponents while shouting "kabaddi, kabaddi" without taking a
breath.
</P>
<P>
The sport made its Asian Games debut at the Beijing Games in
1990 and India has dominated it ever since.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice President Urges East Asia to Unite for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
Wednesday called on East Asian countries to be confident in the
region's development prospects and increase cooperation in order
to achieve higher economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Informal Summit Meeting of East Asian
Heads of State/Government, Hu said the theme for the meeting was
to discuss "how to overcome the financial crisis, step up
cooperation in East Asia and maintain the stability and
development of the countries and the region as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to promote the 21st-century-oriented
regional development and cooperation, it is necessary for East
Asian countries to first of all further heighten confidence in the
region's development prospects.
</P>
<P>
He said East Asia is a region full of vigor and hope and a
relatively solid foundation has been laid for its socioeconomic
development and the fundamental elements for economic growth are
fairly sound as well.
</P>
<P>
He also cited the advantages East Asia enjoys in economic
development, including rich natural resources, huge market
potentials and industrious and talented people.
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to believe that by drawing useful lessons
from past experience, making necessary changes, maximizing
favorable factors and minimizing unfavorable ones, and promoting
what is beneficial and abolishing what is harmful, East Asia will
be able to readjust and improve its mode of development, recover
its vigor and vitality and take up an important position in the
global economy of the coming century," he declared.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice president also said the mutually beneficial
cooperation among East Asian countries should be further enhanced.
"Cooperation in all fields in East Asia should serve the common
interests of the countries in the region, those of the developing
countries in particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the developed countries in and beyond the region "to
take active and effective measures" to further open up their
technology and commodity market to the developing countries in
this region and step up cooperation in the field of high and new
technology while continuing their financial support for the
crisis-affected countries.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Hu also pointed out that there should be more
active participation in the reform and readjustment endeavor of
the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
"Top priority should be given to strengthening the supervision,
regulation and control over the flow of international capital," he
said. "It is not only an urgent task to safeguard the economic
security of the East Asian countries but also a long-term need for
ensuring a sustained and steady growth of the East Asian economy."
</P>
<P>
He called for exchanges among the East Asian countries on
macro-economic issues such as the financial reform and proposed a
dialogue at the level of vice finance minister and central bank
deputy governor among the nine ASEAN members and China, Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Hu described peace and stability as "an important guarantee"
for the economic growth in East Asia. "Without a stable
environment, there will be no economic recovery and development
for East Asia to speak of."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that to cherish the existing goodneighborly
and friendly relations among East Asian countries and persist in
ironing out their differences through peaceful means are
"undoubtedly very important for the stability, prosperity and
cooperation of East Asia in the new century."
</P>
<P>
The vice president said China has all along attached importance
to reinforcing cooperation with the rest of the region and has
since the First Informal Summit "worked tirelessly for
safeguarding the stability and development in East Asia and indeed
the entire Asia."
</P>
<P>
"Although confronted with considerable difficulties itself, the
Chinese government has adopted a highly responsible attitude and
striven to expand domestic demand to ensure economic growth," he
said. "We in China have also adhered to the policy of stabilizing
the value of RMB and provided assistance amounting to 4.5 billion
U.S. dollars to the crisis-affected East Asian countries through
the IMF operating budget as well as bilateral channels."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that as the biggest developing country in the
region, the greatest contribution China can make to the
development of East Asia is continued promotion of its own
political stability, economic growth and social progress.
</P>
<P>
He said China is further deepening the reform, opening up
wider to the outside world, expediting the establishment of a
system of socialist market economy and pressing on with the
fundamental transformation of the mode of growth.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Leader Granted Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Superme Court
Wednesday granted constitutional bail to Dean Mung'omba,
president of opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC).
</P>
<P>
Nakatindi Wina, parliament member and newly expelled
chairwoman in charge of woman affairs of the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), was also granted the bail.
</P>
<P>
Judge Japhet Banda of the Court said the two persons who had
been detained in alleged connection with the country's foiled
military coup in October, 1997, were entitled to be allowed to
have constitutional bail since to date "no evidence has been
offered against the two accused persons."
</P>
<P>
The ruling was attached to conditions that the two persons
should offer a bail of five million Zambian Kwacha (about 2,200
U.S. Dollars) and have two working or reputable sureties.
</P>
<P>
They are also ordered to surrender their passports and other
travel documents and should not travel abroad without the
approval of the court.
</P>
<P>
In the period of the bail, the two persons are obliged to
report to Zambia Police Service headquarters once in a week every
Friday till the case against them is treated, according to the
Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the ZDC leader, who had been detained for
over one year, and Nakatindi Wina, the only senior MMD official
detained in connection with the coup attempt, were charged
together with 77 army soldiers with treason.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of collaborating with the soldiers to topple
the elected government of President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The case opened in early June this year and the state has
called more than 100 witnesses to testify against the accused
persons. But no witnesses have testified against Mung'omba and
Nakatindi Wina, who therefore applied for the bail.

<P>
Authorities estimate as many as 14,000 people live on San
Francisco's streets.
</P>
<P>
They blamed the sharp rise of homeless deaths on the growing
popularity of cocaine. Among the 157 homeless deaths, there are 86
drug-related deaths, or 55 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also blamed the record deaths on the lifestyle of
the homeless who use the 287 U.S. dollars of monthly assistance
payments to buy cocaine instead of food or housing.
</P>
<P>
As shown by media reports, increasingly pure heroin is readily
available on the streets and at a relatively low cost. A single
dose, about a quarter gram, reportedly costs about 20 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Aziz: Butler's Report Aims to Justify U.S. Military Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said here Wednesday that chief U.N. arms inspector
Richard Butler's report aims to justify a U.S. military strike
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency INA, Aziz
stressed that Iraq had committed to the content of the letter
sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in mid-November in
which Iraq announced unconditional cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official Iraqi response to the Butler's
report submitted to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday
in which Butler said Iraq failed to fully cooperate with U.N.
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM) made "extraordinary conducts" during its recent surprise
visits to Iraqi sites.
</P>
<P>
He said UNSCOM's activities included hundreds of inspections,
interviews and flights, adding that Iraq provided all possible
facilities for UNSCOM to carry out its mission.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent on Monday a detailed report to Kofi Annan on
UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducts
in Iraq, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He said Butler withdrew all U.N. arms inspectors from Iraq
before Kofi Annan briefs the U.N. Security Council of UNSCOM's
final conclusion of Iraq's cooperation with arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. arms inspectors of about 120 personnels evacuated
from Iraq on Wednesday morning, a move that many observers
believe indicates that a possible U.S. air strike against Iraq
is on its way.
</P>
<P>
"This is another tangible evidence that the U.S. controls
UNSCOM and uses it as a tool to implement its own aggressive
policy toward Iraq... challenge the Security Council authority and
minimize the role of U.N. secretary-general," INA quoted Aziz as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Azerbaijan's Protest Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi Wednesday rejected Azerbaijan's
protest against Iran's agreements with British and Dutch oil firms
on exploration in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Asefi termed Azerbaijan's protest as "lacking legal basis on
the existing treaties," the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran's National Iranian Oil Company Monday signed an agreement
worth 19.8 million U.S. dollars with Anglo-Dutch Royal
Dutch/Shell and British Lasmo to carry out a two-part study of
unexplored waters in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan lodged a protest against the agreement, saying
waters to be explored in the Caspian Sea belong to Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said he doubted if the Azeri officials were unaware of
the principles of the 1921 friendship and amity treaty between
Iran and Russia, and the trade and navigation pact of 1940 and its
enclosures between Iran and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In these agreements, which are still valid, there is no
discussion about division or restriction of the limits of the sea
and no documents exist to this effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Caspian has been mentioned as
Iran-Soviet joint sea in the enclosures to the 1940 pact, which
indicates that it belongs to all the littoral states, therefore
raising the issue of the Azeri sector of the sea lacks legal basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the Almaty declaration on December 21, 1991, the
independent governments in the former Soviet Union have agreed to
accept all the past commitments including the 1921 and 1940 pacts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the five littoral states of the Caspian, Iran and Russia
favor a common share of the resources in the sea while Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan and Azerbaijian prefer the division of the sea into
national sectors.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the legal regime of the Caspian Sea can be
changed only through consensus of all the littoral states and
within the present legal regime. Iran's economic activities in the
sea should not be a cause of concern for other governments, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran believes the collective legal regime
based on the 1921 and 1940 agreements is still the best mechanism
for cooperation in the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
However, if all the littoral states decide to divide the sea,
then Iran will only agree with equal and complete division of
the sea and its seabed.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches 115 Mln Dollar Appeal for Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Wednesday
appealed for 115 million U.S. dollars in assistance for its most
urgent activities in Afghanistan for 1999, and warned of a
humanitarian crisis if the funds were not made available.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Bronek Srynalski, acting U.N.
Coordinator for Afghanistan, said the war-ravaged country "is one
of the most difficult places for delivering humanitarian
assistance in the world."
</P>
<P>
"The appeal launched by the United Nations today reflects a new
unified approach to aid activities in Afghanistan, forged by the
U.N. in 1998 and endorsed last week by donors meeting in Tokyo,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. requested funding for the top priority
activities out of a total portfolio of projects worth 185 million
dollars, 28 million more than agencies sought for 1998. "These
include demining, preventative health care, community-based
development programs and emergency food aid."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official expressed optimism that the U.N. and
international aid workers would return to Afghanistan soon. "We
are not yet absolutely clear, but we are very hopeful that within
next few weeks we will see a breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
He said the local staff of U.N. in Afghanistan has been asked
to assess the security situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and non-governmental organizations pulled
out their staff from Afghanistan after Taliban authorities asked
them to shift their offices to a building outside Kabul and two
U.N. employees in the Afghan capital were killed following the
U.S. cruise missile attack in August.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Seven Million Doses of Anti-meningitis Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- At least seven million doses of
vaccine are needed for the upcoming season in Africa "meningitis
belt" countries, said the World Health Organization (WHO) here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, available stockpiles are only six million, with one
million doses short of the number of vaccines needed to respond to
the current meningitis epidemic, said the Geneva-based WHO.
</P>
<P>
The meningitis epidemic, which began in 1996, has so far caused
over 300,000 cases in countries ranging from Senegal in the west
to Mozambique in the south-east of Africa, threatening about 280
million people across the meningitis belt, according to the WHO.
</P>
<P>
"Historically, we can very clearly show that meningitis
epidemics occur once every decade or so and that they last two to
four years," said Dr Lindsay Martinez, director of WHO's
Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response.
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that several meningitis belt countries in
eastern Africa have not yet experienced an upsurge in this
epidemic cycle, we must be prepared for the number of cases there
to increase dramatically in the near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said that the mainstay of epidemic control is the early
detection of an outbreak followed by rapid intervention with
vaccination and treatment with antibiotics since no reliable
methods to prevent or predict the onset of meningitis epidemics
have yet been developed.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Foreign Reserves Up to 52 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's total foreign
exchange reserves rose to a record high of 52.3 billion
U.S. dollars as of December 15 this year, or 2.28 billion dollars
more than that of last month, the Bank of Korea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bankers attributed the rise to domestic financial institutions'
repayment of foreign currency loans, foreign currency deposits to
the central bank and a stable domestic foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
When the nation's foreign exchange crisis occurred last
December, the central bank extended a total of 23.29 billion
dollars in emergency loans to domestic financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, domestic financial institutions returned 18.78
billion dollars to the central bank as of December 15.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the nation's usable foreign exchange reserves
would remain at the level of 47 billion dollars at the end of this
year and South Korea can pay back some 10 billion dollars to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) next year.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, the IMF has extended 18 billion dollars to
South Korea. On Tuesday, the IMF also approved the disbursement of
an additional one billion dollars to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Seoul announced a decision to repay 2.8 billion
dollars to the IMF at the end of this year, mainly due to its
record usable foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Despite the payback of 2.8 billion dollars, the central bank
sees no difficulties that will affect the local foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the nation's ample usable foreign exchange
reserves, the repayment of 2.8 billion dollars would not affect
the local foreign exchange market at all," said a bank spokesman.

</P>
<P>

in Cairo Wednesday to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
the outcome of his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The three-way meeting, which took place on Tuesday and was
aimed at getting the derailed Wye River Accord back on track,

</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- An Egyptian delegation led by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
arrived in Ougadougou, capital of the Burkina Faso on Tuesday for
a ministerial meeting of the Settlement Mechanism under the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), which is to open next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory meetings on Wednesday will review the problems
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Great Lake region and
the Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The DRCongo is being plagued with fightings between government
forces and rebels while the Great Lake region is tangled in ethnic
wars.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt Tuesday emphasized the importance of preserving the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzgovina and
ensuring the repatriation of refugees who left the country during
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian permanent representative to the European headquarters
of the U.N. in Geneva Mounir Zahran made the remarks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

alleviate the sufferings of the Bosnians through fund raising
activities carried out by the Red Crescent Society.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Blood Filtration Saves Lives of Acute Pancreatitis Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have
successfully applied a method of blood filtration for the
treatment of 15 patients who were critically ill after contracting
acute necrotic pancreatitis.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital said this is a new way to
deal with this acute disease which usually kills 50 percent of the
people contracting it.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhang Shengdao, who led the research into discovering
ways to combat the disease, said blood filtration for acute
necrotic pancreatitis patients can effectively prevent the
worsening of the disease if the patients receive this special
treatment within 72 hours of diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
He said the disease is partly caused by the rapid increase of
cell activity which leads to the formation of a network. The
excessive cell activity can then accelerate the deterioration of
pancreatic tissue.
</P>
<P>
Zhand said blood filtration is aimed at getting rid of the
excessive number of cells before they form a network, and that
patients can receive this treatment at lower costs than that for
other therapies.
</P>
<P>
The 15 people who recovered after this new treatment includes a
36-year-old woman in her ninth month of pregnancy.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Kim Taek Soo
denied China a title sweep in the Asian Games table tennis
competition, beating dual Olympic champion Liu Guoliang in the
men's singles final.
</P>
<P>
The world 11th-ranked Kim gained a revenge for his team final
loss to world No. 3 Kong Linghui, beating the Chinese in the
semifinals, and then steamrolled over World No. 2 Liu 21-16,
21-14, 22-20 in the title clash.
</P>
<P>
It was Liu's fourth straight loss to the extremely aggressive
South Korean, whose nerves and forehand drives are arguably the
strongest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast-attacker, who still holds better record in his
career encounters with the South Korean penholder, said Kim had got
used to his serves and style.
</P>
<P>
"I am no longer a secret to Kim," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua said he was happy with the
Chinese six-gold haul.
</P>
<P>
"We set the target of four or five gold medals before we came
here," Cai said. "I feel very good now."
</P>
<P>
Kong shared the third place with South Korean Oh Sang-Eun.
</P>
<P>
Chinese fans have got used to winning and will accept nothing
less. The Chinese top men's aborted singles run faces harsh
criticism back home.
</P>
<P>
China swept all the titles in the 1995 world championships and
1996 Olympic Games. In the 1997 world championships in
Manchester, England, the Chinese won all but the men's singles
title, causing an angry uproar from their supporters.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Ertan Hydropower Plant Limits Number of Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ertan Hydropower Plant in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, the country's largest water
conservation project scheduled for completion in this century, has
limited the number of workers on the plant's payroll to 194.
</P>
<P>
The Ertan plant is on the lower reaches of Yalong River in
Sichuan Province and is the second largest power station being
built in China, after the Three Gorges. It will have six
550,000-kw generating units, of which, the first two began
operating earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Cai Chunsheng, deputy director of the hydropower plant,
explained that they cut the number of workers to 194 to assure
that the plant becomes an efficient enterprise. If they followed
traditional management practices, they would have to employ at
least 1,560 workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
When the plant becomes fully operational in late 1999, the
average volume of power generated per worker will be 87.63 million
kw/hours of electricity annually, and the per capita annual output
value of the plant will be 27 million yuan (3.3 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Ertan Hydropower Development Corporation, which is held
responsible for the plant's construction and power generation, now
has 300 workers.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junfeng, manager of the corporation, said the plant will
later reduce the number of workers on the payroll to about 150
when the remaining generating units are installed and put into
operation.
</P>
<P>
The entire cost of the Ertan Hydropower Plant is expected to be
28.5 billion yuan (3.4 billion U.S. dollars), with 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars coming from World Bank loans. In addition to the
large work force, there are 700 technicians and specialists from
47 countries involved in this project.

<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A report by a parliamentary mission on the role played by
France in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda was published on
Tuesday. While stressing the grave faults committed by France in
judging the situation in Rwanda on the eve of the genocide, the
mission, led by former Socialist defense minister Paul Quiles,
denied direct involvement by France in the death of some 800,000
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
-- At a tripartite summit held at the border check point of
Erez with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu refused to implement the withdrawal of troops from West
Bank as it was scheduled by the Wye River agreements, and rejected
the call for the release of Palestinian prisoners arrested during
the Intifada.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin admitted on Tuesday that
the objective to achieve a 2.7 percent GDP growth in 1999 will be
difficult to attain. The prime minister is trying to match his
social and economic program with the pact of stability within the
euro zone.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the annulation of the articles on the destruction of
the state of Israel by Palestinians, Israel Tuesday refused to
implement the withdrawal of troops from Palestinian territories in
the West Bank and release Palestinian prisoners. U.S. President Bill
Clinton quit Israel on Tuesday without succeeding in giving a
decisive push to the peace process.

<P>
TOKYO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Helped by a surge Tuesday on
Wall Street, stock prices in Tokyo finished higher Wednesday
following declines in the previous four consecutive trading days.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 85.11 points, or 0.61
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 14,096.30.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all First Section
issues, added 4.12 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,093.39.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section declined to an estimated 331
million shares from Tuesday's 409.57 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's rebound in Tokyo came about partly due to a 0.86
percent rise in electronics shares, particularly those of
export-oriented high-tech blue chips, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, banks lost 0.55 percent as a sector, their eighth
straight losing day, in the aftermath of the temporary
nationalization of insolvent Nippon Credit Bank (NCB), they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers edged losers
556 to 528, with 201 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Plunges Into Recession Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To stimulate the confidence of domestic consumers and
investors,
measures aimed at minimizing the deflationary impact of the crisis
on
the economy and expediting economic recovery were put in place.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara Malaysia, the state bank, lowered the Statutory
Reserve Requirements for financial institutions from 13.5 percent
to
the present 4 percent in stages, injecting some 38 billion ringgit

(10 billion dollars) into the market to quicken lending to spur
business activities.
</P>
<P>
The government also announced the establishment of several
funds
to help finance certain sectors like infrastructure development,
small- and medium-size industries, export, housing and food
production.
</P>
<P>
More notably, the National Economic Action Council unveiled in
July the National Economic Recovery Plan which focuses on
stabilizing
currency and capital markets and consolidating economic
foundations.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the plan, the Malaysian central bank announced
on September 1 the imposition of selective exchange controls and
pegged the ringgit, the local currency, at a rate of 3.8 to the
U.S. dollar the next day to insulate itself from "predatory
speculators."
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the financial system, Pengurusan Danaharta
Nasional Bhd (National Asset Management Corporation) and Danamodal
Nasional Bhd (National Capital Fund Corporation) were set up with
specialized objectives to purge the banking system of
non-performing loans and to recapitalize domestic banks
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Observers say Malaysia's pre-emptive strategies to ease the
stress in the financial and capital markets would be able to help
bring back confidence.
</P>
<P>
In conformity with the expansionary policies, Mahathir, who is
also first finance minister, presented in Parliament in October
Malaysia's first deficit budget in more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget proposed an expenditure totaling 65.095 billion
ringgit (17.13 billion dollars) against an estimated revenue of
47.16 billion ringgit (12.41 billion dollars), leaving a gap of
17.935 billion ringgit (4.719 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the 1999 budget strategy was aimed at reviving
economic activities and insulating the economy from the contagion
effects of the regional financial crisis, stabilizing the
financial market and the value of the ringgit, strengthening the
resilience and competitiveness of the national economy,
restructuring the financial sector and improving governance in the
private and public sectors, strengthening the balance of payments,
and ensuring social well-being.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the full implementation of the
economic recovery measures would pave the way for a mild recovery
of the Malaysian economy in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said last month
when releasing the economic data for the third quarter that "the
contraction in the economy has bottomed out in the third quarter
and latest indicators point towards gradual improvement in
economic conditions."
</P>
<P>
According to most forecasts made by the government, the
Malaysian Institute of Strategy and International Studies as well
as the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research, Malaysia will
post a positive real GDP growth in 1999 ranging from 0.7 percent
to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main source of the growth is expected to be generated
through domestic demand, stimulated by the measures that have been
put in place by the government recently to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said Malaysia's economic prospects for 1999
would be determined by the speed of implementing economic recovery
measures, developments in the economies of its major trading
partners and the overall growth of world trade.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed to several factors as potential constraints
to any huge gains in boosting growth, which include the high level
of domestic debt, business and consumer sentiment affected by the
uncertain labor market outlook, the sluggish stock market and
property market.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Noncompliance Unacceptable, Says U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said Tuesday that the Iraqi obstruction to U.N. weapons
inspections as described in a U.N. report was "simply
unacceptable" and all options remained open, including possible
air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was the first response from the United States to the report
to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan by U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) Chairman Richard Butler, who said Iraqi obstruction,
evasion and subterfuge had made it impossible for him to assure
the U.N. Security Council that Baghdad's weapons of mass
destruction have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in
either the fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons programs," he said in the report.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said this kind of
conduct was a "very serious matter" and Iraq's obstruction to the
U.N. weapons inspections were "simply unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"When Iraq blocks an inspection, we assume that Iraq has
something it doesn't want inspectors to see," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have said military strikes remain
an option to compel Baghdad to comply with U.N. resolutions on
weapons inspections. And Foley said that option remained open.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have the authority we need under previous
Security Council resolutions to act and all options are on the
table," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said no decision had been made on whether to proceed with
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq, but President Bill Clinton
would review Butler's report with his senior foreign policy
advisers.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty serious and makes some strong conclusions," he
said of the report. "The president will review those conclusion
with his senior advisers."
</P>
<P>
Foley declined to speculate about how Clinton and his advisers
would respond to Butler's report.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Khatami Faces Hurdles in Pushing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- With both difficulties and
successes, Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami has been
trying hard to push political reforms to lead his Islamic nation
into a "civil society."
</P>
<P>
To attain this goal, the president has to fight on two
fronts. On the domestic front, Khatami embarked on strengthening
the rule of law, protecting public freedom and encouraging
people's participation in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the front of foreign relations, Khatami went out of his way
to improve Iran's image, forge closer cooperation with world
countries, especially the Gulf Arab neighbors, and ease tension
between avowed foes like the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, this process has met hurdles after hurdles. From the
very beginning, the conservatives, who fear their dominance of
power would be undermined, opposed these reforms with zeal, even
in a violent way.
</P>
<P>
They trumpeted that priority should be given to economic
development, not political development, as the country is facing a
serious economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Islamic values should be safeguarded and any
liaison with the "world arrogance" - the U.S. - is a breach of the
Islamic values and the teachings of late spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's allies countered the idea by saying that political
development is a necessary guarantee for economic recovery and
the country simply can not be forced off the path it now takes
under the reform-minded president.
</P>
<P>
They argued that Iran's economy growth is more or less
dependent on a favorable external environment, and relations
should be bettered with world powers, even the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in August last year, Khatami has brought
some striking changes in Iran. Newspapers have been "springing up
like mushrooms" and many cultural and political groups and parties
emerging.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives were angered and tried their best to arrest
the alarming trend and to besmirch the government. Islamic
militants with conservative backgrounds disrupted rallies and
gatherings, beat up demonstrators and attacked American visitors.
</P>
<P>
The hardliners also stormed newspaper offices, punished liberal
editors and closed down liberal publications, accusing the media
of abusing freedom of the press and threatening the country's
security.
</P>
<P>
The opponents also targeted Khatami's principal aides. In
April, then Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a well-known
technocrat, was arrested on charges of corruption and misuse of
government funds. He was then sentenced in July to five years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Karbashi's trial and sentencing is seen as a political
punishment for his support for Khatami in the presidential
elections last year and a resounding warning to others in the
moderate camp.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated Majlis, with a no-confidence vote in
June, sacked former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, one of the
most important administrators in the Khatami government to carry
out his political reforms.
</P>
<P>
As the government encouraged the people's participation in
political affairs, the conservative Guardians Council barred many
prominent figures from being candidates for elections.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is facing pressures from both his opponents and
supporters. Mohammad Ali Abtahi, head of the president's office,
said that the opponents set hurdles in his way while his
supporters urge for more radical steps to fulfill his promises to
the people.
</P>
<P>
The president played up the rule of law to contain his
adversaries and appease his supporters. "All people must obey the
laws and must be committed to order, and we have no choice but to
stay within the boundaries of the constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also reacted strongly to conservative challenges. Following
Karbaschi's arrest, he appealed the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei for his release; after Nouri's oust, he immediately
appointed the former minister as vice president.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties, the Iranian president has made his way
forward with the political reforms. His allies have pledged to
help him continue the path and now are preparing for the
forthcoming elections for city and town councils slated for
February 26.
</P>
<P>
They expect a massive turnout in support of Khatami, similar to
that during the presidential elections in May last year, to shore
up his position and advance his reform plan.
</P>
<P>
What complicates the situation, however, is that Iran's
economy, which relies heavily on oil revenues, has been in a bad
mood this year as oil prices on the world market dropped to years'
lows.
</P>
<P>
With no immediate turnaround in sight, the government has to
cut expenditures to keep accounts balance. But whether economic
hardships will erode people's support for the president and offer
more ammunition to his adversaries is yet to be seen.
</P>
<P>
It is hopeful that the efforts made by the president will bear
fruits soon; or so many well-wishers believe.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The all-professional
Philippine Centennial basketball team was beaten by South Korea
103-83 in its last Group B quarterfinal match in the 13th Asian
Games here on Wedensday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the Philippines that finished 1-2 in the group,
qualified for the men's semifinals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the loss to South Korea dimmed the Philippines' hope for
the hoop gold as it is being pitted against three-time defending
champion China in the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
"China is the team to beat. We wanted to avoid China and did't
want to play them until the final. But now, we'll try everything
best we can to play China," Tim Coan, the Philippines' American
head coach said after the game.
</P>
<P>
China has never lost its semifinals in the Asian Games since
1978 and captured four golds and one silver in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Seo Jang-Hoon hit the game-high 26 points with three rebounds
for South Korea and veteran playmaker Kang Dong-Hee added 23 and
four key assists.
</P>
<P>
The top scorer for the Philippines was K. Durendes with 19
points and six rebounds while Marlou Aouino added 16 and Dernnis
Espino 14.
</P>
<P>
South Korea shot 36 of 65 (55%) from the field and surged ahead
in a 13-2 run after exchanging the leads with the Philippines in
the beginning of the match. South Korea built a solid lead of
49-36 at the break.
</P>
<P>
South Korea continued its dominance in the second half with
sharp long shots and solid zoon defence, which was prohibited in
the Philippine professisonal leagues, and Lee Sang-Min's basket
gave South Korea the biggest lead of 87-61 with 8:21 minutes to go
on the clock.
</P>
<P>
In the final five minutes, South Korea head coach Choi Bu-Yung
replaced all his starters with young bench players but still kept
the leading margin at 20 when the game ended.
</P>
<P>
"They shot the ball well and moved the ball well. I don't think
we have good defence today," Coan said.
</P>
<P>
"Their zoon defence didn't bother much. The factor matters
most is that we just could not get our defence start and we got
frustrated. We missed easy shots," the coach added.
</P>
<P>
Before the quadrennial sporting gala in Asia, the all-pro
Philippine centennial team set its eyes to grab the title to end
the country's hoop gold drought since 1974.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was consecutive gold medal winner in the first
four Asian Games from 1951 to 1962 and regained the title in the
1974 Teheran Games.
</P>
<P>
But the basketball crazy islands have never repeated the glory
since launching their professenal league PBA in 1975 since then
the country was represented by top amateurs in the international
meets.
</P>
<P>
The best results the Filipinos have achieved was a silver medal
at the Beijing Games by a hastily-formed PBA All-Star team in
1990.
</P>
<P>
This year in Bangkok, the Philippines has fielded in all its
best cagers in the Centennial team to fight for the gold after the
country celebrated its 100th anniversery of freedom from Spainish
domination in June.

<HEADLINE> Huge Energy Resources to Be Tapped in North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Huge deposits of energy
resources have been discovered along the Hebei section of the
Beijing-Kowloon railway line, according to a recent report from the
State Geological Prospecting Department.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, there are 976 million tons of
petroleum deposits and more than 17 billion tons of coal deposits
in the area. Some 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas deposits
have also been found there.
</P>
<P>
Qi Lanfu, a senior engineer at the Hebei Geological Prospecting
and Development Bureau said that the petroleum resources
discovered in the area are of high quality and are easily
recoverable. Currently, the annual output of oil in the area is
some three million tons.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas deposit is also of high value for industrial
and civil use. Presently, there are plans to extract some 300
million cubic meters of natural gas annually for pipeline
transport to Beijing, according to Qi.
</P>
<P>
Huge coal resources here are buried deep under the earth. There
are over 144 billion cubic meters of coal deposits hidden some
2,000 meters below the earth, and at least 54 billion cubic meters
buried at a depth less than 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
If around 500 million cubic meters of coal gas is extracted
annually, the coal gas deposit in the shallow layer of less than
1,500 meters can be tapped for a century, Qi said, adding that
with the development of exploration technology, coal deposits some
2,000 meters below the earth will last for more than two centuries.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the proximity of these huge resources
to Beijing and Tianjin, two great metropolitans in north China,
makes transportation less costly and will help ease energy
shortages as well as protect the local environments.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran edged China 1-0 to enter
the Asiad soccer tournament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The winner came four minutes into the second half when Ali Daei
sent a free-kick into the penalty area and Daryoush Yakdani made
no mistake by beating the Chinese goal-keeper Jiang Jin with a low
shot.
</P>
<P>
The first half saw the Iranian team gain an upper hand over
their Chinese opponents, who they have beaten 3-1 earlier in the
Asiad soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian team, packed with World Cup players and full of
experiences, dominated the midfield and found it easy to penetrate
the Chinese defence line.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese team, which missed their forward Hao Haidong
and head coach Bobby Houghton due to suspension, put up a
courageous defence to keep the Iranians to a goalless draw at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team started the second half strongly and Yang
Cheng missed a clear opportunity at the 47th minute when his
header just high over the bar.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians were just better than the Chinese players in
grasping the opportunity. They were awarded a free-kick in front
of the penalty area and Ali Daei set Mousavi up for the winner at
the 49th minute.
</P>
<P>
After that the Iranians gave up the midfield and let the
Chinese team do the attacking. But they didn't give their
opponents any scoring chances and kept the 1-0 edge till the final
whistle.
</P>
<P>
Iran will take on the winners of the other semifinal match

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The 27.5-kilometer-long
border separating Hong Kong and Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province has proved to be a gate to happiness for
Shenzhen's thousands of families made up of both Hong Kong and
Shenzhen residents.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Huang Shuiying, 60, has a six-member family of
three Hong Kong residents and three Shenzhen residents. Huang
said, "We are living a very happy life, and there is no difference
between us."
</P>
<P>
What is different from other ordinary Chinese families is that
half of his family comes from Hong Kong which has a capitalist
system, and the others are from socialist Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Huang's wife, who holds a Hong Kong residence permit, takes a
30-minute train ride each day to work in Hong Kong, and she has a
multi-journey certificate enabling her to go through the border
check easily.
</P>
<P>
Huang's family has built two seven-story buildings in Shenzhen,
and a third is being constructed. Huang said happily, "My wife and
I will move into the new building and live there for the rest of
our lives when she retires."
</P>
<P>
Huang's wife immigrated to Hong Kong in 1975, and two years
later two of his daughters also went to Hong Kong. But Huang and
his two other children remained in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
He explained that at that time Hong Kong was still under
British rule and they were not confident about Hong Kong's
future. "Anyway, Shenzhen is my hometown." Huang said.
</P>
<P>
China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, 1997, and established the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region on the same day.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Taipei outscored China
10-6 here on Wednesday to take the baseball bronze medal at the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
China grabbed a two-run lead at the fourth inning amid a
pitching duel between its Zhang Wanjun and Chuan Chin-Her of
Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Later on, a pile of defensive errors from China put the Chinese
Taipei far ahead, hard for China to catch up anymore.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei had its run on four hits in the sixth as
22-year-old left-hander Zhang got tired and Wang Zhanpeng promptly
surrendered a run-scoring single and another run on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
In the next inning, Wang's two throwing errors led to two runs
for Chinese Taipei and a third ushered in Chinese Taipei's another
runner who later scored.
</P>
<P>
Pan Chuan-Wei sent home two other base runners with a double
and Chang Tai-shan smacked a two-run home run to put the Chinese
Taipei ahead 10-2.
</P>
<P>
China came back with four runs in the bottom of the seventh,
but was in no way to narrow the score any further.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei, who also won the bronze at the Hiroshima Asian
Games four years ago, finished the competition with two wins and
four defeats.
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea were to play for the gold medal later
Wednesday.

Huang's home town of Xiasha Village is separated from Hong
Kong's New Territory by a river, and Huang said it has almost
become a tradition in the village for some family members to go to
Hong Kong and some to stay in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
However, many families like Huang's suffered a lot during the
"cultural revolution" (1966-1976), during which China stressed
class struggle. Children in families which had "overseas
relatives" were deprived of their right to go to secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 1978, when China adopted the reform and
opening-up policy, that Huang was able to be reunited with his
wife and daughters in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since then, good bits of news have come one after
another: Shenzhen was approved as one of China's first four
special economic zones, investors from Hong Kong built factories
in Huang's hometown, and Huang and his fellow villagers shook off
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Huang was elected as a member of the board of directors of the
Xiasha Village Shareholding Company six years ago, and this
position has brought a lot to his family.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that now few young people in Shenzhen want to settle
down in Hong Kong. "In Hong Kong, you can only work for someone
else, but in Shenzhen, one can do something of his own."
</P>
<P>
Huang admitted that Shenzhen is still behind Hong Kong
economically, but he said he is rather satisfied with the cultural
and ethical progress in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
In the area where Huang lives, there are playgrounds, swimming
pools, a cultural center, free kindergartens and retirement
apartments.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei, a young decorator in Hong Kong, married a young
Shenzhen woman nine years ago. He said, "I feel good about
everything, except the fact that my daughter and I have travel a
little longer to get to work and school every day."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Unraveling Historical Mystery (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese historians on Tuesday
reported to two subcommittees of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on
their work on a chronology of 5,000 years of Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Li Xueqin, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences'
Institute of History, Li Boqian, dean of Beijing University's
Archaeology Department, and Zhang Peiyu, a research fellow at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences' Purple Mountain Observatory, told the
committees that the nation's most prominent historians will
complete the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasty chronologies in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Existing Chinese historical chronicles begin in 841 B.C. and
have no precise record of nearly half the nation's earlier
history, so the government started a project to put precise dates
on the three dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The scholars' study focuses on events from 4,000 to 2,800 years
ago and determining the length of the three dynasties. It began in
May, 1996, with 170 historians working on 40 specific topics.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Forested Areas Account for 62.5 Pct of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's forested areas
now account for 62.5 percent of the country's land size of 32.9
million hectares, Deputy Primary Industries Minister Hishammuddin
Tun Hussein said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Up to last year, the country had 20.56 million hectares of
forested areas including 5.82 million hectares in Peninsular
Malaysia, 4.46 million hectares in Sabah and 10.28 million
hectares in Sarawak, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable forest management adopted by Malaysia has ensured
more systematic exploitation, maintenance and treatment and
afforestation, he said in the Senate. He added that the government
also rehabilitated degraded areas by planting timber species to
boost afforestation and reduce the pressure on timber resources
from natural forest areas.
</P>
<P>
He said other approaches adopted include gazetting of permanent
forest reserves and alienating areas for national parks and
wildlife and bird sanctuaries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Plunges Into Recession Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- After enjoying an average
annual growth rate of 8 percent for a decade, Malaysia plunged
into an economic recession this year due to the financial crisis
that engulfed the region in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced Tuesday
that the country's economy would contract by 6 percent in 1998
against the earlier official projection of 4.8 percent
contraction.
</P>
<P>
Even more gloomy is the recent forecast by the Malaysian
Institute of Economic Research, known as a government think-tank,
that the country's real gross domestic product (GDP) for 1998
would contract by 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
No matter which figure is more accurate, the contraction, at a
faster pace than anticipated and the first since 1985, is "severe
and unprecedented" compared with the 7.7-percent growth attained
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As all major sectors of the economy have been seriously
affected by the sharply decreased domestic demand resulting from
the prevailing regional financial crisis, official figures show
that Malaysia's real GDP contracted by 2.8 percent in the first
quarter of this year and then 6.8 percent in the second quarter
and 8.6 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the first three quarters this year, the manufacturing
sector, which provided the main impetus to the overall GDP growth
for the past decade, fell by 8.3 percent, the construction sector
by 23.3 percent and the agricultural sector by 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1988, the three sectors are envisaged to
contract by 5.8 percent, 19.2 percent and 5.9 percent respectively
against their respective growth of 12.5 percent, 9.5 percent and
1.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sharp contraction in the primary and secondary sectors has
led to declining demand for services. Therefore, the growth of the
tertiary sector also decelerated sharply to only 1.9 percent for
the first three quarters of 1998. The services sector is estimated
to grow by 2.1 percent in 1998 compared with a growth of 8 percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Malaysia, which has been successful in keeping
inflation at a low rate of about 3 percent for almost a decade, is
expected to record a higher inflation rate of about 5 percent
against 2.7 percent in 1997. During the first 11 months of 1998,
the inflation rate stood at 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the economic contraction has affected the pace of job
creation and led to increased incidence of structural
unemployment, Malaysia's unemployment rate in the outgoing year is
officially projected to increase to 4.9 percent against 2.7
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate in Malaysia is expected to rise to 8 percent
from 6.7 percent last year because of the economic downturn,
according to Malaysian Deputy Rural Development Minister K.
Kumaran.
</P>
<P>
This year however witnessed the strengthening of the trade
account which recorded a cumulative surplus of 38.7 billion
ringgit (10.184 billion U.S. dollars) in the first three quarters,
above the surplus of 35 billion ringgit (9.21 billion dollars)
forecast for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Another positive factor was that the country's international
reserves increased while its external debt position improved.
</P>
<P>
The sharp economic downturn in 1998 was attributed partly to
what Mahathir himself admitted recently "wrong policies" pursued
by the government at the initial stage of the regional financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Facing the slowdown, the Malaysian government has made a
turnaround in its macro-economic policy by abandoning tight fiscal
and monetary policies and implementing expansionary fiscal and
monetary policies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Plunges Into Recession Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- After enjoying an average
annual growth rate of 8 percent for a decade, Malaysia plunged
into an economic recession this year due to the financial crisis
that engulfed the region in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced Tuesday
that the country's economy would contract by 6 percent in 1998
against the earlier official projection of 4.8 percent
contraction.
</P>
<P>
Even more gloomy is the recent forecast by the Malaysian
Institute of Economic Research, known as a government think-tank,
that the country's real gross domestic product (GDP) for 1998
would contract by 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
No matter which figure is more accurate, the contraction, at a
faster pace than anticipated and the first since 1985, is "severe
and unprecedented" compared with the 7.7-percent growth attained
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As all major sectors of the economy have been seriously
affected by the sharply decreased domestic demand resulting from
the prevailing regional financial crisis, official figures show
that Malaysia's real GDP contracted by 2.8 percent in the first
quarter of this year and then 6.8 percent in the second quarter
and 8.6 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the first three quarters this year, the manufacturing
sector, which provided the main impetus to the overall GDP growth
for the past decade, fell by 8.3 percent, the construction sector
by 23.3 percent and the agricultural sector by 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1988, the three sectors are envisaged to
contract by 5.8 percent, 19.2 percent and 5.9 percent respectively
against their respective growth of 12.5 percent, 9.5 percent and
1.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sharp contraction in the primary and secondary sectors has
led to declining demand for services. Therefore, the growth of the
tertiary sector also decelerated sharply to only 1.9 percent for
the first three quarters of 1998. The services sector is estimated
to grow by 2.1 percent in 1998 compared with a growth of 8 percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Malaysia, which has been successful in keeping
inflation at a low rate of about 3 percent for almost a decade, is
expected to record a higher inflation rate of about 5 percent
against 2.7 percent in 1997. During the first 11 months of 1998,
the inflation rate stood at 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the economic contraction has affected the pace of job
creation and led to increased incidence of structural
unemployment, Malaysia's unemployment rate in the outgoing year is
officially projected to increase to 4.9 percent against 2.7
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate in Malaysia is expected to rise to 8 percent
from 6.7 percent last year because of the economic downturn,
according to Malaysian Deputy Rural Development Minister K.
Kumaran.
</P>
<P>
This year however witnessed the strengthening of the trade
account which recorded a cumulative surplus of 38.7 billion
ringgit (10.184 billion U.S. dollars) in the first three quarters,
above the surplus of 35 billion ringgit (9.21 billion dollars)
forecast for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Another positive factor was that the country's international
reserves increased while its external debt position improved.
</P>
<P>
The sharp economic downturn in 1998 was attributed partly to
what Mahathir himself admitted recently "wrong policies" pursued
by the government at the initial stage of the regional financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Facing the slowdown, the Malaysian government has made a
turnaround in its macro-economic policy by abandoning tight fiscal
and monetary policies and implementing expansionary fiscal and
monetary policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
To stimulate the confidence of domestic consumers and
investors,
measures aimed at minimizing the deflationary impact of the crisis
on
the economy and expediting economic recovery were put in place.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara Malaysia, the state bank, lowered the Statutory
Reserve Requirements for financial institutions from 13.5 percent
to
the present 4 percent in stages, injecting some 38 billion ringgit

(10 billion dollars) into the market to quicken lending to spur
business activities.
</P>
<P>
The government also announced the establishment of several
funds
to help finance certain sectors like infrastructure development,
small- and medium-size industries, export, housing and food
production.
</P>
<P>
More notably, the National Economic Action Council unveiled in
July the National Economic Recovery Plan which focuses on
stabilizing
currency and capital markets and consolidating economic
foundations.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the plan, the Malaysian central bank announced
on September 1 the imposition of selective exchange controls and
pegged the ringgit, the local currency, at a rate of 3.8 to the
U.S. dollar the next day to insulate itself from "predatory
speculators."
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the financial system, Pengurusan Danaharta
Nasional Bhd (National Asset Management Corporation) and Danamodal
Nasional Bhd (National Capital Fund Corporation) were set up with
specialized objectives to purge the banking system of
non-performing loans and to recapitalize domestic banks
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Observers say Malaysia's pre-emptive strategies to ease the
stress in the financial and capital markets would be able to help
bring back confidence.
</P>
<P>
In conformity with the expansionary policies, Mahathir, who is
also first finance minister, presented in Parliament in October
Malaysia's first deficit budget in more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget proposed an expenditure totaling 65.095 billion
ringgit (17.13 billion dollars) against an estimated revenue of
47.16 billion ringgit (12.41 billion dollars), leaving a gap of
17.935 billion ringgit (4.719 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the 1999 budget strategy was aimed at reviving
economic activities and insulating the economy from the contagion
effects of the regional financial crisis, stabilizing the
financial market and the value of the ringgit, strengthening the
resilience and competitiveness of the national economy,
restructuring the financial sector and improving governance in the
private and public sectors, strengthening the balance of payments,
and ensuring social well-being.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the full implementation of the
economic recovery measures would pave the way for a mild recovery
of the Malaysian economy in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said last month
when releasing the economic data for the third quarter that "the
contraction in the economy has bottomed out in the third quarter
and latest indicators point towards gradual improvement in
economic conditions."
</P>
<P>
According to most forecasts made by the government, the
Malaysian Institute of Strategy and International Studies as well
as the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research, Malaysia will
post a positive real GDP growth in 1999 ranging from 0.7 percent
to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main source of the growth is expected to be generated
through domestic demand, stimulated by the measures that have been
put in place by the government recently to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, observers said Malaysia's economic prospects for 1999
would be determined by the speed of implementing economic recovery
measures, developments in the economies of its major trading
partners and the overall growth of world trade.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed to several factors as potential constraints
to any huge gains in boosting growth, which include the high level
of domestic debt, business and consumer sentiment affected by the
uncertain labor market outlook, the sluggish stock market and
property market.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Papua New Guinea Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua)-- China's President Jiang Zemin
has told Papua New Guinea prime minister Bill Skate that their
ongoing warm relationship was fundamental to continued peace and
stability in the South Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders met in the Great Hall of the People this
morning where Jiang welcomed Skate, urging him to help expand the
two countries' friendly bilateral links into a long term project.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides should consider the 21st century prospective so
that these already mutually beneficial ties will become even more
stable and grow healthily," Jiang commented to Skate.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president described Skate as an 'old friend of
China' and said that the ties with his country were highly valued,
especially as it was one of the first to open diplomatic links
with China 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled that a number of Papua New Guinea leaders,
apart from prime minister Skate, have visited China over the last
two decades and that Chinese leaders have made many reciprocal
visits. As a result he was confident that there would be fruitful
exchanges in trade, education, culture and health.
</P>
<P>
Although China and Papua New Guinea have different cultural
traditions and social systems, both countries are similar in
certain ways, Jiang went on, explaining that each was keen to
develop its national economy, improve the people's standard of
living and safeguard national sovereignty, as well as both helping
to support peace and stability throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Skate remarked that he was delighted to visit China and meet
President Jiang. "My country values very highly its relations with
China and as its prime minister, personally I cherish this
friendship with the Chinese leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told Jiang that he and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji had
enjoyed extensive and fruitful talks on bilateral relations and
issues of common concern yesterday, and that he was more than
satisfied with the results.
</P>
<P>
Skate added that he believed his current visit had boosted
bilateral ties to a new level and wanted to stimulate even closer
economic and trade cooperation. Therefore, he suggested to Jiang
that there be more frequent high level visits to facilitate
such cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Growth Continues in China's Transport Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's transportation
industry has continued its steady growth this year, especially in
rapid transit modes, according to statistics released by the State
Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Commission revealed that the nation's combined transport
services will have carried 13.3 billion passengers and 13.7
billion tons of freight by the end of 1998, up 3.4 and 3 percent
respectively from last year.
</P>
<P>
Passenger transport volume has grown by between 2 and 4
percent over 1997, although the freight volume has remained static
at approximately 1.62 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year the number of auto travelers is
expected to have increased by 5 percent more than 1997's 11.4
billion. And the amount of freight transported on China's highways
and roads has grown by 4 percent over 1997's figure.
</P>
<P>
The Commission's figures also predict that the number of air
travelers will have increased by between 5 and 10 percent on
1997's 56.3 million.
</P>
<P>
However, following a world trend, China's sea forwarding and
shipping industry will show a slight decline although the tonnage
of products carried by pipelines will have maintained a level of
growth.
</P>
<P>
As China modernizes its infrastructure, industry and commerce
are calling for higher speeds in transporting people, commodities
and goods.
</P>
<P>
By the year's end there will be more than 5,000 kilometers of
expressways open throughout China, allowing passenger and
freight vehicles to travel faster. And since October 1st most
trains have been running faster.
</P>
<P>
Now the Ministry of Railways has announced that work on
China's first express railway, linking Beijing with Shanghai and
capable of reaching speeds of up to 300 km per hour, will start in
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But the Commission admits that it has been difficult to break
the transport "bottlenecks" which have badly afflicted the
southwestern and eastern parts of China this year. It says that
the existing transport capacity - and infrastructure - will not be
able to meet the peak demands of next year's Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
China's transportation industry will have more opportunities
to expand in the next century as the country's economic growth and
social development boosts combined passenger transport volume to
17.5 billion in the year 2000, representing an annual increase of
8 percent.

Li says that the scholars gradually reached a concensus after
examining excavations at the Erlitou Ruins in Henan Province. They
decided that the Xia Dynasty (21 century - 17 century B.C.) culture
originated from the Erlitou. The small town near there could well
be the first Shang Dynasty (16 century - 11 century B.C.).
</P>
<P>
They also believe that King Wuding of the Shang Dynasty was on
the throne from roughly 1250 to 1192 B.C. and that the battle
between King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty (11 century B.C. - 771 B.C.)
and King Zhou, the Shang Dynasty's last king, might have taken
place between 1050 B.C. and 1020 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, said that
Chinese culture, which continues to influence the nation in modern
times, had its foundation from the three dynasties and he
congratulated the scholars on their work.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party and head of CASS, said that the
scholars should paint a complete picture of China's ancient
culture to show the rest of the world.

JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua)-- The following are major

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>

Ha'aretz

topple him at next week's parliament non-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
Yedioth Aharonot:

MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia in 1998 was buffeted by
crises -- the governmental crisis, the economic crisis and the
confidence crisis, which made President Boris Yeltsin's plan of "a
year of reconciliation and economic growth" all but evaporated.
</P>
<P>
Seven years after Russia's emergence from the disintegrated
Soviet Union, a weakened president, two fired prime ministers and
two major financial crises have dragged the world's largest
country into a new low, both economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
The crises not only wiped out the momentum of economic growth,
albeit feeble, registered late 1997, but also fueled social
discontent and broke the relative balance between the political
forces in the country, which pushed Russia toward the left
opposition.
</P>
<P>
In both governmental crises of dismissing prime ministers
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergei Kiriyenko, the political landscape
was dominated by the haggling between the ruling establishment and
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
If Chernomyrdin's ouster in March was a preemptive move by
President Yeltsin to strengthen his own position, the August
dismissal of Kiriyenko was a step smacking of helplessness.
</P>
<P>
In March, armed with a sword of Damocles to dissolve the State
Duma, Yeltsin managed to force the Communist-dominated opposition
in the lower house of parliament to confirm Kiriyenko as premier
at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
In August, however, it was Yeltsin who made a major concession
in the final showdown to give up reinstating Chernomyrdin and
nominate Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The two dramatically different scenarios drew a vivid contrail
of Russia's political struggles this year, marking Yeltsin's
waning influence.
</P>
<P>
What, then, drove Russian politics to move in such an erratic
way? Observers point to the "crisis of confidence" resulting from
a chronically ailing economy as a fundamental reason behind
Yeltsin's faltering position.
</P>
<P>
Despite the frail improvement of the economy late last year and
early this year, the strategic efforts over the years in boosting
production, fighting inflation, foreign trade structure and
borrowing have failed to address the root causes of economic
decline.
</P>
<P>
As the outcome of the Asian financial turbulence and the
depressed oil price in the world, Russia's top export commodity
almost instantly sent the already tattered Russian economy into
further descent. The stock crashes in May and August, the bond
market paralysis and the eventual devaluation of the ruble were
just inevitable.
</P>
<P>
In current Russia, the debate among various political movements
over economic issues is manifested in their struggle for the upper
hand in state affairs. Economic crisis induces political crisis
and political crisis deepens economic crisis in a vicious circle
that gravely hampers Russia's pace of development.
</P>
<P>
For ordinary Russians, their worst nightmare of the year came
on August 17, when the Kiriyenko government effectively devalued
the ruble and defaulted on some foreign and domestic debts.
</P>
<P>
The ruble shed 70 percent of its value in the aftermath. The
proportion of people living below the poverty line went up from 20
percent at the beginning of the year to some 30 percent at
yearend. An inflation of 75-80 percent cut the residents' real
income by 15.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the overall economic front, Russia's agricultural and
industrial outputs this year are expected to slide by six and 10
percent respectively while gross domestic product is set to drop
by five percent on 1997's figure.
</P>
<P>
All this makes an economic recovery almost impossible in the
short run. Primakov, the new prime minister just in office for
about 100 days, faces a daunting task in reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
"I am no magician," he warned Duma deputies during his
confirmation. "And please wait one year, not 100 days, to evaluate
the government's work."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who as foreign minister straightened Russian foreign
policy and strengthened Moscow's status as a world power on the
global arena, sounded optimistic for the coming year, saying 1999
might well be a prelude to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, in volatile Russia, reality usually defies optimism.
</P>
<P>
Duma election and a possible early presidential race,
compounded by economic woes, are bound to intensify the fray among
the various political factions and divert the country's efforts
for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Crisis, after all, may continue to be a catchword for the
Russians in the new year.

<HEADLINE> Money Supply Rises in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Money supply in Kenya rose by
9.9 percent in the 12 months to October 1998 compared to eight
percent in the year to September, according to the monthly
economic review by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the review which is available Wednesday,
said the 9.9 percent expansion was higher than expected. The
October stock of money stood at 302.3 billion Shillings (around
60 Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar) compared to the targeted
299.9 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The review said the money supply was expected to grow faster
during the year following the lowering of the cash ratio
requirement from 15 percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase in money supply was attributed to the rapid rise
in net domestic assets of the banking system comprising the
Central bank, commercial banks and non banking financial
institutions as in their net foreign assets.
</P>
<P>
To check undue expansion in money supply, the CBK conducted
Open Market Operation sales of treasury bills with commercial
banks and rolled over maturing government securities.
</P>
<P>
These operations ensured that reserve money, the intermediate
target for the expansion of money and inflation remained on
course, according to the review.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders Adopt Measures for Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian leaders, who
ended their two-day summit here Wednesday, adopted a number of
measures to revive the region's economy and address the economic
problems that have been plaguing their countries since last year.
</P>
<P>
In the Hanoi Declaration they approved at Wednesday's meeting,
heads of state and government from the nine ASEAN member countries
admitted that the economic and financial upheaval afflicting the
region's economies "has severely set back many of the gains that
our nations and our association have achieved."
</P>
<P>
They pledged to "overcome those economic and social
difficulties by working together in ever closer cooperation and
ever stronger solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Meeting under the theme of "unity and cooperation for an ASEAN
of peace, stability and equitable development," the leaders vowed
to "move ASEAN onto a higher plane of regional cooperation in
order to strengthen ASEAN's effectiveness in dealing with the
challenges of growing interdependence within ASEAN and of its
integration into the global economy."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (The Association of Southeast Asian Nations) now groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN region, which was one of the fastest growing areas in
the world in the 1980s and 1990s, was plunged into a financial
crisis last year, reducing the growth rate of some member
countries to the negative and forcing them to seek assistance from
the International Monetary Fund and other organizations and
countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said ASEAN will keep its markets open to attract
long-term investments which they described as "the key to
strengthening and stabilizing the region's currencies and
economies."
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their commitment to the greater
integration of their economies "as a primary expression of our
cooperation and solidarity."
</P>
<P>
The leaders approved at the summit a number of what they called
"bold measures" to improve the investment climate in member
countries in order "to regain business confidence, enhance
economic recovery and promote growth."
</P>
<P>
According to the measures, the ASEAN countries will extend a
number of incentives to qualified ASEAN and non-ASEAN investors in
the manufacturing sector, including a minimum three-year corporate
income tax exemption, or a minimum 30-percent corporate investment
tax allowance, 100-percent foreign equity ownership, duty-free
imports of capital goods and domestic market access.
</P>
<P>
In the Hanoi Plan of Action, a plan for implementing the ASEAN
Vision 2020 up to the year 2004, the leaders pledged to restore
confidence, regenerate economic growth and promote regional
financial stability through maintaining sound macroeconomic and
financial policies and strengthening the financial system and
capital markets so as to avoid disturbances in the future.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Vision 2020 foresees an ASEAN "as a concert of
Southeast Asian nations, outward looking, living in peace,
stability and prosperity, bonded together in partnership in
dynamic development and in a community of caring societies."
</P>
<P>
The plan contains a number of concrete measures to improve the
member countries' trade and financial systems and facilitate trade
among ASEAN members as well as with other countries through
accelerated implementation of AFTA and other liberalization
measures to remove trade barriers by cutting tariffs to 0-5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the ASEAN countries will promote liberalization
of the financial services sector and intensify cooperation in
money, tax and insurance matters including feasibility studies on
the establishment of an ASEAN currency and exchange rate system.
</P>
<P>
They will also create "a stable, prosperous and highly
competitive ASEAN Economic Region in which there is a free flow of
goods, services and investment, a freer flow of capital, equitable
economic development and reduced poverty and socioeconomic
disparities."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to go ahead with the establishment of
the ASEAN Investment Area, where each ASEAN country will give
foreign investors the privileges of their own nationals in an
effort to attract more direct investment into and within ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen to Set Up Venture Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's first special
economic zone, Shenzhen, will become the country's pilot zone in
establishing venture capital markets, local officials have said.
</P>
<P>
A 100-million-U.S.-dollar investment fund for venture capital
has been recently established in Hong Kong to serve the high-tech
industry in Shenzhen and other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Ye Minhui, a ranking official with the Municipal Bureau of
Science and Technology, said that Shenzhen will strive to
establish a venture capital market and make itself the country's
largest trading center of high-tech products in two years.
</P>
<P>
An investment company with a registered capital of one billion
yuan was set up in Shenzhen four months ago. The company and the
new fund in Hong Kong will make combined efforts to help
establish the venture capital market, said Ye.
</P>
<P>
Twenty more investment companies with a combined capital of
400 million yuan will be set up in the next two years to deal in
venture capital.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the service sector, such as consultation and
information, will play a more important role in the venture
capital market, and that foreign venture capital will be
introduced into the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
A project-introduction center has already been set up by the
Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology for venture capital.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the high-tech industry in Shenzhen is
expected to reach 90 billion yuan in 2000 to account for more
than 40 percent of the city's gross industrial output value,
according to the municipal government.

<HEADLINE> All U.N. Arms Inspectors Evacuate From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- All U.N. arms inspectors,
about 120 personnels, evaluated from Baghdad on Wednesday morning,
a move that indicates a possible U.S.-led air strike against
Iraq is on its way.
</P>
<P>
The arms inspectors left Baghdad Monitoring and Verification
Center at around 9:40, possibly heading for Habaniya airport, 80
kilometers west of Baghdad, from where they would fly to
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
A reliable U.N. sources who asked anonymity told Xinhua ealier
Wednesday that U.N. arms inspectors have received notice from New
York asking them to get ready to evacuate from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Iraq announced unconditional cooperation with
U.N. arms inspections it suspended three months ago, narrowly
escaping a U.S.-led punishing air strike.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. warned that if Iraq failed to fully cooperate
with U.N. arms inspectors, it would strike Iraq without getting
approval from the U.N. Security Council and without prior warning.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler said in his report
Tuesday to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Iraq failed
to fully cooperate with his personnels.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in
either the field of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons program," said Butler in the report.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq, known as UNSOCM,
alleged that Iraq had not handed over all documents concerning its
weapons programs, and that U.N. arms inspectors were blocked from
entering several Iraqi sites.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Tuesday in
Washington that Butler's report was a "very serious matter" and
all options, including air raids, remained open.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has returned home from a
Middle East trip, will review the report with his foreign policy
aides, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
But no decisions has yet been made on what actions the United
States will take to deal with the new development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou Bans Marketing of Vegetables with Pesticide Residues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Hangzhou, capital of eastern
China's Zhejiang province, is making efforts to eliminate
vegetables with pesticide residues from the market.
</P>
<P>
In the city's Zhaohui Farm Produce Market, a sample monitoring
system recently took effect to give vegetables quick examinations
on the pesticide residue level before their entering into the
market.
</P>
<P>
At all wholesale agricultural product trading centers of the
city, quality supervisors are designated by the local government
to prevent vegetables with pesticide residues from being traded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a green vegetable base was recently set up with
governmental support. It grows vegetables with low-poison
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Agricultural Department of the city govern
ment said a nationwide monitoring and examination system has not
been established, and this is why "polluted vegetables" are able
to get direct access to the market.
</P>
<P>
The local government plans to use part of the agricultural
developemnt funds and the vegetable development funds to train
farmers to increase their legal awareness and teach them basic
knowledge concerning pesticides.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Province Boosting Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province in northeast
China has spent four billion yuan so far this year on
infrastructure construction to improve transportation, and water,
heat and gas supplies.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jixiao, an official with the Provincial Transportation
Department, said intensified infrastructure construction has
added 2.8 million square meters to the road network of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Heat supply has also been added to another five million square
meters of building area and gas pipelines extended to 100,000
more households, with water supply basically available to all
local residents, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The huge amount of investment, aimed to improve the people's
living standard and stimulate local demand, equals the province's
total in the previous five years, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has issued an additional 100 billion
yuan worth of special bonds earlier this year to support
nationwide infrastructure construction with a view to boosting
national economic growth to challenge the financial crisis
sweeping some Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Buy Advanced Air-to-Air Missiles: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced on
Wednesday that its air force will acquire new generation
air-to-air missiles under a 100 million Australian dollar (63
million U.S. dollar) upgrade of the F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as part of the efforts to maintain the
country's technological lead over air forces of Southeast Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister John Moore said the new Advanced
Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (known as ASRAAM) would
significantly improve Australia's air combat capability.
</P>
<P>
"They are fourth generation technology, highly agile, passive
infra-red guided weapons which can be launched using a variety of
aircraft systems," the minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the new missiles, made by the European Matra-British
Aersopace Dynamics group, were expected to enter service in 2001
as the Hornet upgrade was completed, and eventually replace the
AIM-9M "Sidewinder" missiles currently in use.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the Defense Department had selected a
new type of "beyond visual range" missiles to complement the
AIM-7M "Sparrow" missile currently in service.
</P>
<P>
"The new AIM-120 is a medium range, active radar-guided
missile, providing the Hornet with an all-weather, beyond visual
range, 'fire and forget' missiles which incorporates an advanced
Electronic Counter Measure Capability."
</P>
<P>
"The onboard technology will enable pilots to fire,
simultaneously, several missiles at multiple targets, and then
perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to
their targets."
</P>
<P>
AIM-120 missiles are in service in Britain and the United
States, and Australia would be the first nation in the region to
adopt them into service, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press (AAP) said the new missiles
plus the Hornet radar upgrades are expected to reinstate the
capability gap, again giving Australia a technological lead over
the air forces of regional nations.
</P>
<P>
AAP said that closing gap was highlighted by the Russian-built
MiG-29 fighters flown by the Royal Malaysian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
It said that in several war game encounters they used their
current-generation radars and missiles to "shoot down" Australian
air force's Hornets at ranges outside F/A-18 detection
capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Ties Are More Important Today: Kissinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Sino-U.S. relations have
become more important today, former U.S. secretary of state Henry
Kissinger said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States should make every effort to
cooperate for peace, stability and progress in Asia," he told a
meeting to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the normalization
of U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, who made a secret trip to China in 1971 and
accompanied President Richard Nixon on a visit to China in 1972,
served as U.S. secretary of state 1973-77. The visits paved the
way for the establishment of diplomatic relations on January 1,
1979.
</P>
<P>
It is important that the two countries maintain the spirit of
cooperation, Kissinger said, "there are no victories to be
achieved in either side trying to impose its preferences on the
other."
</P>
<P>
Recalling a statement made by the U.S. administration 20 years
ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Stanley Roth said those words stressing the importance of
Sino-U.S. relations "are still true today."
</P>
<P>
The statement had said that the United States believes that the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries
will contribute to wealth of the American people, stability of
Asia and peace in the world, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
China's remarkable economic achievements and increasing
diplomatic prominence have made it imperative to build a
cooperative relationship between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the exchange of state visits by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in the last
two years will "provide the momentum for movement forward on
issues of mutual concern."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the America-China Society, the
Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Zhaoxing, who was
also attended the function, said he hopes that the constructive
strategic partnership between China and the United States will be
enhanced on a more solid basis.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting were former U.S. secretary of
state Cyrus Vance and former U.S. ambassador to China Leonard
Woodcock.

<HEADLINE> Drilling Program In South China Sea, Western Pacific Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Ocean Drilling
Academic Committee today announced a plan up to and after 2004 for
drilling in the South China Sea and the western Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
It combines continental geological studies with deep ocean
studies, according to Academician Wang Pinxian, the
deputy-director.
</P>
<P>
Wang told a national conference on ocean drilling in Beijing
today that seas near the Pacific, specifically the South China Sea
and East China Sea, are the areas most likely to provide
remarkable scientific findings and that China may also gain useful
information ocean exploration there.
</P>
<P>
The South China Sea will be the focus for the 1999-2003 period,
Wang said. China will expand its ocean drilling program to more
areas around the western Pacific after 2004 and will encourage
young scientists to take part.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have suggested that ocean drilling be made
one of the country's major research projects.
</P>
<P>
China joined the International Ocean Drilling Program, with 20
member countries, eight months ago. One of its purposes is to help
prove theories about the movement of the earth's plates.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Business Experts Warn of Euro Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies doing
business in Europe have been told they should already be preparing
for changes in the way the market operates after next year's
launch of the Euro, the planned single currency.
</P>
<P>
The advice came from Chinese economic experts who also warn
that the integration period for the new trans-national currency in
Europe will be lengthy.
</P>
<P>
"Companies should appreciate that they will need to make
adjustments in a number of administrative ways to cope with the
challenges the Euro will bring." said Zhu Min, director of the
Institute of International Finance under the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and a number of other Chinese financial experts were
addressing a special seminar focused on European trade regulations
and reminded Chinese companies that they will need to adjust their
accounting systems once the Euro is introduced.
</P>
<P>
They explained that, as a result of the single currency and
the related linked trade tariffs, it will be easier for Chinese
companies to enter the European market as a whole rather than
trying to tackle all 15 nations independently.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Euro will generally reduce the unstable
exchange rate and the cost of trans-nationals transactions within
the Euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The experts also advised Chinese companies to change their
assets and bonds held in German marks and other European
currencies into the Euro as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
And as the market conditions change, competition will become
fiercer when the new European zone expands to eastern and
southern Europe, they said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu added: "Chinese companies must improve their
competitiveness and if possible set up agents in Europe to tackle
the new dynamic market."
</P>
<P>
During the transition period, the experts also warned that
Chinese companies should be careful in selecting the currency they
trade in.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls on Islamic Countries to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Tuesday called on Islamic countries to make efforts to
solve the Palestinian issue in order to achieve lasting peace in
the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Speaker of Kuwait's National Assembly Ahmed
Abdul Aziz Al-Sadoun here on Tuesday, Khatami stressed that the
greatest problem facing the Islamic countries today is the
Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the Islamic countries should do more for the
Palestinians than what they have done so far, because a large
number of displaced Palestinians live outside the Palestinian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran desires for peace and understanding in the
region, but at the meantime it believes that there can be no
lasting peace until the rights of all Palestinians are secured,
</P>
<P>
"We have never sought war and nor have we ever tolerated
aggression and this is the very nature of the Islamic
nations," he said, "real peace lies in justice and not
aggression."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also criticized the world powers,
particularly the United States, for their support for Israel,
"a cruel regime now ruling over this usurped territory of
Palestine."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti speaker condemned the recent peace
deal between Palestine and Israel, saying that "we have drawn
a cancellation line on all of our expectations regarding the
deal."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official is currently in Tehran for a two-day
session of the coordinating committee of parliaments of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, which concluded on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Development of Electronics Industry in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, one of China's major
electronics and information industrial centers, has made steady
progress in developing this industry this year.
</P>
<P>
The total industrial output value of this sector reached 31.87
billion yuan in the first ten months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has the nation's fifth largest electronics and
information industry. The sector's industrial output value last
year stood at 27.12 billion yuan, accounting for 9.6 percent of
the city's total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Improved investment environment has attracted a number of
large international companies such as Motorola. According to city
government statistics, over 80 percent of the electronics and
information industrial output value is generated by
overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To date, the information technology personnel has constituted
10 percent of the city's employment. Experts say this is where
the further potential of the emerging industry lies in.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Say Great Changes Taking Place in Social Sciences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars say they are
satisfied with the new circumstances in which they have become
students of subjects they are interested in instead of merely
interpreters of political documents.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the reform and opening up over the past 20 years, we
have abandoned the theory of class struggle in academic research,"
said Ru Xin, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
The prestigious academy held a seminar here today to mark the
20th anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at which the Party
introduced the policy of reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Ru described the social sciences as a "disaster area" 20 years
ago, when every academic conclusion had to be made cautiously,
based on the instructions of revolutionary leaders and according
to the doctrine of class struggle.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody dared to think about questions such as what real
socialism should be at that time, when even first-rate scholars
were persecuted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Congwen, of the CASS's Philosophy Institute, said that it
was the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, which
advocated liberating people's minds and seeking truth from facts,
that saved the social sciences.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that now the laws of economics have become the basic
principles for confronting economic problems, something that
sounded like a crime even to mention 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The CASS now has extensive cooperation with overseas
institutes, including the Ford Foundation in the United
States. And foreign research methods, concepts and technology,
including the Internet, are all being employed by the institute,
where 20 years ago, a person who had foreign contacts might be
considered a spy.
</P>
<P>
"Many branches of learning, including politics, sociology and
population science, were abolished during the 'cultural
revolution' (1966-1976). But after the reform and opening up, they
were reinstated at the order of Deng Xiaoping," Ru said.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, president of the CASS, said that Deng Xiaoping has
described science as the first productive force in developing the
country, and an atmosphere of respect for science, knowledge and
expertise has been created. The spring of social sciences has
arrived, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged scholars to sum up the experiences of the past 20
years as a contribution to the nation.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Improve Quality of Fine Wool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- New standards for quality fine
wool are expected to be set soon for producers in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, one of China's leading fine wool production
bases.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 fine wool producers across the region recently
gathered in Urumqi, the regional capital, to discuss over two
sets of norms, known as High Quality Wool and Brand Wool, in a
bid to improve quality.
</P>
<P>
The High Quality Wool is meant for fine wool products which
meet the state's requirements for top grade wool, while the Brand
Wool is meant for even finer products.
</P>
<P>
Located in the northwest of China, the Xinjiang is one of the
country's four major grassland areas and also one of the major
fine wool producers.
</P>
<P>
China's first fine-wool sheep, Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, and
the China Merino Ram are both bred in Xinjiang. The region now
has eight million fine-wool sheep and produces some 30,000 tons
of fine wool a year, accounting for 24 percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
The fine wool in Xinjiang is the best in the country in many
respects, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
While the price of wool in the international market has been
declining, that of superfine wool has kept rising. The Ministry
of Agriculture said that the standardization of Xinjiang's fine
wool production will benefit the country's wool industry.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Uzbekistan to Fare up in Boxing Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Host Thailand will compete
against Uzbekistan for the supremacy in Asia as six out of 12
boxing finals will be decided on Thursday in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan boasts of seven finalists while Thailand books five
final spots, with the two to clash against each other twice in the
60kg final on Thursday and the 57-kg final on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The victory in these two events is crucial for both countries
in the overall medal count.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is also in a position to claim a sizeable share of
honours with four of their boxers in the finals.
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong presence in the finals and if we can win five
medals, it would be fantastic despite our three-gold goal," said
Thai boxing manager Thavatchai Sajakul.
</P>
<P>
Somluck Kamsing has the big hit for the 57-kg title as he
succeeded in the Atlanta Olympics with his brilliant skills and
supreme confidence, but he is troubled by an ankle injury
sustained two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
His opponent in the final is Uzbekistan's Tulkunbav Turgunov,
the world's top ranked 57kg amateur boxer.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also have gold hopes in the 48, 51, 60 and 67kg
events, where all the boxers are ranked in the top two.
</P>
<P>
Another Thai-Uzbek clash will be in the 60kg event where world
number two Pongsit Wiangwesas takes on Temur Suleymanov.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan will be contesting three of the four heavier
division finals and look certain to land gold in the 91kg event
through Ruslan Chagaev, who looks too good for Pakistan's Muzaffar
Mirza.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Mihaylov will be up against a defending champion in
South Korea's Lee Seung-bae in the 81kg final while Dilshod
Yarbekov faces Kazakhstan's Burba Vyacheslav in the 75kg event.
</P>
<P>
Only two finals do not feature a Thai or Uzbek.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Land Resource Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
getting strict with land management and protecting arable land to
stop the loss of arable land.
</P>
<P>
According to Gan Zangchun, of the State Land and Natural
Resources Ministry, the country has a series of measures to
protect farmland, compensate farmers for land, and penalizing
people for violating its rules.
</P>
<P>
Gan says that the measures are meant to increase farmland and
control construction and to keep urban planning from coming in
conflict with the nation's land use plan.
</P>
<P>
He says that China has 130 million hectares of farmland, or a
per capita average of 0.1 hectare. The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization has a minimum of per capita farmland of
0.05 hectare.
</P>
<P>
He says that agricultural restructuring and disasters in the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Bid Adieu to Arranged Marriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Arranged marriage is now
basically extinct, and Chinese farmers are more open to formerly
taboo subjects such as their sex lives, according to a recent
report in the China Women's News.
</P>
<P>
The marriage and family research society in east China's Anhui
Province recently conducted a survey of 400 farming households to
discover their values regarding married life.
</P>
<P>
The society found that arranged marriage has become all but
extinct for young people, though it may survive somewhat among
older people.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the farmers still hold to traditional
family values, with 89 percent of the households saying that
spouses should respect and love each other, and 75 percent
opposed to extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four percent of the couples are against cohabitation
without a marriage certificate, while 91 percent of them said that
household violence should be completely ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are tending to abandon the traditional belief that
marriage should take place only once in life, with 52 percent of
the couples surveyed saying that no affection means no marriage.
</P>
<P>
However, nearly 60 percent of the couples are still against
divorced older people remarrying.
</P>
<P>
Asked what are the main reasons for discontent in married life,
44 percent of the couples cite an inharmonious sexual life as the
reason, an unspeakable pain in the old days.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Arms Inspector Evacuating From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- All U.N. arms inspectors in
Iraq have been ordered to leave Baghdad at 9:30 local time (0630
GMT) Wednesday, said reliable U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
"We are gathering luggages and are ready to withdraw from
Iraq," the sources told Xinhua Wednesday morning on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that all the 120 U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq
have received notice from New York asking them to get ready to
leave Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They will leave for their logistic bases in Bahrain, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Bulter said in his report
to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Iraq had failed to
fully cooperate with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in
either the field of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons program," said Butler in his report.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq, known as
UNSCOM, alleged that Iraq had not handed over all documents
concerning its weapons program and that Iraq blocked arms
inspectors from entering several Iraqi sites.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Tuesday in
Washington that Butler's report was a "very serious matter" and
all options, including air raids, remained open.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has returned home from a
Middle East trip, will review the report with his foreign policy
aides, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
But no decisions has yet been made on what actions the United
States will take to deal with the new development, he said.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, Iraq announced unconditional resumption of
cooperation with U.N. arms inspections it suspended three months
ago, narrowly escaping U.S.-led punishing air strikes in the
latest crisis over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The United States warned that it is poised to act if Iraq fails
to fully cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors again.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Central Bank
and the Department of Finance believed that the launch of the
euro, the single European currency, next year would have no
immediate impact on the country, the newspaper Philippine Star
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central
Bank, as saying that among the first likely effects of the
currency union will only be the need of the bank to convert some
of its international reserves into euros.
</P>
<P>
Some of the country's debts and trade payments would eventually
be settled in euros, he said. "But there is no immediate effect."
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Department of Finance agreed with the bank.
</P>
<P>
But sources of the department said the government should be
ready to deal with euro when it takes effect on January 1, 1999.

BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Yuichiro Kamiyama beat
compatriot Noriaki Mabuchi in straight wins in the men's sprint
final here on Wednesday to become the first professional Japanese
Keirin cyclist who won an Asian Games gold.
</P>
<P>
Kamiyama, 30, said at the Hua Mark velodrome: "I am very happy
with the win. But I would not be unhappy if my friend Mabuchi
wins."
</P>
<P>
Kamiyama, who would surely lose prize money back home by
competing here, said: "I love cycling more than money. I come here
to show the real strength of Japanese cycling."
</P>
<P>
Professional cyclists are allowed to compete in the Asian Games
for the first time following the ban was non-existant after the

Keirin cycling is popular in Japan as people often bet on the
outcome. The sport is physically combative as a field of eight
racers compete together to sprint for the finish line.

BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua)-- China's top legislator Li Peng
has told Papua New Guinea's prime minister Bill Skate that the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) treasures its
relationship with his country.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is ready to continue to strengthen
exchanges in this regard with Papua New Guinea, in a bid to
promote the friendship and cooperation between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made the remarks
today in a meeting with Skate, who is here as guest of his Chinese
counterpart Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the successful visit to China this May by
John Pundari, speaker of the Papua New Guinea national parliament
had served to bring closer the friendly relations between the two
legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
"Exchanges and cooperation of this nature have helped enhance
the overall development of the relations between the two nations,
and we're satisfied with this," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Skate as an old friend of the Chinese people ever
sine he headed a parliamentary delegation in 1993, Li commented
that this latest tour of China as prime minister is a strong
indication that he and his government similarly treasure their
relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
Skate replied that since the two nations first forged
diplomatic ties, their leaders and officials have maintained an
exchange of visits, which have given impetus to the smooth
development of the ongoing ties.
</P>
<P>
"During my current China visit I have seen with my own eyes
the positive changes which spur me on to encourage even further
strong relations between the two parliaments." Skate said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Confine Inflation to Single Digit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
plans to confine inflation to single digit, specifically at below
five percent, according to the bank's Third Monetary Policy
statement available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its statement for the 12 months ending December 1999, the
bank projects that foreign exchange reserves are set to increase
to 870 million U.S. Dollars while foreign exchange liabilities
will increase to 662 million Dollars from 536 million Dollars in
June this year.
</P>
<P>
The low inflation target, said the bank, is supposed to
increase investors' confidence in the country's macro-economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The policy is also aimed to support recovery in economic
activity by five percent growth in output in the fiscal year and
to attract adequate foreign exchange while maintaining a stable
banking sector, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Tight monetary policy in which money supply will be managed to
expand by no more than 10 percent, will ensure stability in the
general level of price so as to create a better monetary
environment.
</P>
<P>
"Government borrowing will be limited to 5.0 percent while
loans and advances extended by the banking system to private,
government and other public sector will be confined to below 9.3
percent," the statement noted, adding: "this is a move in trying
to free more resources for lending to the private sector for
investment."

WELLINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of New Zealand
(BNZ) has agreed to jointly pilot NZ Post's online bill payment
system, becoming the first bank in the country to sign up to NZ
Post's ambitious vision for paperless billing, according to the
latest issue of NZ Infotech Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred BNZ and NZ Post employees will try the system for
three months starting in next March. The system is expected to be
issued publicly in the second half of next year, the weekly
reported.
</P>
<P>
The online billing service, developed by NZ Post around
technology supplied by United States-based Checkfree Corporation,
is designed to replace monthly paper-based bills with electronic
versions.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will go through a one-off registration process with
NZ Post, which will then arrange for their bills to be stored in
what amounts to an electronic mail box hosted on NZ Post's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
People will be able to look at and pay their bills at either NZ
Post's own Web site, BNZ's Web site, or at the Web sites of the
billing companies themselves.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will gain entry to their mail box using a password
and pin number and the system will be protected by 128-bit
encryption.
</P>
<P>
BNZ customers will be able to pay bills online by direct debit
once they give the bank authorization to set up this arrangement.

ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Aid agencies here and in
Geneva Wednesday appealed on donors for 115 million U.S. dollars
to support their 1999 assistance activities to save lives, ensure
human rights and build sustainable livelihood in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The appeal launched by the United Nations Wednesday reflects a
new unified approach to aid activities in Afghanistan, forged by
the U.N. in 1998 and endorsed last week by a donors meeting in
Tokyo, said a press release from the Office of the U.N.
Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Wednesday requested funding for the top priority
activities out of a total portfolio of projects worth 185 million
dollars, 28 million dollars more than aid agencies sought for
1998, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The activities include demining, preventative health care,
community-based development programs and emergency food aid, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the U.N. and other international agencies
and NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in Afghanistan have
saved millions of lives threatened by poverty, war and natural
disasters by supplying food, medical assistance and shelter.
</P>
<P>
Aid groups this year helped Afghans to rebuild Kabul's
sanitation system and to reconstruct and rehabilitate hospitals,
schools, agricultural systems and roads around the country, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.N. mine action program in Afghanistan, the
largest in the world, is clearing land and providing housing for
rehabilitation and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the release said that international agencies have
also worked to ensure the protection of human rights and gender
equality as Afghans knit their societies together again.
</P>
<P>
Aid programs have continued in Afghanistan although most
international workers have been out of the country since U.S.
missiles hit terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden's headquarters in
Afghanistan in August, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were ongoing with the Afghan Taliban militia on
creating secure environment for the return of all aid staff and
full-scale assistance, it said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Mega-Droughts May Return to U.S. High Plains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists warned
Tuesday mega-droughts over decades, or centuries, could again
wreck U.S. Great Plains agricultural "bread basket" next century.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, quality water from the High Plains Ogallala Aquifer
supplying 30 percent of the ground water used for U.S. irrigation
will be drained, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Paleoclimatic studies of tree rings and archaeological remains
suggest the U.S. heartland has seen numerous severe droughts over
the last 2,000 years, according to a study released Tuesday by the
U.S. Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA).
</P>
<P>
"Paleoclimatic records of the past 400 years strongly indicate
that the severe droughts of the 20th century, including the 1930s
Dust Bowl and the 1950s drought, were not unusual events," said
Connie Woodhouse who works at NOAA's National Geophysical Data
Center in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Woodhouse said new evidence suggest that "we can expect to have
droughts of this magnitude once or twice a century."
</P>
<P>
NOAA scientists want U.S. state planners to take into account a
possible upswing in unpredicted droughts and to better conserve
well water for irrigation while diversifying farm economies.

BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- All U.N. arms inspectors in
Iraq have been ordered to leave Baghdad at 9:30 local time (0630
GMT) Wedensday, said reliable U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
"We are gathering luggages and are ready to withdraw from
Iraq," the sources told Xinhua Wednesday morning on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that all the 120 U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq
have received notice from New York asking them to get ready to
leave Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They will leave for their logistic bases in Bahrain, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Bulter said in his report
to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Iraq had failed to
fully cooperate with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Tuesday in
Washington that Butler's report was a "very serious matter" and
all options, including air raids, remained open.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has returned home from a
Middle East trip, will review the report with his foreign policy
aides, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
But no decisions has yet been made on what actions the United
States will take to deal with the new development, he said.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cyclist Wang Yan
battled against a mysterious fatal disease and her rival to win
the Asian Games women's sprint here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 26, defeated compatriot Jiang Cuihua 2-0 in the final,
clocking 14.463 and 13.450 seconds in her two rides.
</P>
<P>
"It was really painful to train just after having a surgery,"
said Wang, who four months ago had her thymus removed to treat
disease which caused her muscle weaker and weaker.
</P>
<P>
"The doctor said I would be dying slowly if untreated. But the
question is that they said for this disease there was almost no
cure," added Wang, who was from northeastern Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The disease begins to take its toll when the patient is unable
to even lift her eyelids. If untreated, the symptom progresses
throughout the whole body until all muscles become listless and
fail to function.
</P>
<P>
"Before the surgery I felt tired every day and now feel much
better. I still want to ride, and if possible, win a medal at the
Olympics," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the deciding rides for the bronze medal, Chinese Taipei's
Fang Fen Fang edged teammate Lu Yi Wen 2-1.

two-day summit here Wednesday after adopting a number of measures
to revive the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
of Vietnam, the host of the summit, said that at the summit, "we
have demonstrated the determination to strengthen unity on the
basis of traditional 'unity in diversity', and turn it into a
driving force to elevate ASEAN's cooperation to a higher plane."
</P>
<P>

community spirit based on the inherent identity and values of each
member and the whole region as well as the basic principles and
ways which have helped to develop ASEAN through the years."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the leaders from the nine member countries "have
unanimously agreed to speed up reforms, especially those of
banking and financial institutions, deepen our integration, with a
view to creating a dynamic, attractive and competitive ASEAN
economic area, fully capable of responding to changes in the
global economy."
</P>
<P>
Khai also pledged that the ASEAN "will continue its
outward-looking policy and wish to strengthen cooperative
relationship with its dialogue partners and other countries,
regional organizations and fora, participate actively in and make
worthy contributions to the cause of peace and prosperity of
Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world."
</P>

the interests of strengthened peace, enhanced cooperation and the
fulfillment of the vision of ASEAN-10, we have agreed to admit the
Kingdom of Cambodia into the association at an early special

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Olympic track star
Dennis Mitchell did not take drugs, the USA Track and Field
Doping Hearing Board announced Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, a member of the gold winning 400-meter relay team
and bronze medalist in the 100 meters in the 1992 Olympics, had
been suspended by the International Amateur Athletics Federation
(IAAF) in July after the IAAF tested his urine sample positive.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that high levels of testosterone and
epitestosterone were found in the test.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has been the chairman of the Athletes Advisory
Committee of USA Track and Field for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Under its rules, the IAAF may review the decision of the
Doping Hearing Board panel.
</P>
<P>
"I have done nothing wrong, but I am not being permitted to
compete," Mitchell said in August. "I will now proceed through
the hearing process. I can only hope that justice will prevail
and I will be rightfully exonerated."
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old sprinter was suspended for two years by the
IAAF.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's lawyer Suja Thomas said Mitchell's appeal would
question the validity of the test in two grounds.
</P>
<P>
"Experts will look at whether or not the test itself was
correct. And two, if the test was correct, what could have caused
the testosteone to epitestosterone level to increase."

<HEADLINE> Banana Returns Home to Face Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's convicted former
president Canaan Banana who has been on the run for three weeks
has returned home through Beitbridge border post in south
Zimbabwe to face justice.
</P>
<P>
His return is suspected to be linked to political intervention
at the highest level, the Daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The clergyman and former lecturer of the University of
Zimbabwe skipped bail at the end of last month, days ahead of the
finalization of his case at the high court.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Harare by road on Tuesday night, marking the end
of a manhunt mounted after he illegally crossed into Botswana and
later South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by a team of detectives who escorted him to
the capital from Beitbridge in a white Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
Banana was whisked away at about 9:30 p.m. in another green
Mercedes-Benz to an undisclosed place from criminal investigation
department headquarters at Morris depot, where he briefly stopped
and is believed to have given interviews to senior police
officers.
</P>
<P>
How Banana left the country is still a mystery as his passport
was still with the High Court. After failing to appear in court
twice, which led to the postponement of his sentence till January
18, nest year.
</P>
<P>
A warrant of arrest had been issued for his arrest when he
failed to turn up for judgment on November 26. He was convicted
in absentia on 11 counts of sexual assault crimes perpetrated on
male state house employees and other ordinary citizens during and
after his term of office as president.
</P>
<P>
He was reported to have passed through Botswana and later
turned up in South Africa where he met President Nelson Mandela.
Mandela discussed the matter with Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe at the weekend when he was in the capital for the World
Council of Churches Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Indian Expert Panel for Curbs on Govt Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- An Indian expert panel on
trade and industry in its report submitted to Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee recently suggested strict control on the
government expenditure and borrowing from financial institutions,
a government official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to cap government finance assumes
significance in the wake of predictions by economists that
interest rates would jump in the markets, making borrowing
expensive if the government had a heavy borrowing program.
</P>
<P>
As it is estimated in the budget, the government borrowing
would be pegged at 790 billion rupees (18.97 billion us dollars)
for 1998-99 fiscal (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999), but reports
indicate that the targets have already been exceeded.
</P>
<P>
The expert panel in its report has advised that high repayments
pressures should be avoided by borrowing long term and swapping
securities issued to pension and provident funds with deep
discount bonds.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested the government to sell real assets and
aggressively disinvest its equity in public sector undertakings
even at discounts to market prices and use the proceeds to retire
debt and reduce the interest bill.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Survey: Retirement Benefits More Important Than Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Two age groups of
Americans agree that salary isn't everything when it comes to a
good compensation package from a prospective employer, according
to a national survey released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in November by the Los Angeles-based
research firm CommSciences, found that 60 percent of respondents
would take a job with a lower salary and excellent retirement
benefits before they would choose a position with a higher salary
but poor retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
A total of 500 employees of small-to medium-sized companies
took part in the telephone poll. All respondents worked for a
company with less than 1,500 employees and belonged to one of two
age groups: the so-called Baby Boomers aged between 34 and 52, and
Generation Xers between 25 and 33 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of both age groups considered retirement
benefits more important than salary, the younger group placed
slightly less emphasis on benefits (64 percent versus 53 percent).
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that financial security at retirement is
the top reason to participate in a retirement program. However,
nearly 30 percent of the Generation Xers said the ability to
borrow against the retirement plan to purchase a home or pay for a
child's education was their main motivation for participation.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two percent of those polled planned to retire before the
age of 65 if they felt financially secure enough to do so. But
generational differences arose when individuals are asked how much
money they would need at retirement age to feel secure.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of Baby Boomers said between 250,000 U.S.
dollars to one million dollars was their target, while only 60
percent of Generation Xers fell into that same monetary range.
Twenty-four percent of the younger generation wanted between one
million and two million dollars to feel secure, while only 17
percent of their older counterparts felt they needed to be
millionaires at retirement.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the poll results, CommSciences said it appeared that
many Generation Xers were not satisfied with their retirement
plans. The poll indicated that although the majority of both
groups participated in retirement programs offered at work, only
one third of the younger group thought their programs were
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The research firm said, this statistic should be a cause for
concern for smaller companies who will find the younger workforce
is more apt to move on to prospective employers who offer a
program that more closely meets their needs.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Report on Iraq Said to be Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. chief weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, reported Tuesday that Iraq has failed
to fully cooperate with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.N. diplomats said the report, expected to be released on
Wednesday, had been submitted by Butler to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats described the report as drawing negative
conclusions about Iraq's cooperation with UNSCOM, the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced the limitation of its cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors on August 5 and halted the cooperation on October 31.
The U.N. arms inspectors returned to Iraq on November 14, when
Iraq decided to resume its full and unconditional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has complained that Iraq had prevented it from carrying
out its work on several occasions and, in the most serious case,
had blocked the inspectors from entering the ruling Baath party
offices on December 10.
</P>
<P>
Butler's report is to determine whether the United Nations
Security Council should conduct a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions with a view to possibly
easing sanctions.

NEW DELHI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
asked the country's leading financial institutions and banks to
buy shares worth 50 billion rupees (1.20 billion U.S. dollars) in
four public sector units (PSUs) to help reduce the nation's fiscal
deficit, official sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The four units include Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL),
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), National Aluminium
Company (Nalco) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. (MTNL). With
stock markets in a slump, the government has no option but to ask
the financial intermediaries to pick up PSUs shares, the Finance

</P>
<P>
"The financial institutions and banks are required to provide a
detailed report on how much they would pick up from each of the
four companies and at what price," the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
The shares of each of the four companies will be subscribed by
the financial institutions and banks at a discount on the market
price. Subsequently, these shares will be off-loaded in the market
at a market-related price. The gains that each institution makes
in the process will be shared with government on a 50:50 basis.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Protests Against Tirana for Backing Kosovo Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia protested against
Albania on Tuesday over fresh conflicts along the border, accusing
Tirana of directly supporting ethnic Albanian separatists in
terrorist operations, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement said more than 100 armed ethnic
Albanians in uniforms of the banned Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
Monday attempted to cross the border from Albania into Kosovo,
which the KLA wants to be independent from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav troops killed 30 of the guerrillas and injured 12.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Charge d'Affaires Florian Novi was summoned to the
Foreign Ministry in Belgrade, where he was given "a strongly
worded protest in connection with series of border incidents
between December 5 and 14", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry claimed that 16 incidents had been recorded along
the Yugoslav-Albanian border since October 16 when Belgrade signed
an agreement with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) on international verification of the ceasefire in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The incidents "represent direct support for terrorists and
separatists, whose aim is to create tension and jeopardize the
peaceful resolution of the Kosovo problem", the ministry said in
its protest note.
</P>
<P>
"They also confirm once again that Albania has become a haven
for terrorists and a base for their arming and infiltration" into
Yugoslavia, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry held Albania fully responsible for the border
incidents, which, it said, were a serious threat to Yugoslavia's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Expects Debt Service Ratio Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
expects the ratio of serviced foreign debt to exports to reach an
alarming level of 49.3 percent in the current fiscal year that
ends in March, Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto said.
</P>
<P>
"Our debt service ratio in the 1998/99 fiscal year is estimated
at 49.3 percent," he said on Tuesday in a written reply to a
question posed by legislator Thomas Suyatno.
</P>
<P>
The figure was based on forecasts of the principal and interest
payment of the sovereign and private debt amounting to 27.19
billion U.S. dollars this year and the total predicted export
earnings of 55.16 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This estimate was higher than the government's earlier
projection, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In September, Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance
and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said the government saw the
debt service ratio for the current fiscal year at 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Before the economic crisis, which has seen the rupiah sinking
by more than 60 percent in value against the U.S. dollar since
July 1997, the country's debt service ratio stood below 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the government should boost exports to bring down
the debt service ratio.
</P>
<P>
Increasing exports is one of the only two approaches the
government could take in response to the alarming debt level. The
other is delaying the debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing with the House of Representatives' Commission VIII
for finance and the state budget on Monday, director general of
budget affairs at the Ministry of Finance Darsjah said the
government would not write off its sovereign loans in order to
maintain healthy relations with the country's foreign debtors.
</P>
<P>
This means boosting exports is the only way to reduce the debt
service ratio.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has not benefited from higher export revenues this
year because of trade financing troubles, despite the rupiah's
significant plunge which normally would make exports more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented firms, especially those highly reliant on
imported materials, have been facing difficulties in securing
letters of credit to import raw materials because of the low
confidence in the local banks.
</P>
<P>
The government has pledged to help export-oriented firms by
establishing an Export Financing Institution to handle all issues
regarding trade financing.

<HEADLINE> Armed Group's Remnants Surrender in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 50 members of an
anti-government drug trafficking armed group laid down their arms
to surrender to the government last week, official newspaper The
New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The armed group members, who are remnants of the Mong Tai Army
(MTA) drug trafficking armed group operating on the Myanmar-Thai
border, "exchanged arms for peace" with the government at the
regional battalion in Konhein Township, Shan State in the eastern
part of the country, on December 13.
</P>
<P>
Similar armed groups are still in the jungle planning to
exchange arms for peace, the report added.
</P>
<P>
In October, 106 members of the remnants of the MTA surrendered
to the government.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1996, former notorious drug warlord Khun Sa and
his MTA have unconditionally surrendered to the Myanmar government
in succession, bringing the number of the surrendered to 15,000 by
May this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 44 members of anti-government armed groups, most of
them are ethnic, also turned in to the government during last four
months.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a total of 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as
well as the MTA drug trafficking armed group in the country have
made peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
The government said it still permits the turned-in armed groups
to retain their arms for "self-protection and area-defense."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Hosts National AIDS Program Managers' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A three-day meeting of National
AIDS Program Managers for Southeast Asia Region is being held here
to seek ways to tackle the problem of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The 13th meeting of its kind, which began Tuesday, is jointly
sponsored by the Myanmar Health Ministry and the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the meeting, Myanmar Deputy Health Minister Dr.
Mya Oo warned that HIV/AIDS has become a national concern in
Myanmar, pledging that the government is committed to do its
utmost to fight against the dreadful epidemic within the country.
</P>
<P>
In tackling the HIV/AIDS problem, the Myanmar government first
formed the AIDS Technical Committee and conducted surveillance
activities in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Myanmar formed another National AIDS Committee and
implemented a short term anti-AIDS plan in the year, followed by
the first medium term plan from 1990 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities
are being carried out within the context of the National Health
Plan since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are delegates from Southeast Asian
nations including host Myanmar, officials of United Nations
agencies and regional office of the WHO, non-governmental social
organizations from local and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting of the National AIDS Program Managers for
Southeast Asia region was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh in November
1996.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Residents Work in Day, See Doctor at Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Residents in south China's
booming city of Guangzhou have become more hardworking these days,
with more ailing workers choosing to remain on the job during the
day and see the doctor after dusk, the China Business News
reported recently.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital show
that the number of people seeking medical care rose to between
200-300 a day since last summer, and most of them came between 6
pm and 1 am, compared with fewer than 70 a day during
these hours last year.
</P>
<P>
On Sundays, the hospital's emergency treatment department is
packed with patients almost around the clock, with anywhere
between 300 and 400 people waiting to see the doctor.
</P>
<P>
Many patients say they are too busy during the day, and that
asking for sick leave means a reduction of their bonus and other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate this new pattern, many hospitals have extended
their out-patient hours to 9 pm, and their emergency hours to
round-the-clock service.
</P>
<P>
Now, some hospitals also have expert-level doctors, whose
services require higher charges, at their out-patient clinics.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Expects World Economic Growth to Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, December 15 (Xinhua)-- Merrill Lynch research
analysts are expecting slow growth in the world's economies, lower
interest rates and a strong U.S. dollar in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Global economics are forecast to slow to about 1.25 percent,
while lower interest rates are expected to prevent a global
recession, the financial services company said in a briefing
published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Widespread excess capacity suggests deflation is a bigger risk
than inflation in 1999, said the company, adding that the
U.S. dollar should remain the world's strongest currency.
</P>
<P>
The briefing quoted the company's chief economist Bruce
Steinberg as saying that world GDP grew about 3.5 percent in 1997,
slowed to around 1.75 percent in 1998, and will slow further to
1.25 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg expects U.S. GDP growth to slow to two percent in
1999, down from 3.7 percent in 1998, and Fed funds rates could be
down to four percent by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Another economist, Michael Hartnett, noted that in 1998 global
demand weakened while supply increased, thus intensifying
deflationary pressures. Deflation is still a bigger risk than
inflation in 1999. He said global pricing pressure should remain
intense.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch's economists highlight two key events in 1999
that will provide an unusual backdrop to industries worldwide: the
launch of the single European currency, the euro, and the European
Monetary Union in January; and the countdown to Y2K, a software
glitch expected to disturb most computers of the world around year
2000.
</P>
<P>
They say that emerging markets may have passed maximum stress
points but recovery will likely be slow.
</P>
<P>
As for the future beyond 1999, Steinberg, who looks at 1999 as
a year of transition, said that if restructuring goes far enough
in the United States and elsewhere, the world economy will be able
to grow faster in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Hartnett cited two conditions that would be required to
stimulate "strong" output and price recovery in 2000: First, if
European Union demands strengthen more than expected. And if
substantive Japanese and Asian restructuring becalms deflation in
the Far East.
</P>
<P>
He doubted that both conditions could be met. Therefore, he
said, "soft landing" is the best the world can hope for in 1999 to
2000, with lower-than-expected inflation leading to
lower-than-expected interest rates next year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition Lacks Support to Oust Govt Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai opposition has suffered
another setback after an opinion poll showed little public support
for its bid to impeach two key government leaders.
</P>
<P>
The poll available on Wednesday showed 72.4 percent of 1,254
respondents disapproved of the opposition's impeachment move
against Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has already failed in its attempt to woo senate
support for a motion accusing the two government leaders of
constitutional violations for having issued letters of intent to
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) without prior parliament
approval.
</P>
<P>
Only 10.7 percent of the respondents backed the opposition's
move, while the remaining 16.9 percent refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight percent also said they did not like the
opposition's political attitudes and stand-points.
</P>
<P>
This group viewed the opposition as focusing only on political
games aimed at discrediting the government, failing to help the
government fight the economic crisis, trying to destabilize the
government and worsening the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 32 percent rated the opposition's
performances as "satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
What the respondents wanted the opposition to do most was to
inspect government work in a more credible and respectable manner,
support government attempts to revive the economy, protect
national interests and give the government more time to work.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents, 84.7 percent, disagreed with dissolving the
House of Representatives to allow a general election while 15.3
percent favored this option.
</P>
<P>
Most also wanted the prime minister to restore the economy,
tackle corruption, keep on working to the best of his ability,
keep a close watch on ministers whose images were tarnished, and
solve social problems.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted recently in Bangkok and the provinces in
the country.

during several inspections.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia, UN Force Say No Yugoslav Troops in Border Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian authorities and the
U.N. Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDF) in Macedonia confirmed
in Skopje Tuesday they had no evidence of a Yugoslav troop
build-up in border areas.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Deputy Defense Minister Petar Atanasov said the
situation was calm in the border areas between Macedonia and
Yugoslavia, adding that he could not confirm Kosovo Albanians'
allegations that Yugoslav soldiers were deploying along the border.
</P>
<P>
Mark Mekevoi, senior officer of the UNPREDF, also said the
U.N. force did not see any troop movement on the Yugoslav side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the mountainous landscape, "we could not
confirm those allegations".
</P>
<P>
As a U.N. force in Macedonia, its task was restricted to
matters occurring in Macedonian territory, and not with things on
the other side of the border.
</P>
<P>
NATO last month decided to send a 1,700-strong rapid reaction
force to Macedonia to guarantee the safety of the international
observers stationed in Kosovo under the auspices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are several hundred NATO troops and some
helicopters and armored vehicles in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities opposed NATO troop to enter Kosovo,
claiming it was an act of aggression against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Chinese Consumer Income Expection Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers are lowering
their expectations for the future growth of family income amid a
slowing economy, says a recent national survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Forecast Department of the State
Information Center, the just-completed survey indicates that the
consumer income expectation index for the latter half of 1998
dropped by 6.8 percentage points to 77.3 percent from the previous
84.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the workers surveyed, 51.7 percent expect a fall in family
income, as compared with the 48.4 percent among enterprise
managers, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
Income expectation is influenced by both long- and short-term
income fluctuations, experts of the center say. The slowing
economic growth, continuing slippage in enterprise efficiency, and
falling farm produce prices are all attributable to falling
demand, they point out.
</P>
<P>
Lowered income expectations constitute a major reason for the
present sluggish consumer market in China, and macroeconomic
control departments should be on the alert, since the country's
economic growth now depends to a great extent on the expansion of
the domestic demand, the experts observe.
</P>
<P>
Consumer income expectation has been falling since 1996, the
survey shows.

<HEADLINE> Large Theme Park Closes, No Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The largest theme park
featuring characters from the Chinese classic "Journey to the
West" has been closed down after being unable to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
The park, located in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province,
is one of the dozens built across China based on the book by
the great novelist Wu Cheng'en of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Built in 1996 at a cost of 25 million yuan (3 million U.S.
dollars), the park covered 14,000 square meters and was once a hot
touristic attraction. But by the end, only about a dozen people a
day were coming to the park, though the entrance fee had been
reduced from 20 to 7 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Because of the vast amount of new construction and a lack of
market surveys, many of the "Journey to the West" theme parks have
closed down, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The novel, known in every household in China, is about gods and
devils, and is based on the historic travels to India in the 7th
century by the Buddhist monk-pilgrim Xuan Zang who went in search
of Buddhist scriptures. The other main characters, know throughout
China, are Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy.

<P>
CHENGDU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chengdu, capital of Sichuan
Province in southwest China, started construction of two new
expressways recently as part of its efforts to form a
comprehensive expressway network in early next century.
</P>
<P>
One project, the 42.04-kilometer-long west section of the
city's ring-road expressway, starts at the Chengdu airport
expressway and ends at the starting point of the east section of
the ring road expressway.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the 2.02-billion-yuan (243.3 million U.S.
dollars) west section in 2001 will extend the road to 85
kilometers in length, the longest ring-road expressway now under
construction in China.
</P>
<P>
Construction is also underway on the 39.08-kilometer-long
Chengdu-Guanxian expressway linking Chengdu with the city of
Dujiangyan (previously called Guanxian County).
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for completion on June 30, 2000, the expressway will
be part of the National Road No. 213 linking Sichuan with Qinghai
and Gansu provinces in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
These two new links, plus five others, will form a radiating
expressway network early next century, with Chengdu at the
center.

WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade
Minister Shi Guangsheng arrived here Tuesday to co-chair the 12th
session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade
(JCCT) with U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>

The JCCT session, to be convened on Thursday and Friday, is the

visits by the U.S. and Chinese presidents, said Shi upon his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
"It is an event of great significance to Sino-U.S. economic and

implementing the results of the presidential summits," said Shi.
</P>
<P>
"I hope through this meeting, both countries will be able to
increase understanding and expand consensus based on the principle
of equality and mutual benefit," he added.

relations in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. trade reached 43.52 billion U.S. dollars in the first
10 months of 1998, an increase of 10.3 percent over the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Help Liaoning with Afforestation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany will provide 12
million deustche marks in free aid to help the city of Chaoyang in
northeast China's Liaoning Province develop an afforestation
program over the next five years to curb the expansion of the
desert.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have completed their examination of the sandy region
near Chaoyang and have worked out a plan for project by which an
area of 30,000 hectares will be afforested by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and German governments signed an agreement on this
project earlier this year, and the German government has listed
the program among its free aid programs for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dacao, mayor of Chaoyang, said that foreign aid for
environmental protection will help enrich presently
poverty-stricken areas for the benefit of future generations.
</P>
<P>
The local government will provide 33 million yuan (about four
million U.S. dollars) in supporting funds for this project.
</P>
<P>
Chaoyang carried out afforestation programs in 35 towns with
the help from the United Nations Food Program between 1986 and
1990. The results of these programs were praised by the UN as the
most successful of all such projects.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian GDP to Reach 3.8 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Panama will end this year
with a 3.8 percent growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), below
the projected 5 percent rate but above Latin America's average of
2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian economy grew 3.7 percent during the third
trimester of this year compared with the same period last year,
Planning and Economy Minister Guillermo Chapman told the press on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's ports registered a 78.2 percent rise, while
exports went up 19.1 percent, canal revenues increased 9 percent
and banking services went up 11.3 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chapman attributed the failure to reach the 5 percent target
this year to a strike by banana workers, weather changes and
world financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment remained at 13.4 percent, Chapman said, but added
that over 29,000 jobs had been created this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the cost of staple foodstuffs had increased by 0.8
percent in September, especially vegetables and beef.
</P>
<P>
Latin American economists believe Panama is less affected by
the Asian economic crisis. Brazil remains the top trade partner
with Asia, but only slightly ahead of Panama.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that fact is caused not by a booming Panamanian
market for Asian goods or Panamanian exports to Asia, but rather
the trade of goods at the Colon Free Zone on Panama's Atlantic
coast.
</P>
<P>
The zone is the world's second-largest free zone after Hong
Kong and trades billions of dollars each year in imports from Asia
and re-exports throughout Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Production Line for Radial Truck Tires in Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 16 (Xinhua) --Installation of a radial truck
tire production line based in Chaoyang in northeast China's
Liaoning Province was completed recently, and the line will begin
operations early next year.
</P>
<P>
By then, the Liaoning Tires Group Co., Ltd. will become the
third firm producing tubeless tires in China, after the Shanghai
Tires Co., Ltd. and Qingdao No.2 Rubber Factory in east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Costing 430 million yuan, this new line, equipped with
technology imported from Britain, began installlation in late
1996. Its main components were imported from Britain, Germany,
Japan and the Netherlands. The new facility will have an annual
production capacity of 200,000 sets of radial truck tires,
including 70,000 tubeless tires, all of which will be exported.
</P>
<P>
With the construction of more radial truck tire projects, it is
expected that by the turn of the century, China's annual
production capacity for radial truck tires will reach 8.7 million
sets.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Central Bank Cuts Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish Central Bank on
Tuesday cut its key re-purchase rate by 0.2 percentage points to
3.40 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth re-purchase cut made by the Central Riksbank
within the past six months. The bank had just cut its re-purchase
rate from 3.85 percent to 3.6 percent on November 24.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is a member of the European Union (EU) but will not
join the EU in a switch to the euro single currency on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Though the Riksbank has cut rates several times, Sweden's
repurchase rate remains above that of other EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The Riksbank's last rate cut, which came less than two weeks
after a joint cut on December 3 by the 11 countries in the
euro-zone, is viewed as a further mark for the country to ease its
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The new cut has narrowed the difference in rates between Sweden
and the key countries among the 11 euro-founders to no more than
0.40 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
President of the Riksbank Urban Baeckstroem said the bank will
keep its current re-purchase rate for a period of time since there
is no room for further rate cuts.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM to Advance International Security Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Loyd
Axworthy will travel to New York on Friday to undertake a number
of activities aimed at advancing Canada's international security
agenda.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to talk with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
on a range of global and human security issues and meet with
U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler to discuss the current
situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy will also make Canada a State Party to the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) by depositing
Canada's instrument of ratification with the Secretary-General,
and will sign, on behalf of Canada, the statute for the
International Criminal Court (ICC).
</P>
<P>
He will meet with the permanent representatives to the United
Nations of various countries to discuss the emphasis that Canada
will place on human security issues during its upcoming term on
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Canada was among the first countries to sign the CTBT when it
opened for signature in September 1996. The deposit of Canada's
instrument of ratification was made possible by parliament's
passage of implementing legislation this fall, and will place
Canada among the first countries to ratify. Canada is playing a
key role in organizing a Conference of States for the autumn of
1999 to explore ways of facilitating the Treaty's early entry into
force.
</P>
<P>
"The CTBT is an important part of Canada's efforts over the
past years to construct an effective international nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament regime," Axworthy said in a
release issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"By ratifying, Canada will help to enhance the strength of this
regime. I urge all states that have not signed the Treaty to do so
immediately and without conditions."
</P>
<P>
On the ICC, Axworthy said, "By helping to uphold the rule of
law, this Court will serve in the long run to promote
international stability."
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice is examining Canadian legislation and
facilitating any necessary amendments to ensure that Canada is in
compliance with its obligations under the ICC Statute, so that
Canada may ratify the Statute as soon as possible, said the
release.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Gateways to Macao Goes Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Construction of three major
infrastructure projects connecting Macao with neighboring Zhuhai,
a booming special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
Province, is going well.
</P>
<P>
These projects include the port of Gongbei, the Lianhua (Lotus)
Bridge linking Zhuhai and Macao, and the Guangzhou-Zhuhai section
of the Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway, said Zhou Benhui, vice-mayor of
Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
The Gongbei port of entry, which will cost 300 million yuan,
requires the construction of a building for joint customs
procedures, a public square and an underground parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Workers have now completed construction of the building, with a
floor space of 80,000 square meters, and are working on the
interior decorations. This building will be put into service next
May.
</P>
<P>
The Lianhua Bridge was begun in late June with approval of the
State Council and will cost about 200 million yuan, to be borne
equally by the city government of Zhuhai and the Portuguese
government in Macao. It will be finished and opened to traffic
before Macao is returned to China on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Guangzhou-Zhuhai section of the
Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway has been going on smoothly. Tang
Bingquan, deputy governor of Guangdong Province, pledged that
Guangdong and Zhuhai will go all out to finish the expressway and
make sure it is an example of fine craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, construction of the Guangzhou-Zhuhai
railway line has begun. The Portuguese government in Macao has
asked to have the line extended to Macao, an idea which has won
support from the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study on extending the railway line to Macao has
just been finished and the Chinese and Portuguese governments will
hold further negotiations on construction details.

COLOMBO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, due to visit India later this month, will seek a
reassurance from India that it will not interfere in the internal
affairs of the island, newspapers here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News said Sri Lanka wants to know whether
there has been a recent shift in the Indian policy of
non-interference that previous Indian governments have been
pursuing for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
The private newspaper The Island reported there are increasing
evidences showing the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
stepped up its activity in India and there are also clear signs of
support extended by some parties within the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
During her three-day visit, President Kumaratunga will discuss
matters relating to the LTTE with Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee, Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh and Home Minister
Lal Krishna Advani, said the reports.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Pledges to Strengthen Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Venezuelan
President-elect Hugo Chavez said Tuesday that his country would
encourage a greater development of friendship and cooperation with
China during his term.
</P>
<P>
During a news conference in the Venezuelan embassy here, Chavez
told Xinhua that Venezuela wants to further boost its cooperation
with China in the agriculture, housing, science and technology
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, China is Asia's development epicenter," said Chavez,
who is on his first official visit to Brazil since his election
last week.
</P>
<P>
He said he had made some very good contacts with Chinese
diplomats in Caracas, which could serve to help develop stronger
ties with the country.
</P>
<P>
Chavez also said he and Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso discussed Venezuela's integration with the Mercosur group.
</P>
<P>
One of his priorities is the integration of all Latin America
and the Caribbean into the group, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that his transition project over the next 120 days
would follow five basic guidelines: macropolitical, macrosocial,
and macroeconomic, adding that he would also launch a new project
for the redistribution of wealth and convene a new congress on
February 15.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that democracy included sovereignty, dignity,
equality, justice and social development among others.
</P>
<P>
He said that currently, 80 percent of Venezuelans are mired in
poverty with a jobless rate of nearly 20 percent, while 1.2
million new homes were needed.
</P>
<P>
He said that good education and health were the most
fundamental of all human rights.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's first foreign trip will also take him to Argentina and
Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Likely to Become WTO New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi has emerged as the front-runner to become
the next director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
A preliminary count of support issued by two ambassadors
conducting consultations among the WTO's 132 members put New
Zealand's former prime minister Michael Moore in second place and
Morocco's ex-trade minister Hassan Abouyoub third, Wednesday's
Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The two ambassadors -- William Rssier of Switzerland and Celso
Lafer of Brazil-- have delivered their report to the WTO's ruling
General Council.
</P>
<P>
Canada's former trade minister and current high commissioner in
London Roy MacLaren was in the fourth place.
</P>
<P>
The two ambassadors said that taking into account second, third
and fourth choice preferences, geographical distribution of
expressed backing, and first choice preference, Supachai, 52, had
"the greatest density of support."
</P>
<P>
But trade officials and diplomats warned against assuming the
contest was all but over.
</P>
<P>
They said the situation could change in the next few days as
the 15-member European Union and the United States haven't made
their views known.
</P>
<P>
So far the two trade powers have declined to express their
preferences to the two ambassadors who are trying to establish
whether a consensus can be built around one of the four
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The winner will take over from outgoing Director-General Renato
Ruggiero of Italy next May and will take the task of leading the
WTO into what is expected to be a new set of global trade
negotiations from the start of the next century.

<HEADLINE> IDB to Fund Roads for Peruvian Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The InterAmerican Development
Bank (IDB) will fund the building of three highways to support a
crop substitution program for Peruvian coca farmers.
</P>
<P>
The bank will channel 143 million U.S. dollars into the project
which will be carried out in three Peruvian jungle zones
considered as key producers of coca, the base for the drug,
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The roads will enable thousands of farmers to take their new
crops to coastal markets and eventually export them, starting in
2000.
</P>
<P>
The crop substitution program aims to "significantly reduce"
the number of hectares sown with coca saplings.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and 1997, Peruvian authorities managed to reduce
an area of 150,000 hectares sown with coca to some 65,000
hectares. They used incentives and punitive measures.
</P>
<P>
Punishment seems to have worked best, with a ban on Colombian
drug rings' air routes used to smuggle Peruvian cocaine and harsh
jail sentences for traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Propose to Rewrite History of Ancient China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese historians now believe
that China's high level of civilization may well be twice as
old as previously thought, taking it back some 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
A group of scholars from China's mainland provinces and Taiwan
Province have now called for the history books to be rewritten and
have won the support of at least 100 colleagues worldwide.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi Shi, chairman of the Research Society on the
History of the Chinese Nation, who with a Taiwan colleague has
co-drafted the proposal to adopt the latest findings, the
traditionally-held theories on China's origins need to be revised.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he points out that in 1991, archeologist Su Bingqi
proposed extending the known history of the Chinese nation to at
least 10,000 years. Since that initiative researchers in China and
from many other countries have responded positively to his
views, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
In the draft proposal Shi said that the origins of the
"5,000-year-old Chinese history" theory were based on the "Shi Ji
(Historic Records)", the first chronicle on the Chinese history by
Sima Qian, an imperial historian of the Western Han Dynasty (206
B.C.-24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
It went on to suggest that the Yellow River area should no
longer be seen as the only original birthplace of Chinese
civilization, for a long time the prevailing school of thought,
since enough proof has now been discovered to suggest that it
could have happened simultaneously and even earlier in other parts
of the country.

<P>
Shi also suggested that more attention should be paid to the
development of the southern part of China as most of the research
in the past has been concentrated in the north.
</P>
<P>
This may well help consolidate Chinese unity, he said, and
traditional ancestors such as the Yan and Huang kings can
be continuously studied as part of that history.

<HEADLINE> Animal Rights Activists Accused of Poisoning Christmas Cakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Twelve people are under
investigation for last week's poisoned Christmas cake scare in
Italy, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police in the city of Florence and Bologna said they have
identified 12 persons, including eight animal rights activists
from the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), who injected rat poison in
two Nestle's Christmas cakes and sent them to the Italian news
agency ANSA's offices last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The brand-named cakes were immediately banned for sale and
removed from supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
However, police said the "threat" is over and have removed all
restrictions on the distribution of the Swiss-based multinational
food giant's two Italian brands.
</P>
<P>
The 12 suspects will face serious charges, authorities
said. Despite the lifting of the food ban, Nestle said some of its
plants in Italy could still face lay-offs or even closure.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time ALF has resorted to eco-terrorism at
Christmas time, ANSA said. The group put red paint in the holy
water in the cathedral in Alessandria, a northwestern city in
Italy on December 25, 1992, to protest the eating of animal meat
for Christmas lunch and buying animal fur.

<HEADLINE> Corrupt Practices Cause Indonesia Big Losses: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Bambang
Subianto Tuesday said the Indonesian government has suffered heavy
losses due to the bad habits of officials including mark-up.
</P>
<P>
"Mark-up that took place in 1997, inflated costs by about 50
percent, and caused a loss of over 5 trillion rupiah (675 million
U.S. dollars) to the state in tax revenues. And that's only in the
tax sector. In addition, (it also) impacted on the higher prices
that had to be shouldered by consumers," he told a meeting with
the Commission VIII of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Subianto was responding to a question about rampant corrupt
practices, especially "mark-ups" in government projects.
</P>
<P>
"The rampant practice of mark-up occurs often due to lack of
awareness on the part of decision makers of the importance of the
projects for the people. This is a matter of morals on the part of
officials, and has to be improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has suffered from corrupt, collusive and nepotistic
practices conducted by state officials as well as the business
community.
</P>
<P>
Subianto said that to avoid any conflict of interests, a score
of first echelon officials at the finance department will soon
resign from their positions in other companies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of Tax Ansyari Ritonga, for example, will
resign from Bank Bukopin while Chairman of the Indonesian Banking
Restructuring Agency Glen Yusuf will quit Danareksa institution,
the Indonesian Observer Wednesday quoted Subianto as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said a clean government is one of the requirements needed to
make the banking recapitalization program a success.
</P>
<P>
"Recapitalization is not the only solution to the problems.
There are other prerequisites, among them, good governance and
restructuring of the corporate sector," he added.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Collects VATs from Oil-refilling Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) - Taxation officials in the port
city of Beihai in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
recently strengthened efforts to collect value-added taxes (VAT)
from oil-refilling tankers, which were at one time tax evaders.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the fishery and ocean-shipping
industries has boosted oil sales in the city, which now handles
some 4,000 vessels. Currently, the port services about 100 oil
tankers with per ship sales of 150 tons a month, and these
ships have an obligation to pay some 10 million yuan in VATs
annually.
</P>
<P>
The majority of these ships are mobile and have no fixed
business location, and so have became serious tax evaders in the
past.
</P>
<P>
After thorough investigations, the Beihai State Taxation Bureau
began to levy taxes on these ships. All oil-tanker owners were
first required to audit themselves and pay the taxes they owed
within a prescribed time period.
</P>
<P>
Tax officials then launched their tax-collecting campaign, and
violators were severely penalized with the confiscation of their
tankers or criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of local police authorities, state taxation
officials had taken in 80 million yuan from this sector by the end
of last month.

JINAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Qilu Petrochemical
Co. said today it has turned the losses of the two companies it
merged last year into to profits.
</P>
<P>
The former Zibo Chemical Fiber Works and Zibo Petrochemical
Plant had suffered years of losses and lacked sufficient assets to
retire debts before they were merged by Qilu Petrochemical in
November last year.
</P>
<P>
The two new plants reduced losses by 92 million yuan and earned
profits of 2.33 million yuan in the first three quarters of this
year, according to Wang Yankang, general manager of Qilu
Petrochemical.
</P>
<P>
Their asset-liability ratio was also reduced to 110 percent
from 233 percent before the largest enterprise merge of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed the success to the introduction of a modern
enterprise system, accelerated technological upgrades, reduced
production costs and the development of new products.

Some 4,700 laid-off workers have found new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Italian Justice Minister Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Justice Minister Oliviero
Diliberto is under investigation by Rome magistrates as required
by a lawsuit filed by the Turkish government on Tuesday
challenging the house arrest granted to Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The suit argues that Diliberto overstepped his prerogative in
allowing Ocalan, the head of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and
Turkey's most wanted man, house arrest following his arrival in
Rome November 12.
</P>
<P>
Two days after his arrival, Ocalan, named in international
arrest warrants issued by Turkey and Germany, made a formal
application for political asylum as Turkey prepared a request for
his extradition to face charges connected to the PKK armed
rebellion in southwest Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Under Italian law, Tuesday's suit requires Rome prosecutors
investigating alleged irregularities connected to Ocalan's arrival
to turn their findings over to the Tribunal of Ministers, a body
empowered to weigh allegations against sitting and past cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's office issued a statement Tuesday, saying
that the charge of abusing office cannot be considered based on
fact because Diliberto scrupulously fulfilled his duties in
accordance with the instructions unanimously defined by the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is currently under house arrest in Rome on the basis of
a German warrant. But Germany said that it will not request his
extradition and its warrant will expire on December 22.
</P>
<P>
Italy's rejection of Turkish demands for Ocalan's extradition
has caused a rift between the two countries. Italy refused the
extradition request because Italian law bars extradition to
countries where defendants could face the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Dai People Drop Traditional Contempt for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Ming, a 28-year-old
farmer of the Dai ethnic group, can earn over 100,000 yuan (about
12,048 U.S. dollars) a year by selling locally produced fruits and
vegetables to other provinces.
</P>
<P>
This young man of Changning County, Yunnan Province, has a car,
uses a mobile phone, and is leading a life much envied by others.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of business people like Zhang Ming have emerged among
the Dais, who, as a matter of fact, are known for their
traditional contempt for merchants.
</P>
<P>
"If not for the change of this concept triggered by the reform
and opening-up, the Dais would still live in poverty," said Yang
Jianhong, a Changning County government official.
</P>
<P>
The Dai ethnic group lives mainly in the tropical and
sub-tropical areas of Yunnan Province in southwest China. Because
of their centuries-old contempt for doing business, many Dais in
the past had to sneak out of the village after dark to buy things.
</P>
<P>
The massive opening-up in the past two years has provided a
chance for the Dais to leave their villages and return with modern
technology and new ideas.
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing local production has also enabled them to
accumulate surpluses apart from their daily needs.
</P>
<P>
Now the Dais trade their products as far away as the
northeastern provinces at the other end of the map.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Boyan of Fengping Township, Luxi City, is another
fast-rising Dai businessman. The 43-year-old farmer-turned
businessman bought two trucks to transport rice and watermelons to
Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, increasing his family's per
capita annual income to over 5,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Discuss Ways to Push Up Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela is to hold talks
with Saudi Arabia and Mexico on how to prop up falling oil prices.
</P>
<P>
"We will not rule out anything, we are open to any solution to
the price problem," Venezuelan Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said energy ministers from Mexico and Organization of
Petroleum and Exporting Countries (OPEC) members Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela will discuss measures to end a continuing slump in
Madrid on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arrieta said Venezuela was ready to adopt a medium and
long-term structural solution to end the decline of crude prices
which have reached a 12-year low.
</P>
<P>
In June, members of OPEC and non-OPEC producers pledged to
reduce exports by 3.1 million barrels a day for one year to
stabilize prices.
</P>
<P>
But the cuts were not enough to end the slump due to high
inventory levels and to some producers' failure to comply with
their pledges.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela promised to reduce exports by 525,000 barrels a day,
but it has not complied fully.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Venezuela in November was pumping some
305,000 barrels per day above its allocation. But President-elect
Hugo Chavez's promise over the weekend that his government would
respect its quota gave some new confidence to the oil market.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the second largest oil exporter of OPEC after
Saudi Arabia, which produces eight million barrels per day (bpd).
Venezuela produced 3.2 million bpd in 1997. Mexico, one of the
important oil producers and exporters, produces 3.1 million bpd.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region has decided to close 154 illegal small
coal mines in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The mines are run without licenses and cause heavy pollution
and serious waste of resources.
</P>
<P>
The massive shutdown will reduce Xinjiang's coal output by 3.3
million tons a year, but will not affect the normal coal supply,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,457 coal mines in Xinjiang, 1,116 mines are
collectively or privately owned, and many of them are illegal
ones, with backward equipment and no safety standards.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, more than 1,500 miners have been killed in
small coal mines in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the local government launched a campaign to shut
down these illegal mines early this month. Coal mines which are
heavy polluters will also be closed or remodeled.

assistant said that conservation areas had low priority. This is
evident in the way how a mining company is licensed to exploit
mineral resources in a conservation area even at the expense of
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Rampant poaching also poses a threat to endangered species,
Antara News Agency Wednesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most conservation managers still apply an
extensive management pattern instead of an intensive one.
</P>
<P>
"Under the intensive management pattern, conservation already
includes the knowledge of species movement such as animals'
behavior, sex-ratio and age composition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia now has 12 percent of the world's mammals, 10 percent
of reptiles, 17 percent of birds, and 25 percent of the world's
marine biotas.

<HEADLINE> F.A. Chief Kelly Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The English Football
Association's chief executive Graham Kelly resigned on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The FA's executive committee has also recorded an unanimous
vote of no confidence in its chairman Keith Wiseman, but Wiseman
refused to resign.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after the alleged promise of a 3.2 million
pounds loan to the Football Association of Wales.
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that both he and Wiseman had been involved in
granting a loan to the Welsh FA in return for votes at a meeting
of the game's world governing body, FIFA.
</P>
<P>
David Davies, the FA's director of public affairs, said that
Wiseman had been informed of the vote by FA vice-chairman Geoff
Thompson but had refused to resign.
</P>
<P>
Davies said: "There was an unanimous vote of no confidence in
the chairman, he has declined to resign.
</P>
<P>
"The executive will seek endorsement for their actions at a
special FA council meeting in early January. This vote of no
confidence was taken unanimously by all sections of the game.
</P>
<P>
"It was not part of a personal campaign...this has been
painful for all those involved in taking the decision, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Later Davies read a statement from Wiseman, which said: "The
issue is one for the full Football Association Council.
</P>
<P>
"I do not intend to make any comment at all until I have
shared the full circumstances of this matter with them all - save
that the version of events carried hitherto in the national press
is a gross distortion of the truth."
</P>
<P>
According to a report in a Sunday newspaper on 15 November,
Wiseman pledged a 3.2 million grant to the hard-up Football
Association of Wales, spread over eight years.
</P>
<P>
But the chairman was adamant that such assistance was
"commonplace".
</P>
<P>
Wiseman is trying to become a vice-president of world
governing body FIFA, and recently won Welsh backing in his bid to
become the sole nominee from the four home football associations:
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Restraint in Kosovo, Condemns Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
condemned the "wanton murder" of six Serb youths in Kosovo but
said such violent incidents will not hinder the deployment of
unarmed international monitors in the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department deputy
spokesman James Foley said that about half of the 2,000
international monitors are already in Kosovo to promote peace.
</P>
<P>
Foley added that it is expected that Belgrade authorities will
honor obligations to ensure their security.
</P>
<P>
"I'm told that the KVM (Kosovo Verification Mission) will
continue to deploy to Kosovo. There is no slowdown in the build-up
(of the monitors)," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, six Serb youths were killed by masked gunmen in a
cafe in the town of Pec in western Kosovo. The attack sparked
protests against the monitors, charged with verifying a
U.S.-brokered ceasefire in the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this wanton murder
of innocent civilians," Foley said of the Pec incident.
</P>
<P>
"Barbarous actions like this can only lead to a spiral of
retribution that will make reaching a settlement for the region
all the more difficult," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the border activity, Foley said the international
monitors, under the auspices of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, are investigating.
</P>
<P>
But they have "not confirmed whether the incidents originated
from an FRY (Yugoslav forces) ambush or resulted from KLA (Kosovo
Liberation Army) troops simply crossing the border from Albania
into Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local news reports said the guerrillas were part of a big group
trying to bring arms and ammunition from Albania. Foley said most
of the victims were dressed in KLA uniforms.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was already planning
to visit Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, diverted to Kosovo "to try and calm the situation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Foley also urged both Serbs and Kosovar Albanians to exercise
restraint and to avoid provocative actions.

<HEADLINE> More Moderate U.S. Republicans Favor Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- More moderate Republicans
came out in favor of removing U.S. President Bill Clinton as the
White House makes its efforts to avoid impeachment against the
president by the House of Representatives in connection with the
Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
"No one is above the law, not even the president," said Nancy
Johnson, a Republican lawmaker. She announced Tuesday that she
would vote for impeachment despite days of intensive White House
lobbying aimed at encouraging her to defect from her party.
</P>
<P>
"The issue is about principle, not politics," said another
moderate Republican lawmaker, Jack Quinn, when announcing Tuesday
that he will now vote for impeachment. "My decision is based on
the clear evidence of perjury and obstruction of justice as
presented by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee in
the last week."
</P>
<P>
The announcements of the two moderate Republicans were among
several pieces of bad news for the president's defenders. At least
17 Republicans targeted by the White House have come out for
impeachment in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton flew home from the Middle East, sources close to the
president and leading Democrats on Capitol Hill said one option
under consideration was to invite 10 or 12 key moderate
Republicans to the White House to hear a personal appeal from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives is expected to start debate
Thursday on four articles of impeachment approved last week by the
House Judiciary Committee. They include two counts of perjury, one
of obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power in the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
A House vote for impeachment would send the case to the Senate
for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would be
needed to remove Clinton from office -- a result no one expects.

<HEADLINE> Chile No Longer Danger for Britons: UK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom Foreign
Office said on Tuesday it was no longer advising British nationals
against non-essential travel to Chile.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that Britons should keep a low profile there
while the extradition case proceeds in London against former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer advising against non-essential travel to
Chile," a Foreign Office spokesman said. But he warned at the same
time that "anti-British feeling could flare up at any time".
</P>
<P>
"Visitors to Chile should be aware that for as long as the
extradition case against Senator Pinochet is in progress in the
UK, feelings against Britain and British nationals will remain
high. British nationals should therefore exercise caution," the
advice said.
</P>
<P>
Anti-British feelings has run high in Chile since Pinochet was
house arrested in london last month on an extradition warrant from
Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said street violence in Chile had diminished
over the past few weeks but the situation remains volatile.
</P>
<P>
Britons were warned on October 27 to avoid unnecessary travel
to Chile after isolated reports of abuse and physical assault on
people mistakenly identified as Britons.
</P>
<P>
Britain's House of Lords, the highest court in the country,
confounded the hopes of the Chilean government and thousands of
supporters of Pinochet in November when it ruled that the Pinochet
did not enjoy immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
UK Home Secretary Jack Straw last week gave the go-ahead for
Pinochet's extradition proceedings to Spain, where the 83-year-old
general is wanted to face charges of human rights abuses. A
Spanish judge accused him of responsibility to the deaths and
disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule, including
Spanish citizens.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's Lawyers are challenging both decisions this week.
</P>
<P>
British nationals in Chile should "keep a low profile, avoid
crowds, meetings and demonstrations and avoid areas where the
English-speaking community usually gather," the Foreign Office
said.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation on Target for 4th Month Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON December 15 (Xinhua) - The UK inflation has hit the
Government's target rate for the fourth month in succession,
according to official figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics put underlying inflation for
November unchanged at 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The headline rate of inflation, which includes mortgage
interest payments, continued to fall, dropping from 3.1 percent
year-on-year to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
But with all the economic signals pointing to a sharp slowdown
in growth next year, economists said the Bank of England would
remain under pressure to cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Governor Mervyn King said recently while the Bank could
take credit for steering inflation towards the 2.5 percent target,
it was "pure luck" that it had been bang in line.
</P>
<P>
Mark Miller of Morgan Stanley said: "Broadly speaking, this
will be very much in line with the Bank's inflation expectations."
</P>
<P>
"We would see the next rate cut coming early in the new year,
perhaps at the February Monetary Policy Committee meeting," he
added.

LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) - European bourses slipped into
sleep mode Tuesday, posting small gains as traders continued to
warn that activity will dry up in advance of the launch of the
euro.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 rose 22.6 points, 0.4 percent, to close
at 5557.1.
</P>
<P>
However, the FTSE-250 Index of second line stocks was less
fortunate, ending far into the red after a tide of very heavey
falls.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's leading share index saw mild gains following a
technical rally. The Xetra Dax index closed up 6.44 points at

</P>
<P>
"There's very little news to move the market," said Josh
Waiblinger, an institutional salesman with BHF-Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks closed near opening levels on the day after a
choppy session in which traders said moderate selling pressure was
offset by some bargain hunting from investors polishing end-year
portfolios.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forces in Gulf on High Alert against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon has
"significant, credible evidence" of possible imminent terrorist
action against Americans in the Gulf region and has asked U.S.
military forces in the Gulf to be on high alert, Pentagon
spokesman Ken Bacon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we have significant, credible intelligence
suggesting the possibility of imminent terrorist action in the
Middle Eastern region," Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our forces in the Gulf are now in a threat condition
called 'Charlie', which is the third out of four threat
conditions," he added. "The definition of 'Threat Con Charlie' is
that an incident has occurred or intelligence has been received
indicating that some form of terrorist action is imminent."
</P>
<P>
His statement came a day after the State Department said U.S.
diplomats and citizens in seven Gulf states could be in danger
of attack, possibly within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the next-to-highest level of U.S. military alert
meant that troops would be largely confined to bases, would not
move about in significant numbers and would be told to vary
their movements when off base.
</P>
<P>
The United States has 24,100 military personnel in the Gulf
region. More than 5,000 Air Force personnel are in Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait and thousands of sailors and Marines are on 22 U.S.
warships in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bacon stressed the United States did not take lightly any
intelligence involving possible attacks, especially after two
bombings in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and 1996, which killed 24 U.S.
soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Green Christmas Likely for Many in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The warmest fall on record is
likely to mean a green Christmas in the parts of Canada that still
have no snow.
</P>
<P>
According to Environment Canada, temperatures in September,
October and November were on average 2.3 degrees above normal
across the country and the warmest since climate data were first
collected 51 years ago. This year also saw the hottest spring and
summer on record.
</P>
<P>
If there is no snow where you live in the country, the warm
fall and mild early weeks of December don't offer much hope for a
white Christmas, climate researcher Bob Whitewood said.
</P>
<P>
In stark statistical terms, that means Ottawa, Toronto,
Montreal and much of Atlantic Canada are likely to be the dull,
muddy grey that is euphemistically described as green.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, the National Capital Commission said there is little
chance the Rideau Canal will be open for skating before Jan.1,
because it takes 10 days at -10 for it to freeze to a safe
thickness. Last year, it was opened on Dec.21. The latest opening
date was Jan.18, in 1970.
</P>
<P>
The Arctic experienced temperatures that departed far more
radically from normal than other parts of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures were 7.5 degrees above normal in some parts of the
High Arctic in September, October and November, while other areas
of the North saw average temperatures more than five degrees
higher than normal.

<HEADLINE> Women Rights Leaders Oppose Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Women's rights leaders in
the United States Tuesday expressed outrage at how the impeachment
debate has consumed Congress.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Betty Friedan, a pioneer of the women's
liberation movement, described the impeachment push against
President Bill Clinton by the Republican-controlled Congress as
jeopardizing the stability of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
"Even if he did what he's alleged to have done, what's the big
deal? It's simply not a matter of public concern," Friedan said.
"That does not threaten the Constitution of the United States.
That does not threaten the structure of the United States
government. Where is the sense of proportion?"
</P>
<P>
Many of the women went to Capitol Hill following their meeting
to urge congressional leaders to vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Clinton's Washington pastor, the Reverend
J. Philip Wogaman, said Clinton deserves a public reprimand, but
Congress should find a way to do it "without partisan exploitation
or mean-spiritedness" and without booting him out of office.
</P>
<P>
He is pastor of the Foundry Methodist Church, which Clinton has
attended since becoming president six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wogaman said he doesn't condone the president's admitted
actions with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, but he
added, "I view the sexual sins of the president and the resultant
efforts to cover them up as an expression of a much more pervasive
looseness about sexual life in our society."
</P>
<P>
While Clinton has apologized many times for his actions,
Wogaman suggested that "no matter what words he uses, it wouldn't
be satisfactory to his harshest critics."
</P>
<P>
Wogaman made the remarks at a news conference on his book,
"From the Eye of the Storm: The Pastor to the President Speaks
Out."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Israel to Fulfill Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Tuesday urged Israel to
honor its commitments to the peace agreements signed with the
Palestinians in light of the revocation of anti-Israeli clauses in
the Palestinian national charter.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for Israel to implement all its commitments and
what has been agreed on" in the agreements, Moussa said before
leaving for Burkina Faso for a meeting of the Organization of
African Unity, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine National Council Monday nullified the provisions
in the Palestinian national charter calling for the destruction of
Israel, as required by the Wye River agreement signed in October
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also stipulates that Israel withdraws from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in three phases and free 750
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel has carried out the first phase of the withdrawal, but
threatened to halt the implementation if the Palestinians did not
revoke the anti-Israeli articles in their covenant.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians' step has affirmed that they are moving in line
with what has been agreed on, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are fully aware of the importance of
co-existence with the Israelis on Palestine's land in two separate
states and entities," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Let us in the Arab nation ... wait and see how the Israelis
would deal with the situation," the Egyptian official said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa termed as "balanced" and "very good" the statements made
by U.S. President Bill Clinton during his meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has referred to the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people in addition to the sufferings and aspirations
of both the Palestinians and Israelis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton visited Gaza Monday to make a speech to the Palestine
National Council, as scheduled in the Wye River accord, in a bid
to give a momentum to the troubled Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Says U.S. Sting Hurt Joint Effort to Fight Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Mexico told the United
States on Tuesday that more efforts are needed in cooperation to
fight against drugs as it was severely damaged by a covert U.S.
money laundering sting last Spring.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the sixth annual meeting of U.S. and
Mexican drug-control officials, Mexico's attorney general, Jorge
Madrazo, said his country intends to again raise the "events,
circumstances, presumptions, indefinitions or insufficiencies"
that led to the undercover operation.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation "severely strained our cooperation" and
gave heart to those inside Mexico who would prefer confrontation
over cooperation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
If unaddressed, the problem "could jeopardize our respectful
bilateral cooperation" in the war on drugs, said Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
However, Madrazo acknowledged efforts have been made to prevent
the situation from happening again. He cited a recent meeting
between U.S. and Mexican investigators that showed they could
operate jointly "without suspicions or strains."
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the meeting, Rosario Green, Mexico's secretary
of foreign relations, said the willingness of the Mexican
government to cooperate in combating drug traffic is unwavering.
</P>
<P>
"However, President Zedillo has very clearly stated that
international cooperation regarding this matter must be based on
the respect for our legal framework as well as for our
sovereignty," Green said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno, U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey and
other federal officials repeatedly stressed respect for Mexico's
sovereignty and the need for cooperation to stem the tide of drugs
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Reno said she is confident the two countries will resolve their
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever differences exist between our systems should not be
viewed as stumbling blocks to cooperation,... they should be
viewed as building blocks," she said.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, Operation Casablanca resulted in 160
indictments, including of at least two dozen Mexican bankers. Many
of them were lured to the United States, where they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the sting operation was disclosed, President Bill
Clinton told Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo that the United
States never should have kept Mexican authorities in the dark.
</P>
<P>
Mexico lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. government over
how the three-year investigation was run.

<HEADLINE> EU Official: U.S. Companies Profits from Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
European Union (EU) said Tuesday that doing business in Europe
will become more efficient and less costly for American companies
when the euro comes into being in January.
</P>
<P>
Hugo Paemen, the European Union's ambassador to Washington,
also said the euro would have a substantial impact on the
international monetary system but the dollar would remain its
linchpin for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
When the euro becomes the common currency of 11 EU nations,
Paemen said, "it will not be a revolution but historically
important" because it will consolidate European integration "in an
irreversible way."
</P>
<P>
Paemen told reporters that big American companies could benefit
more than European ones when the euro is introduced because they
are more comfortable operating in a large market.
</P>
<P>
When the European Union created its single market in 1992, he
said, American companies were the first to take advantage, and "we
think that will happen again," Paemen said. "We hope the European
companies will catch up as they did then."
</P>
<P>
Paemen said major American companies such as Microsoft and
Coca-Cola were prepared for the introduction of the euro because
they have been keeping their books in European currency units, or
ecus, the predecessor of the euro.
</P>
<P>
"Small and medium-sized enterprises will have a difficult
adjustment period because they don't have the expertise, but the
big ones have done the job," Paemen said.
</P>
<P>
The new euros will not actually start jingling in people's
pockets until 2002, but the currency once dismissed as a pipedream
of bureaucrats will become a reality.
</P>
<P>
The euro will trade on international markets against the dollar
and other currencies.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the EU's 15 member countries will be using the single
currency starting January 1: Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece
have decided to remain outside the euro zone for the time being.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, European officials will discuss the launching of the
euro with President Clinton and other U.S. officials at the latest
round of the twice-yearly EU-US talks.
