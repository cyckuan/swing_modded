LAWSUIT AGAINST GENENTECH ABOUT PATENT ENDS WITH JURY DEADLOCKED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal jury deadlocked Wednesday in a lawsuit
contending that Genentech Inc. had infringed a University of
California patent in developing its first big product, human growth
hormone.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock represented a narrow escape for Genentech, since
the panel vote was 8-1 in favor of the university, according to the
jury's foreman. The university will ask for a new trial, its lead
attorney, Gerald P. Dodson, said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-week-long trial, in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, attracted widespread attention because of sensational
testimony in which a former Genentech researcher told of visiting a
laboratory at the university near midnight on a New Year's Eve and
clandestinely taking vital samples of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Such accusations raised new questions about past practices of
Genentech, one of the nation's oldest and most successful
biotechnology companies. In April, the company agreed to pay $50
million to settle federal criminal charges that it had marketed
human growth hormone for unapproved uses from 1985 to 1994,
pleading guilty to one criminal violation.
</P>
<P>
   The university had been seeking $400 million in damages, an
amount that could have been tripled if the jury had decided that
the infringement was willful. Genentech has had $2 billion in sales
of Protropin, as it calls its drug, since its approval in 1985. The
drug is used to treat children who are abnormally short because
their bodies do not make enough of the hormone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard the deadlock on the infringement issue as a victory
because UC didn't prove its case to the satisfaction of the jury,''
Joseph Ferraro, a lawyer representing Genentech, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodson, the university's lawyer, said, ``I don't see how
they can take great comfort in convincing one renegade juror out of
nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles A. Legge has set a hearing for June 22 to discuss
what happens next. It is likely that he will hear contentions by
Genentech that the university misled the Patent Office in obtaining
its patent.
</P>
<P>
   If Genentech prevails, the patent would be invalidated. If not,
a retrial could be held on the patent infringement claims with a
new jury.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which deliberated six days, did rule in the
university's favor Wednesday on an attempt by Genentech to
invalidate the university's patent on different grounds. That
question will thus not be considered in any retrial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The events at issue took place in the early days of the
biotechnology revolution in the late 1970s. The adversaries in this
trial had worked closely together to make the revolution happen.
One of Genentech's two founders was Herbert Boyer, a scientist at
the University of California at San Francisco who was a
co-developer of the basic technique of gene splicing.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensational testimony, about the so-called midnight
raid, came from Peter Seeburg, a former Genentech researcher. In
his previous job at the university, Seeburg and some colleagues had
cloned the gene for the production of human growth hormone. But the
rights to that invention remained with the university when he left.
</P>
<P>
   Seeburg, who now works at the Max Planck Institute for Medical
Research in Heidelberg, Germany, testified that he and a Genentech
colleague returned to his old laboratory at the university around
11 p.m. on Dec. 31, 1978, and made off with some samples of growth
hormone DNA, which Genentech then used to help develop its own
product.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he and David V. Goeddel, a then colleague at
Genentech who is one of the biotechnology industry's star
scientists, made a secret agreement to conceal this fact and that
Genentech researchers published a paper about their work in the
journal Nature that contained deliberate misstatements.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech has not disputed the taking of the university samples
_ it paid the university $2 million in 1980 to settle that matter _
but the company has maintained that it did not use the material to
develop the drug, for which it has received its own patents.
</P>
<P>
   Goeddel, who is now chief executive of Tularik Inc., a privately
held biotechnology company he founded, denied any agreement to
conceal the use of university DNA. He and several other authors of
the 1979 Nature paper have written letters to both Nature and
Science, another journal, saying that the accusations ``have
falsely impugned our reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech has placed relevant pages of Goeddel's laboratory
notebook from the time on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Seeburg's testimony contradicted statements he had made under
oath in earlier depositions, and he admitted on the stand that
during the period in question he had alcohol and drug problems and
barely worked. Genentech also pointed out that Seeburg, as one of
the inventors listed on the university patent, stood to get nearly
10 percent of any payments the university won from Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald K. Losch, the jury foreman, said in an interview that the
jurors ``by and large'' believed that Genentech had used the
university samples in developing its product.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the jury disregarded much of Seeburg's
testimony. ``The facts could have been established almost entirely
without figuring out whether he was lying then or now,'' Losch, who
is himself a lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Meirav Chovav, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said
Genentech, which has $1.7 billion in cash, would not have been hurt
financially even if it had lost the case because the damages
probably would not have been anywhere near as much as the
university wanted.
</P>
<P>
   She also described the trial outcome as an
``irrelevant-positive'' for Genentech's stock. The key issue for
the stock is that Roche Holding AG, the Swiss drug company that
owns two thirds of Genentech, must decide before the end of this
month whether to exercise its right to buy the rest of the company
for $82.50 a share.

WORLD BANK SAYS POVERTY IS INCREASING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of people living on less than $1 a day appears to be
rising and will reach 1.5 billion by year's end as a result of the
economic crisis in Asia and its aftermath, the World Bank said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, countries that until recently believed they were
turning the tide in the fight against poverty are witnessing its
re-emergence along with hunger and the human suffering it brings,''
the World Bank president, James Wolfensohn, wrote in its latest
report on global poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The report implied that the increase was caused in part by the
international rescue packages that were begun to help Asian
countries overcome their economic difficulties. Those packages were
mainly prepared by its sister institution, the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did not mention the IMF by name, but said these
packages bore down too harshly on the least well-off sections of
the population and should have been more carefully designed to
cushion them from the effects of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said that while 1.2 billion people lived on less than
$1 a day in 1987, this figure had risen to 1.3 billion by 1993.
Assuming the proportion of people living in poverty remains
unchanged, the number of abjectly poor will reach 1.5 billion by
the start of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In East Asia, the bank said, Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea
are suffering ``significant increases in poverty.'' In Indonesia
alone, the bank said, the proportion of people living on under $1
day rose to 19.9 percent in 1998 from 11 percent in 1997, implying
20 million newly poor.
</P>
<P>
   The picture for South Asia is more mixed with some countries
recording good economic growth. But the number of abjectly poor in
India has increased to about 340 million from 300 million in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In sub-Saharan Africa, economic growth lagged behind population
growth last year, implying a fall in average incomes. Brazil's
difficulties continue to cloud Latin America, where the World Bank
found evidence of growing inequality. It also anticipated ``sharp
declines in growth and increases in poverty'' in Russia, Ukraine
and Romania as well as in the Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's criticism implies that the rescue packages for Asian
and other countries hurt the poor disproportionately. While cuts in
government spending are inevitable in a crisis, it said services
that protect the worse-off should be maintained.

RANGERS EXTEND WINNING STREAK TO NINE GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The luxury of using Rafael Palmeiro as
designated hitter will be missed by the Texas Rangers starting
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro reminded those at The Ballpark in Arlington of that
possibility during the Rangers' 7-4 victory against the Kansas City
Royals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, a first baseman reduced to the role of designated
hitter by an injured right knee, drove in three runs. He had a
one-out, two-run double during the Rangers' decisive six-run fifth
inning and later hit his team-high 15th home run in the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's offensive production and a strong, seven-inning
performance by right-hander Aaron Sele (5-4) propelled the Rangers
to their ninth consecutive victory. That is the longest this season
in the major leagues and the second-best in club history to a
14-game streak in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, begin interleague play Friday with a
three-game series scheduled at Arizona's Bank One Ballpark and Los
Angeles' Dodger Stadium, and that means National League rules will
prohibit manager Johnny Oates from using the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   No designated hitter could mean no Palmeiro in the lineup until
the Rangers' return to The Ballpark on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it looks right now,'' Oates said. ``I don't see
him playing first base.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who emerged as the Rangers' Player of the Month for
May by hitting .404 with nine home runs and 26 runs batted in
during 27 games, plans to challenge that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get a week off,'' said Palmeiro, whose
fifth-inning double off Kansas City's Kevin Appier (6-3) gave the
Rangers an insurmountable 3-2. ``I'm going to play first base in
some of those games. I feel good enough where I can play in a few
of those games. I'll give it a test Friday and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't want to mess up what we've got going. But if I
feel I can do the job and not hurt the team, I'll try to play. If
I'm not ready, I'm not going to do it. We'll figure it out and do
it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, though, remains unsure of Palmeiro's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a slow process,'' Oates said. ``There's not a whole
lot of difference than there was two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The play of Lee Stevens prevents the Rangers and Palmeiro from
rushing his return to first base. Stevens will enter Friday's game
hitting .320 with 10 home runs and 31 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to keep playing, but I know I have to do a good
job,'' said Palmeiro, whose 2-for-2 performance Wednesday improved
his batting average to a team-high .360 with 43 RBI. ``I just can't
stand there. I have to do as good a job as Lee Stevens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who won his second consecutive decision, made the most of
the Rangers' six-run fifth inning by surrendering only two runs on
seven hits and one walk during his 114-pitch appearance. The
seven-inning outing matched Sele's best of the season, an April 6
game against the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we scored, my job is to hold them,'' Sele said. ``This
team scores runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's presence supports that cause, yet he could be limited
to the role of a pinch hitter for the next six games should his
right knee not allow him to play first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against that,'' Palmeiro said. ``I've thought about
coming off the bench with the game on the line and hitting a
game-winning home run. I've thought about it, but I'd rather be in
the game from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would prefer it, too. nn

RANGERS PLACE MIKE MORGAN ON 15-DAY DISABLED LIST
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander Mike Morgan's availability for
his scheduled start Tuesday against Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium
remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers on Wednesday placed Morgan (inflammation, right leg)
on the 15-day disabled list. However, the Rangers made the move
retroactive to May 24, and that means Morgan could be reinstated
from the disabled list before Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Burkett will replace Morgan in the rotation
for the start should Morgan not be available, manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready,'' said Morgan, who Wednesday threw in the
bullpen. ``My arm is not hurting. My leg just needs to get the
blood and swelling out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers recalled right-hander Danny Kolb, 24, from Triple-A
Oklahoma to replace Morgan on the roster. Kolb, who will be in
uniform for tomorrow's game at Arizona, went 3-0 with a 3.86
earned-run average during three starts at Oklahoma since his
promotion from Double-A Tulsa in May. Kolb will join the Rangers'
bullpen, Oates said. CLOSE LOOK AT APPIER
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Kevin Appier started Wednesday for the Kansas City
Royals, and that gave the Rangers a first-hand look at a pitcher
the organization has been scouting since spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals have made no secret about their willingness to trade
Appier, but Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said there was no
special importance in watching him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking at him,'' Melvin said. ``This is a chance
to see him for ourselves, but our scouts have seen him and
evaluated him.''
</P>
<P>
   Major-league officials say the Royals seek two premium prospects
for Appier in return, something the Rangers aren't willing to do
right now. CLAYTON READY TO PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton avoided a second stint on the 15-day
disabled list by informing Oates of his availability for tomorrow's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, who Saturday sustained a soft-tissue strain in the area
of his trapezius muscle in his right shoulder, missed his fourth
consecutive game Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance of me playing Friday,'' Clayton said.
``We'll see how it feels today and tomorrow. It's truly a
day-to-day thing, but I would think Friday could be the day.''
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers sent catcher John Marzano to Charlotte of the
Florida State League to begin a medical rehabilitation assignment.
Marzano, whom the Rangers invited to camp this spring as a
non-roster player, suffered a fracture to his left hand March 17
and has not played this season. Marzano served as a coach for
Triple-A Oklahoma while on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Left-hander Andy Pratt, right-hander Travis Hughes and first
baseman Travis Hafner of Class-A Savannah have been selected to
play in the South Atlantic League All-Star Game on June 22. nn

SPORTS COLUMN: EWING OUT AND KNICKS LOSE A CENTER OF GRAVITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ After months of hearing he was a barrier to the
Knicks' grand ambition, Patrick Ewing painfully stepped off the
court on Wednesday. He left an opening for his younger, quicker
teammates to run the floor without waiting for a limping 7-footer
to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   But has Ewing also left an opening for the Indiana Pacers? How
do the Knicks replace a franchise center, even the shop-worn and
limping figure who howled at the Market Square Arena rafters after
his last game on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you lose a great player,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy
said on Wednesday after learning that Ewing will miss the remainder
of the post-season with a partial tear in his left Achilles'
tendon. ``It doesn't help you. He was the one guy on our team who
had the respect of the officials, where he'll get a call when
bumped. But there's a lot of things he does for us, rebounding,
defense, low-post presence. We're just going to have to find some
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Life Without Patrick, a regular saga the past two seasons,
begins anew for the Knicks in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference
finals Saturday at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks are Allan
Houston's team now. And Latrell Sprewell's. And Larry Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Pacers, the most brutish, experienced and talented
team in the East, the Knicks are down to an eight-man rotation of
role players, streak shooters and foul-prone big men. For all of
Ewing's defensive liabilities against Rik Smits, his ability to
create his own shot in the final minutes or draw the foul will be
sorely missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will attempt to fill the void by pushing the ball
upcourt feverishly, letting Sprewell gamble and basket-hang on
defense and Johnson to do his best to keep exploiting his mismatch
with Chris Mullin inside.
</P>
<P>
   But they will need more to advance to their first finals in five
years; Chris Dudley, Ewing's replacement, will need to conserve his
fouls to stay in the game; and Kurt Thomas, as combustible as John
Starks, needs to keep his poise.
</P>
<P>
   Before he knew of Ewing's season-ending injury on Wednesday,
Antonio Davis called Thomas, the scowling Knicks power forward,
``dirty,'' offering up Thomas' Game 2 high-bridge to the face of
Reggie Miller as proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kurt Thomas has really taken it upon himself to just
be dirty, and if that's the way you want to play, that's fine,''
Davis said, standing in the parking garage of Market Square Arena.
``Either the referee has to step in and take care of it or we'll
take care of it. One or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anybody to be fighting for no reason,'' Davis
added. ``We don't want anybody to get kicked out because that's not
professional. But if that's what we have to do, then we're going to
have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional ante keeps rising in this series, a cauldron of
forearms and elbows that could easily goad the Knicks into falling
victim to their own passion. They lose their composure and toss
aside grand opportunities so often, it's as much a part of their
legacy as their resolve over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, one of the most physical players in the league, saw that
in Thomas' game on Tuesday night, that he had become the worst kind
of Knick; a nonthinking aggressor instead of a determined
basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the man, and he wasn't like that,'' Davis said. ``I
played against him when he was in Miami, and before he wasn't like
that. But he got a crazy look in his eye, and he's got this mean
streak going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, but whoever told him that told him
the wrong thing. I think it's kind of taking him out of his game. I
think he's a better player than that, but he's so worried about
playing dirty that he's not playing the type of basketball that
he's played in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will run more isolation plays for Sprewell and
Houston, hoping they can kick-start the offense early in Ewing's
absence. Their hybrid team _ a mix of young athletes and bruising,
veteran big men put together by Ernie Grunfeld and Dave Checketts _
have the perfect opportunity in which to prove they can win
important games without an aging warrior, a proud player who will
ultimately be phased out the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks future is suddenly now, though Van Gundy
understandably did not want to address that topic on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, to me, it's not about what we do in the future,'' he
said. ``I just wish there was a way to honor a guy who did so much
for us this year, who really was the consummate team guy in doing
what he could to help us win.''
</P>
<P>
   For his patient teammates who often deferred to him, there is a
way to honor Ewing. Govern their passions, take over his team and
remake it in their own image.
</P>
<P>
   It's what management wanted all along, and what the stubborn Big
Fella may understand what is best for the team today. &QL;

   Bill Clinton and Slobodan Milosevic face critical decisions this
week about the war in Yugoslavia. If intensifying diplomatic
efforts produce a political settlement, military operations could
end quickly, followed by the rebuilding of Kosovo and the return of
ethnic Albanian refugees this fall. If Milosevic refuses to make
peace, months of additional bombing are likely and Clinton and his
NATO allies will have to decide soon whether to prepare for an
invasion later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest peace plan proposed by the United States and Russia
is reasonable but fragile. Milosevic accepts many of the ideas in
principle, including the presence after the war of an international
security force in Kosovo and restoration of considerable autonomy
for the province. But the plan will collapse if he is unwilling to
accept crucial elements, including the use of well-armed NATO
troops as peacekeepers and the removal of Serbian army, police and
paramilitary forces from Kosovo. A few hundred border guards may be
allowed to return once Kosovo is at peace. Milosevic must also
begin a substantial and verifiable withdrawal of forces before NATO
suspends bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces should play a leading role in making Kosovo
secure for the return of the refugees, along with troops from
Greece and other NATO members that Milosevic may abide. But
hundreds of thousands of displaced ethnic Albanians, shaken by the
brutal Serbian assault on Kosovo, will not return home unless their
safety is guaranteed by a substantial number of soldiers from the
United States, Britain and France. NATO has drafted a sound plan
that calls for some 50,000 alliance peacekeepers, including 7,000
Americans. Coordination and command issues must be sorted out with
Moscow, which seems to think Russian forces can operate
independently in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO peacekeepers will gather in the Balkans in the days
ahead, and many of the same units can be used if an invasion is
warranted. But making a land war more than an empty threat requires
assembling at least 100,000 combat troops, and a much higher
proportion of Americans than planned for peacekeeping alone. Tanks,
artillery and other heavy weapons must also be brought to the
region, along with ammunition, fuel and other supplies, a complex
logistical exercise that would take several months to complete. If
Clinton wishes to preserve the invasion option, which he should,
the United States and NATO must start assembling the forces now.
</P>
<P>
   His meeting today with the nation's top military commanders
should give Clinton a chance to review the risks involved in an
invasion. They are considerable, and Congress and the American
people are wary of an invasion. If Milosevic balks at peace, there
will be time this summer for the nation and NATO to decide whether
ground forces should be used. But unless the soldiers and weapons
are in place by early September, there will be no invasion option
until next spring.

 LITTLE ROCK, Ark.: the plane landed. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines' chief pilot said he would not have tried to
land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone informed me that there were 50-knot gusts of wind
at the airport I was preparing to land at, I would leave town,''
said Cecil Ewell, who oversees all American Airlines pilots.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologist George Wilken said radar
images showed the storm arriving in Little Rock about the same time
as the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scenario that the storm approached one end of the runway
as the plane approached from the other probably is correct,''
Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   Weather data show that conditions were relatively calm 27
minutes before the accident, Black said. At that time, the wind at
the airport was out of the south at about 10 mph and visibility was
seven miles with lightly scattered clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But two minutes after the crash, the wind was out of the west
with gusts to nearly 30 mph, Black said. The gusts of more than 80
mph were recorded five minutes after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said Buschmann alerted them about 30 minutes before
the crash that storms were looming around Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``A half-hour before the crash, he said there were strong
\Rstorm\S cells,'' Barrett Baber said. ``He said we were going to
try to go around them _ that was the last I heard'' from Buschman.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed on Runway 04, which points almost north, and
then veered off the left side of the 7,200-foot runway before its
end, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Richard Klamm said he was certain he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time the pilot made his first bumpy touchdown until
the plane came to a stop was about 20 to 25 seconds,'' said Klamm,
49, of Pine Bluff, Ark. ``While you are swerving back and forth,
you don't have time to see your life flash before your eyes. I was
just thinking, `Get this plane under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane touched down, it bounced, came back down and
bounced again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell the pilot did not have control of the craft,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it slid past the end of the runway, the plane turned right
into the large steel stanchion supporting the runway alignment
lights.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the fuselage was split just behind the cockpit, the
left side of the plane was ripped open by the steel light supports
and the left wing was torn off and crumpled.
</P>
<P>
   The tail of the plane separated from the rest of the fuselage.
Fire rolled through part of the plane, and some of the injured
apparently were seriously burned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighting and rescue vehicles reached the scene within six to
seven minutes, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the survivors exited through cracks in the fuselage
because they could not get emergency exits open, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Black called the plane ``a clean aircraft, with no maintenance
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was delivered to American in August 1983. As of April 30, the
plane had logged nearly 49,000 hours of service and had been
through nearly 27,000 takeoff/landing ``cycles.'' Each pair, a
takeoff and a landing, is one cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at the brakes, the runway surface, drainage of
the runway and the runway's skid resistance in determining why the
aircraft was not able to stop,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we don't know how far down the runway the plane
touched down, and whether the pilot tried to get it back into the
air when he saw that he could not stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Wednesday whether wind shear _ a rapid change
in wind direction and speed that can bring an airliner crashing
down _ was a factor in the accident, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock airport has a low-level wind-shear detection
system, but it does not have the newer Terminal Doppler Weather
Radar that was developed for the FAA after the wind-shear crash of
Delta Air Lines Flight 191 at D/FW Airport in 1985, safety board
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock Mayor Jim Dailey said he hopes the investigation
shows that the city's emergency response to the accident was
``helpful in saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first commercial aviation accident at our airport,
and, at the least, we will use this as an opportunity to be more
prepared in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was en route to a speaking engagement in
Colorado, called Dailey from Air Force One to express his concern
for the crash victims and to offer his support in the
investigation, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also was asking about two friends of his who were on the
plane, Nancy and Craig Wood,'' the mayor said. ``I was able to tell
him that they both survived the crash and were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wood served in Clinton's administration while he was
governor of Arkansas, and Craig Wood is a member of the city's
water board, Dailey said.

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The pilot who crashed his American Airlines
jetliner in a severe thunderstorm had aborted one landing and was
trying a second when the plane slid off the runway, broke apart and
burned, killing at least nine people, a federal investigator said
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the pilot circled the airport, then
apparently landed too far down the runway after weather conditions
deteriorated significantly in the minutes after the aborted
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 of the 145 people on board the McDonnell Douglas
Super 80 were injured, some critically, as hysterical passengers
scrambled off Flight 1420 from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport when it
crashed at 11:51 p.m. Tuesday. The left side of the fuselage was
peeled away as it slammed into a large steel structure that
supports runway alignment indicator lights.
</P>
<P>
   All but one passenger had been accounted for by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told harrowing tales of escaping from the thick smoke
and roaring flames as a violent downpour, hail and wind gusts of 75
mph enveloped the wreckage at Little Rock National Airport, just
yards from the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I thought was that I was going to die,'' passenger Bonnie
Montgomery said. ``Everyone was pushing and pulling to get out of
that plane. We were on our hands and knees, and the smoke was so
thick we couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I pushed a few people, because your natural instinct to
survive just kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
recovered the flight data boxes from the cockpit with hopes that
they would yield information about what the pilots knew of the
weather conditions when flight controllers cleared them to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recovered recorders and the tower transmissions. From
here we will go into understanding what the pilots were trying to
do,'' said George Black, an NTSB spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they
have to base that on the information they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Richard Buschmann, 48, one of six members of the
flight crew, was killed in the crash. His co-pilot survived with
broken legs and other serious injuries and was ``interviewed
briefly,'' Black said, declining to say what the co-pilot told
investigators about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The four flight attendants, all based at D/FW, also survived,
although two were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said that ``all of us'' at American ``are terribly
sorry that this accident has occurred. ... It is clearly a terrible
day for all of us at American Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said airline officials ``will be doing everything we can,
together with the team of investigators, to determine exactly how
and why this accident happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Delayed for two hours by turbulent weather in North Texas, the
cockpit crew was on the last leg of a journey that originated in
Chicago, with stops in Salt Lake City and D/FW before Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   As it approached Little Rock, the plane ``started to rock pretty
good,'' said Kevin Mergel, 21, who was on the flight with other
members of the Ouichita Baptist University choir.
</P>
<P>
   After it touched down, ``I knew something was wrong when we
started to swerve,'' Mergel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to God he could straighten out,'' Mergel said,
referring to the pilot. ``He was trying to reverse it and correct
things before making a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Jamie Goss, a Georgetown University student, said the
plane was out of control immediately as the pilot struggled to slow
it down and keep it on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't,'' she told The Washington Post. ``I thought we
were never going to stop. Every time he would try to brake, we
would go to the left. I realized we were going farther and farther
to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking out the window at the ground, and the third time
he tried to slow down, I saw the grass rushing by and knew we were
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the NTSB was not ready to declare weather a factor in
the crash, conditions at the Little Rock airport deteriorated
rapidly as the aircraft approached the runway for landing.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, as
well as tapes of the conversations between the pilots and air
traffic controllers, will be reviewed ``to determine what the
pilots knew or were told about the weather before they landed, and
what they might have attempted to do once they got into trouble,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Steady winds of 50 mph with gusts up to 75 mph were reported in
the Little Rock area just before the plane landed. MORE &QL;

EDITORIAL: GOVERNOR BUSH FINALLY EMERGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 3:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who became the favorite for the
Republican presidential nomination without ever leaving Austin, has
begun to emerge from his self-imposed seclusion. The people of
Texas are probably grateful that Bush refused to campaign until
their Legislature had finished its business. But meanwhile the
expectations that have grown up around him have gotten so high that
he may find them impossible to meet. His first foray to Iowa and
New Hampshire later this month will be a kind of political
Groundhog Day, with spectators waiting to see whether Bush becomes
unnerved by the reality that greets him when he pops out of his
burrow.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has actually been filling two different roles in the
presidential race so far. He is the front-runner in a field of
Republican candidates by virtue of his family name and his
popularity as governor of a very large state. But he has also been
this season's Ross Perot or Colin Powell _ a famous but actually
little-known figure whom each voter can fashion into the ideal
candidate of his or her dreams. By actually venturing out to
campaign, Bush will have to fill in the blanks. He will inevitably
lose his status as a one-size-fits-all politician, just as Perot
did, and as Powell would have too, if he had chosen to run.
</P>
<P>
   The American people have a tendency to turn new faces into
mythic candidates, building them up into imaginary people who will
disdain compromise but nevertheless get a great deal done, cut
taxes while increasing services and defend the helpless overseas
while keeping the peace. Some of Bush's early fans will certainly
lose their enthusiasm for him when they discover he is mortal, and
others may realize his positions on issues are not nearly as close
to their own as they had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   While he stayed in Texas, Bush and his surrogates were piling up
contributions and endorsements, creating a campaign engine that
seems almost unstoppable. But we have seen inevitable candidates
fade before, and Bush is still a relatively untried campaigner. He
has actually only run in one hard-fought race _ against Gov. Ann
Richards in 1994. That was a big victory, but it cannot be compared
to the stress and demands of a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The field of Republican candidates hoping to become the Bush
Alternate is crowded, but there is no consensus fallback if the
front-runner stumbles. The primary season begins and ends very
early in 2000 _ a couple of states are even talking about voting in
December 1999. If this year turns out to be something other than
the triumphal march Bush's fans are expecting, the Republicans may
find themselves scrambling.

CRASH RESPONSE TEAMS ANTICIPATE CATASTROPHE
</HEADLINE>
 
(First Lede-Writethru) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAN REED and SEAN WOOD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ In a demonstration of the grim realities of the
airline business, American Airlines launched a huge response to the
crash of Flight 1420 late Tuesday night in Little Rock within
hours.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, every key executive in the company's
crisis response management team was in place at the American System
Operations Control Center near Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, at
company headquarters a half-mile away, or tied into the crisis
response team by phone.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 a.m., two jets filled with members of the airline's
Customer Assistance Relief Efforts, or CARE Team, and the technical
experts who make up its emergency response ``Go Team'' were
airborne, headed for Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30 the cafeteria At American headquarters had been turned
into a fully equipped news media conference center.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, American was criticized by families of some of
the crash victims, who were awaiting the flight at the airport and
were initially confused about what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   American executives acknowledged that it took several hours
after the crash for most of the CARE team members to get settled in
Little Rock, but they pointed out that Little Rock is a smaller
airport and not one of American's major hubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply do not have the same resources in a city the size
of Little rock that you have in a major metropolitan area from the
airline's perspective,'' said Robert Baker, American's executive
vice president for operations. ``I think our folks, collectively
the folks in Arkansas, did pretty darn well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our personnel were out at the crash site immediately helping
our passengers and helping to recover the injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the crash about 11:50 p.m. Tuesday, Art
Pappas, managing director of American's Systems Operations Control
Center, was notified of the crash. Pappas called American spokesman
Al Baker.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, the two men were in position at the head
of huge, U-shaped conference table in the ``bridge'' room
overlooking the main control room at the SOC, a room the size of
two football fields that looks much like NASA's Mission Control,
only about 10 times larger. Gathered around them were senior
representatives of nearly every effected department: flight
operations, ground operations, safety, scheduling, cabin service,
meteorology, reservations, corporate communications, legal and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission, Becker said, was to ``immediately regain control
of the situation to whatever degree we can and to begin responding
in the most effective, and most humane way we can to the tragedy
that had just occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   That response includes subtle efforts to protect the airline's
image. American made sure its news media briefing room had no
American signs or insignia visible. Two speakers' lecterns with
American Airlines logos used for
</P>
<P>
   happier events, sat in the corner of an adjacent room, while
American executives stood behind a plain brown lectern.
</P>
<P>
   But Becker downplayed the company's efforts at image damage
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of protecting the image flows from how well you
perform under great adversity,'' he said. ``And it evolves into how
you take care of the passengers and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first steps in activating American's plan was to call
in some of its 1,200 CARE team members _ American employees
systemwide who have volunteered to respond to an accident to aid
survivors and victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, American had activated 213 CARE Team members,
most of them based in North Texas. Of those, 121 were either in
Little Rock or en route there.
</P>
<P>
   While the airline has long had a practice of assigning employees
to the families of passengers involved in a crash, six years ago it
instituted a formal and thorough training process for its CARE Team
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are authorized to do whatever is necessary to make sure
that families are comfortable,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   CARE Team members are given carte blanche to pay for funerals,
hotel accommodations, meals, transportation and whatever else
victims or their families need.
</P>
<P>
   Most survivors, for example, needed new clothes because the ones
they were wearing when they escaped the crash were ruined by jet
fuel, mud and rain. Whatever remains of their luggage was still on
board the stricken plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our responsibility,'' said American Airlines spokesman
Mark Slitt.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of responsibility has been a relatively recent
development for the industry, said David Stempler, president of the
Airline Travelers Association in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone full circle from the less-than-caring, barely
responsible agencies and airlines to those who find this policy to
be more effective,'' Stempler said. ``It's a good business
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also federal law. In 1996, President Clinton signed the
Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act, which gives survivors and
relatives someone to turn to for information after an aviation
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was written after the 1996 crashes of TWA Flight
800 off Long Island and a ValuJet plane in the Everglades. nn

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ When Patrick Ewing missed a wide-open 15-foot jumper off
the heel of the rim at the end of the Knicks' 88-86 loss to Indiana
in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, little did he know that
would be his last shot of the 1999 NBA playoffs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ewing, who has been plagued all season by a strained left
Achilles' tendon, said he felt something tear in the tendon during
warm-ups before Tuesday's game at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who played anyway, finishing with 10 points and three
rebounds in 25 minutes, underwent an MRI Wednesday morning at Beth
Israel Hospital Singer Division, which confirmed the tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to work so hard and be so close to something
I've dreamed about for so many years,'' Ewing said. ``To not be
able to be on the floor to help my teammates is very frustrating
and disappointing. But if my Achilles' ruptures completely, it
would end my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, team doctors ended his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a distinct tear, in contrast to his previous MRI,
which showed no tear,'' said Knicks team physician Dr. Norman
Scott. ``It's a partial tear. The treatment is that the choices
were out of his hands and he had to stop playing the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following (Tuesday's) game, Patrick showed signs of swelling
in his Achilles' that we have not previously seen. This morning,
Patrick underwent an MRI which showed a partial tear of his left
Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a career-threatening injury, and we expect Patrick
to make a complete recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was stunned when Scott delivered the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You're kidding.' He didn't believe me,'' the doctor
said. ``He was really depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Achilles' will be immobilized in an air cast for six weeks.
Ewing will wear the removable cast over the majority of each day,
and after six weeks his Achilles' tendon will be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing averaged 17.3 points and 9.9 rebounds during 38
regular-season games this year, missing 12 games because of
soreness in the Achilles' tendon. During the playoffs, a five-game
first-round victory over Miami and a sweep of Atlanta in the
conference semifinals, Ewing averaged 13.1 points and 8.7 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being hobbled by tenderness in the tendon, Ewing led the
Knicks to a victory in Game 1 against Indiana, scoring 16 points
and hauling in 10 rebounds in a game-high 40 minutes. Ewing scored
six points in the last minute, including four straight free throws
in the final 51.3 seconds to nail down the 93-90 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But with the series set to resume Saturday with Game 3 at
Madison Square Garden, there will be no more heroics from Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick wants to play, but the injury prevents that from being
a possibility,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``After all that he has
been through this year, playing injured and doing what he could do
to help his team achieve the goal of competing for a championship,
I feel very badly for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year veteran has been slowed by a string of injuries this
season _ but the biggest concerns at the start of the year were his
chronically sore knees and his surgically repaired right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought that the broken wrist, which caused Ewing to miss
the final 56 games of last season, would end his career. But after
a strenuous rehabilitation regimen, Ewing returned in time for the
playoffs, playing in the final four games of the Knicks' five-game
loss to the Pacers in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Achilles' tendon was not a concern until Ewing left in the
opening minute of a March 9 game against the Milwaukee Bucks. An
MRI showed no tissue damage, but Ewing sat out the next six games
as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing missed five more regular-season games before being placed
on the injured list May 5, forcing him to miss the season finale
vs. Miami. It was thought that that late-season rest would keep
Ewing healthy for the Knicks' playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Knicks' entering the playoffs as the No. 8 seed,
Ewing led them to the conference finals, the first time a team
seeded last has advanced that far. Ewing had been seeking his
second trip to the NBA Finals, having lost to the Rockets in the
1994 Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick has been on this journey,'' Van Gundy said. ``The
reason he plays today is to win a championship. It is the reason he
fought through a lot of pain to try and help. I feel bad for him.
It's as if he's been cheated out of another opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly for Patrick Ewing. I've been with him for 10
years, so I know what he stands for. I know how much he's put into
it. I'm disappointed for him, that all these sacrifices this year,
playing through pain, how hard he worked to come back from his
wrist injury, how much he was willing to do extra just to get
himself on the floor and give us a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As are the Indiana Pacers, who watched Ewing limp off the floor
Tuesday after missing his game-ending shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see he was hurting,'' said Mark Jackson, once Ewing's
teammate. ``I'm proud of him. He's a warrior. A lot of guys
wouldn't have even suited up.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, who has made a career out of toasting the Knicks
in the playoffs, took time out Wednesday to offer a toast to his
rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a shame, because Patrick is such a great competitor
and has been such a huge part of this great rivalry and the great
games that the two teams have played,'' Miller said. ``The Knicks
are still going to be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't make our job any easier. It probably makes it
tougher because they (the Knicks) will step it up even more.''
</P>
<P>
   They're going to have to.

EDITORIAL: THE CHALLENGE FOR SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 3:
</P>
<P>
   The slums in South Africa are as bleak as any in the world _
miles of single-room hovels, each holding a huge family or two,
with no electricity or water and only a bucket for waste. Apartheid
forced millions of blacks into these slums, and many have not been
able to leave. The most important task facing Thabo Mbeki, who will
become president following the African National Congress's apparent
election victory yesterday, is to improve life for these poor.
</P>
<P>
   When Nelson Mandela and Mbeki took over South Africa's
government in 1994, they wanted to focus on helping poor blacks.
But Mbeki, who is deputy president and ran economic policy,
apparently decided that simple redistribution would be rejected by
world markets and would not help enough of the poor. Instead he
chose a pro-business strategy, lowering taxes and seeking economic
growth by attracting foreign investment and preventing the flight
of white citizens or their capital.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has reduced deficits and inflation. But
unemployment remains at a shocking 38 percent and income has not
increased. Apartheid left the country with one of the world's
worst-educated work forces. It also has inflexible labor rules that
inhibit job creation, a bloated government, inefficient state-run
industries and uncompetitive private industries. Reform is
necessary for growth, but is opposed by influential unionists and
Communists inside the ANC.
</P>
<P>
   To help the poor directly, the government cut the defense budget
and spent the money building more than 600,000 new houses and
providing water, phones or electricity to several million homes.
The millions helped, however, are only a small slice of South
Africa's poor. In addition, some programs have been badly run and
not directed at the worst poverty, which is rural. Many of the
water lines have cracked. Teacher spending is high, but education
is terrible, in part because little money is left for books and
many teachers are incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki promises to improve these programs. He is a strong
administrator, but making government efficient is difficult,
especially in a poor nation. More progress will come if he can
privatize state industries and remove obstacles to local job
creation. This will take courage, as Mbeki is not trusted by the
ANC's left wing. But his responsibility is to South Africa's poor,
who have waited for decades, and are waiting still. &QL;

WOMAN SUES OLOWOKANDI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The attorney representing a Sacramento woman is
demanding a multimillion-dollar payment from Clippers center
Michael Olowokandi in a civil action filed Tuesday in Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement released Wednesday by Olowokandi's
representatives at Bill Duffy and Associates Sports Management, the
woman _ who, like Olowokandi, was a University of Pacific student
at the time _ is alleging her 1998 relationship with Olowokandi
that produced a child included one sexual encounter that was not
consensual.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no criminal charges have been filed. The woman has not
petitioned for custody of the child or financial remuneration for
its welfare. As of Wednesday night, Olowokandi's attorney had not
been served with the civil papers.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy would not provide names of those involved, or more
specific information about the situation, in order to protect the
interests of the four-month-old boy, who was given up for adoption
by his mother immediately after birth. According to BDA's
statement, Olowokandi was consulted by the woman before the
adoption process began and handled the attendant financial
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But about a year after the alleged incident and four months
after signing a three-year, $10 million contract as the first
overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft, Olowokandi _ who, according to
the BDA statement, passed a polygraph test concerning the issue of
consent _ is facing civil action.
</P>
<P>
   The statement indicated the accusations against Olowokandi
``will not be taken lightly,'' and that ``the NBA and the Clippers
support and respect his right to defend himself.''

EDITORIAL: SILVER'S SILENCE ON REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 3:
</P>
<P>
   The fight to overhaul New York state's rigid Rockefeller-era
drug laws took a depressing turn recently when Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver said the Assembly would not take up Gov. George
Pataki's proposed changes. Pataki's tepid proposals deserve
criticism, and this may have been Silver's way of expressing it.
But the speaker seems also to have foreclosed debate on an issue
that badly needs an airing, and broader reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are right to reject the governor's proposal. The
Rockefeller laws require long, costly prison sentences for
relatively minor offenses. Pataki would not repeal the laws but
merely allow a very small number of first-time drug felons _
probably fewer than 300 people _ who have received mandatory
minimum 15-year sentences to ask an appellate court to reduce their
sentences to 10 years. As a trade-off he wants the Legislature to
end parole for all nonviolent offenders, an issue that has not
received any public debate.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Democrats have wanted to overhaul the pointlessly
punitive laws that imprison tens of thousands of minor drug
offenders, many for more time than that served by violent felons.
But the Republicans have always blocked reform, and hammered the
Democrats for being soft on crime. Perhaps Silver is wary of being
hammered again. But Pataki's plan, however weak, at least
represents a shift in his party's reflexive opposition to any
change at all. Silver should exploit the opening, challenge the
defects in Pataki's plan and push for reform that would make a
difference.

SALMON'S WRIST HEALING PROPERLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Right fielder Tim Salmon had the cast removed from his
sprained left wrist Wednesday and the news was good _ the wrist
ligaments are healing properly and if the progress continues he
could return before the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the cast off and didn't put it back on,'' Salmon
said. ``That's a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon was examined by hand specialist Dr. Normal Zemel and team
medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum but did not have an MRI performed.
As long as the wrist continues to get better, there's no reason for
an MRI, though Salmon was fitted with a removable splint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain was reduced and the range of motion was better,'' he
said. ``It's healing.''
</P>
<P>
   If there had not been signs of improvement, season-ending
surgery would have been a consideration. Instead, Salmon will
undergo therapy to regain flexibility and strength in his wrist and
hand.
</P>
<P>
   When he'll be able to return to the field is not easy to say,
Salmon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a broken bone where you can say it'll be healed
in six weeks or a certain time frame,'' Salmon said. ``Only God
knows how quickly it's going to heal. I don't want to get locked
into a date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two weeks is the window. I'll do that and see where
we're at. After that, either I'm making progress and can start
swinging the bat or not, and we'll go from there. . . . It could be
two to three weeks, it could be four to five weeks. There could be
surgery down the road. I'll just do what I have to do to get
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good news,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``You take
the guy's cast off and start getting him ready to play. That's good
news. It's what we've been waiting to hear, certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   Draft status: The Angels did not have a first-round pick in the
free agent draft that began Wednesday, but they did have picks in
rounds 2-22. The draft concludes today.
</P>
<P>
   With their second-round pick (the 68th selection overall), the
Angels took right-handed pitcher John Lackey (6-foot-6, 200 pounds)
from Grayson County Junior College in Denison, Texas. Lackey went
10-3 with a 4.23 ERA in 16 games (15 starts) this season. He also
played first base and hit .428 with 15 homers and 81 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real excited to hear I was drafted by the Angels,''
Lackey said. ``It's an opportunity that every little kid wants when
growing up and I was really excited when I heard I went in the
second round.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' first seven picks were pitchers. Of their 21 picks
Wednesday, 10 were pitchers, 13 were collegiate players, four were
JC players and four were high school players.
</P>
<P>
   Slump over?: Troy Glaus went into Wednesday's game with five
hits in his previous 12 at-bats, including two homers. It appears
Glaus has emerged from a slump that lasted all of May, but Collins
said Glaus' work with hitting coach Rod Carew must not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the process is, keep doing it,'' Collins said. ``Tony
Gwynn always said when you're hot, take extra batting practice. He
didn't want to lose what you're trying to do, maintain it because
it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus hit .130 in May (12 for 92), but Collins was happy with
the way Glaus, 22, handled the slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did fine,'' Collins said. ``I'm sure he was
frustrated at times, but I think he handled it great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are off today and will begin a three-game series
against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium on Friday.

STARTING PITCHERS ADDING STRENGTH TO STREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Aaron Sele turned in a workmanlike
performance against the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday. The Texas
Rangers' right-hander pitched seven innings, allowing seven hits
and two runs in a 7-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wider scope of the Rangers' nine-game winning streak,
Sele's performance paints a brighter picture for the team. During
those nine games, the Rangers' starting pitchers have combined for
a 4.07 earned-run average, dropping the combined ERA from 7.00 to
6.41 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts with our starting pitchers,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``They give us a chance, and we're going to win
a lot of ballgames. Unfortunately, it also falls on their
shoulders. But to put together a nice winning streak you've got to
have good starting pitching and a quality bullpen to finish it
off.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been the case in the six-game home sweep of Minnesota
and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rick Helling, Jeff Zimmerman and John Wetteland
combined to hold the Royals to one run, the fewest runs allowed
since May 15. Sele (5-4) followed that showing with good work in
the first three innings, allowing only two hits. He faltered a
little in the fourth, allowing two runs and three hits, but
regained his composure in his last three innings _ after the
Rangers rallied for a 6-2 lead _ to keep the Royals to two hits and
no runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to make some pitches, other than in the fourth
inning where they got a couple of breaking balls up in the zone
where they hurt me,'' Sele said. ``But really my job after we
scored six is to come out and shut them down, and that what's I've
got to do. That's what my whole focus was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday, the Rangers' bullpen accounted for four
consecutive victories, which overshadowed some solid work from the
starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been big,'' left-fielder Rusty Greer said of the starting
rotation. ``That's the way you win ballgames, with good pitching
and defense. The offense is the last thing to come around.
Hopefully we can keep swinging the bats and give them some
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for the starting rotation was lacking at the beginning
of the season, when some ERAs soared into double digits. That was
cause for some concern, but the numbers were bound to drop as the
staff developed consistency, pitching coach Dick Bosman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of repetition and a lot of work,'' he said.
``Sometimes it takes a little bit longer to get into really good
pitching shape mentally and physically. We've stayed the course,
and I really don't believe we've changed the game plan or anything
like that. We just kept doing what we were doing in the past that
brought us success.'' nn

'98 RUNNER-UP RETURNING TO U.S. OPEN AS PRO
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ Jenny Chuasiriporn, runner-up to Se Ri Pak
while competing as an amateur in last year's U.S. Women's Open,
said she is confident about making a memorable professional debut
this week at Old Waverly Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn, 21, will compete as a professional for the first
time in Thursday's opening round of an event where she has won low
amateur honors the past two years. Pak needed 20 holes in last
year's playoff to keep Chuasiriporn from arriving at Old Waverly
with a ``defending champion'' title as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My track record for Opens is pretty good, so I feel
confident,'' said Chuasiriporn, who has finished 56th and second at
the past two Opens. ``I realize there are a lot of expectations on
me. But it doesn't really feel any different to me. I'm excited. I
feel like I am ready for the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn, a member of Duke's 1999 NCAA championship team,
seeks to make enough money by the end of the season to earn her
LPGA Tour card for next year without going through qualifying
school. Chuasiriporn said she has accepted sponsor's exemptions to
three upcoming LPGA events: the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic (July
1-4), the Michelob Light Classic (July 8-11) and the Big Apple
Classic (July 15-18). RAINS DAMPEN COURSE
</P>
<P>
   Forget about firm and fast course conditions during Thursday's
opening round. Play was suspended for 21/2 hours Wednesday morning
because of showers. The final practice round was cut short at 2:45
p.m., when a second wave of storms dumped more than an inch of rain
on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deluge, Dallas resident Kelli Kuehne described the
greens as ``very quick ... They are big, so target golf is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the targets have become more tempting because of soft
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to winning an Open is keeping your composure when you
bogey from the middle of the fairway with a 9-iron in your hand,''
said Karrie Webb, the LPGA Tour's leading money winner. ``That's
what knocks you off your game. With a wet course, that's not as
likely to happen.'' KUEHNE ANSWERS SELF-DOUBTS
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Kuehne, a two-time U.S. Amateur champion who played at the
University of Texas, said the best part of Sunday's victory at the
Corning Classic was coming back from a final-round deficit to
secure her first career victory on the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know I still have the same instinct that I had
during my amateur days, because that's been missing for a while,''
said Kuehne, 22, who closed with a round of 2-under 70 and won by
one stroke. ``I've struggled as a pro, so getting that first win
meant a lot. It was pretty neat for a couple of girls to come up to
me and say, `You've got yours. Now, I'm waiting to get mine.' That
was great to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne, who joined the LPGA Tour in 1997, did not crack the top
10 at any of her first 33 tournaments as a professional. But she
has placed seventh and first the past two weeks, the best finishes
of her career. As for the likelihood of continuing her roll at the
Open, Kuehne said: ``I'm very comfortable playing in USGA events
because I love the courses they pick. You have to hit it straight
and putt well and that fits my game. I definitely think that's to
my advantage.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeanne Cho, a 17-year-old foreign exchange student, is
skipping her high school graduation in Bradenton, Fla., to compete
in the Women's Open. Cho's permanent residence is Boulogne, France,
and she is a member of the 1999 French National Junior Team.

MCCAIN OFFERS PLAN FOR SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUN CITY, Ariz. _ Warning that a ``pervasive public cynicism''
threatens to undermine American democracy, Sen. John McCain
outlined a plan Wednesday to save one the nation's most vital
institutions _ the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential can didate wants to allow recipients
to invest some of their benefits in the stock market. He also would
protect Social Security from congressional raids and remove earning
limits that penalize seniors for working.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants a commitment from the next president to use 60
percent of the federal budget surplus to keep the Social Security
system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is more about your children and grandchildren,'' he
told about 100 retirees in Sun City, ``but that doesn't diminish
the urgency of the cause. It makes it greater.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said such reforms will re-establish the public trust,
which has been squandered by elected officials who rely on
poll-driven policies, phony posturing, partisan politics and
``damage control we substitute for progress.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was critical of a proposal by President Clinton to allow
the government to invest up to $700 bil lion in Social Security
funds in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really want the federal government to be the major stock
holder in General Motors or Micro soft?'' McCain asked. ``Do we
want Washington bureaucrats picking winners and losers in the
economy? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dougherty, an 82-year-old retired credit manager, said he
likes McCain's ideas about Social Secu rity, but thinks McCain
lacks pizazz as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to get more charisma,'' Dougherty said, adding that
he respects McCain. ``I like him. I think he's honest, and I admire
his service record (as a Navy pilot and POW in Vietnam).''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Neumeister, an 80-year-old retired engineer, said McCain
doesn't seem as self-interested as other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants to do what's best for the country,''
Neumeister said.
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Roland Smith, 81, said he was concerned about the
potential for looting in the Social Security investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we guard against people who would take advantage of the
new system?'' Smith asked. ``How do we protect ourselves against
the Charles Keatings of the world?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said under his plan, people would be able to invest 2
percent or 3 percent in Social Security payroll taxes, selecting
investment options _ such as conservative mutual funds _ from a
menu created by an independent panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
   He said such a move could increase Social Security benefits from
an annual $24,000 to more than $60,000 for a family earning $35,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Social Security reve nue can only be invested by the
government in government securi ties.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said two Democrats _ Sen. Pat Moynihan of New York and
Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska _ have also endorsed the private
investment concept ``because they know it is the only way Social
Security can be saved without raising taxes or cutting benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also called for Social Security Trust Funds to be
separated from the rest of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that as the popula tion ages, fewer and fewer
workers will be paying for a growing number of Social Security
recipi ents. The result, he said, would be a rise in Social
Security taxes from 12.4 percent to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as it would be unconscion able to break a sacred trust
with you by confiscating your promised re tirement benefits,''
McCain said, ``it would be morally bankrupt to im pose such an
onerous burden on our progeny.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain criticized recent Social Security legislation in the
House of Representatives, saying the ``lock box'' law has a fatal
loophole that allows the money to be tapped for emergency spending
measures.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that a few days before the House passed the lock
box bill, Congress sent an emer gency spending bill to the
president that included millions of dollars in pork barrel spending
for such dire ``emergencies'' as subsidized rein deer ranches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently,'' McCain quipped, ``even Santa Claus has hired a
Washington lobbyist.'' &QL;

LA NINA SPRINGS FAST ONE ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Turn up the heat, get out the woolens, the
weatherman says it's going to snow tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to June in Los Angeles in the year of La Nina. Record
rainfall Wednesday, snow tonight on Mt. Wilson in the Angeles
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, very unusual for June,'' said National Weather Service
meteorologist Gary Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday set a record for the most rain on a June 2 in Los
Angeles -- 0.58 of an inch downtown, 0.91 in Glendale, 0.71 at the
Getty Center. Most of the Valley and its northern and western
suburbs got less than 0.25 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the third-heaviest rain this century recorded in the
month of June (in Los Angeles County),'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a 40 percent chance of showers in the lower elevations
today and into early Friday, and in the mountains it is expected to
snow above 6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight lows in the suburban San Fernando Valley northwest of
downtown and surrounding areas are expected to be in the upper 40s
and 50s, with highs today and Friday in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Weather Service officials could not recall the last time it
snowed around Los Angeles in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said Kenar Yegyayan, 24, of Glendale, as she
walked down Brand Boulevard bundled up in a leather coat. ``My
sacrificial rain dance must be working. L.A. is just too sunny.''
</P>
<P>
   Her companion disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Miami. I like my weather warm, like my women,'' said
Al Zequeira, 40, of Glendale. ``This weather is like Seattle. It's
too depressing,'' he said. But then he saw the bright side of his
predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be gloomy in L.A. than gloomy in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Treto, 35, of Glendale, a valet at Valet Unified Parking
in downtown Glendale, wore an extra layer of company uniform with a
vest and jacket over his usual white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain, it should be over,'' Treto said. ``The body doesn't
like it to be this cold.''
</P>
<P>
   The wacky weather surprised even the forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity . . . Caught us off guard,'' Ryan admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest rainfall was in La Crescenta, which received more
than an inch and a half. Burbank received nearly six-tenths of an
inch while Northridge absorbed a tad more than one-tenth of an
inch.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor restaurants kept their tabletop umbrellas tied down
Wednesday to allow patrons to catch whatever sun they could as it
played hide-and-seek behind the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the Valley are expected to be in the low to
mid-60s today, climbing to the mid-60s to low 70s on Friday,
forecasters said. Wednesday's high was 65 in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually strong upper level low-pressure system is allowing
the cool, moist air as it creeps down the California coast from up
north, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the crazy weather on La Nina, said Bill Patzert, a
satellite oceanographer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   The global weather phenomenon has chilled coastal waters as much
as 4 degrees below normal from the Gulf of Alaska to Baja
California, which in turn gives rise to the marine layer and
overcast skies, he said. The ocean temperatures are expected to
climb exceedingly slowly, meaning the gloomy weather could extend
into July and August this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The somber skies Wednesday didn't faze Rafael Farias and Jose
Sanchez as they used a cherry picker to hang banners along Grand
Avenue announcing ticket sales for the women's 1999 World Cup of
Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   They ducked under some trees for a few minutes during a morning
shower but after that, nothing bothered them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how Aztec blood is,'' said Farias. ``It's warm
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain caught Julie Bachman without an umbrella, forcing her
to run back to her car Tuesday night after seeing Elvis Costello
perform at the Wiltern Theatre. So, to be safe, on Wednesday she
took her small, black umbrella to work at the criminal courts
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sat all day in my supervisor's office,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With little regard for the wintry weather, Tony Martinez went
about his business as a bicycle messenger Wednesday -- wearing
short sleeves and short pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's California, man,'' he said, shrugging outside the civil
courthouse on Hill Street downtown. ``To me this weather is kind of
tropical -- it's humid.''
</P>
<P>
   When he wakes up Friday morning and looks at the mountains,
though, Martinez might not feel the climate is so Caribbean
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The cool weather was also a hot conversation topic at barber
shops around the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying it's screwball weather, the rain, the cold,
the dragging in the June gloom,'' said barber Joe Nozzi, who owns
Captain's Hair and Galley in Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all talking about it. The rain surprised a lot of
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   County officials warn that the rain could boost the mosquito
population, and they urged residents to get rid of any collected
rainwater or landscape water and to maintain ponds and pools with
adequate filtration and chemical additives.
</P>
<P>
   Infected female mosquitoes can transmit St. Louis encephalitis
virus, a potential cause of inflammation of the brain and spinal
cord. Humans can contract the disease only through the bite of an
infected mosquito. Los Angeles County had 25 reported human cases
of the virus between 1984 and 1992, including one death.

OFFENSE DISAPPOINTS JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The middle of the Dodgers lineup features Gary
Sheffield, Raul Mondesi, Todd Hundley and Eric Karros. For most of
the season Eric Young led off, replaced by Devon White a week ago.
The shortstop, Mark Grudzielanek, once had 54 doubles in a season.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means nada when talking about the 1999 Dodgers'
dismal offense.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16-team National League, the Dodgers rank 11th in runs
scored (245) and 13th in batting average (.261). They've also
grounded into 46 double plays, fourth most in the league. None of
which sits particularly well with manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, offensively, we're more talented,'' Johnson said. ``I
know we can score more runs than we've been scoring. We hit into
too many double plays. We hit the pitch that's sometimes designed
for us to hit into double plays. We don't situationally hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't hit behind runners, aren't adept bunters,
don't deliver sacrifice flies and don't score like they should. In
their last six games (four losses), they're 5 for 51 with runners
in scoring position. During the just-concluded nine-game road trip,
the Dodgers scored four runs or less seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we jelled offensively? No,'' Johnson said. ``Have we
jelled pitching-wise? I think we're getting closer. What's
frustrating is that first game here. We could have broken that game
open. We just haven't put it all together. That's the frustrating
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Vero Beach update: Dodgers officials met briefly with
representatives from Vero Beach, Fla., and Indian River County in
Florida to discuss the ramifications of Gov. Jeb Bush vetoing $7.5
million in funding and came away with very little.
</P>
<P>
   Indian River County administrator Jim Chandler said the meeting
lasted approximately one hour. Dodgers general counsel Sam
Fernandez and director of business development Fred Coons asked the
city and county to exhaust every option in trying to find more
funding than the $13 million available. ``We agreed that everybody
(should be) creative to see if there's a way we can make things
work out,'' Coons said.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said there wasn't any additional funding that could be
secured. If the Dodgers wanted to remain at Dodgertown, the
organization would have to drastically change its demands to have
the land purchased and the site renovated. No other face-to-face
meetings are planned, though the sides will continue to talk via
telephone. Coons said the team expects to meet soon with
representatives from the Fort McDowell Indian Community, near
Phoenix, about their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Draft Dodgers: The Dodgers' first three picks of the amateur
draft were shortstops, which held with the club's philosophy of
drafting pure talent and tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tool guys, have high ceilings,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``We're trying to get more athleticism,
more speed-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' first choice, 37th overall, was ``sandwich pick''
Jason Repko of Hanford High in West Richland, Wash. Repko, a
5-foot-11, 175-pounder, batted .581 with 18 homers and 47 RBI. He
was rated 54th on Baseball America's Top 100 prospects list.
</P>
<P>
   Repko, who will be represented by his dad, Ed, and his family
will be at Dodger Stadium this weekend to begin contract
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pumped about it. I'm in awe,'' Repko, 18, said. ``It just
gives me the opportunity to do something I've worked for all my
life. I've always had a goal of being a major-league baseball
player. This is the next step. It's what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' next two picks were shortstops Brennan King of
Oakland High in Morfreesboro, Tenn. (69th overall) and Drew Meyer
of Bishop England High in Charleston, S.C. (83rd).
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Johnson said a likely scenario has the Dodgers
placing Todd Hollandsworth on the disabled list Friday and
activating utility infielder Jose Vizcaino, despite Johnson's talk
of needing a fifth outfielder to rest White. ``There really isn't
another left-handed (batting) outfielder (in the system),'' Johnson
said. ``The good thing is we have a few days off coming up. That'll
help Devo. He's been dragging the past few days.'' . . . White and
Grudzielanek were given the day off and replaced in the lineup by
Trenidad Hubbard and Tripp Cromer.

MCCAIN VIDEO SELLS PERSONAL STORY, NOT POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain on Wednesday unveiled his
presidential campaign video, a feel-good biography that aims to
yank at America's heartstrings by employing dramatic
black-and-white footage of McCain twice eluding death during the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign immediately sent 50,000 copies of the video
to likely Republican voters in New Hampshire, which is hosting a
February 2000 primary considered crucial to the Arizona
Republican's chances.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-minute video is long on personality themes and
comparatively short on issues.
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates highlight their positions _ Steve Forbes,
for example, emphasizes his tax-simplification plan _ McCain's
campaign handlers believe his personal story is his most powerful
selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the video features grainy footage of McCain, a Navy pilot,
scrambling out of a plane in 1967 after it was hit by a rocket that
misfired on the deck of the USS Forrestal. The subsequent fire and
explosions killed 134 men.
</P>
<P>
   There are clips of McCain, filmed by a French film crew, lying
on his back in a Hanoi prison camp after his plane was shot out of
the sky. He was held by his captors from October 1967 until March
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping it personal, a present-day McCain is seen reminiscing
about the impact his absence had on his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter, Sidney, was 6 months old when I left to go to
Vietnam, and 6 years old when I returned,'' McCain says on the
tape. He said Sidney grew more accustomed to having pets than a
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when my (first) wife, Carol, was telling her, `Your daddy
is coming gome,' she said, `Oh yeah, where will he sleep and what
do we feed him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   What the video does not say is almost as important as what it
does.
</P>
<P>
   For example, President Clinton is never mentioned. But the video
displays a lingering image of the White House with this voiceover:
``At a time when some leaders let us down, John McCain is a man we
can believe, and believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the video make reference to Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the GOP front-runner in the polls. But the video chronicles the
McCain family's extensive military background and says McCain is
``more tested and better prepared'' to lead than others seeking the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A son of the Navy, John Sidney McCain was born into a family
where duty, honor and country are articles of faith,'' the narrator
says. ``His father and grandfather were admirals, and, at the age
of 17, young John McCain followed in their footsteps to the U.S.
Naval Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   The video does not say that the young McCain, who seemed to have
a rebellious streak, finished near the bottom of his class.
</P>
<P>
   The video was produced by Stevens Reed Curcio, McCain's
Virginia-based polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``His story is remarkable enough if you just recite the words,''
said Paul Curcio, a partner in the firm. ``But to have the actual
film of some of those events taking place _ whether on the
Forrestal or in the Hanoi Hilton _ it just gives it that much more
power and poignancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Little, if any, of the footage in the video is simulated.
However, neither Curcio nor campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky said
they knew the origin of a fleeting shot of McCain parachuting from
the sky over Hanoi after he was shot down. Opinsky said he could
not rule out the possibility that the clip was a re-creation.
</P>
<P>
   The video makes reference to McCain's divorce to his first wife,
saying it is typical for POWs to struggle with their family lives
upon their return. McCain's second wife, the former Cindy Hensley,
appears on camera and describes her husband as ``a loving, kind,
strong father. He understands the importance of being there and
being relied upon.''
</P>
<P>
   The video was previewed by McCain campaign staff members for the
press at a downtown Washington restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign videos have become increasingly important since the
emergence of video capabilities on the Internet. In 1992, Clinton
made effective use of a video detailing his humble origins. It was
shown at the Democratic National Convention to help warm up the
crowd before Clinton accepted the nomination. &QL;

PLAYERS EXPECT OLD WAVERLY COURSE TO POSE FORMIDABLE OPEN
CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-COURSE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, rising star Se Ri Pak won the U.S. Women's Open golf
championship with the highest over-par score in the tournament in
15 years. While the then-20-year-old Korean-born pro commanded
center stage at the LPGA's greatest show, she had to share some of
the spotlight with the golf course on which she won.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwolf Run in Kohler, Wis., was the real winner, some golf
analysts observed, bringing the field to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Open, which begins Thursday, is being played at Old
Waverly Golf Club, a universally acclaimed layout in West Point,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a phenom such as Pak will again emerge as the surprise
champion is not known. What is certain is that like Blackwolf Run,
Old Waverly will try the souls and talents of the best women's
players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Said Meg Mallon, the 1991 U.S. Women's Open champion, ``It's a
fabulous course. I'm excited to see what kind of shape the (United
States Golf Association) has it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it's going to be a bear, but a fair test of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1998 it was Blackwolf. In 1999, it's The Bear.
</P>
<P>
   Opened 11 years ago, Old Waverly will play to 6,433 yards for
the Open and a par of 72.
</P>
<P>
   There are hazards aplenty, including 40-acre Lake Waverly, which
comes into play at five holes on the back nine, including No. 17
and No. 18, a finishing hole that offers the potential for a
dramatic conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Old Waverly was modified after being awarded the
Open four years ago, and those modifications won't make scoring any
easier. For example, bunkers were added, bringing the total of
traps to 101. In addition, 11 tees were redone and two greens were
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the USGA's handling of the rough that could make for
difficult shots and high scores, as the women pros know all too
well. While the USGA likes deep rough for its championships, the
rough for the U.S. Women's Open will be held to two inches.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem like a less-than-severe test, but golfers point
out that the Old Waverly rough, a hybrid Bermuda grass, is tough
even at a shorter depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bermuda, it's like a nest when the ball settles in
there,'' said Austin resident and former University of Texas golfer
Cindy Figg-Currier, an LPGA Tour competitor. ``It can be really
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Figg-Currier said golfers accustomed to attempting challenging
recovery shots from the rough on other courses might be
well-advised to play it safe from Old Waverly's rough by pitching
back into the fairway and all but conceding bogey.
</P>
<P>
   The greens won't be any bargain, either, being bent grass and
tuned to warp speed, per USGA standards.
</P>
<P>
   If the course, designed by Bob Cupp and Jerry Pate, doesn't get
to the pros, the weather might. Even golfers accustomed to
performing in warm weather could be affected by the potential heat
and humidity of small-town central Mississippi in June.
</P>
<P>
   Figg-Currier said she was happy to play in Austin recently at
the Philips International Honoring Harvey Penick because it allowed
her a test under Texas' hot and humid conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Favorites to survive Old Waverly start with the tour's top
players. Among them: Karrie Webb, Julie Inkster and Mallon _ each
of whom has won multiple events this season, as has Rachel
Hetherington. Superstar Annika Sorenstam, who has yet to win this
year, is another possible contender along with Pak, who also has
failed to repeat her successes of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mallon and Inkster said they are pointing for this Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the majors,'' Mallon said. ``They're usually
our best-conditioned courses and our toughest tests of golf. I
really get psyched up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who has won three major championships among her 19 LPGA
victories, has never won the Open, although she finished second in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about the Open,'' Inkster said, ``is that you have
to be on a course you like, that suits your game.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Open rotates among venues, she added, ``That happens
maybe twice in five years.'' In addition, she said, a player has to
be at the top of her game to contend.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of one of her best seasons, the veteran hopes this
is the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the U.S. Open would the capper (to my career),''
Inkster said. ``It would be the icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, she must get past The Bear.

BURNED BOY FACES FEAR, WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHERMAN OAKS, Calif. -- He trembled but didn't cry. Denis
Nefedov said he was determined to walk into the operating room on
his own Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That was a milestone for the 10-year-old Russian boy, severely
burned last year in an explosion at his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I was really afraid,'' Denis said. ``This time
I was brave, because I knew I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the first operation April 5 in a yearlong series at the
Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital in the suburban San
Fernando Valley to repair his scarred face and hands.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday the latest surgery -- this time, on his seared
left cheek -- was another step in a grueling process.
</P>
<P>
   Denis said he implicitly trusts the surgeons at the Burn Center,
but still can't imagine the day when his medical ordeal will
finally be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too unreal. It's too far in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't teary-eyed. At this point, he's an old pro,'' said
Dr. Peter Grossman, who assisted his father, Richard, in the
morning surgery.
</P>
<P>
   When the operations on the boy's cheek are done, Grossman said,
he will be able to open his mouth wider, brush his teeth more
easily and simply regain some of the animated expressions that the
stiff scar tissue held captive.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Janna Nefedova, said she yearns to see one of the
broad grins that she used to get from her tawny-haired son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid to hope,'' she said. ``I cannot wait for the first
smile. It will be like a precious gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The burns occurred one evening early last year, when Denis was
home alone and accidentally ignited gasoline fumes in his family's
apartment on Sakhalin Island near Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors there didn't have the facilities or expertise to repair
his withered features. So with the help of Valley doctors who heard
about his case, Denis and his mother came to Sherman Oaks looking
for what they're calling a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and the Burn Center are donating their services. And
the nonprofit Children's Burn Foundation in Sherman Oaks
contributed $50,000 toward Denis' treatment and is collecting
donations for the family's food, clothes and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   After his anesthesia wore off Wednesday afternoon, Denis started
squirming under the covers and itching his bandages, aching for his
next dose of pain medication.
</P>
<P>
   Before his first operation, Denis carried memories of painful
treatments he'd endured back home. That combined with his fear of
the upcoming surgery, which flowed in torrents of tears.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he said he was careful to go to bed early Tuesday,
so he'd be plenty rested for the operation. His mother got no sleep
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a nervous wreck,'' she said. ``I was sure it was going
to be a successful surgery, but I wanted everything to go well. I
kept saying in my head everything is fine, everything is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors sliced off a layer of scar tissue covering Denis'
left cheek and covered it with cadaver skin that will protect the
wound and promote blood flow. Next week, when they graft skin from
his thigh to create a new cheek, the new, healthy blood supply will
help the graft take, Grossman said. The two procedures are
identical to operations that already worked for his right cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young, he's healthy -- that's a positive,'' Grossman
said.
</P>
<P>
   After work on his face, surgeons will resurface his forehead and
the top of his nose. That will increase the flexibility in his
face. Now he can't even close his eyes fully to sleep, unless he
squints very hard, Grossman said. Next they'll go to work repairing
his hands, gnarled and stiffened after the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothered him most right now was his face,'' Grossman
said. ``So we did that first.''

 Racial profiling is simply unfair, minorities say  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It is a hot August evening, and Katherine
Carrell is chatting with her two sons on the lawn outside the
family's Blue Springs, Mo., townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   As she talks, Carrell is eying a police car, creeping up and
down the street. The police car goes by three times during their
brief conversation, turning around at the end of the cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip, 21, and Quintin, 19, get into their car and drive off,
headed for the movies. The cruiser, parked about 50 feet up the
street, pulls out too.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed, Carrell waves her arms, flagging down both the squad
car and her sons. She demands to know why the officer has taken so
much interest in her sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't look like they fit in this neighborhood,'' the
officer says.
</P>
<P>
   Carrell is furious. She is half Japanese and half
African-American. Her sons' father is African-American. The officer
is white.
</P>
<P>
   This is Carrell's version of events; Blue Springs police tell a
different story. In their version, the officer's suspicions were
based on the young men's actions, not their skin color.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, like many involving minorities and police, boils
down to perceptions: what officers see as suspicious behavior,
viewed from one angle, and what minorities see as racial
harassment, viewed from another.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, African-Americans, Hispanics and other ethnic
groups have argued that they are routinely stopped by police and
questioned simply because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, that has been an unproven allegation. But that
may be changing. Proposed federal legislation, court-ordered
remedies and pressure from civil-rights groups are fueling studies
to determine whether minorities are targeted unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, in a report released
Wednesday, said the number of highway traffic stops based on race
has increased significantly because of the war on drugs. The ACLU
has filed lawsuits in Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and Oklahoma
challenging the police practice known as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, Katherine Carrell isn't the only one
with a firsthand account. Others, including several business
executives, say they believe they have been stopped because of
their skin color.
</P>
<P>
   Racial stereotypes that link minorities to criminal behavior are
viewed as the catalyst for the stops. In the view of many
minorities, their ``suspicious behavior'' amounts to nothing more
than ``Driving While Black.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Stopped many times
</P>
<P>
   The Carrells have lived in their Blue Springs home for nearly
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Quintin Carrell estimates he has been stopped
more than a dozen times. He has been followed by police, frisked
and told that he was stopped because of reports of a prowler.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never been ticketed for a traffic offense. A noise
violation for his car stereo was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they apply their stereotypes on me, `a black man
driving in a predominately white town,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Carrell is afraid for her sons _ especially Phillip,
who she knows may be short-tempered with police because he is fed
up with what he views as unfair treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just scary,'' Carrell said. ``I'm afraid for the phone
call from the police saying, `We are sorry. We stopped your son and
we thought he had a gun. He was shot and killed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After the encounter in front of her home, she filed a complaint
with the Blue Springs Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Written reports compiled during the investigation of the
complaint tell the police version of the evening's events. Blue
Springs police allowed The Kansas City Star to read the complete
file of reports.
</P>
<P>
   The officer wrote he had received ``hard, furtive glances'' from
her sons when he had driven by them minutes earlier, before their
car stopped at the home.
</P>
<P>
   The car was unfamiliar to the officer. The young men pulled up
on the curb, instead of pulling into the driveway. They bounded up
the lawn, leaving one car door open. Another young man, also
African-American, was left sitting in the front passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, based on my training and experience as a police
officer, I believed the occupants of the vehicle may have been
involved in some type of criminal activity,'' the officer wrote in
a report later.
</P>
<P>
   The officer asserts he did not intend to stop Carrell's sons.
His suspicions were alleviated when he saw the boys talking with
their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Springs Police Chief H.L. Brown supports his officer's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the exact same set of circumstances and turn them white,
the officer would have done the exact same thing,'' Brown said.
``They were suspicious.''  &LR; brk:Chiefs consider matter
</P>
<P>
   In early April, 20 police chiefs from some of the nation's
largest cities gathered to discuss the perception of racially
biased traffic stops. The Washington meeting was called by the
Police Executive Research Forum, which represents 40 percent of
America's police forces.
</P>
<P>
   Local departments also recognize that there is a widely held
belief that race plays a role in traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park Chief of Police John Douglass accepts that police
officers are influenced by the racial stereotypes inherent in
American society. Some officers initially might want to act when
they see a black or Hispanic who doesn't seem to ``fit'' in an
area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those myths have to be trained out,'' Douglass said. ``It has
to be taught away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Blue Springs chief, argues that, at times, police are
correct to note the person who seems ``out of place.'' But good
policing means not acting on that suspicion until it is supported
by other factors, Brown and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An officer should be able to tell you why he stopped you,''
said Atkins Warren, a former police chief and now the regional
director of the U.S. Justice Department's Community Relations
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have led police to this point.
</P>
<P>
   The courts, over a number of years, have given more authority to
police in car stops. A 1996 Supreme Court decision said police may
use traffic stops as a pretext to uncover other types of criminal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, zero-tolerance policies on drugs have fueled
an increase in police actions. One result is a nationwide drop in
crime, but more contacts with police for some people.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Wexler, the forum's executive director, recalls the
comment of one chief: ``It seems like the better the job we do in
driving crime down, the more the trust factor in the community is
being diminished,'' the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Diminished trust undermines community policing, a philosophy
practiced in Kansas City and many other cities. Community policing
asks citizens to link with police in fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we drive crime way down, but it comes at the expense of the
community's respect, it is not worth it,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials argue that race is often wrongly blamed when
minorities don't understand what may have aroused their suspicions.
That assertion _ that minorities too often claim race as the reason
for their stop _ is a factor in the Carrell case.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Fain, director of the Kansas City Police Department's
Office of Citizen Complaints, said racial bias is a common
complaint, even though police unions and associations say officers
often can't determine the race of a driver when they stop a car.
</P>
<P>
   Fain, an African-American, says she hears the race issue raised
from every perspective: whites complaining a black officer was
racist to give them a ticket, and blacks saying they were stopped
solely because of their race by a white officer.
</P>
<P>
   With each case, she does what she terms ``reality testing,''
probing for more information. ``What else might have singled you
out?'' she will ask a black person who was stopped by a white
officer.  &LR; brk:Statistics needed
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, efforts are under way to push for valid
statistics to attach to this question of perception.
</P>
<P>
   A few court-ordered studies of traffic stop patterns are proving
that minorities in some areas are subjected to a disproportionate
number of traffic stops. The New Jersey Turnpike is the
most-often-cited example.
</P>
<P>
   There, a study found African-Americans made up 13.5 percent of
the traffic and 15 percent of the speeders, but were subject to 46
percent of the traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed federal legislation would order law enforcement
agencies to collect data to track any possible racial patterns in
police activity. At least 12 state legislatures are also
considering legislation that would require such studies.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri legislature, in its last session, passed such a
measure. But it has no teeth because it did not order the Highway
Patrol to collect the data, but simply suggested it ``may'' keep
the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Police Organizations, which
represents police unions, argues that the public needs to
understand it might come in contact with police as they fight
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, sometimes law-abiding citizens will be
inconvenienced when police aggressively enforce the laws and
investigate crimes,'' wrote Robert Scully, executive director of
the 220,000 member National Association.
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park Chief Douglass is a member of another group
opposed to the proposed legislation _ the International Association
of Chiefs of Police. Douglass is a member of the chiefs group's
ethics and image committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the consensus is we would all be naive to believe
that there are no police officers who don't tend to stop people
based on race,'' Douglass said. ``But we don't feel it is as
widespread as some people believe.''

OPTIONS FOR ENSURING AREA'S AIR QUALITY DEBATED AT FUEL SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ You've heard of designer suits and jewelry,
but can you imagine designer gasoline?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one way for Kansas City to bring its air quality into
compliance with federal guidelines may involve what oil industry
representatives refer to as a ``designer'' or ``boutique'' fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel is so named because it's a special blend _ in this
case, a Kansas City blend _ that is intended to help a community
meet its specific air-quality needs.
</P>
<P>
   This designer fuel was suggested Wednesday at a daylong ``fuel
summit'' as one of the three or four main options for cleaning the
metro area's air.
</P>
<P>
   Although not their preference, oil industry representatives
indicated that even a regional blend would be better than
reformulated gas, which is designed to reduce emissions of
chemicals that create ozone. Use of reformulated gasoline is the
key element in the metro area's strategy for meeting federal
air-quality guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``RFG is just not an option for us,'' said Gary Schooveld, who
represented Phillips 66.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting assembled regulators, local officials, oil refiners,
petroleum marketers and advocates of different alternative fuel
blends at the Jack Reardon Civic Center in Kansas City, Kan. The
meeting concludes today and is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, the oil refiners raised numerous questions
and criticized the push to bring reformulated gas to Kansas City
area pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Telthorst of the Missouri Oil Council said the main
opposition is centered on an oil industry lawsuit in Washington
that claims it is illegal for Kansas City, as well as some other
cities, to have such fuel. The federal Clean Air Act, he explained,
has set limits on how the fuel could be introduced into a
community. Kansas City, he said, doesn't meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The oil refiners oppose making it available to more cities
because it would increase their costs of production. Some refiners
in the Missouri Oil Council don't yet make the new fuel, while
others have only a limited capacity to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Jack Smith, a professional facilitator who led a similar
session in St. Louis last year, the meeting today will address the
area's more immediate clean-air problem: making its transportation
plans conform to federal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In May, federal transportation officials ruled, unexpectedly,
that the area's transportation plan fails to conform with its
clean-air plans. As a result, those transportation plans have
lapsed and new highway improvement projects that expand a highway's
capacity must be placed on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest way out of that fix would be for the governors of
Missouri and Kansas to request that the metro area be allowed to
bring reformulated gas to area service stations in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If the governors don't act in about a month, millions of dollars
in highway expansions, including some $30 million in construction
on the new Chouteau Bridge, may be placed on hold, state and
federal official say.
</P>
<P>
   The governors have promised to make a decision after the fuel
summit.
</P>
<P>
   The need to move quickly on the transportation plan issue may be
the toughest hurdle in the path toward a regional ``designer''
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Randolph, chief air pollution regulator for the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources, told the oil refiners Wednesday
that designing a special state blend would take months to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't leave today saying we want to investigate a new state
fuel for x-number of months,'' Randolph said. ``That's a
non-answer. We can't go that way.''

CABDRIVER HELPS LEAD TO ARREST OF ROBBERY SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A cabdriver who was robbed two weeks ago may
have saved another cabbie from the same fate and helped police
arrest a Kansas City man, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrick E. Hardy, 23, was arraigned Wednesday on two counts of
first-degree robbery. He was in jail Wednesday night on a $75,000
bond.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened, according to the cabdriver and court
records:
</P>
<P>
   On May 20, the driver, Jerry Bussey, picked up a man in the 1600
block of Elmwood. The rider pointed a gun at Bussey's head and
demanded money. Bussey gave the robber $84 and the robber ran.
</P>
<P>
   After he was robbed, Bussey asked his dispatcher to notify him
if other calls sounded suspicious. Eleven days later, the
dispatcher did.
</P>
<P>
   Bussey drove to a convenience store at 19th Street and Jackson
Avenue and recognized a man standing at the door. Bussey parked
behind the store and walked to the front door.
</P>
<P>
   The man held the door open for Bussey as he entered and left the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Bussey then returned to his cab and called his dispatcher at
Checker Cab.
</P>
<P>
   Bussey said he told the dispatcher, ``This guy doesn't need a
taxi. He needs a paddy wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   About that time a Yellow Cab driver had pulled up to get gas and
the man asked for a ride. But Bussey pulled his car in front of the
Yellow Cab and gave the other driver a coded signal that the man
might be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The two drivers stalled until police arrived. The man went into
the store, where officers arrested him. They later found a gun
hidden inside.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned, Hardy denied involvement in the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Police said he also was suspected of robbing a cabdriver May 29
at Truman Road and Hardesty Avenue and was being investigated in
three other recent cases in the same area.

SCHOOL BOARD'S ACTION ON ADMINISTRATOR LEAVES MANY QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TANIKA WHITE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ By asking the Kansas City Board of Education
for a vote of confidence Tuesday night, Phyllis Chase hoped to
better determine her chances of becoming the permanent district
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Some district observers, however, say Chase's request was an
exercise in futility.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her best efforts, they say, the interim chief
administrator for curriculum and instruction will not be the next
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my understanding that the DMC (Desegregation Monitoring
Committee) is not in favor of her being superintendent. They don't
think she's qualified,'' said Arthur A. Benson II, lawyer for the
plaintiff schoolchildren in the federal desegregation case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard that she was spending a lot of time campaigning
for the superintendency. But I think she should concentrate her
energies on more productive goals like helping educate the kids in
the Kansas City School District while she's looking for another
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the monitoring committee would not comment publicly
about whether Chase was still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent search committee _ which consists of all
three DMC members and school board member Helen Ragsdale _
interviewed Chase in early May.
</P>
<P>
   The committee later rejected the initial round of candidates and
asked a search firm to find others.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said Wednesday that she thought she still was in the
running, because the search committee had not specifically told her
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I'm a candidate,'' Chase said. ``And I've been doing
the job for the last six months, and I still desire to be up for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to look at my future options, and I think it's
critical that I know where the board of directors is in terms of my
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting Tuesday four board members gave Chase a vote of
confidence, three members voted no, and Sandy Mayer abstained.
Connie Clark was absent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the board's position was just as muddled.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said she should have voted against the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in favor of her taking that (superintendent's)
position,'' Mayer said. ``I think we need a superintendent who is
going to challenge the board based on what's best for the children.
She has had the authority. She has had her hands free to make tough
decisions, and I haven't seen that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Riley said he wished he could change his no vote to an
abstention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a vote saying I don't support Phyllis Chase,''
Riley said. ``It's just there are more important things at hand,
and I support people by actions, not by symbols.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale said her no vote was against the motion, not against
Chase. But she said she was disappointed that Chase put the board
in such a position.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should have realized that we supported her when we went to
court and asked them to reconsider and let her apply for that job.
So that was a show of support,'' Ragsdale said. ``And she applied
for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said it was difficult for board members to push the
candidacy of any one person because the selection committee chooses
the candidates who will be presented to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know where we stand in our power to select a
superintendent,'' Riley said. ``I feel like we're in between a rock
and a hard spot, because the DMC has so much power.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Patricia Kurtz said that despite the monitoring
committee's heavy involvement and the questions about Chase's
candidacy, community and board support could be enough to win Chase
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you count votes, she's got the (board) votes
to be the superintendent. I don't understand why they (the DMC)
don't see this as I do, that we have the best of all possible
worlds here,'' Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very willing to embrace someone within the organization
who has proven herself under the most difficult circumstances. I
think she has the potential to flourish into a very fine leader of
the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring committee member Charles McClain said the selection
committee expected to present more candidates to the board in the
next two weeks.

PATTI MANUEL IS LEAVING SPRINT FOR TELOCITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Patti Manuel, formerly president of Sprint's
long-distance division and the company's top-ranking woman
executive, has signed on as president of Telocity Inc., a
telecommunications start-up in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Telocity, started in 1997, is a provider of digital subscriber
line service. DSL is a technology that allows telephone companies
to provide high-speed Internet service over standard copper phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Telocity is developing a technology that will let consumers
install DSL service in their homes without an expensive and
time-consuming visit by an installer. The company is testing the
resulting product, a box, and hopes to introduce it in partnership
with phone companies by the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make DSL more of a plug-and-play product, to
eliminate the truck roll by the phone company,'' Manuel said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel, 42, worked at Westwood-based Sprint Corp. for 13 years.
She was head of the long-distance division for slightly more than a
year. Manuel quit in late March, citing personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She said the move to Telocity involved a substantial cut from
the $876,910 she earned in salary and bonus at Sprint in 1998. She
will, however, have a substantial equity position in Telocity.

   ``It's a risk,'' she said, ``but an educated risk on a market
that is growing very rapidly.''

TOUR WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO A TIME OF TOMMY GUNS AND `PRETTY BOY'

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Zoot-suited gangsters and billy club-wielding
cops take center stage this summer when Gray Line begins offering
guided bus tours of Kansas City's seamy past.
</P>
<P>
   The Gangsters of Kansas City Tour will join Gray Line's other
motor coach trips that focus on the city's pioneer history, jazz,
fountains and Harry S. Truman, said Bill George, president of
Metropolitan Transportation Services Inc., which operates Gray
Line.
</P>
<P>
   The famous bullet holes in Union Station _ long believed put
there June 17, 1933, by Charles ``Pretty Boy'' Floyd and others in
a shootout with authorities _ are to be one of the tour's
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Union Station also will serve as the starting point for what
promises to be part guided tour and part Disneyesque production
complete with costumed characters and what some say is an
inappropriate script.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been determined how specific the narration will be
regarding more recent events, including the mob wars of the 1970s
that spelled an end to the city's River Quay district _ reborn a
decade later as the River Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sensitive subject,'' George acknowledged. ``The tour
has a gangster theme, but everything's going to have a positive
spin. The rebirth of the River Market, for example, is a great
story.''
</P>
<P>
   George announced the plans at a luncheon Wednesday attended by
members of the Hotel and Motel Association of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The tour _ which sounds similar to a gangster-themed tour in
Chicago _ is raising a few eyebrows in the Jackson County
prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Present-day violence and crime is what we're fighting,'' said
Phil Levota, an assistant prosecutor who specializes in inner-city
gang cases. ``Any time you glorify violence, it is just not a good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan employee Gary Conroy agrees the city's crime
history is a touchy topic for many. Conroy, 52, said Wednesday he
grew up in the Northeast area where elements of Kansas City's
organized crime family have long had a foothold.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the characters we're not going to name in the
narration, I grew up with,'' Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy is leaving his desk job at Metropolitan to perform as
fictional Johnny ``KC'' Holiday in a running gangster skit that
accompanies each tour. It culminates in a shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday survives. The officer, named O'Henry, doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City does have colorful history, and gangsters are
certainly a part of it,'' Levota said. But the shootout crosses the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A policeman getting shot would be something this office would
not find entertaining,'' Levota said.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute to two-hour tour will cost between $19 and $24 per
person, depending on the price of an embossed souvenir tin cup
that, George says, serves as a symbol of the bathtub-gin and
speakeasy era.
</P>
<P>
   Tour riders also will get a taste of Kansas City from before
World War II through the 1950s, as video monitors flash pictures of
historic but long-gone buildings, the Country Club Plaza under
construction and other scenes as the coach passes by those spots.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part now, said George, is finishing the research,
producing the video and pacing it to match the tour. The company
hired a local historian who is compiling information.
</P>
<P>
   Not much is final at this point, George said. But tales of
Kansas City political boss Tom Pendergast certainly will be
included.
</P>
<P>
   George said the tour should have plenty of appeal for both
tourists and Kansas Citians. ``We want people to be tourists in
their own town...to discover what's in their own back yard,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gangster Tour bus will be hard to miss on the city's
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan paid $100,000 for a custom-built 16-passenger coach
that mimics a 1930s panel truck _ typically used to transport
illicit alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   It will be chased by a restored 1940s Chevrolet Fleetline,
painted as a black-and-white police cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the city's very colorful past,'' George said,
``but just as well as how far we've come. The tour is really going
to showcase midtown and downtown.''

MINORITIES ARE LEAVING JOBS AT INCREASED RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your organization values diversity, why are they leaving?
</P>
<P>
   That headline appeared in a May-June Society for Human Resource
Management newsletter. It touched a nerve in many workplaces, where
concerted efforts to hire African-American, Latino, Asian and
American Indian workers are frustrated by rapid turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multicultural professionals are leaving their companies in
alarming numbers,'' wrote Vanessa J. Weaver, president of Alignment
Strategies Inc., a Washington consulting firm that specializes in
diversity recruitment and retention.
</P>
<P>
   Minority professionals are quitting their jobs at rates two and
three times higher than Caucasian men and women, Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies, one by the National Society for Black Engineers and
one by the Women's Center for Policy Studies, found that between
one-third and slightly more than two-thirds of multicultural
professionals were actively looking for new jobs or seriously
considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Why are they leaving?
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, money talks. Larger markets and bigger companies
often lure qualified minorities away from their current jobs. Top
multicultural talent is a scarce resource, and diversity-conscious
organizations will pay well to nab the best and brightest.
</P>
<P>
   But Weaver contends money isn't among the top reasons that
minority professionals jump ship. Mainly, she said, they leave
because they don't feel recognized as valuable resources.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said two decades worth of consulting on corporate
diversity had uncovered six reasons that talented minority
professionals leave:
</P>
<P>
   - They say their organizations talk the diversity game but don't
play it; they feel excluded from mentor-protege relationships or
peer groups.
</P>
<P>
   - They feel limited by negative race, religious, accent or
English-as-a-second-language stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   - They say their supervisors aren't comfortable dealing with
multicultural employees, or their supervisors change so often they
can't build relationships.
</P>
<P>
   - They say no one talks to them about their current and
potential roles in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   - They become dissatisfied with ``safe'' assignments that don't
challenge or develop them.
</P>
<P>
   - They tire of fighting the inference that they were hired only
because of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of those are reasons any employee leaves. Almost
every worker craves feedback and rapport; without it, work isn't as
much fun.
</P>
<P>
   As for retaining minorities, Weaver said organizations with good
minority-retention records had continuing diversity-awareness
training _ not just a one-day thing once in an employee's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it seems to me that it's important to have honest and
open communication about each individual's career potential.
Employers should be careful about setting up undeliverable
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Employers also should take periodic staff surveys to test
perceptions and realities. Feedback will tell organizations where
their diversity goals are in conflict with actual practices.

RANGERS USE TOP PICKS ON TWO YOUNG PITCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers selected two pitchers with
their two ``sandwich'' picks in Wednesday's first-year player
draft.
</P>
<P>
   If they are as talented as they are enthusiastic about who
drafted them, then the Rangers' pitching problems are over.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers used the 38th overall pick to take right-hander
Colby Lewis from Bakersfield (Calif.) College and the 47th overall
pick to select right-hander David Mead from Soddy Daisy High School
in Sale Creek, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitchers are hard throwers, although Lewis underwent elbow
ligament transplant surgery three years ago. But Rangers scouting
director Chuck McMichael said Lewis' elbow is no longer a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis is a physically strong guy,'' McMichael said. ``He's a
fastball, curveball guy who is learning a changeup. This is a guy
you give to your player-development people and say, `OK baby.' ...
The ball leaves his hand and explodes at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mead is a real lean, real lanky guy with a high leg kick and
what we call a very whippy arm. He has a chance to throw extremely
hard some day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers must first sign them, but that doesn't appear to be
a major obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who was 4-5 with a 2.86 earned-run average and 108
strikeouts in 88 innings, has signed a letter of intent to play for
Long Beach State but said he doesn't expect to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unlikely,'' Lewis said. ``I'm pretty much 100
percent set on the Rangers. I'm not worried about getting enough
money. To be a club's first pick is outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Mead, who was 2-3 with a 3.56 ERA and 61 strikeouts in 41
innings for Soddy Daisy, has a scholarship to Santa Fe Community
College in Gainesville, Fla., but said he also expects to turn
professional instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lifelong dream,'' Mead said. ``I'm still in shock.
... As long as the negotiations go well, I will sign with the
Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Through 22 rounds, the Rangers made 25 picks, including former
Irving High School standout Ernie Villegas in the 14th round and
Martin High School outfielder Kevin Marshall in the 20th round.
</P>
<P>
   Villegas, an outfielder from Northeast Texas Community College
in Mount Pleasant, was picked by the New York Yankees in the 12th
round in 1997. Marshall hit .385 with eight triples, 28 runs scored
and 23 runs batted in this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took 13 pitchers among those 25 picks, seven
outfielders, three catchers, a shortstop and a first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, the Rangers selected right-hander Nick
Regilio, a sinker/slider pitcher with an above-average changeup who
was 7-2 with a 4.58 ERA for Jacksonville University in Florida. In
the third round, the Rangers took Hank Blalock, a shortstop from
Rancho Bernardo (Calif.) High School who hit .515 with 11 homers
and 40 RBI this year. The Rangers will likely move him to third
base.
</P>
<P>
   There was one painful note for the Rangers. The Oakland
Athletics took Southern California pitcher Barry Zito with the
ninth overall pick. The Rangers drafted him in the third round last
year out of junior college but couldn't sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't acrimonious negotiations,'' McMichael said.
``They were confusing negotiations. I think the kid wanted to sign.
Whatever advice he was getting... I don't know.'' nn

OVITZ GETS COOL RECEPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Given the month of June by the NFL to present his
plans for a remodeled Coliseum to the area's multitude of agencies,
Michael Ovitz opened his rush salesmanship Wednesday with the
Coliseum Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many on the commission have been working with the rival Eli
Broad-Ed Roski Jr. group competing with Ovitz for the ownership of
the NFL's 32nd franchise, and Ovitz hardly found an audience eager
to embrace his belated Coliseum plans.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Mike Roos, while calling Ovitz's elaborate plans
``bold and daring,'' clearly was miffed he had put together his
Coliseum renovation scheme on state property without first
consulting with the commission or other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm struck by, isn't there a high potential that you have
developed a wonderful illusion that's a house of cards?'' Roos
asked. ``If you take one card out, the whole thing collapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the (Los Angeles) conservancy people say, `Your concept may
well be to emulate and model on the Coliseum in Rome, but that's
not what our purpose is.' If in fact they pull that card out, what
happens to all the reliant parts that you have built this model
upon?''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz originally wanted to build a new stadium in Carson, and
after the NFL announced the Coliseum as the Los Angeles expansion
site, had less than six weeks to design new plans for the
historical monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much like a Chinese jigsaw puzzle,'' Ovitz said.
``A bit of a Catch 22. The question is, do you go to all of the
committees first and get everyone's point of view and then design,
which we did not have the time to do? Or do you design something
that is going to catch (the NFL's) attention and get them to take
Los Angeles very seriously, when there is a deal sitting in Houston
that is actually incredibly acceptable right now? What we attempted
to do, was meet their needs first.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz first presented his ``vision'' for the Coliseum to NFL
owners last week in Atlanta. Broad also presented an update of his
plan to the owners, stressing his group had met with the proper
agencies for input, his plan was not ``pie in the sky'' and was one
that could get done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due diligence'' became a sudden catch phrase for NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue and he talked of using this month to
exercise earnest application of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Broad-Roski plans are all but complete, and there is
little left for their group to accomplish this month. But for
Ovitz, it is another opportunity to catch up at the Coliseum, and
it enhances the suspicion among many he is the favored prospective
owner of Tagliabue and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, you have a person (Ovitz) willing to go
anywhere, willing to do a design on the back of an envelope,'' Roos
said. ``Yet, tell me if I'm not hearing this right, but they seem
to be calling him. They seem to be saying, `Here is the criteria,
you solve the problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ovitz said after the commission meeting he has been in
close contact with Tagliabue since the NFL meetings in Atlanta
ended last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to (Tagliabue) on my way over here, actually,
and briefed him on what was going on,'' Ovitz said. ``He's going to
call me tonight because he wants to know what went on here and said
in the month of June he wants us to present this plan to all of the
local constituencies, and this is what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion with the Coliseum Commission focused on
parking. The Ovitz plan calls for five garages that could hold
27,000 parking spaces and cost an estimated $250 million, money he
said would have to come from outside his ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said Wednesday, however, the NFL asked for 25,000 spaces,
so he provided a method for building them around the Coliseum. He
said the garages were modular in design and fewer spaces could be
built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on looking for advice, we are looking for feedback at
this point and we are not suggesting that we build these plans as
they stand,'' Ovitz said. ``This is what we were asked to do in
order to bring football back to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Lisa Specht and Roos also quizzed Ovitz about
possibly teaming up with Broad. Roos said if Ovitz was so open to
new ideas, what about the plans Broad-Roski had already put
together with input from the area agencies?
</P>
<P>
   ``Great, that idea was presented and I assume if they (NFL
owners) wanted that idea, they would have chosen that plan and
voted on it, and that would have been that,'' Ovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz has been invited by Broad to join his group, and Ovitz
said he expects to talk to Broad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wide open to it,'' Ovitz said. ``I like Eli a lot. We've
known each other a long time. I think he has to look at what we're
doing, and we have to look at what he's doing and see if there's
some common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the projects are compatible, but surely our
desire here downtown are.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad-Roski announced they were giving up their exclusive
agreement with the Coliseum at the owners meetings, and the
Coliseum Commission officially severed the agreement
Wednesday. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MILWAUKEE _ If County Stadium can withstand the explosives the
Astros set off Wednesday night, it may take a few well-placed
missiles when the time comes to demolish the outgoing ballpark at
the end of the season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros' offense, a powder keg of frustration in recent
games, smoked the Milwaukee Brewers 9-1 in what they hope was a
breakout game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were due for one of those,'' said Astros third baseman Bill
Spiers, who drove in his first two runs since May 18.
</P>
<P>
   And Jose Lima was due for a win. After all, he was riding a
one-game losing streak, which constitutes a drought considering the
way he has pitched this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who had an eight-game winning streak snapped in his
previous outing, bounced back stronger than ever, holding the
Brewers to four hits in his second complete game of the season. It
was the fewest hits Lima has allowed in a nine-inning outing in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to brag on myself,'' Lima said. ``But I had great
stuff. I kept my slider and my changeup down, and my sinker was
working. I only made one mistake all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers scored on Dave Nilsson's homer in the fifth. Two of
their other three hits were infield singles. Lima struck out eight
batters and needed only 98 pitches to get through the 2-hour,
26-minute game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored four runs in the first and five in the fourth
in an offensive display reminiscent of their quick-strike scoring
ability of the first six weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   How welcome was Wednesday's outburst? The Astros had scored
seven runs in their previous three games combined, and their nine
hits equaled their total for the previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that sooner or later we were going to bust out,''
Spiers said. ``When you struggle for as long as we've struggled,
you usually break out in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   As many long nights as the Astros have endured at the expense of
opposing pitchers, it was about time they made short work of
someone. Cal Eldred, where have you been the past two weeks?
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, who has given up two touchdowns and a field goal in his
last two outings, may have been just what the Astros needed to get
their misguided offense back on track. The Astros scored nine runs
in 3 innings against Eldred in their most explosive offensive
showing since they beat the Dodgers 11-3 on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been scuffling for a while, and when you've got as many
talented hitters as we have, it's only a matter of time before you
turn it around,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``It doesn't
matter who's pitching against us; sooner or later we're going to
get some hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had the bases loaded when Tuesday's rain-shortened
game ended, and Wednesday they picked up where they left off,
blasting Eldred for four runs on three hits in the first inning.
Bagwell and Richard Hidalgo accounted for the scoring with a pair
of two-run homers.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hidalgo's second homer in four at-bats _ dating to Sunday
in Pittsburgh _ and his ninth of the season. Bagwell leads the
Astros with 15 home runs and 47 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros put together an even bigger inning in the fourth when
they scored five runs on three hits. Derek Bell drove in a run with
a sacrifice fly, and Carl Everett and Spiers each delivered two-run
singles.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson's blast over the right-center-field wall put the Brewers
on the scoreboard in the fifth inning. Nilsson's homer traveled 436
feet, the second-longest home run at County Stadium this season.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all the Brewers had to brag about as Lima retired 27
of the 31 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get nervous when we score a lot of runs early in
the game,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``I worry because I
think the pitcher might get too relaxed. But Lima didn't. He
pitched one heck of a game. When he's on like he was tonight, he
doesn't give the other team anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Righthander Jim Pittsley relieved Eldred in the fourth inning
and pitched 4 scoreless innings. The Astros got only one hit over
the final five innings, but Lima made sure that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot of fun to play behind,'' Bagwell said. ``He pitches
fast, and he wins. That's a good combination.''

KOSOVAR FAMILY RELIEVED TO REACH LOS ANGELES

<TEXT>
<P>
   STUDIO CITY, Calif. -- A little more than a week ago, Kosovo
Liberation Army soldier Shukri Rexha was in the war-torn Balkans
fighting for his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   With much prodding by his cousin, West Hills resident Hajrush
Vlashi, he flew with his family and sister Wednesday to Los Angeles
International Airport and to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy to be here,'' said 33-year-old Rexha, who until a
little more than a week ago was fighting the Serbs. ``I still can't
believe I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rexha and his wife, Nadire, 21; their son, 23-month-old Andi;
and his sister, Nazmije, 14, were picked up at the airport at 2:30
p.m. by Vlashi's wife, Renee. On her way home, she dropped Rexha
off at her husband's work, the Out Take Cafe in suburban Studio
City, where he works as a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   When Rexha came walking in through the back of the restaurant,
Vlashi and five of his relatives from Kosovo, who flew to Los
Angeles only days ago, were waiting at a table. Ibrahim and Meside
Vlashi and their three children rose to their feet and greeted
Rexha with smiles and hugs. He kissed their children on their
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rexha updated them about what was happening in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   From the restaurant's eclectic fare, Vlashi served him a Coke
and a lamb shank dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was his first Coke, Rexha said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have that there,'' Vlashi said. ``We have a Coke
factory over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlashi requested that Rexha's family come over a month ago and a
week ago Rexha decided to bring his family to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be with his family,'' Vlashi said. ``If it was
his choice, he'd go back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rexha does return to Kosovo, Vlashi said, he'd like to keep
his family in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 32 members of the Vlashi family have now come to the
United States. The Vlashi family came from the small village of
Hani-Elezit, where a concrete factory was the major industry. Some
were truck drivers, security guards or supervisors. Others were
skilled craftsmen and professional musicians. The women were
housewives. Before all the wars started in Yugoslavia, Rexha served
his required year in the Yugoslav Army, where he was in the
military police. He's also a professional musician who plays
accordion and the keyboards. He spent several months in Switzerland
playing in a band in Albanian restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Since their arrival about two weeks ago, they have met with
vocational counselors, searched for houses and have began the
process of getting adjusted to life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After eating at the restaurant Wednesday, Vlashi and Rexha drove
to Vlashi's home in West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very, very glad to be here,'' said Renee Vlashi. ``In
the car, (Rexha) was going, `I'm here in Los Angeles,' pointing to
things. I think he's planning on staying here with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Renee said Rexha brought his family to the United States for the
same reason many other refugees have come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very bad over there,'' she said. ``We have
relatives calling almost every day wanting to come over.''
</P>
<P>
   She estimates her husband has about 200 more relatives either in
Kosovo or Macedonia. About 15 more hope to come to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really, really need money,'' Renee Vlashi said. ``(The
donations) have been slow.''

INDIANS OUTLAST YANKEES, 10-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One pitcher was afraid to hit anybody, the other
pitcher seemed scared to throw the ball over the plate, and the
plate umpire was philosophically opposed to calling strikes. What
resulted at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night merits a place in
posterity only because it serves as a stiff reminder that truly bad
baseball is possible at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Cleveland Indians combined for 147 pitches, 16
runs, 15 hits, 3 errors and 5 visits to the mound in 92 minutes.
And then they started the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Once Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove yanked his starting
pitcher, Jaret Wright, the reliever Steve Karsay restored some
order and the Indians survived the Yankees, 10-7, to take the third
and decisive game in the three-game series. The Yankees will be off
on Thursdayy, before beginning a three-game series with the Mets on
Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hope that the leadoff hitter Chuck Knoblauch will be
able to play. Knoblauch left Wednesday night's game in the fifth
inning, after Wright hit him in the ribs with a 94-mile-an-hour
fastball. Knoblauch said afterward that he expected to play. But
the Yankees aren't so sure about the reliever Jeff Nelson, who has
a stiff elbow and who may be headed to the disabled list again.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians are the American League's superpowers,
probably destined to play meaningful games sometime in the fall,
and for the first time, there is some uneasiness between the two
clubs. Three batters got hit Tuesday, Knoblauch was nailed on
Wednesday night, leaving Knoblauch and his teammates to wonder
whether Wright had hit him on purpose. ``You never know what some
people are thinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright and Andy Pettitte, the Yankees' starting pitcher,
threw so badly that it would be hard to imagine they could control
anything, let alone a beanball, in a game that disintegrated
quickly. With runners at first and third and one out in the top of
the first inning, Manny Ramirez hit a line drive to right, where
Paul O'Neill charged in, reached down with his glove, set his body
to throw home _ and flat missed the ball in the evening shadows. As
it rolled to the wall in right field, O'Neill in ragged pursuit,
both runners scored and Ramirez rambled into third base.
</P>
<P>
   The error came at the worst time, for Pettitte again was a
reluctant combatant; to Yankees Manager Joe Torre, Pettitte
appeared as if he were throwing stiffly, trying to guide the ball
over the plate. ``He kept getting behind in the count,'' Torre
said. ``And when you get behind, it's suicide against this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said: ``I felt mechanical _ I started trying to do too
much out there. I was scuffling. I just stunk tonight. There's no
excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neill's three-base error, Pettitte walked Jim Thome and
then Travis Fryman dumped a run-scoring double into right-center.
Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, walked slowly to the
mound and Pettitte's Adam's apple bobbed deeply. Pettitte walked
the No. 8 batter Einar Diaz before finally extricating himself from
the inning, having allowed four runs on 28 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Wright, however, Pettitte had all the presence of a
general. Eleven days ago, Wright plugged Detroit's Tony Clark in
the helmet with a fastball, prompting American League President
Gene Budig to schedule a face-to-face meeting with Wright. Probably
unsure whether he might be suspended, given detention or forced to
write ``I will not bean anybody'' 100 times, Wright surrendered
eight runs against Boston last Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wright met with Budig Tuesday and, according to Hargrove,
exchanged some good ideas. Budig apparently had little to offer in
the way of pitching advice, however, because Wright was a mess
against the Yanks. After throwing a fastball high and tight to
Knoblauch in the first, the 36,955 fans at Yankee Stadium booed
him. Young and stubborn, Wright brushed off the effects of the
jeering later, but the fact remains that after the fans noisily
reminded him that he was on unspoken, double-secret probation for
hitting too many batters, he fell apart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter singled. O'Neill doubled. Bernie Williams doubled.
Tino Martinez walked. With one out, Scott Brosius singled, and just
like that, the Yankees led, 5-4. O'Neill slammed a two-run home run
in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte was hardly in the frame of mind to protect a lead.
He got away with two walks in the second inning. (Neither Pettitte
nor Wright was helped by the fact that the home-plate umpire, Tim
Tschida, called a consistently miniature strike zone.) But Pettitte
allowed a two-run double to Omar Vizquel and a run-scoring single
to Alomar and the score was tied. The screams for Torre to take
action grew louder, and when Torre went to the mound to make a
change, Pettitte was booed, as if his name were Irabu or something.
Little more than half of his 72 pitches were thrown for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Ramiro Mendoza took over, the Indians went on to
add two more runs in that inning, one scoring after an error by
Martinez, who may have been lulled into a daze by the incredibly
slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   Wright continued to get in trouble and Karsay took over in the
fourth, giving up just one hit in three and two-thirds innings and
adding some sanity to the otherwise brutal game. When it was over,
the Yankees' designated hitter, Chili Davis _ who had struck out to
end the contest _ showed pictures to reporters documenting how
Tschida had blown a strike call in the final at-bat, a strange end
to a strange game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty from either side,'' Hargrove said.

CHARISMATIC DRAWING CROWD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Charismatic might be running for the Triple Crown
on Saturday, but his competition isn't running away.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve 3-year-olds were entered Wednesday for the 11/2-mile
Belmont Stakes, in which Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner
Charismatic will bid to become the first horse since 1978 to sweep
the grueling three-race series.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 26 horses that have gone into the Belmont with a chance
to win a Triple Crown, only one faced a larger field. Thirteen
started when Canonero II finished fourth in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring them on, bring them all on,'' said Bob Lewis, the
Newport Beach, Calif., beer distributor who owns the colt with his
wife, Beverly.
</P>
<P>
   At least Charismatic has finally won the oddsmakers over.
</P>
<P>
   After being 15-1 on the program line for the Kentucky Derby and
dismissed at 6-1 for the Preakness, he was made the 2-1 early
favorite for the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins the Belmont, Charismatic will become the first horse
to earn the $5 million VISA Triple Crown Challenge bonus. Aside
from that, the Belmont is a $1 million race, with $600,000 going to
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, second to Charismatic in the first two legs, is next at
7-2 in the program line. Once-beaten Silverbulletday is 4-1, even
though she is running against males for the first time. No filly
has won the Belmont since Tanya in 1905.
</P>
<P>
   ``The filly will add a great deal of spice,'' Charismatic
trainer D. Wayne Lukas conceded. ``Half the world is women. She'll
have a built-in rooting section.''
</P>
<P>
   Others entered Wednesday were Best of Luck (6-1), Stephen Got
Even (10-1), Vision and Verse, Lemon Drop Kid, Patience Game and
Adonis (each 20-1); Pineaff and Prime Directive (30-1) and
Teletable (99-1).
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic got post No. 4 in the traditional-style draw in
which the positions are assigned at random and owners and trainers
have no choice. Menifee will start from No. 10 and Silverbulletday
drew No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 11/2-mile distance, Belmont Park's sweeping turns
and the slightly shorter field, post positions in the Belmont
Stakes don't mean as much as the first two legs of the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic and Silverbulletday arrived at Belmont Park at about
10:45 a.m. Wednesday on a flight from Louisville, Ky., that was
delayed 90 minutes because of stormy weather. MENIFEE PUTS IN FAST
WORKOUT
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic and Silverbulletday got most of the attention
Tuesday with their Churchill Downs workouts, but Menifee had a good
one of his own, too.
</P>
<P>
   At Belmont Park, Menifee zipped five furlongs in 59 seconds and
galloped out six furlongs in 1:112/5 _ the identical clockings as
Silverbulletday got in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually a little faster than I wanted,'' trainer
Elliott Walden said. ``But he went easy. He's a talented horse, and
he's doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden had Menifee flown from Kentucky to Belmont earlier than
his rivals to familiarize him with the deeper and sandier surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he handles this racetrack pretty well,'' Walden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walden used similar tactics last year with Victory Gallop, also
second in the Derby and Preakness. That colt won the Belmont to
spoil Real Quiet's Triple Crown bid. BITING THE HAND THAT...
</P>
<P>
   After the Preakness victory two weeks ago, Lukas commented that
Charismatic was feeling cockier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even bit Bob Lewis,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Charismatic gave his owner more than just a
playful nip. Perhaps as a payback for twice running him in a
claiming race, he took a hunk out of Lewis' hand, and 10 stitches
were needed to close the wound.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a World War II sergeant, laughed off the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just keeping my hands to myself from now on,'' he said.

BIG 12 LOOKS FOR SOLUTION TO KANSAS STATE BOWL PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 12 MEETINGS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ There is no simple solution for the
``Kansas State Problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 Conference's spring meetings Wednesday focused on how
to avoid a repeat of last season's bowl problem. When Kansas State
lost in the Big 12 championship game, the Wildcats went from
playing for the national championship to free-falling to the Alamo
Bowl, fourth on the league's bowl pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   The conundrum: Conference championship games aren't played until
the first Saturday in December. Waiting until those games are
played to make bowl picks allows little time for travel plans and
selling tickets. Making deals ahead of the championship games
creates problems illustrated by the Kansas State situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a personal opinion, but I'd like to see some way that
we protect the runner-up or the loser of the championship game,''
Big 12 commissioner Kevin Weiberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tradeoff involved,'' said Nebraska's Bill Byrne,
chairman of the Big 12 athletic directors. ``We want to be flexible
for the bowls to allow them to sell tickets, but we need to and
want to honor the results of the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``And several athletic directors are concerned about going to a
bowl game where you're obligated to sell tickets but it's a game
your fans are not excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 hopes to come up with some potential solutions to
present to their bowl partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in their hands now,'' said Rick Baker, executive director
of the Cotton Bowl, which matches the first Big 12 team not
selected by the Bowl Championship Series against a Southeastern
Conference team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kicked around a lot of things, but it's back in their court
now,'' said John Reid, executive director of the Holiday Bowl. The
Holiday gets the third choice of Big 12 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Baker requested that if the Big 12 has any suggestions or
solutions, to put them in writing. The Cotton Bowl's officers are
meeting July 1 and Baker would like to be able to consider any Big
12 proposals then.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is for the Cotton Bowl to select its Big 12 team
based on the Bowl Championship Series ranking. Another is to add a
won-loss differential. For example, the Cotton Bowl couldn't select
an 8-3 team over a team with just won loss.
</P>
<P>
   However, either proposal would require changing the contract
between the Cotton and the Big 12. FOOTBALL SCHEDULES
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 released conference football schedules for the 2000
through 2003 seasons. The schedules are subject to changes dictated
by television.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State professor Tim VanVoorhis wrote a computer program to
come up with the schedules. He was given parameters such as
Texas-Oklahoma in early October, Colorado-Nebraska and Texas-Texas
A&AMP;M at the end of the season, teams end seasons with one home and
one road game and teams play no more than two consecutive road
games.
</P>
<P>
   VanVoorhis came up with 400 possible schedules; assistant
commissioner Tim Allen narrowed those down to four for the athletic
directors to examine.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State have been given permission to
move their annual ``Bedlam Game'' to Thanksgiving weekend. This
year, the Sooners and the Cowboys are scheduled to play Nov. 27. TV
GAMES
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 announced eight football games this year have been
selected for telecasts. The schedule:
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 4 _ Stanford at Texas and Nebraska at Iowa, 11 a.m. ABC
regional telecast; Alabama-Birmingham at Missouri, 2:30 p.m., Fox
Syndication; Colorado State-Colorado, time to be determined, Fox
Sports; Sept. 11 _ California at Nebraska, 2:30 p.m., ABC regional;
Tulsa at Oklahoma State, 11:30 a.m., Fox Syndication; Iowa at Iowa
State, 6 p.m., Fox Sports; Sept. 18 _ Kansas at Colorado, 2:30
p.m., ABC regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor at Oklahoma game Sept. 18 could be announced Thursday
as a Fox Syndication telecast. nn

REDS NIP METS, 8-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Franco knew he was not going to go the whole
season without blowing a save. It was the timing of his first one
on Wednesday night that shook both he and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   One out away from a desperately needed victory, the Mets
suffered their most devastating defeat of the season on Wednesday
night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Franco came on in the ninth inning to protect a 7-6 lead but he
blew his first save in 15 chances when Mike Cameron hit
bases-loaded single to give the Cincinnati Reds a come-from-behind
8-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who have lost a season-high six consecutive games, now
travel to the Bronx on Friday to open a weekend series with the
Yankees after going oh-for their homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later it was going to happen,'' said a disconsolate
Franco, whose critics have long lambasted him for the critically
bad timing of his blown saves. ``I wish it would have been later
than today.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco was not the only one. He was one pitch away from a
victory that would have sent the Mets to Yankee Stadium, Friday
night, on a rare good note. But the 38-year-old left hander did not
record the third out of the ninth until it was way too late.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Mets, who dropped to 27-26, have lost 17 of 27 games
since running off a season-high six straight wins. With Wednesday
night's loss, the Mets dropped into third place in the National
League East, percentage points behind the Philadelphia Phillies.
The last time they were only one game over .500 was April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Mets lost six consecutive games was early last
season. The last time they dropped six straight games at Shea
Stadium was 1994. The last time they were swept in two consecutive
three-game series was 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Most astonishing of all: The last _ and only _ time the Mets
were swept in two consecutive three-game series at home, as they
were over the last six days? Try Aug., 1962, at the Polo Grounds,
in the first season of the franchise's existence. Shea had not even
been built. The Mets lost 120 games that year.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, these Mets need a victory badly. As Manager Bobby
Valentine said when asked how much longer his team could wait
before they win again, ``I'd have liked it to happen yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mets are staring at three games against the
defending World Champions after what Valentine described as a
much-needed day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it will kick start us a little bit,'' Franco said of
this weekend's series with the Yankees, in which the Mets will
decidedly be the underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's going to be a jolt there and hopefully it
does us some good,'' said Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Both Franco and Ventura, along with Mike Piazza and Dennis Cook,
had spoken during a players' only team meeting after Tuesday's
loss.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if to do something to take his mind off the Mets'
current struggles, Franco had grabbed a garden shovel and a few
packets of vegetable seeds from his locker stall on Wednesday
afternoon and headed for the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else to do out there lately,'' the erstwhile
gardener _ and full-time closer _ said, referring to the slide the
Mets took into Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Franco had his hands full at Shea Stadium a
few hours later, but not of earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had rallied from three runs down in the bottom of the
seventh for a 7-6 lead. And Franco was soon one out away from his
15th save.
</P>
<P>
   But he walked Greg Vaughn on a 3-1 pitch with two out and Barry
Larkin followed with a crucial infield single to move Vaughn to
second. The ball might have been an easy grounder for Ventura at
third had he not been playing on the line to prevent extra bases
with the tying run at first. Instead, Luis Lopez, the shortstop,
had to dive at the ball just to keep it from going into left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made a lousy decision,'' Valentine said, attempting to
take some of the blame. After Franco fell behind Dmitri Young, 3-0,
the runners executed a double steal on a 3-1 pitch. Young the
walked on a full count to load the bases. And then, after falling
behind 0-2, Cameron _ who had entered the game 0 for his last 24 _
worked the count to 2-2 before lining a fastball that Franco left
over the plate up the middle for the game-winning single.
</P>
<P>
   As Larkin came around with the go-ahead run, a softball whizzed
by Franco, who was busy watching the two runs score. On a night
that the Mets had somehow bailed out Jason Isringhausen before
losing in stunning fashion, one unruly fan was apparently letting
the Mets know just how he felt.

<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ If it's Wednesday, this must be Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a hectic cycle of racing and travel that began even
before his Kentucky Derby and Preakness victories, Charismatic
stepped off a horse van at trainer outside D. Wayne Lukas' Belmont
Park barn late on a muggy morning.
</P>
<P>
   The van ride followed a flight delayed more than an hour by a
lightning storm in Louisville, Ky., the first thing that's slowed
him down all spring.
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived, 11 other 3-year-olds were being entered in
Saturday's Belmont Stakes, the large field a tangible sign that
Charismatic is not held in the awe of the 11 Triple Crown winners,
the group he's trying to join.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, Charismatic might not be a great thoroughbred, a
Citation or a Secretariat or an Affirmed. But in one important
respect, he is a horse the old-timers should appreciate, a
throwback to the sport's gilded age.
</P>
<P>
   In the 43 days that began with the April 3 Santa Anita Derby, he
has raced four times, taking no longer than 15 days between races.
To him the 21 days between the Preakness and Belmont must feel like
a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   For the six races from the March 6 El Camino Real Derby at Bay
Meadows in the San Francisco Bay Area to the Belmont, he will have
visited six racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   He has already raced nine times in 1999 _ more than the average
'90s Kentucky Derby winner raced in his entire 3-year-old season.
And whereas most modern racehorses would wilt, Charismatic has
appeared to thrive, improving from a Santa Anita Derby also-ran to
a potential immortal since his campaign heated up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gives Charismatic a chance to complete the Triple
Crown that his overall ability wouldn't otherwise suggest,'' said
Steve Davidowitz, author of the handicapping textbook ``Betting
Thoroughbreds.''
</P>
<P>
   In decades past, horses routinely raced this often. Citation,
the 1948 Triple Crown winner, won the Jersey Stakes !ital!in
between!off! the Preakness and Belmont, which completed a string of
seven races in 52 days.
</P>
<P>
   But racing was different in those days: Tracks were powdery.
Competition was less evenly matched. Thoroughbreds were a hardier
lot, the breed not yet dragged down by widespread use of Lasix and
other medications, and by breeders' recent obsession with speed.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, stakes purses are high enough that top horses
don't have to race more than once a month to pay the owners' bills.
</P>
<P>
   But after late-blooming Charismatic ran fourth in the Santa
Anita Derby, he had to win the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland two
weeks later to earn a place in the Churchill Downs starting gate.
So began the every-two-weeks schedule, with hard workouts between
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's working, why back off?'' said Richard Mandella, one of
California's leading trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic can stand it because he's a big, muscular horse. In
fact, without a heavy schedule, as Lukas found out, the colt plain
gets fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as wide as he is tall,'' said Elliott Walden (he was
exaggerating), who trains Belmont challenger Menifee. ``A
lighter-framed horse couldn't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who has never been accused of babying his horses, said
the heavy seasoning and ``bounce-back ability'' is an advantage for
Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to win the Derby, at some point you have to test
them, hold their feet to the fire,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   But could Charismatic's strength prove his weakness Saturday?
What if the workload catches up with him during the 1{-mile
Belmont?
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point it's got to catch up with him. Whether that'll
be Saturday or not, I'm not prepared to say,'' Walden said.
``(These) horses are dealing with a lot of stress. We're all hoping
our horse has got one more good one in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Can a handicapper know before the race?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw him in the post parade for the Preakness, he looked
like an absolute bull,'' Davidowitz said. ``Unfortunately for those
who have to make predictions the day before the Belmont,
(Charismatic's physical condition) will probably be most apparent
in the post parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's got some bounce in his step, an arch in his neck,
beautiful color and rippling muscles, then he feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   And all that work might pay off in a Triple Crown.

TCU SPRINT RELAY MISSES FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ A season of hope and disappointment ended because
of a hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's 4x100-meter relay team, which began the outdoor season
dreaming of setting records and fought through a series of injuries
to get to the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, was
stopped Wednesday by Jarmiene Holloway's sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who ran the second leg for the Horned Frogs, severely
twisted his ankle just before the race, stepping in a divot in
Bronco Stadium's hammer-throw area, which is being used as a warmup
area during the NCAA meet. He ran in the 4x100 preliminary heat
anyway, but was noticeably slower, which also threw off the timing
of the Frogs' baton exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a shockingly slow time of 40.19 seconds, far off
TCU's season best of 38.64 and last among the nine teams that
finished the event's two heats. The top eight teams of the 12
entered qualified for Friday's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went wrong,'' said a distraught Ricardo ``Flash''
Williams, who ran the anchor leg. ``Everything. I don't know what
to say. By the time I got the baton, I was too far back. I ran OK,
but I was just too far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   For Holloway, a senior, the injury not only cost him a chance to
defend the Frogs' 1998 national relay title _ he was a member of
the team that ran a collegiate record 38.04 at last year's NCAA
meet _ it may also cost him a shot at the 100-meter crown. TCU
coach Monte Stratton said Holloway, last year's NCAA runner-up in
that event, is doubtful for tonight's 100 meter preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad day,'' Holloway said. ``I'm going to get treatment
and rest and hope I can be ready for the 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway wasn't the only one who had a bad day in the relay.
Texas' Eric Frempong and Nathanael Esprit botched the final handoff
and wound up disqualified for running out of the exchange zone.
North Texas dropped the baton and was also disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' women, on the other hand, were their usual overpowering
selves in the 4x100, posting the day's fastest qualifying time of
42.90. In addition, the Longhorns got a huge break when archrival
Louisiana State, expected to challenge Texas for the women's team
title, was knocked out of the running by a dropped baton as leadoff
runner Joyce Bates tried to hand off to Chenelle Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it, but it just brushed past my hand,'' Marshall said.
``This really hurts, and we can't get it back, but we've got to
realize that we can still win this meet.''
</P>
<P>
   That thought was not lost on the Longhorns, who were not about
to break into backflips over LSU's misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't help them, but they've got a lot more people here
to score points for them,'' Texas' Nanceen Perry said. ``This
doesn't take them out of nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but Perry did her part for the Longhorns'
championship effort with a strong relay leg and a blazing 200
meters. The senior ran a school-record 22.55 to lead three Texas
runners into Friday's semifinals. Texas also qualified Tanya
Jarrett and Angel Patterson for the 400-meter hurdles final and Liz
Diaz for the 800 final.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas prepared for its usual assault in the running events,
SMU's women grabbed a share of the first-day lead with Florence
Ezeh's victory in the hammer throw. Her best mark of 207 feet, 2
inches in the early afternoon rain outdistanced the 206-5 of South
Carolina's Michelle Fournier. The 10 points tied SMU with Kansas
State and Pittsburgh for first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I wanted to be good, rather than just saying maybe I
can be good,'' said Ezeh, a sophomore who failed to make the final
at last year's NCAA meet. ``Now I say I want to be good, and that
has made me change.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford took the men's lead with a 1-2-3 finish in the 10,000
meters for 24 points ahead of Auburn with 13 and SMU with 10,
thanks mostly to Janus Robberts' second-place finish in the discus.
</P>
<P>
   With the relay team out and Holloway hobbling, TCU's hopes for a
high team finish are gone. The only healthy Frogs sprinter left
running is Bryan Howard, who moved on to the 200 semifinals on a
day in which temperatures in the 40s slowed the times considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's 20.77 was second in his heat to local favorite Corey
Nelson of Boise State but beat that of his nemesis, defending NCAA
100 champion Leonard Myles-Mills of Brigham Young. Myles-Mills was
third in 20.93.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over and said, `Man, not him again,' '' said Howard,
who was second to Myles-Mills in the 100 and 200 at the Western
Athletic Conference meet. ``It was nice to beat him, but he'll be
ready to roll when it counts.'' nn

REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE Y2K COMPLIANCE ON SHIPS ENTERING PUGET
SOUND PORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Commercial vessels entering the Strait of Juan de Fuca
and Puget Sound will have to prove their on-board computers won't
pose a safety hazard when the new year clicks over to 2000 under
new Coast Guard procedures expected to be put into effect later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Vessels from big cargo haulers to commercial fishing boats will
have to respond to a series of questions about ``equipment critical
to the operational safety of the vessel,'' said Capt. John
Veentjer, chief of the Marine Safety Division for the Coast Guard's
13th District, which includes such major ports as Seattle, Tacoma
and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about so-called ``Y2K'' problems will be included
with those asked when vessels routinely provide their 24-hour
advanced notice of intent to enter a port, Veentjer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will also ask if the company owning the vessel has a
documented Y2K policy in place, yes or no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also will ask information about navigation,
steering, propulsion and power generation systems and cargo
handling equipment and other safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will ask if they had inventory checks for the ship to
identify and categorize potential non-compliant equipment,''
Veentjer said.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of critical on-board systems could result in container
ships, some weighing as much as 50,000 to 75,000 deadweight tons
and carrying as many as 5,000 shipping container units, rampaging
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of computerized cargo handling equipment could result in
hazardous material being spilled.
</P>
<P>
   Veentjer and other officials are meeting on Thursday with
Canadian coast guard representatives at Coast Guard facilities at
the Port of Seattle to hash out wording on the requirements, which
will be published in the Federal Register and on the Coast Guard's
Internet site when ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the same procedures in place for vessels that enter
the Strait of Juan de Fuca regardless of whether they are going to
turn left and head to Vancouver, B.C., or turn starboard and head
to the Port of Seattle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The extended requirements will be in effect for 24 hours before
and 24 hours after Sept. 9, 1999, Jan. 1, 2000, and Feb. 29, 2000,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The September date is included because old computer programs
might read the abbreviation ``9/9/99'' as a code to shut down. The
Feb. 29 ``Leap Year Day'' might not be included in some programs.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on what to do with vessels that might pose risks to
navigation or the environment because computers on-board or ashore
fail will be left to the captain of the port.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Mike Moore, currently executive officer to
Capt. Miles Booth, captain of the port in Seattle, will succeed
Booth on June 28 and is now heading local efforts at bringing
vessels here into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be ready in advance as much as possible and to
minimize the number of vessels we know little about showing up just
before midnight on Dec. 31 and expecting to enter a port here,''
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Most container ships entering the Port of Seattle and Port of
Tacoma are liners owned by steamship companies that regularly bring
the same vessels into Puget Sound, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have information on those vessels in hand ahead of
time, so that we will know in advance if they have been checked out
as much as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While questions about Y2K compliance will be globally imposed at
ports throughout the United States, providing consistency for
shipping lines, each of the 40 or so captains of the port will have
authority to make judgments because each port has different
currents, weather and other local conditions to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tug availability is another factor that varies from port to
port and a captain of the port might require a vessel to have a tug
escort, depending on his evaluation of the vessels response to the
questions,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could ask a vessel to remain at sea or merely not to use
autopilot as it enters our navigable waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some steamship operators and their associations independently
are taking precautions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petroleum tanker industry, for example, has decided all of
its vessels will be at sea or tied up at dock at the critical
dates,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are at dock, they are not going to transfer oil until
they are sure they don't have unexpected computer problems. We
didn't go to them with this. They just came to us and said, `That's
just how we're going to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard's own Vessel Traffic Service, which operates
radar and video systems on its shipping lanes much like the air
traffic control systems oversee plane traffic, is bringing its
systems into Y2K compliance and will have backup systems in place.
Rescue boats also are being checked.

HUNDLEY HURT AS DODGERS LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Losing the series to the Pittsburgh Pirates was bad
enough, but the Dodgers added an exclamation point by getting swept
in a three-game series for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   They lost 8-4 in lethargic fashion Wednesday at Three Rivers
Stadium to fall to 26-26 and end their one-time promising road trip
at 4-5. And they stagger into today's off-day trailing the Arizona
Diamondbacks by five games.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and it gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley will have his left wrist X-rayed today
after he injured it in a third-inning collision at home plate with
Ed Sprague. The initial diagnosis is a sprain that will keep
Hundley out of the lineup at least for the Anaheim series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done it (broken the wrist) twice, and I'll know when I
wake up (today) what's going on,'' said Hundley, who left the game
after grounding out in the sixth. ``I didn't feel it pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was examined after the game by Pittsburgh Steelers team
physician Dr. Jim Bradley, who diagnosed it as a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Still, excuse Hundley for his extreme concern. The pain is at
the base of his left thumb, on the outside of his hand. He said
it's the same place he broke it in 1992 and again in 1995 when he
and Dodgers second baseman Eric Young, then a member of the
Colorado Rockies, collided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said the symptoms are more of a bone bruise than a
broken bone, and I'm hopin' and prayin' he's right,'' Hundley said.
``When I grabbed the bat, I was sick. That's why I wanted to keep
in the game. This could be my last game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hundley had trouble throwing out runners, and
despite hitting .228 and going 2 for 26 on the road trip, a
long-term injury would be jolting to the Dodgers. It means L.A.
will have rookie Angel Pena catching and Paul LoDuca, who's at
Triple-A Albuquerque, as the backup unless they search the trade
waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the best-case scenario, manager Davey Johnson said Hundley
would likely miss the Angels series and possibly the three games
against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While Hundley hasn't provided the production the Dodgers hoped
for, the switch-hitter has provided protection and a necessary
break in a righty-dominated lineup. And with Todd Hollandsworth
slated for the disabled list Friday, it leaves switch-hitting
center fielder Devon White as the only possible lefty bat among the
starters.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries bring to light just how barren the minor-league
system is, and how little it can help during these crucial times.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things (needed) is depth, and you knew that was
lacking going in,'' Johnson said. ``When a couple of guys go down,
it kind of exposes you. It's tough when you have guys on the bench
and it's a right-handed (hitter) against a right-handed (pitcher).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you rest somebody, you try to create matchups off the
bench. I'm not sure an all right-handed lineup can consistently
beat a right-handed pitcher. We got it, but Holly's hurt, (Jose)
Vizcaino's been hurt. Those are things we need to perk up a lineup.
Not a big thing, but we have to tighten it up until the guys get
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Hundley overshadowed the hurt the Pirates put on
the Dodgers. Darren Dreifort (5-4) yielded seven runs on nine hits
(two homers) while Pittsburgh's Todd Ritchie (5-3) allowed four
runs in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The three-game losing streak matches the Dodgers' longest of the
season. They haven't won three straight since winning five in a row
April 27 through May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time it looks like we're going to get over the hump, we
stumble,'' Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw said. ``You have to win three,
four, five in a row so when you stumble it doesn't look bad. It
will come. You have to trust that it will.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ Today, the circle is unbroken. Ten years after their first
meeting in a French Open semifinal, the two fading _ but fighting
still _ divas of women's tennis reprise a historic match that
should have launched an epic rivalry, perhaps even one the equal of
Navratilova vs. Evert.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf, already ensconced at No. 1 after her Golden Slam
year of 1988, needed three sets to rid herself of the gawky,
grunting 15-year-old who had won her first professional title
barely a month earlier in Houston. Steffi was way ahead of Monica
Seles in terms of experience and sophistication, but you could see
Monica's potential straightaway. Those explosive, brutally
efficient, if stylishly deficient, two-fisted groundstrokes of hers
would not be denied for long by anybody, Graf included.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi saw it coming. She knew she had met, in Seles, an all too
worthy adversary.
</P>
<P>
   They would play nine more times through the 1993 Australian
Open, where Seles won in three sets to claim the title. Eight of
the matches would be finals, including two French Open wars that
went Seles' way _ the latter 10-8 in the third _ plus a Wimbledon
rout by Graf. Only on grass had Steffi kept Monica's number.
Overall, their head-to-head stood Graf 6, Seles 4. But Monica was
the new No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And then she was stabbed, an insane and tragic event that
changed, and ruined, everything.
</P>
<P>
   A German maniac who worshipped Graf stuck a knife in Seles' back
in April '93, and Monica hasn't won much of anything that mattered
since. Hiding from the demons, she was totally off the tour for
almost 2{ years in the prime of her career, while Graf cleaned up.
Since Seles' return at the '95 U.S. Open, she has beaten Graf just
once in four tries, in the Australian Open quarters last January.
</P>
<P>
   Of Steffi's 21 Grand Slam titles, six were claimed during
Monica's exile, as was a significant chunk of her record $21
million in earnings. Seles' corresponding numbers are nine majors
won and $11.2 million banked. Overall, the series stands Graf 9,
Seles 5. By comparison, Evert and Navratilova faced off on more
than 70 mostly memorable occasions.
</P>
<P>
   And consider this oddity: Today's pairing is the first to pit
Steffi and Monica in any semi since that first one here.
</P>
<P>
   Had the normal course of events not been criminally altered,
however, the parity between the two women's records might be
striking. Who can say? It's a pity, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   A greater shame might be how, unlike Chrissie and Martina, Graf
and Seles have never bonded despite the many ties that should bind
them. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hard one for me to answer, just too hard,'' Monica
has said. ``Steffi and I shared one emotional moment when she came
to the hospital to see me after I was stabbed, but that's been it.
There has been no communication between the two of us. We have no
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, Graf probably deserves most of the blame. She has
always been a loner. Just as she snubs the next generation's
phenoms now, she paid little heed to Evert, Navratilova and Billie
Jean King before her. They believe Graf's aloofness, fostered by an
overbearing father who taught Steffi to see the whole world as an
adversary, actually did damage to the game during her decade-long
reign.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, although a tad ditzy, was a charming woman-child before
the stabbing, as gregarious with fans and sponsors as Graf was
remote. Monica would have been the superior leading-light
ambassador by far.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps, in a final accounting, the better player. We'll
never know, because the likely few matches of import left between
them won't answer any questions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Graf, at 29, is as strong and healthy as she has been
since recovering from the reconstructive surgery on her knee that
cost her a year of competition, she's hardly the Steamroller Steffi
we remember. She doesn't have a tournament title yet in '99 and
admits to succumbing to a bad case of the shakes in the defeat by
Seles in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely lost concentration,'' she said. ``I was extremely
nervous, and I didn't have an explanation for it. Rarely has
anything like that happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Seles, despite a current 11-match winning streak, she has
surrendered much of her bite as well. Their day is about done.
Either would be a decided underdog against No. 1-ranked Martina
Hingis, assuming she beats Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, in the Saturday
final.
</P>
<P>
   While this French hurrah may not be their last, it's close. The
resurgent teen terror Hingis has already eclipsed both Graf and
Seles, while the other kids, led by the Williams sisters, are
closing fast.
</P>
<P>
   Observes Hingis, speaking with the intemperance of youth but
truthfully nonetheless: ``Steffi has had some results in the past,
but it's a faster, more athletic game now than when she was (on
top). Her time has passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica's time, regrettably, never fully came. It should have,
but it didn't.

VAUGHN MAKES THE TWINS PAY

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ It was either the ultimate show of respect for Garret
Anderson or just plain stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the decision by Minnesota Twins pitcher Brad Radke
to pitch to Mo Vaughn with first base open and the potential
winning run on third base in the eighth inning was the difference
as the Angels beat the Twins 2-1 on Wednesday night in front of
17,766 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Radke and Angels starter Chuck Finley had been locked in a 1-1
game going into the eighth, and it was Radke who gave in. Darin
Erstad doubled to lead off the eighth, then went to third on Randy
Velarde's sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Vaughn, who was 0 for 3 against Radke in the
game but entered the contest with a .414 lifetime average against
him. Instead of walking Vaughn intentionally and pitching to
Anderson, who had homered earlier in the game, Radke went after
Vaughn and paid for it. He singled past a diving second baseman
Brent Gates, who was playing in on the infield grass, scoring
Erstad for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Finley gave way to closer Troy Percival to start the ninth, and
Percival earned his 15th save. Finley (4-5) gave up one run and
five hits in eight innings. He struck out five, giving him 2,016 in
his career to move into 49th place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Finley began the game by retiring the first eight batters he
faced. Doug Mientkiewicz broke the string with a two-out single in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, it wasn't unlike Finley's previous start last
Friday, when he struck out seven consecutive Royals during one
stretch only to see the game blow up in his face. Finley was out of
that game in the fifth after giving up eight runs and seven hits in
four-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to say (why that happened),'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``You go back and watch the film and say `Gosh, all
of a sudden...' Normally, Chuck is one of those guys that when he
has trouble he has the knack to get out of it. Well, not a knack.
He !ital!knows &UR; !off! &LR;  how to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, though, didn't fall apart Wednesday. He didn't allow a
Twins baserunner to get into scoring position until there were two
out in the fifth. That's when Chad Allen singled, then scored on a
double by Mientkiewicz for a 1-0 Twins lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Radke (4-5) was tough on Angels hitters, which is
nothing new. He went into the game with a record of 7-1 and a 1.57
ERA against Anaheim in his career. He was 3-0 with a 1.65 ERA last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The only Angel to get a hit off Radke in the first 32/3 innings
was Erstad, who had two _ a ground-ball single to right in the
first and a line-drive single to left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Decker, starting at first base for the fourth time this
season, singled to right with two out in the fourth, then went to
third on a double to right by Troy Glaus. Decker and Glaus were
stranded when Matt Walbeck grounded to second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finally got on the scoreboard in the sixth on
Anderson's homer, his 12th of the season, on a 3-1 pitch.

U.S., CANADA REACH AGREEMENT ON FAR-REACHING SALMON TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A sweeping U.S.-Canadian agreement for management and
conservation of West Coast salmon runs will be unveiled Thursday,
sources in both countries confirmed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress votes the money to support it, the accord would end
a prolonged and at times confrontational dispute over fish that
return from the north Pacific to spawn in rivers of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year agreement is to be announced in Vancouver by
Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson and in Seattle by Gov.
Gary Locke. Locke reportedly will be accompanied by former White
House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, named last month by President Clinton
to oversee negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really good news for the salmon,'' Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash., said late Wednesday. ``It will be a very long-term
agreement, which is great since we won't have to go back through
all this again.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord is particularly good news for imperiled Puget Sound
and Columbia River salmon runs. The accord reportedly requires
further deep cutbacks in Canadians' catch of U.S.-bound chinook
salmon off the west coast of Vancouver Island and in the Strait of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators, including Locke, were still working on final
details Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and the White House have put substantial political
capital on the line to solve the prolonged cross-border salmon war.
Locke, who keeps count, has been involved in 31 salmon meetings
since last November.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared clear, from details available Wednesday night, that
Congress will have to appropriate a large amount of money to make
the accord work.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government would need to spend upwards of $25
million to buy out commercial licenses of non-Indian U.S.
fishermen. About $2 million of state money also would be required.
Canada's contribution is to be announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would establish two $75 million salmon enhancement
funds, one in the north and one in the south, reportedly under
U.S.-Canadian administration.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be available to help fish runs in such places as
the Skeena River of northern British Columbia _ where Canadians
have blamed fishing in Alaska waters for declining salmon
populations _ as well as restoring depleted fish stocks of rivers
in the Puget Sound-Georgia Strait region.
</P>
<P>
   While lasting a decade for most of the coast, the accord will
reportedly be in effect for 12 years on the Fraser River. The
Canadian river, which flows into the Strait of Georgia just north
of the U.S.-Canada border, is a crucial resource to Washington and
British Columbia fishermen as well as native fisheries in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The undammed Fraser River is the world's greatest sockeye salmon
stream. Allocation of the river's sockeye runs has been a point of
contention for years. Although bound for a Canadian stream, Fraser
River sockeye swim through U.S. waters in Alaska at the start of
their southward migration, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca and San
Juan Islands before entering the river.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reportedly contains a formula for allocating the
abundant Fraser River sockeye, along with the promise of resources
to restore other salmon species in the river that have experienced
severe declines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, the salmon dispute has rocked the
world's longest peaceful border. Canadians have resorted to
unaccustomed militancy in pressing their claim that the United
States takes too many fish bound for British Columbia rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Canada's then-fisheries minister Brian Tobin slapped a
$1,100 ``licensing fee'' on U.S. fishing boats using Canadian
waters of the Inside Passage en route to Alaska. The Canadian coast
guard detained several boats that refused to pay.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark proposed in 1996 that U.S.
Navy vessels be barred from using an important torpedo testing
range on Vancouver Island. The Canadian federal government _ far
more conciliatory to the United States _ eventually moved to
expropriate the bay from provincial ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A major confrontation came in 1997. Angry at the catching of
Canada-bound chinook and sockeye salmon off Noyes Island in Alaska,
fishing boats prevented the Alaska ferry ``Malaspina'' from leaving
Prince Rupert, B.C., for four days.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon war took a turn toward peace last summer, however,
even as formal talks between the two countries were at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the decline of coho salmon runs in its own rivers,
Canada moved unilaterally to curtail the sport and commercial catch
of millions of coho salmon off Vancouver Island and the Queen
Charlotte Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian curtailments had major benefits south of the
border, increasing the numbers of coho and chinook salmon reaching
such Puget Sound streams as the Nooksack, Skagit and Stiliguamish
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Locke returned the favor. State officials cut back Americans'
catch of coho salmon bound for the Thompson River in British
Columbia, as well as the early sockeye salmon run beginning its
900-mile migration up the Fraser River to remote Stuart Lake in
central British Columbia. It turned out that the Fraser River was
experiencing record water temperatures and high salmon mortality.
The U.S. action was vital to the survival of the so-called early
Stuart run.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Locke formed a mutual admiration society as a
result of last year's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confrontation made everybody poorer. Our constituencies are
tired of arguments over who would kill the last fish,'' the
Canadian fisheries minister told a recent Seattle luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, faced with a listings of salmon under the Endangered
Species Act, has looked for Canadians' help in assuring that
Washington-bound fish are not caught while in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long-term U.S.-Canada agreement would focus on recovery of
salmon in all of our rivers,'' Locke told the same luncheon. ``We
have a shared regional identity.''
</P>
<P>
   While cross-border relations improved, Canadians have fought
furiously among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The British Columbia government has accused its federal
government of making far too many concessions to the United States,
and not trying hard enough to halt interceptions of Canada-bound
salmon in Alaska waters.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Anderson has cut Premier Clark out of Canada-U.S.
negotiations and decried the premier's outspoken nationalism as an
impediment to a salmon accord.
</P>
<P>
   More than 13,000 people have left the B.C. fishing industry in
recent years. With canneries closing along B.C.'s north coast, the
province has begun studying once-unthinkable alternatives like
drilling for oil in Hecate Strait between the Queen Charlotte
Islands and the B.C. coast.

NO DRAMATICS AS TIGERS STOP RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TIGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It has come down to a matter of perception. Some people
will look at one game and see things that should have been done,
could have been done, and brood about it.
</P>
<P>
   Others will look at a bigger picture. Twenty wins in the last 26
games, a five-game winning streak that included good pitching,
timely hitting, late-inning rallies, all of the things needed to
put a team in first place.
</P>
<P>
   They will, as Red Sox first baseman Mike Stanley and several of
his teammates did Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, see a season broken down into a
series of three- and four-game challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the series and we move on,'' said Stanley, who had
three hits Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, not dismissing a 4-2 loss to the
Tigers at Fenway Park as meaningless, but not placing too much
importance on his team's first defeat in a week. ``You try and win
series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox did that, beating the Tigers the first two games of
the three-game set before lefthander Justin Thompson, who has
beaten the Sox twice this season, fired his assortment of darts and
heat over eight-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who beat the Red Sox in Detroit in April, needed his
best stuff to outpitch Tim Wakefield, who turned in one of his
stronger efforts of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got beat,'' said Wakefield, who is 3-5 but has had two
strong efforts in his last three starts. ``It was a matter of
getting to him early. And we couldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much of the last month, when the Red Sox went on a
remarkable 20-5 burst, and the last week, when they swept the
Indians in Cleveland and came from behind in wins over the Tigers
on Monday and Tuesday, the Red Sox had no magic formula
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, much to the disappointment of the Fenway faithful
of 27,280.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson limited the Red Sox to four hits through the first
eight innings before a Nomar Garciaparra infield hit and a 409-foot
blast by Stanley (his sixth home run of the season) over the screen
above the left-field wall brought about thoughts of another Red Sox
rally.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the previous two games, when Detroit manager Larry
Parrish's call to the bullpen brought only hits, home runs, and
defeat, Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night a Tiger reliever responded.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones came in to finish things without any more damage and
the Red Sox had to be content to win two of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're doing is playing the schedule,'' said Williams,
whose team will play an exhibition game in Pawtucket Thursday night
before entertaining the Atlanta Braves in a three-game set
beginning Friday night with a Pedro Martinez-Tom Glavine matchup
that will have people talking about baseball in October. ``We won a
series against a tough club.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that tough, but tough enough. The Tigers built their lead
against Wakefield slowly.
</P>
<P>
   They managed a run in the third on a pair of singles, one going
just past the pitcher's mound. Detroit added two more in the fourth
and that was all Thompson needed to get his fifth win in 11
decisions and end a personal four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Red Sox, it also wasted a pretty good
effort by Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw some good pitches out there tonight,'' said Williams.
``He had a good knuckleball. He was on the plate, getting a lot of
hitters out.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a semi-day of rest, then another of those ``series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the series and that makes it a little easier,'' said
Wakefield. ``Things didn't work out tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the picture is that first place still is
theirs and they are still one of the hottest teams in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good baseball,'' said Garciaparra, making it
sound so simple.
</P>
<P>
   So they are. Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night just wasn't quite good enough.

THOMPSON'S WIN JUST IN TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He beat them last year. He has already beaten them
twice this year. Ask who is the toughest pitcher in the American
League and the Red Sox might very well mention Tigers lefthander
Justin Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that Thompson was in the middle of a horrible stretch
going into the third and final game of Detroit's series at Fenway
Park Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that in his last five starts, he had four losses, a
no-decision, and had allowed 20 earned runs in 25 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to facing the Red Sox, Thompson looks like
Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's effort was the latest evidence. In working
eight-plus innings and allowing six hits in a 4-2 win, Thompson
needed only 87 pitches. The only Sox hitter to solve Thompson was
Mike Stanley, who had three hits, including a two-run homer in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is 2-0 against Boston this season, with an earned run
average of 1.13. For his career, he is 4-1 with a 2.75 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps you off balance,'' said Stanley. ``He's got a great
changeup. He hides his pitches well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good fastball, big changeup to righthanded batters, not afraid
to throw the breaking ball to righthanded batters either,'' said
third baseman John Valentin. ``The kid's got talent.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost a month, not many people on the Tigers saw it. After
opening the season with a pair of losses and horrible efforts
against the Rangers and Yankees, Thompson came back to pitch seven
strong innings in a win over the Yankees April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Then came eight shutout innings against the Sox in a 1-0 win
April 22, and two more wins.
</P>
<P>
   But just like that, it all went south on Thompson. He had five
starts, no wins, four losses, one no-decision, and a whole lot of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night may have turned things back the other way for
Thompson, who was looking for his first career shutout and the
first complete game by the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   But then Nomar Garciaparra had a sharp infield single to start
the ninth and Stanley hit a pitch over the screen above the
left-field wall, and Thompson was done for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully for the Tigers, Todd Jones finished off the
proceedings, making Thompson a winner and leaving the Red Sox to
wonder what they needed to do to beat him.

   DEADLY-PRESCRIPTIONS (Washington) _ With more medications on
pharmacy shelves than ever before, and more prescriptions being
written, the nation's health care system is overwhelmed, creating a
growing risk that patients will be killed or hurt by adverse
reactions or mistakes. Regulators, even after approving a new drug,
cannot always predict all potential side effects, or toxic
interactions. And with as many as a dozen medications available for
any one ailment, doctors are having a hard time keeping abreast of
FDA warnings about possible risks. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

SLEEPWALKING DEFENDANT REPORTEDLY DISCUSSED SIMILAR CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks before he fatally stabbed his wife, Scott Falater
was heard discussing a similar case in which a Canadian man who
also claimed to be sleepwalking was acquitted of killing his
mother-in-law, the prosecutor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in open court after the jury was excused for the day,
prosecutor Juan Martinez outlined that new lead and two others to
support his charge that Falater deliberately stabbed Yarmila
Falater 44 times and held her head underwater in the family's pool.
</P>
<P>
   One lead, Martinez said, is a new witness prepared to testify
that she told Yarmila that her husband had been unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   In another lead, Martinez said that Randy Keadle _ who testified
last week for the defense that Falater ``was a very peaceful man''
_ has since reported that Falater ``may have dragged his daughter
upstairs by the hair'' after a minor infraction of household rules.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said Keadle also provided information about a Motorola
employee who heard Falater, a Motorola engineer at the time of the
1997 attack, discuss the Canadian sleepwalking case.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion took place a few weeks before Falater killed his
wife with a hunting knife and stored the weapon and his
blood-spattered clothing in the back of his car. He says he was
sleepwalking at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially explosive new information prompted a protest
from defense attorney Michael Kimerer, who said the claims had
arrived ``a little late in the game'' and too abruptly for him to
evaluate their significance.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Martinez would be allowed to present the
new information. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Ronald S.
Reinstein ordered attorneys to meet Wednesday night to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   In another surprising announcement, Martinez said a new witness
has reported that a few months before her death, Yarmila Falater
talked about developing a venereal disease in 1990. The witness, a
nurse practitioner and former neighbor, will testify that she told
Yarmila that her husband had been ``messing around,'' Martinez
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the information supports his motion that Reinstein
reverse a pre-trial decision that information from 1990 about the
disease was too old to be relevant to a trial on a 1997 killing.
</P>
<P>
   If presented to the jury, the information could damage the
defense claim that the Falater home was a model of domestic
tranquility, that the couple never quarreled and were still deeply
in love after 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, the defense has called more than a dozen
witnesses who have testified glowingly about Falater's personal
life as a family man and local leader of the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most important defense witnesses were the two teenage
Falater children, who last week described their father as an
unfailingly kind man whose temper never got out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The key defense witness Wednesday was Falater's mother, Lois
Wilcek, who described several instances when her son had walked in
his sleep as a boy and young man.
</P>
<P>
   That testimony is key, Kimerer says, because sleepwalking adults
almost always have a childhood history of sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcek also contradicted the testimony of a key prosecution
witness, who had watched from his yard as Falater dragged his wife
to the pool after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Greg Koons, had denied telling Kimerer and Wilcek
shortly afterward that Falater's movements had been ``robotic.''
Wilcek remembered the conversation differently.
</P>
<P>
   Koons had said that Falater ``was very deliberate, had no
expression on his face at all, and his movements were not rushed;
they were slow and mechanical,'' Wilcek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said, `You mean like a robot?' And he said, `Yes,
like a robot.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, two of Falater's former colleagues at
Motorola cried as they spoke glowingly of the engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was _ is _ one of the best people I know,''
Gordon Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Ingram said she had been stunned to learn in 1997 that
Falater had been charged in his wife's death. ``It was totally
inconsistent with his character and with him as a person, with him
as a priesthood-holding member of the Mormon Church,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But another former Motorola colleague surprised the courtroom
with his recollection that Falater had called his wife ``either
dumpy or overweight.'' But Chester Gordon quickly agreed with
defense attorney Lori Voepel who suggested that Falater had made
the remark ``in a loving way.'' &QL;

ANGELS WIN 2-1

   ANAHEIM _ It was either the ultimate show of respect for Garret
Anderson or just plain stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the decision by Minnesota Twins pitcher Brad Radke
to pitch to Mo Vaughn with first base open and the potential
winning run on third base in the eighth inning was the difference
as the Angels beat the Twins 2-1 on Wednesday night in front of
17,766 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Radke and Angels starter Chuck Finley had been locked in a 1-1
game going into the eighth, and it was Radke who gave in. Darin
Erstad doubled to lead off the inning, then went to third on Randy
Velarde's sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Vaughn, who at that point was 0 for 3 against
Radke in the game but entered the contest with a .414 lifetime
average against him. Instead of walking Vaughn intentionally and
pitching to Anderson, who had homered earlier in the game, Radke
went after Vaughn and paid for it. Vaughn singled past a diving
second baseman Brent Gates, who was playing in on the infield
grass, scoring Erstad for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know T.K. (Twins manager Tom Kelly) and we've faced each
other before in that situation,'' Vaughn said. ``He kind of lets me
play the game. I told their first baseman I appreciate that,
because a lot of guys wouldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins wouldn't say whether or not he
would have pitched to Vaughn. He said he won't second-guess an
opposing manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad we had (Vaughn) up there and he came through,''
Collins said. ``The key was Erstad. He's swinging great now and he
got on.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad appeared to have hit a home run to lead off the eighth,
but second-base umpire Gary Cederstrom correctly ruled that a fan
reached below the top of the fence to catch the ball. Erstad had to
stay at second with a ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a triple,'' Collins said. ``Darin's running hard all
the way. They (fans) don't understand. I'll give them a dozen
baseballs if they'd leave that one alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out it didn't matter. Erstad scored the winning run
anyway and made a winner out of Finley (4-5). Finley gave way to
closer Troy Percival to start the ninth, and Percival earned his
15th save.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (4-5) gave up one run and five hits in eight innings. He
struck out five, giving him 2,016 in his career and moving him into
49th place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those pitching performances that didn't go to
waste,'' Collins said. ``We just don't seem to score him a lot of
runs. But Chuck Finley's style is to pitch and pitch well.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley said he's used to pitching in low-scoring games. Often he
faces the other team's ace, and Radke was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake and gave them a run, and he made a mistake
and gave us a run,'' Finley said. ``I was just hoping he had one
more in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I take the mound, I expect to be pitching in a 2-1 game,
a 3-2 game, a 1-0 game. That's just the way I approach it. I don't
start crying if the offense doesn't get me three or four runs in
the first couple of innings. If you go out there trying not to get
hit because the offense isn't scoring, you're going to get
whacked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored their only run of the game in the fifth on an
RBI double by Doug Mientkiewicz, and the Angels got the run back on
Anderson's solo homer in the sixth, his 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad had a big game with three hits, his first three-hit game
since April 15.

LUNAR PROSPECTOR ON SUICIDE MISSION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The bargain-basement spacecraft that found tantalizing signs of
water on the moon will die in a final effort to confirm the
discovery, NASA scientists announced Wednesday.
<P>
   The odds are 10 to 1 against success for its death plunge into
the sunless depths of a lunar crater, but because the Lunar
Prospector's mission is over anyway, the scientists have decided to
make the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, the 354-pound spacecraft caused a worldwide
sensation when its on-board sensor signalled back to Earth that it
was detecting large amounts of hydrogen in the deepest, darkest
bottoms of steep-walled craters in the terrain around both lunar
poles.
</P>
<P>
   The hydrogen was a strong indication that frozen water lies in
the permanently shadowed craters, according to Alan Binder, the
mission's chief scientist. And when the spacecraft was commanded to
descend from an orbit of 65 miles to six miles above the moon's
surface, the sensor gathered even more intriguing hints of water.
Scientists estimated that the darkest craters at both poles might
contain a total of at least 800 billion gallons of water.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement about the possibility of ice arose because of the
likelihood that water might eventually provide both rocket fuel and
oxygen to support human scientific colonies on the lunar surface.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Guenter Riegler of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Office of Space Science said that on July 31,
ground controllers will try commanding the spacecraft to end its
18-month orbital flight and dive directly into a crater named
Mawson, located at the moon's south pole.
</P>
<P>
   The crater's steep, high rim means its base has remained in
permanent shadow ever since a wandering meteorite gouged it out
billions of years ago. Because Mawson is only 31 to 38 miles
across, it will be a highly difficult target to hit, Riegler said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the spacecraft does reach the target, its impact energy
will be the equivalent of crashing a two-ton car at more than 1,000
mph, according to a NASA announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope that the impact will churn some 40 pounds of
water vapor up from the lunar surface _ an extremely thin cloud
that might be detectable by instruments on Earth or aboard other
spacecraft. Astronomers at the University of Texas in Austin have
been allocated time to use the Hubble Space Telescope in an effort
to observe the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the probability of success for such a bold undertaking
is low, the potential science payoff is tremendous,'' Riegler said.
``It seems fitting to give Lunar Prospector the chance to provide
scientific data right up to the very end of its highly successful
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched on January 6 last year, the spacecraft was one of the
new series of ``faster, better, cheaper'' missions ordered by NASA
administrator Daniel Golin; where other spacecraft have cost in the
billions, Lunar Prospector cost only $63 million _ one of the
cheapest space ventures on record.

A PROTEST THAT TRANSFORMED CHINA'S IDENTITY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By APRIL LYNCH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  BEIJING _ Friday, the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen
crackdown will probably pass without much public fanfare in this
city that saw so much heartfelt protest, political upheaval and,
ultimately, brutal bloodshed in the spring of 1989.
<P>
   Tiananmen Square itself has been walled off with metal
construction fences, ostensibly in the name of renovation. Police
have rounded up dissidents in an attempt to thwart any public
commemorations. Many Chinese people, still appalled by the NATO
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, are suddenly loath to
criticize their government in front of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   But public silence should not be mistaken for acquiescence, or
despair. The legacy of Tiananmen and June 4 has fundamentally
changed contemporary China and resonates throughout the country
even during an anniversary marked by enforced quiet. Tomorrow,
according to many Beijing residents, millions of private memories
will pay tribute to a movement that continues to shape the People's
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell those June 4 exiles living overseas that we remember what
they did,'' said a student surnamed Xu, a 24-year-old business
major at one of Beijing's most prestigious universities. ``They
made some mistakes, and we may not agree with everything they
wanted. But many of the reforms they struggled for, we now breathe
in every day, like air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Liu Si'' (June 4) lives on as a catalyst for change in China,
even within the government that tried to squelch it. The 1989
protests forced rapid reforms in the country's economy and its
systems of social control. The one major demand rejected by the
Communist Party _ greater political pluralism _ is slowly evolving
despite the party's recent harsh efforts to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The protests also changed the thinking of many ordinary
citizens. Police and social observers have tallied frequent
demonstrations around China in recent years, often centered around
economic inequality or government indifference. The Tiananmen-era
realization that people could form powerful groups outside official
channels has led to the widespread growth of associations that,
even if they are mostly apolitical, subtly loosen the party's grip
on society.
</P>
<P>
   Such quiet, incremental signs of success stands &LR;  in contrast to
the days that immediately followed June 4, when Beijing felt like
an occupied city. Almost two months of largely peaceful student and
popular protests calling for widespread reforms in Chinese politics
and society were crushed by tanks and troops acting on government
orders to stop the demonstrations at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks before the crackdown had a heady, carnival-like feel
in the normally serious capital, and the protests that began on
April 15 eventually spread to more than 75 cities across China. On
some days, more than a million people took to the streets in
Beijing. Contingents from doctrinaire government agencies joined in
the marches, waving banners calling for change. Students camping in
Tiananmen Square put up the now-famous ``Goddess of Democracy''
statue, its rickety, white plaster effigy staring down the giant
portrait of Chairman Mao that hangs over the gate to the Forbidden
City.
</P>
<P>
   When the crackdown began over the night of June 3 and the
following morning, many workers and other residents who tried to
stop the troops in the streets leading to Tiananmen Square paid
with their lives. A few soldiers died as well. The government puts
the official death toll at about 230, while dissident groups put
the number in the thousands. Afterwards &LR; , thousands of organizers
and participants were arrested, and key leaders of the protests
were forced into exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world needs to know what happened here, how they have
treated us like animals,'' a middle-aged man in a torn white work
shirt and plastic sandals gasped to this reporter as he stopped for
breath near a pile of crushed bicycles after running from army
gunfire the morning of June 4. ``Everything is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't. On the government side, the same Communist Party
that declared martial law and turned the People's Liberation Army
on the people quickly realized that the deep discontent reflected
in the protests could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps this bad thing will enable us to go ahead with reform
and the open policy at a steadier and better _ even a faster _
pace,'' former party boss Deng Xiaoping said in a speech five days
after the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the turmoil of that time, Deng's words were dismissed by many
as cynical platitudes.
</P>
<P>
   But the party put them into action. The government began
launched &LR; a campaign of economic, legal, social and educational
reforms that _ with the notable exception of greater democracy and
political pluralism _ directly reflected many of the demands that
echoed through the streets of Beijing in the spring of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Economic reforms have fattened the wallets and brightened the
financial prospects of many urban students, professionals and
workers, although many in China's remote rural areas have yet to
share in the wave of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The government also decided to loosen up on people's personal
lives, letting recent graduates choose their own jobs, giving
people more say in choosing their own housing and eliminating the
need to get government approval before marriage. More than 10,000
villages, at the party's urging, have experimented with electing
their own officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tiananmen generation had less to hope for,'' said Hu Yang,
a 26-year-old computer science major at Beijing University. ``We
have a lot of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reforms that sprang from the streets in 1989 _ stamping
out official corruption and creating a fair, independent legal
system _ have been slower to kick in, despite party efforts to push
them through. The government has put thousands of officials _
including Beijing's mayor _ on trial for corruption in the 1990s,
sentencing some to death. But many in Beijing still complain that
personal connections, favors and bribery remain the most effective
way to get anything done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1989, it was the people with the good party connections
who got their way,'' said a 31-year-old software engineer surnamed
Jiang, who complains of being thwarted by bureaucrats in his
attempts to get the permits to start his own company. ``Now, it is
the people with a big stock portfolio. That may be change, but it's
not the kind we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is often true of the legal system, where an independent
judiciary and the rule of law are still far off.
</P>
<P>
   Many judges are still political appointees, often chosen more
for their ability to follow orders than to interpret legal codes.
Party whims often override the law books, and corruption is
prevalent. In Beijing's legal circles, it remains a bleak joke that
one of the most useful courses that law schools could offer would
be titled ``How to Invite the Judge Out to Dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials also stepped up nationalist propaganda and
rhetoric after Tiananmen, drumming achievements from Chinese
history and stories of party glory into the heads of the young.
Earlier in the '80s, the government under Deng had emphasized
reform over doctrine. Such ``lapses in theoretical work,'' Deng
said in his June 9, 1989, speech, were the party's ``worst omission
of the past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a decade of increased political indoctrination,
students in Beijing are more critical of the West than their
predecessors were in 1989. At the same time, however, they are even
more Westernized, eager to join foreign companies, study overseas
or swap their proletariat ``Flying Pigeon'' bicycles for a mountain
bike or a Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   That split personality was reflected in the recent attacks on
U.S. diplomatic posts that followed the embassy bombing in
Belgrade, as young crowds dressed in knock-off Nike gear blasted
embassy and consular buildings with rocks and paint bombs. Some
sincerely echoed the party line that the bombing was a deliberate
act of aggression. Others were more questioning of official views,
but that did not dampen their rage over perceived U.S. carelessness
and callousness about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in Beijing said, such skepticism of the West should
not be confused with a return to the days of Mao's Red Guards.
Today's young people, hungry for their own information, turn to
mobile phones, satellite TV, radio talk shows, pagers and the
Internet. Like their older brothers and sisters from the Tiananmen
generation, they often find ways around party censorship of the
media.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Cultural Synthesis
</P>
<P>
   And, like young people everywhere, they often struggle to find
coherent meaning in the growing flood of information. As a result,
many are most comfortable with influences that blend China and the
West. Pop culture trends from consumer-happy Hong Kong and
politically democratic Taiwan once considered subversive are
quickly embraced _ and often have more resonance than their Western
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``American music is pretty cool, but Taiwan music is really
cool,'' said an 18-year-old guitar player who goes by his English
name of Jimmy, chosen in honor of Jimi Hendrix. ``Taiwan music is
in Chinese, and it is so moody, all about yourself and your hopes
and what you want. Those are new thoughts for a lot of kids as they
grow up, and they really like it.''
</P>
<P>
   That growing obsession with self is just one reflection of
Tiananmen's other major impact _ a gradual change in the way people
think.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 protests reflected and coalesced what had been a
growing dissatisfaction with forced collective thought in China.
Even after the crackdown, and despite some periods of heavy-handed
repression, the party has been unable to stamp out people's desire
to think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At a popular level, at least in Beijing and other big Chinese
cities, the Tiananmen mass movement brought home the power of an
individual decision of conscience. While the effect in China's vast
countryside is harder to gauge, many urban residents who joined the
protests learned that they could get the government's attention,
form groups outside party-sanctioned channels _ and quickly get in
trouble if they didn't keep things well-organized and low-key.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an upsurge in public groups of all kinds,
from spiritual orders such as Falun Gong to the small but
well-organized China Democracy Party, which is quietly pushing for
official acceptance. While many of the nonpolitical groups have no
intention of directly challenging the Communists, their very
existence and large memberships subtly weaken the party's grip on
society.
</P>
<P>
   Most such groups, whether political or not, have also learned to
bolster their emotional appeal with strong organization and a
quiet, orderly way of challenging the party. The powerful
sentiments and hopes of the Tiananmen protests, some said, will
never be realized until there are foundations built under them.
</P>
<P>
   These groups are trying to avoid the fate that continues to
befall outspoken dissidents in China. Leaders of the China
Democracy Party were recently given jail terms of up to 13 years,
and Tiananmen activists have either been rounded up or put under
house arrest in advance of the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   When government officials made moves to clamp down on Falun Gong
and its millions of followers this spring, the group sent more than
10,000 members _ mostly middle-aged women _ to sit quietly around
Communist Party headquarters in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very smart,'' said one Beijing woman who is not a
Falun Gong follower but lives in a neighborhood where the group is
popular. ``They gave the government a big headache. How do you stop
a bunch of quiet women who look like everyone's mother?''
</P>
<P>
   The China Democracy Party, rather than marching through the
streets, has also taken a path of quiet resistance that has proved
hard for the government to quash. Although the authorities rebuffed
the party's attempts to become officially registered and jailed its
top leaders, the party continues to hold low-profile networking
meetings and develop its already strong organizational base.
</P>
<P>
   Many thoughtful Chinese see this more systematic kind of dissent
as a sign that post-Mao China is growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Tiananmen protesters were fundamentally more
interested in reform than revolution. Now, they focus on building
the social awareness and structures needed for real reform _ often
one person, work unit or neighborhood at a time. In such a vast
country, that will take time.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the chaos that could erupt if the party suddenly
collapsed, many have chosen to be grudgingly patient with the
gradual pace of change. Most said they pin their hopes on
reform-minded Premier Zhu cq &LR; Rongji, who is grappling with the
social effects of rapid economic change _ tens of millions of
unemployed people, millions of migrant workers, farmers locked in
land and water disputes, and peasants fighting high taxes.
</P>
<P>
   At Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University, one small group of
students is remembering Tiananmen in a way that reflects China 10
years later. Using news photos from Western magazines or downloaded
off the Internet, the students have made a small, photocopied
collage of the 1989 protests and are sharing it with friends. One
23-year-old woman, surnamed Gao, smiled as she looked at one image
of a cheering crowd running through the streets with a bright
banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very young then, but these pictures are very
beautiful,'' she said. ``People look so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she mind that she can't hang the collage up on campus, or
that many other students won't do anything to commemorate the
anniversary at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too much,'' she said. ``I do what I like, and they can do
what they like. I think that is what people at Tiananmen wanted.''

<P>
   BELGRADE _ On the banner of Serbia, it is written: ``Only Unity
Saves the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic will be quick to take
advantage of the disunity of the outside world as his visitors
present him with a peace plan whose authors were denying some of
its contents the moment the envoys set off for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The disunity was as preposterous as it was potentially tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Even as European Union and Russian envoys were flying to
Belgrade to present it to Milosevic, NATO and Russia fell out over
their latest Kosovo ``peace plan'' Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian Balkan envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, an
international peace force could be sent to Kosovo composed of
Russian and NATO troops under separate commands _ a plan that
looked suspiciously like the partition of Kosovo; but in less than
an hour, both NATO and the U.S. State Department spokesmen were
insisting that a peacekeeping force must be under NATO's sole
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The EU's envoy, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari who also flew
to Belgrade Wednesday night, was facing the monumental task of
explaining these hopelessly different versions of the
U.S.-Russian-EU proposals to Milosevic _ a task made more difficult
because they were supposed to be a concrete and united plan that
the Serbian leader would be forced to accept if NATO's bombardment
of Yugoslavia was to end.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's demands for a return of all Albanian Kosovo refugees to
their homes, the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and the
presence of an international force in the province, are all
familiar to the Serb leader. But he has always insisted that NATO
would not be allowed to lead such an army.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's remarks will have found favor with Milosevic _
which is one reason why both Jamie Shea, NATO's spokesman, and
James Rubin, the U.S. State Department's spokesman, were so quick
to deny what he said. A peace force, Rubin insisted, must be under
NATO control, whatever the degree of Russian participation.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Rubin who stated on Tuesday that Ahtisaari has ``all
the detail that he needs so that when the Belgrade authorities ask
the question `what is the precise timetable, exactly what will the
force be composed of, how will it be verified?' he (Ahtisaari)
believes he's got sufficient answers.'' Clearly, this was not the
case Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Serbs have suspected that the West intends to divide
Kosovo, to give the south to the Albanians and leave the north for
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Serb nationalists have produced copies of Second World War maps
which show Kosovo divided between its German and Italian occupiers
and suggested that the world now has similar plans to divide the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   But few Albanians would trust Russian troops under non-NATO
command to guarantee their safety from Russia's Serb allies. And
NATO's insistence that all of the Albanian refugees must return to
their homes in Kosovo suggests that Chernomyrdin's ideas of a
separate Russian force will never be approved by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The Chernomyrdin-Ahtisaari proposals _ which are supposed to be
the joint work of Moscow, Washington and the EU _ are supposed to
form the basis of a U.N. Security Council resolution mandating the
international force.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government has long accepted the idea of a U.N.
resolution but has refused to accept such an international
peacekeeping army with NATO ``at its core.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and EU envoys were therefore arriving in Belgrade
Wednesday night divided over the one issue which Milosevic refuses
to concede. An imminent end to the latest Balkan war, therefore,
seemed less likely, even after 71 days of air bombardment by the 19
nations of NATO against a country of 10 million people. &QL;

<P>
   SURDULICA, CENTRAL SERBIA _ Not far from Milena Malobabic's
young body, we found the notebook of love poems she wrote for her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's jets had killed her and at least 18 other patients in the
tuberculosis sanatorium just a few hours earlier and Milena's body
lay in the shade of a pine tree, her long black hair drifting over
her face in the breeze, a silver earring still sparkling in her
left ear.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy here to report that the deaths of Milena and
her mother and two brothers and the other 14 patients we found dead
_ not to mention the three elderly people whose shredded remains I
also discovered in the sandwiched concrete of the sanatorium _ is
an atrocity. And it would be true.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombs destroyed a hospital Monday and they called it _
heaven spare us again _ ``collateral damage.'' But Milena's death
alone constitutes a unique tragedy of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you only knew how much I suffer now,'' she had written in
her first poem in the notebook in childish Biro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's wrong, but I want to go back to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Milena still loves you, but I feel my wounds so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can still kiss you.''
</P>
<P>
   The poem had been written at least two months ago and across the
side of one page, Milena had inscribed the words _ in capital
letters and in English _ ``I LOVE YOU DEJANE!''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb woman who translated Milena's poem to me broke down in
tears. No going back to Dejane now. The wounds are too many.
Suffering is best not spoken of.
</P>
<P>
   Beside Milena's body was her mother _ both feet torn off but
placed gently beside her severed legs _ and Milena's two brothers,
one of them with an arm bent over his face as if still cowering
from the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-uniformed Yugoslav rescue teams covered all of them
with bloodstained sheets to protect them from the flies. They lay
only a few meters from a pile of concrete and torn clothes and old
papers. That's where we found Milena's notebook.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 patients at the Special Hospital for Lung and
Tuberculosis were also seriously wounded when the NATO bombs fell
on them just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the two-story 75-year-old hospital simply caved in on
the men and women in their beds which is where most of them died _
although one old man whose body I saw was still dressed in a pair
of old blue trousers and a torn striped shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It was an elderly people's home as well as a tuberculosis
clinic. It was a hospital, set in a pine forest, marked on every
map.
</P>
<P>
   Branislav Ristic, the commander of the local civil defense unit,
had been among the first to reach the scene of horror. ``When I got
here,'' he said, ``there was fire and smoke in all the trees and
people screaming in the darkness and terribly wounded people trying
to crawl out of broken windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was screaming for help. But because this city is
bombed every six hours or so, we had a problem at first to get
enough people to help.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, he said, no military target in the area. So I took a
little walk up into the pine forest, joined hurriedly by none other
than Ristic. ``There is nothing, you see, no military target,
nothing,'' he said as we walked between towering stinging nettles,
the trees alive with bird song.
</P>
<P>
   But in a small glade perhaps half a kilometer from the hospital,
I found the remains of two camp fires _ the ash was still warm in
my hands _ and four ``foxholes'' - the kind of rectangular pits
that soldiers dig to protect themselves from bombs. Down another
track were another 12 ``foxholes,'' all newly dug.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital staff were worried about the bombs, Ristic said. They
probably built them. The unwounded patients had sat by the fires
after they were evacuated from the bombed building.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what is called a likely story. Had there been some
military vehicle here, a missile launcher perhaps? Not so, insisted
the Yugoslav authorities when I raised with them such a heretical
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   However there was, they said, a radio repeater station a
kilometer away, which was a regular NATO target. Perhaps defense
personnel for the station had been camped here, I was told. ``Maybe
engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it most certainly was not the barracks or munitions depot
which NATO claimed it was targeting Monday. There was no barracks
here.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the old problem of reporting civilian deaths in the
Yugoslav war.
</P>
<P>
   To find the slightest, most minimal reason why a hospital might
be bombed is to transfer the guilt of the slaughter to the
Yugoslavs and thus to say that Yugoslavia killed its own people
even when they are torn to pieces by NATO bombs. And any Yugoslav
who hears such a remark regards it, not unnaturally, as an
obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva Conventions _ so assiduously produced by NATO in the wake
of war crimes against Albanians in Kosovo _ state quite
specifically that civilians must be protected even if they are in
the vicinity of military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the patients at Surdulica were not given that protection.
Nor were the other 450 dead (more than half of them Albanian) in
NATO's other 16 ``mistakes'' during this Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partisans were treated here during the Second World War
and the Germans knew they were here but never touched them,''
Ristic said as we walked back beneath the pine stands, filtered
sunlight blessing the smashed concrete and glass and the patients''
clothes which had been blasted high into the branches of a silver
birch tree.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that they took the bodies of Milena and her family
off the grass and loaded them onto an orange-painted dump truck for
their journey to the local morgue. &QL;

TIANANMEN DISSIDENTS REMEMBER MOVEMENT _ AND THOSE WHO DIED FOR 
 IT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BENJAMIN PIMENTEL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ For Jing Chang of Daly City, Calif.,
remembering Tiananmen Square triggers a range of emotions.
<P>
   After escaping China shortly after the June 4 crackdown, the
former Beijing University student leader fled to the United States,
where he began a new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very lucky,'' said the 31-year-old entrepreneur, who
has just started his own Internet company. ``I was able come to the
States and live here and make some kind of achievement in my
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still have a very strong sense of guilt because of what
happened. I was a student leader _ and I bear responsibility for
the lives and well-being of my fellow students.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after escaping to the United States, many Bay Area
Chinese exiles have moved on, starting families and settling into
new careers. But like Chang, they still think of their homeland and
what they tried to achieve 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Chang's colleagues and friends were killed when Chinese
soldiers opened fire on the demonstrators in the Beijing square, he
said. After the bloody incident, he helped fellow students escape,
finding them places to hide and giving them pocket money. Chang
himself was later smuggled out of the country by sympathizers from
Hong Kong. He had to hide in the water tank of a container ship.
``I thought I was in hell,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Chang arrived in San Francisco in late 1989, then moved east,
earning an MBA at Columbia University. He worked for a Hong Kong
consulting firm before returning this year to the Bay Area to start
his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Weiguo, 42, was a Beijing journalist when the bloodbath
happened. He was later imprisoned twice for his dissident views and
writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the government fired on the students, it was as if I
myself was hit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police harassed him to the point that whenever he heard sirens,
he got very nervous. When Chinese authorities gave him permission
to leave the country, he grabbed the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living in horror,'' he said. ``By being here, I am away
from that horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang arrived in San Francisco in 1993. He lives in El Cerrito,
Calif., and is a visiting scholar at the University of California's
Graduate School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He still writes about China and spends much time learning about
the Internet and the New Media which he hopes will one day make it
easier to distribute news and information in China.
</P>
<P>
   Another journalist, Zhou Sha, 34, was an editor for a
Canton-based business weekly newspaper during the upheaval. He
helped pass on information to supporters and the media in other
countries after the massacre. He later had to be smuggled out of
the country via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty bad,'' Zhou said. ``I felt that the country
didn't have any hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou came to the United States in late 1989. Two years later, he
joined the U.S. Navy and served on the Seventh Fleet's humanitarian
mission to Bosnia. He is now an independent computer engineering
consultant living in Daly City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other dissidents went to school. I got to know other
Americans,'' he said of his military experience. ``It made me feel
like a normal American.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang has also acquired U.S. citizenship. Zhang has applied for
a green card, but said he hopes to remain a Chinese citizen.
</P>
<P>
   It's a special week for the three exiles.
</P>
<P>
   Chang has been helping organize a daylong commemoration of
Tiananmen. Zhang is writing articles on the 1989 protests for
Chinese-language newspapers in the Bay Area and Hong Kong. He also
plans to attend the planned demonstration and vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably will see some friends and exchange some of our
ideas,'' Zhou said of his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back to the decade after Tiananmen hasn't been easy.
Many attitudes have changed, toward China and toward the dissidents
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   China has undergone rapid economic growth which, even the
dissidents admit, has meant a better life for many Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed feelings about the 10th anniversary,'' Zhang
said. ``I feel happy that China has made a lot of progress
economically. ... At the same time, I feel sad because,
politically, China is reversing the cause of freedom and
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the pro-democracy movement in exile has also faced
criticism for being fractious and for putting the spotlight on the
negative side of China.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View business consultant George Koo even belittles the
significance of the Tiananmen Square anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10th anniversary of Tiananmen is a much bigger deal
outside China than inside,'' said Koo, who has worked with American
companies doing business in Asia. ``There are certain people who
are very interested in keeping that thing on the front pages of the
papers ... the very anti-China elements in this country.''Some are
dissidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese exiles scoff at such views, accusing some U.S.
business and political leaders of downplaying the repression for
their economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never sacrifice the Chinese people's well-being and
human rights for your business connections,'' Chang said. ``I think
that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Chinese Americans want to do business (with China); they
depend on China to make a living,'' Zhou said. ``People like me,
who don't depend on China, can have a more objective view of what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics, like San Francisco attorney Ed Liu, say it's also
time to take a deeper look at Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Beijing government clearly used excessive force,
Liu said some of the student leaders' tactics were also
confrontational and should be reexamined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years is a long time,'' he said. ``We are now developing a
much more sobering perspective. There are some thoughts that it
could have turned out differently if some of the leaders had acted
more responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang still reflects on his own leadership _ and the death of
his fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, because of my inexperience and limitations of
my capabilities, I couldn't protect them,'' he said. ``We didn't
really achieve what we wanted. I feel very sad.'' &QL;

   1. JOAN CHEN'S 'XIU XIU' MARKS BRAVE DEBUT Joan Chen was a
teenage star of Chinese films before heading West for a career in
Europe and Hollywood. In America, she is best known for captivating
performances in ``The Last Emperor,'' and ``David Lynch's ``Twin
Peaks'' television series. Now the actress has become a director,
with ``Xiu-Xiu, The Sent Down Girl.'' This controversial film,
which Chen also co-wrote and produced, is set during China's
Cultural Revolution. It has already been banned by the Chinese
government. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 800 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
HEADING TO BROADWAY IN SEARCH OF REASONS TO BELIEVE At the
beginning of his one-man play about the Middle East, ``Via
Dolorosa,'' David Hare declares that he recently realized, ``almost
without noticing, that for some time my subject as a playwright has
been faith. My subject is belief.'' He envies the Arabs and
Israelis their fervour, while being too aware of its
destructiveness to adapt any such passions himself. Conversely, all
around him in England he sees the rigor mortis of a life without
that passion. That's the horrible irony of Western civilization at
the millennium, as he tells the audience. By Ed Siegal. Boston
Globe. 1,800 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________3. A
WALK ON THE LAWLESS SIDE : A CHAT WITH THE STAR OF
</P>
<P>
   'XENA : WARRIOR PRINCESS'' Lucy Lawless, star of ``Xena :
Warrior Princess,'' has emerged as an unlikely feminist icon. But
minus the wig and sexy warrior wardrobe, she is jaw-droppingly
delicate. This New Zealand-born cult heroine is also remarkably
down-to-earth, friendly and vulnerable. By Michael Logan. TV Guide
Canada. 1,500 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
MICHAEL OVITZ, SUPERAGENT, IS BACK Michael Ovitz, the superagent
who once ruled Hollywood by fear, is back. In the '80s he cornered
the market on movie talent, but that kind of power wasn't enough
for him. Now he's scrambling to get that talent again - and
reminding Hollywood how much trouble he can make. By Lynn
Hirschberg. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (8,300
words) + edited article available.

   5. SAFFRON BURROWS : THE DARK SIDE OF INNOCENCE Any minute now
Saffron Burrows may find herself a movie star, but if she ends up
famous it won't be her fault. ``I've got a small taste of it, but
I've seen it really happen to people I know and it can be scary and
disorienting,'' says the 26-year-old British actress. In ``Sexual
Innocence'' she plays two characters, twins raised in different
countries. There are interracial relationships, violence and scenes
of child abuse, not to mention enough exposed flesh to make Hugh
Hefner blush. By Ian Spelling. 1,500 words + photo.

   NASHVILLE'S FEATHERS The Dixie Chicks are three women who dress
like alternative rock stars but play a mixture of straight country,
pop and bluegrass. They have found themselves ruling the country
roost and the Nashville establishment has been forced to pay
attention to them. Their audience consists mainly of women in their
20s - as all three Chicks happen to be - who are looking for feisty
role models. By Bob Paxman. 1,500 words + photos.

signed on to film ``Instinct,'' playing a psychiatrist assigned to
evaluate a famous primatologist (Anthony Hopkins) accused of
``going native,'' living among the gorillas he studies and
ultimately murdering two park rangers. The money didn't enter into
it. More important was the chance to work with the Oscar-winning
Hopkins ... and to redeem himself in the British actor's eyes. By

UC BERKELEY CHANCELLOR RAPS 4% ADMISSIONS POLICY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ California's new policy of admitting the top 4
percent of California high school students to the University of
California will have ``no truly significant impact'' on the
percentages of black and Hispanic students at the Berkeley campus,
Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl said Wednesday.
<P>
   The new policy, recently approved by Governor Gray Davis and the
UC Board of Regents, is the state's latest effort to maintain
minority enrollments in the wake of Proposition 209, which banned
race-based affirmative action in public education, employment and
state contracting.
</P>
<P>
   The intention of the new policy is to give students from
poor-performing high schools in the state an equal chance of
gaining admission to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Berdahl, speaking to the National Press Club, noted that the 4
percent admission standard does not guarantee admission to the
prestigious Berkeley or Los Angeles campuses.
</P>
<P>
   But, Berdahl said, the policy will benefit disadvantaged
students by sending a signal that ``if you work hard and do
extremely well and graduate from high school (in the top 4
percent), you will be eligible for admission. ... You will not feel
you are already barred because you had the bad luck to have
attended a weak high school.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that Berkeley is focusing, instead, on other
approaches to increase minority admissions. Berdahl said those
initiatives include ``a massive refocusing of investment to correct
inequalities in the K-12 public school system, with higher
education engaging the problems of public schools and investing
more in outreach and remediation; and second, a deep re-evaluation
of the standards by which we judge merit, with public universities
leading a transition toward judging students as individuals rather
than as the sum of their grade-point average and test scores.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, UC Berkeley started an outreach program to improve 50
poor-performing public schools in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley
and West Contra Costa County. Called the Berkeley Pledge School
Partnerships, its intention is to improve the academic performance
of minority applicants to Berkeley. The program uses such methods
as after-school and in-school tutoring, teacher training and
Internet-based curriculum enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   Berdahl also said that the Berkeley admissions process has been
altered to ``evaluate students on the basis of the hand they have
been dealt and how they have played that hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Berdahl insisted that ``academic standards still remain the
basic premise'' for student admissions, ``but they are evaluated
not simply in terms of test scores or grade-point averages.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``context of the school'' is also considered, he said, and
students are evaluated ``in terms of the kind of curriculum with
which they challenge themselves. If a student attends a high school
that has a significant number of advanced placement classes but
refuses to take those classes, that student has not challenged
himself or pushed herself as hard as she ought to,'' Berdahl said.
``If, on the contrary, that student has attended a school which has
far fewer advanced placement classes, one that we might consider to
be a disadvantaged environment, but that student has taken all of
the advanced placement classes ... that student, it seems to me,
should be given credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Berdahl took over as Berkeley chancellor in July 1997, after
serving as president of the University of Texas, another school
where race-based affirmative action was banned after the Supreme
Court ruled against the practice.

 And CHARLES ARTHUR  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   American doctors are preparing to ban blood donations from
people who have visited Britain for as little as six months, to
guard against the spread of the human form of ``mad cow disease,''
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
   The decision to stop the donations has already been made by
experts advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who
are now considering what criteria to use.
</P>
<P>
   They were expected to exclude only long-term visitors to Britain
who would have been here during the 1980s, when many BSE-infected
cattle were used for food.
</P>
<P>
   Their fears are that visitors to Britain may have absorbed the
BSE agent through eating contaminated food, and could then pass on
``new variant'' Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (v-CJD) by donating their
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, scores of people could be infected by a single
donation if it is pooled with others. Because there is no way to
detect the BSE or v-CJD agent, thought to be a single protein,
conventional blood tests and filtering are useless.
</P>
<P>
   BSE has not been a big issue in the U.S.: no cases of BSE have
been officially recorded, nor any cases of v-CJD. But scare
stories, and growing publicity such as that by the talk-show host
Oprah Winfrey on the beef industry's practices, have pushed it up
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities now clearly want to head off any crisis of
confidence in blood supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Ending blood transfusions from people who have been to the UK
for six months or more would cut the U.S. blood supply by about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the FDA banned the use of blood products from people
with ``sporadic'' CJD _ the form of the disease with no known
cause, which usually affects people over 60.
</P>
<P>
   But all forms of CJD apparently have a long incubation period in
which the victim shows no symptoms: this can last decades before
they show failing memory and coordination, and die within a couple
of years.
</P>
<P>
   In the UK, 40 people have so far died of v-CJD. The Department
of Health said Tuesday night: ``In this country we use
leucodepletion, which removes the white blood cells, as a
precautionary measure against this theoretical risk. The U.S.'s
measures are up to their regulatory authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman emphasized that the risk remains theoretical, with
no recorded cases of any form of the disease being passed by blood
products.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night evidence was presented to the FDA's Transmissible
Spongiform Encephalopathies Advisory Committee about blood donors
who have lived in Britain for various periods, to assess the risk.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the U.S. Veterans' Affairs Department found that no
one seems to have caught CJD from infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   Abid Rahman, an epidemiologist with the Department of Veterans'
Affairs Office of Public Health, said it appears there is only a
``small, theoretical risk'' of getting it that way. ``It at least
gives us some evidentiary basis for no transmission through blood
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Blood Services has already decided to refuse blood
donations from people who have visited the UK, and has asked an
expert committee to decide on the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the close historical ties between Canada and Britain,
the decision could have a much more serious effect on Canadian
blood supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to defer donors has essentially been made,''
Graham Sher, vice-president of the blood services division, said
last week. ``It's a matter of what the criteria are that we will
use to determine who should be deferred.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey found that 22 percent of its donors had visited Britain
since 1980. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Is the new ``Star Wars'' movie racist?
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the hotly awaited American release of ``Episode
1: The Phantom Menace,'' otherwise die-hard fans of George Lucas's
space opera are beginning to wonder about the wholesomeness of
noseless baddies who speak in high-pitched Japanese accents, a
filthy bloated insect who sounds either Greek or Arabic, and a
computer-generated idiot alien who talks like a Caribbean
galley-slave.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, which has engaged film critics, university academics
and literally thousands of online ``Star Wars'' fans, doesn't
appear to have hurt the blockbuster film's box-office fortunes:
with more than 200 million dollars in revenue, it is by several
measures the fastest-grossing film of all time so far.
</P>
<P>
   But it could influence the filmmakers when it comes to deciding
who to keep and who to leave out of Episodes 2 and 3, which are due
for release in 2002 and 2005 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of the criticism has focused on Jar Jar Binks, member
of an underwater alien race called the Gungans, who theoretically
provides the film's comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   With a head like a sea horse, a whiplash tongue like an anteater
and bulbous frog eyes, Jar Jar comes across as the idiot of the
galaxy and utters lines like ``da force is maxi big'' in a
Caribbean patois that fans find both inane and demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet user observed: ``He is the worst character in `Star
Wars's' history, a pathetic excuse to sell toys.''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old comic-book shop assistant from Seattle has founded
an International Society for the Extermination of Jar Jar Binks and
set up a website called jarjarmustdie.com, which is lobbying hard
for his exclusion from future episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm, which produced the movie, has denied any racist
intent, but that has done nothing to dampen the furore.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ``Star Wars'' saga, George Lucas has drawn on a
wide variety of popular culture sources, particularly old Saturday
morning adventure serials.
</P>
<P>
   His noseless leaders of the Galactic Trade Federation are
clearly a throwback to the Yellow Peril characters popular in
``Flash Gordon'' and other series, but risk being interpreted as a
racial slur just as much as a fond cultural reference.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise the revolting fly Watto, a corrupt mechanic on the
planet of Tatooine, might remind film buffs of the Greek car
repairman in Robert Aldrich's ``Kiss Me Deadly,'' but also looks
uncomfortably like an eastern Mediterranean stereotype. &QL;

   DISPATCHES FROM DREASMVILLE: Diamond in the rough
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Hartsfield
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and early 1960s Atlanta was a much smaller
town, especially in the southwestern part of the city in the little
community known as Oakland City.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer we often played baseball on a large field next
to ``Miss Georgia,'' an ice cream shop where you could get a scoop
of ice cream for a nickel. A ``spinning wheel,'' what they called a
milkshake, was 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   A briar patch was out in right field, the infield sloped as you
ran toward first base, and the back of a tire company was not too
deep in left field.
</P>
<P>
   When Mack came to bat, the left fielder had to play with his
back to the wall of the tire company, because Mack could hit it
over the building and out onto Lee Street with most swings.
</P>
<P>
   He was the slugger of our neighborhood. But every day we played,
somebody got a big hit, made a great play or slid home with the
winning run, as we chased fly balls into the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One day as we played, a chauffeur-driven Cadillac pulled into
the parking lot of the ice cream shop.
</P>
<P>
   The curiosity was overwhelming for 10- and 12-year-old boys, so
we went over to see who was inside.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mickey Mantle, we wondered, or Whitey Ford or Ted
Williams?
</P>
<P>
   But that couldn't be, because this was baseball season. So it
was probably just some rich person.
</P>
<P>
   As we approached, the window came down and we could see a
beautiful woman with flaming red hair inside the car.
</P>
<P>
   It was Susan Hayward, the glamorous Hollywood actress!
</P>
<P>
   She waved to us as the car pulled away. She was probably
returning to her home in Carrollton, not far down the road from
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly our game continued, with more home runs, great catches
in the outfield and balls rolling into the briar patch, which were
ground-rule doubles, unless the ball was touched by an errant
fielder, and then you could run forever.
</P>
<P>
   These were our glory days!
</P>
<P>
   When the game was finally called on account of darkness, we made
our way to Spratlin's Grocery up on Lee Street and bought penny
bubblegum baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   I usually got some good ones. That particular day I traded a
Nellie Fox for an Al Kaline. What a steal! I had two Nellie Foxes
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   There is an apartment building on the field now. I bet that
under the cement parking lot or building foundation there are the
remnants of an old baseball that was forever lost in the briars.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bob Barr's other witch hunt
 &HT;    (Eds: Magickal Cauldron in penultimate graf is cq.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do you do if a political witch hunt flops? If you're
Congressman Bob Barr, you set off on a real witch hunt. Only to
discover the witches can do a little hunting of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, you likely recall, was demanding President Clinton's
impeachment long before Monica showed up to provide an excuse,
arguing that if Congress just looked long enough it would surely
find some reason. Bitter that the Big Warlock got away, the
congressman has had to settle for harrying the lesser witches.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen of them tracked the Georgia representative to a
hometown constituent meeting recently in Marietta to protest his
demand that the U.S. military stop sanctioning pagan religious
services on its bases. Barr was set off by a story in the Austin
American-Statesman about a spring rite performed by Wiccans _ or
pagans, witches, nature worshipers: you pick one _ at the Fort Hood
Army base in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Barr started firing off letters to the military sputtering about
the armed services condoning godlessness and indiscipline and
letting standards go, more or less literally, to hell.
</P>
<P>
   This being the very cusp of the 21st century _ the Wiccans'
neodruidism to the contrary notwithstanding _ no one has so far
been hustled to the stake for a little purgative auto de fe.
Instead the matter has set off a web site war.
</P>
<P>
   The military pagans' site _ and, yes, there really is one _
argues for paganism's legitimacy and its rights under freedom of
religion, all quite soberly. Barr, on his site, lumps
homosexuality, witchcraft and ``other bizarre behavior'' together
and wonders whether ``armored divisions will be required to travel
with sacrificial animals for Satanic rites.''
</P>
<P>
   Why armored divisions, I don't know, but then if you are
actually scared of people who say they are witches, I suppose it is
not surprising that your worries could achieve a certain, oh,
extruded quality. Is Barr indifferent to the prospect of the
infantry leading goats to slaughter? Is he willing to forfeit the
animal rights crowd? Does this man care nothing for re-election?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Wiccan practices have been recognized by the military
chaplain's handbook for years and the faith has had tax-exempt
religious status in Barr's own state since 1981. Rites have been
carried out at numerous military installations _ apparently without
anyone, as Barr fretted in his constituent session, dancing naked
around trees or bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to guess that at a meeting in which a preacher's
invocation for ``Brother Barr'' got a huge round of applause and
Barr got a standing O just for showing up, the witches of the
Magickal Cauldron _ not even Lady Galadriel, high priestess and
elder of the Grove of the Unicorn _ changed any minds, Barr's least
of all. But at least the congressmen heard them out and shushed the
audience's grumbles. Fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, though, that the good witches will keep trying. Who knows?
One might get close enough to Barr one day to kiss him and turn him
into a prince.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Man vs. woman: a new snag
 &HT;    For release June 6, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since women rose up and demanded their rightful place in
society, I have been in step. As females moved out into the
workplace, I bonded with their cause _ quite forcefully supported
ERA. It only seemed right.
</P>
<P>
   I often do the dishes, also the grocery shopping; my married
sons go off to Indian Princess camp with their daughters, there's
no ordering around of the female members of the family and, I can
boast, we're 50-50 in my clan.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I've ever measured it.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes disturbing news from Germany where the Greens
party, a radically minded ecologist group with growing power in
Bonn, is insisting on a legal requirement that men do an equal
share of housework.
</P>
<P>
   This would include, the Greens say, cooking, doing the dishes
and cleaning up the house. ``If both partners are working, the
50-50 principle also has to hold true over the housework,'' a
spokesperson for the Greens said.
</P>
<P>
   Unclear to me is what the rules should be regarding households
where the female doesn't work. Since everything is aimed at working
partners, am I to assume that women who do not work do not qualify
for the 50-50 rule?
</P>
<P>
   I have no problem with men doing their fare share. As I said
above, we're about 50-50 in my family. But this proposed measure by
the Greens is demanding the 50-50 ratio and, in order to keep it,
someone's got to maintain records.
</P>
<P>
   This is the issue upon which I pounce.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to keep score?
</P>
<P>
   The Greens are contending that no matter the new relationship
between men and women these days, working mothers still do three
hours a month more household work than their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   So someone in Germany was keeping score, which does not surprise
me, knowing the efficiency of the German mind.
</P>
<P>
   If it passes, charts will have to be placed _ say on
refrigerators _ marking the minutes and hours worked by each
partner in performing the tedious chores of the household.
</P>
<P>
   I see a need for stopwatches.
</P>
<P>
   Looming are never-before-thought-of confrontations between
husband and wife, or partners, as the expression now goes. Did I do
the dishes in 12 minutes or 17 minutes? Did she spend one hour at
the washing machine, or one hour and 10 minutes and, besides, she
was reading a book all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Things like that. Venus and Mars stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking about something like that a couple of weeks ago
when we were going through a life boat drill on a cruise ship
leaving Lisbon. As the passengers stood on deck, their life jackets
firmly tied to their bodies, the ship's officer announced that in
case of emergency, and despite the sufficient capacities of the
life boats, loading would be women and children first.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, that ain't 50-50! Neither is the fact that guys have to
sign up for Selective Service and gals don't.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't allow those male-icous thoughts to alter my
devotion to a 50-50 partnership with my wife. Nevertheless, with
the Greens coming up with their proposal and the likelihood that
some equally radical group on this side of the Atlantic might seize
upon it, I raise the question:
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to keep score and how? None of this he-said,
she-said stuff.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 years of marriage, my wife and I still can't work out
the difference of time. When she says she'll be ready to leave the
house in five minutes, it always takes 10. When I tell her there's
only two minutes left in the basketball game, it always takes 15
minutes to play it.
</P>
<P>
   We don't operate on the same clock; never did, never will.
</P>
<P>
   And now someone is suggesting a law that requires we keep a
clock on housework? Yeah, well how about one that keeps track of
who spends how much time in control of the bathroom?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE POLITICS OF FAITH VS. THE EVILS OF HOLLYWOOD
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 6.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's easy enough to dismiss the coming $1 million
federal probe into whether the entertainment industry markets
violence to children as yet another bit of fluffy Washington show
business.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we already know ``our children are being fed a
dependable daily dose of violence,'' as President Clinton put it
from his Rose Garden lectern in ordering the review. ``This stuff
sells,'' Clinton said, without waiting for the results to come in.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the nanny-in-chief was doing his thing: Washington is
about politics, just like Hollywood is about illusion. Only these
days, lots of the stuff being peddled out of this town is
illusionary, while the big campaign bucks being milked out of
Hollywood are quite real.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Democratic president acted out of a political
desire to pre-empt the Republican-led Congress, which was moving to
approve a comparable investigation out of a political desire to
deflect pressure for more gun controls following the Littleton
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   That said, some of the changes occurring on both coasts do bear
a closer look. For one thing, in gearing up for the 2000 elections,
Democrats have found religion. For another, Hollywood has lost its
moral gears.
</P>
<P>
   In his first term, Clinton ate the Republicans' lunch by
balancing the budget and cutting welfare rolls. In trying to win
his first term, Al Gore cites the Bible to explain what drove two
teenagers to commit mayhem in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have long held a lock on the Holy Scripture as a
guide to policy choices. No longer. The politics of faith that
drove the president to the crack down on Hollywood violence also
drove the vice president to summon seven religion reporters to a
White House schmooze about theology.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the conservative crowd takes a somewhat cynical
view. Says Gary Bauer, a second-tier Republican White House
hopeful: ``I welcome converts, but I suspect it has something to do
with the political calendar and polls showing that a majority of
Americans now think our problems are spiritual rather than
economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then too, Washington experts would have less to study if
Hollywood hadn't become so cynical in its bloody marketing
campaigns. Any honest inquiry would reveal that there's been plenty
of violence in movies, going back to the Depression and World War
II. Nobody kept us from paying our quarters to sit in the
children's section.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that all of us knew then whom to root for. The
bad guys wore black hats and invariably got what they deserved.
Even before the MGM lion roared, we already knew that the good guys
would win the war, even though they would have to suffer brutality
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Justice Department will probe why Hollywood no
longer makes a moral choices between good and evil. Perhaps Buffy
the Vampire Slayer will be caught selling nuclear secrets to the
Chinese.

GUBA GOODING JR.: SHOW ME THE ROLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Jerry Maguire,'' Cuba Gooding Jr. made the kind of
impression every actor dreams of. The impression was made with the
words: ``Show me the money.''
</P>
<P>
   His character's famous catch phrase became so familiar that
complete strangers shout it at him on the street. Even his agent,
the actor says, has been known to greet him that way. (Well, at
least he has an honest agent.)
</P>
<P>
   But if the phrase implies someone interested in money over all
else, Gooding has not lived up to it. Some actors use their new
star recognition to move into higher-paying action movies, all but
deserting the character-driven roles they were originally praised
for. (Nicolas Cage, please come home.)
</P>
<P>
   Gooding said he has been offered big-studio money to do
action-movie lead roles, but he doesn't think those are right for
him. So he has chosen to stay in character roles, even though it
has kept him a supporting actor. It's not that he doesn't want to
do leads _ he certainly does. But he wants to do roles that
interest him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every actor has choices to make, and the way the choices are
made will affect his career forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time that Gooding, 31, has made acting
choices with his long-range career in mind. After his first big
success in movies, a featured role in the surprise low-budget hit
``Boyz in the Hood,'' Gooding was offered similar urban films and
bad-guy roles. But he said no to avoid being typecast. Being picky
has cost him a lot of films, but now he's identified with quality
character parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm on the track, sometimes in a positive direction,
sometimes in a negative. But on the whole I think I'm sticking to
my plan.''
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to be paying off. After strong supporting roles in
``Jerry Maguire,'' ``As Good As It Gets'' and ``What Dreams May
Come,'' Gooding finally has his first real lead in a major studio
film with ``Instinct,'' opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the studio (Disney) is promoting it more as an Anthony
Hopkins film, Gooding's character has the larger part and carries
the most dramatic weight.
</P>
<P>
   So is it a breakthrough role in his career?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Gooding.
</P>
<P>
   When he called recently, Gooding was in a limousine heading for
the Denver airport. He was sharing the ride with his ``Instinct''
director, Jon Turteltaub (``Phenomenon''), as they stumped the
country to promote the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Instinct'' role is especially sweet for Gooding because he
was not the first choice for the role. Gooding has said that both
Tom Hanks and Mel Gibson were early candidates, but the deals never
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking to get the opportunities that aren't handed
to me,'' said Gooding. ``When `Jerry Maguire' came around, I was
like the third choice for this read-through (audition). Director
Cameron Crowe said, `I've got to be honest: I never really thought
of you for this, but after seeing this read-through, I think that
you're a contender for the role.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I ate, drank, slept the character until my next audition,''
Gooding said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the actor got the part, and eventually a
best-supporting-actor Academy Award for his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding may be staying with character parts for now, but he
makes no bones about wanting them to be in lead, not support roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make the transition from support actor to lead
actor. This was the first role I saw an opportunity (to do that).
My strife is showing the studio they can green-light a movie with
me, with a character that carries the burden of telling the story
through his eyes. That was my first goal. That was always my first
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to fight to show that I could be a lead. This script was
one of the best I had read in a while, and it really made me want
it for that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Instinct,'' Gooding plays Caulder, a young psychiatrist
given the opportunity to work on a high-profile case, that of a
famous anthropologist (Hopkins) who seems to have gone homicidally
mad.
</P>
<P>
   The anthropologist, named Powell, had disappeared in Africa,
actually going to live with the gorilla band he was studying. When
park rangers began killing the gorillas, Powell killed two rangers
to protect the rest of the animals. Since his capture he has
refused to speak or communicate.
</P>
<P>
   In Powell, Caulder sees either a great opportunity to help
someone or a big career break. Maybe both. Part of the complexity
of Gooding's performance is that we must decide for ourselves where
Caulder's heart lies.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins has the film's flashier role, the eccentric mute who
represents nature being destroyed by man's callousness. But it's
Gooding who has the tougher part.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so tricky about the role Cuba played is that you don't
get the juicy acting moments a more flamboyant character would
have,'' said Turteltaub. ``It is far more difficult for an actor to
play a common man and make simple emotions believable. That's much
tougher than it is to bounce off the walls and play someone with
one leg or no tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are pitfalls in the other stuff _ overacting _ and
that's where Anthony Hopkins is so brilliant. But in the case of
Caulder, Cuba has to make an average man feel believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where that is tough is we have so much to compare him to. If
you're playing a man who lives with gorillas, nobody knows what
that's like, so you're going to take Anthony Hopkins' word for it.
Cuba had to present a character who is very mainstream. That
requires a lot of subtlety.''
</P>
<P>
   With a large percentage of the movie taking place in dialogue
between the two Oscar-winning actors, Turteltaub knew he'd have to
find ways to keep the interaction dramatic. One approach he took
was to shoot the actors very tightly _ a technique hardly likely to
win critical praise, although he believes it works.
</P>
<P>
   Another was to emphasize the different ways the two adversaries
approach dealing with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cat-mouse game between them,'' said Turteltaub.
``There is an unpredictability to their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the script does _ and I tried to do _ is always allow
Cuba to be asking the kind of questions that will throw Anthony
Hopkins' character off guard. Anthony Hopkins would always be
taking physical postures that would be throwing Cuba's character
off guard. Therefore, the audience is always thrown off guard by
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooding, as anyone who saw his enthusiastic acceptance of the
Oscar might guess, has a reputation for high energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a nut,'' Turteltaub said. ``What you see publicly from
Cuba is just the tip of the iceberg. If you find him in a limo
listening to Busta Rhymes, you're in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   (At this point, the limo's radio cranks up to full volume.
Turteltaub starts laughing and yells at Gooding, ``Behave yourself,
I have an interview to do.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gooding knew going into the film that he couldn't use too much
of his famous energy in the role, at least not overtly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character being a psychiatrist and just sitting in a room
for most of the movie talking with a patient ... I knew this
couldn't be flamboyant and boisterous and energetic,'' Gooding
said. ``I had to kind of sit there and hold my poise. I thought
that might be a nice challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the majority of ``Instinct'' consists of Gooding and
Hopkins going one-on-one in a small room, talking, arguing and
playing mind games, you might wonder if their styles clashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was because of the relationship of the
characters in our movie, but we were sort of stand-offish,''
Gooding said. ``Everybody calls Anthony Hopkins `Tony.' I never
stopped calling him Anthony. He never corrected me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that it was a stiff relationship, because I love the guy.
We are looking for something to do together again. Maybe it was
that we are personal in our approaches to acting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gooding said the different styles did not cause them
difficulty on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completely the opposite. We didn't do one day of rehearsal on
this movie. We didn't talk about the scenes. We didn't talk about
what the dialogue meant. When we went to dinner, we never talked
about the day's work. The only exchange of comments would be, `That
felt good.' That was it.''

 &HT;    Can Sean Elliott stay hot for two weeks?
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When Sean Elliott walks into Portland's Rose
Garden today, certain dimensions might seem out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rims are going to look like the Grand Canyon to him,''
said Steve Kerr, Elliott's teammate with the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view from a hero's perch, where Elliott now stands
after hitting the game-winning three-point shot from 24 feet
against Portland on Monday, giving the Spurs a 2-0 lead in the NBA
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The shot _ Elliott's sixth three-pointer of the game _ was
off-balance, rushed and perhaps ill-conceived, considering that
Elliott had nine seconds to find a better one and that
7-foot-1-inch teammate David Robinson was waiting near the basket.
But it went in, and 20 minutes later Elliott said, ``I could do it
again now. I'm still feeling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why teammates Kerr and Mario Elie, who have won playoff
games for other teams with critical shots, think Elliott should be
able to ride this feeling for at least a few more games.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr made a name for himself by hitting a 17-foot jump shot with
five seconds left in game six of the 1997 NBA Finals to secure the
championship for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, you feel like anything you throw up is going to go
in,'' Kerr said. ``When Sean goes out Friday, he's going to feel
relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's six-for-seven accuracy on three-pointers Monday will
boost him more than if he had just made the one that everyone will
remember, Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you shoot like that, you gain confidence,'' Kerr
said. ``But when you do it in the playoffs, it even increases that
confidence more. Smart players, when they are playing, think about
situations where they've come through in the clutch.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie, playing for Houston, made a three-point shot in game seven
of the 1995 Western Conference semifinals to lift the Rockets past
Phoenix, giving his team momentum it carried all the way to a
second straight NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hit my three-pointer in Phoenix, I felt like every
shot was going in,'' Elie said.
</P>
<P>
   Elie has since been regarded as a dangerous clutch shooter, a
reputation he enhanced by hitting a last-second three-pointer to
beat the Rockets on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of sustained momentum, Elie notes the continued
success of Allan Houston, the New York guard whose running shot
eliminated Miami from the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, an inconsistent three-point shooter most of his career
_ he hit 32.8 percent this season _ said his confidence has
recently been building. He hit four of 10 three-pointers against
the Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels like a regular shot now,'' Elliott said.
``Instead of a long-distance shot, it feels like a 12-footer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr wishes he could say the same. Kerr is the most accurate
three-point shooter in NBA history _ 46.3 percent _ albeit as a
part-time player. But right now, the rim probably looks more like a
golf hole than the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr received his first serious playing time in the postseason
Monday, 11 minutes. Left open by the Blazers, he missed all five of
his shots, three from behind the arc. His body language after each
miss suggested agony and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Given sporadic playing time this season by coach Gregg Popovich,
primarily because of his liabilities on defense, Kerr never found a
groove, never shot consistently. He hit only 31.3 percent of his
three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has moved back into the rotation behind Avery Johnson at
point guard. Popovich told Kerr that he would receive more playing
time because Portland double-teams Tim Duncan and David Robinson so
well near the basket that the Spurs might need to rely more than
usual on outside shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop's always apologizing to me for a lack of playing time, and
I'm always apologizing for a lack of production,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Elliott, Kerr said that at some point the new hero
probably will have a game when he loses his shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the law of averages takes over,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   Having moved back into the spotlight himself, Kerr can only hope
so.

 &HT;    Berger's `Return of Little Big Man' worth your time
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Way back in the 1960s, when Thomas Berger's wonderfully original
take on the Wild American West, ``Little Big Man'' came out, first
as a book then as a movie starring Dustin Hoffman in the title
role, many people agreed with me that both versions were about as
good as books and movies come.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all these years later, when it was least expected, Berger
has produced a sequel, ``The Return of Little Big Man'' (Little,
Brown and Company) and, although it lacks the scintillating
surprise of the first one, this sequel is definitely worth your
time.
</P>
<P>
   And the good news _ the other good news, I should say _ is that
Berger has set himself up for yet a second sequel. The ancient
Little Big Man, after 432 pages of one tall tale after another,
declares, ``Right now, though, I got to take a nap. If I ever wake
up, you sure will hear the rest of my story.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Little Big Man book, as many of you may recall, found
Jack Crabb, the only survivor of Custer's Last Stand at Little Big
Horn, in a nursing home at age 100-and something, telling his life
story, how he was raised by Cheyenne Indians after they raided his
family's westward bound wagon, killing his parents and making off
with his older sister and him. His Indian name becomes Little Big
Man and he learns Cheyenne ways and becomes a rookie Cheyenne
warrior before being captured by white soldiers and returned to
``civilization'' where, among other things, he tangles with Wyatt
Earp and Wild Bill Hickok.
</P>
<P>
   Jack goes back and forth several times, from the white world to
the Indian world, as he is on the losing side in every battle
between the two. He is able to straighten out several Wild West
myths by relating what really happened because he was there.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of ``Little Big Man'', Jack's supposed death cuts
short his tale. However, a newly discovered manuscript reveals that
Jack faked his death to get out of his publishing contract, and, in
this sequel, picks up the amazing story of his life, giving
eyewitness accounts of the assassination of Wild Bill Hickok and
what really happend at the O.K. Corral. He also hangs out with Bat
Masterson and Annie Oakley and travels to Europe with Buffalo Bill
Cody.
</P>
<P>
   Jack falls in love, at last, near the end of this volume but
decides to wait to tell ``what became of me and her during the rest
of my life, what happened with her book, what kind of work I done
next and where, while technically speaking a middle-aged man, I had
lived not quite half my life at that point, so there's lots left to
relate to what still for some time was my competent years, with
quite a bit happening ...as the nineteenth century turned into the
twentieth, for example Tom Edison begun to make moving pictures to
be shown in theaters rather than just peep machines, gold was
discovered in the Klondike and Colonel Teddy Roosevelt's Rough
Riders fought at the battle of Santiago de Cuba, not on horseback
as you might think, but on foot and took a hill by the name of
Kettle and not San Juan....''
</P>
<P>
   So, we've got a lot to look forward to, if Jack doesn't drop
dead before he gets it told.
</P>
<P>
   And we will hope Berger continues to produce his Mark Twain-like
stories for a long time to come. As the London Times has declared,
``He is one of the century's most important writers.''

 &HT;    A letter to my daughter upon her graduation
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Dear Meredith:
</P>
<P>
   I guess this means I'll have to stop calling you Goose, now that
you're a high-school graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez. Where did the time go? In my mind you're still the little
brown-eyed girl in the photo in my office, wearing one of my
T-shirts as a dress, posed with your sister and her pet lamb. You
were 5, and everybody could tell you were my daughter because you
walk like me _ toes pointed out, bouncing up and down on the balls
of your feet.
</P>
<P>
   I nicknamed you Goose a few weeks after your birth. You just
pecked around, bright eyes following everything, and it seemed to
fit. You were a happy baby, always smiling and giggling.
</P>
<P>
   As you grew up, it was obvious you had a gift for the written
word. I remember when you had a poem published in a teen magazine
because your older sister fibbed and told them you were 13, even
though you were only 11. I still have the 20-page short story you
wrote at about age 9, called ``The Best Christmas Ever.'' I have a
file drawer half-filled with your stories, scripts for plays,
drawings and such.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my greatest pleasure these days comes from talking to
you about books we've both read. I wish I had your memory for
characters, dialogue and such. The older I get, the harder it is to
remember much about what I read two weeks after I've finished.
</P>
<P>
   You are the undisputed world champion of the Six Degrees of
Kevin Bacon parlor game, where someone names a movie and the other
person has to somehow connect it to Bacon through common actors in
six or fewer steps. Of course, you could have been bamboozling me
when I named some obscure film and you ripped through and connected
it to him in a matter of seconds. I know the names of about 10
actors, and the faces of a few more, and that's it. You, on the
other hand, are the queen of movies.
</P>
<P>
   You have lived half your life with me as a weekend dad living in
another house down the road a few miles. I know that's been hard,
but I hope you realize I tried to be the best father I could under
the circumstances. You did great, despite all the changes in your
life caused by us adults, especially me. I am so proud of what
you've accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's off to college, to join your sister at the University
of Texas. I know you're going to love it, and I know you'll do
well. I am thrilled that you plan to major in journalism, but if
you change your mind in a few semesters that's fine, too. Do what
makes you the happiest, what fulfills you the most. I'd be just as
proud of you if you decided to be an accountant. And you'd make
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some unsolicited advice.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be intimidated by the university. Sure, it's big, but
your world there will be relatively small. Just ignore the rest.
That worked great for me.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Avoid driving in Austin at all costs. Both driving and finding
your way around a big city are not your strong suits. Have you ever
heard the expression, ``Lost as a goose?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you do get lost, don't panic. Everybody has to be
somewhere. You're just not where you're supposed to be. You'll find
your way back.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't marry too young. I think 30 is about right. And when you
do get hitched, marry your best friend. It helps if your best
friend has lots of money, but it's not a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make new friends. Keep your old ones, of course, but that's
one of the joys of college _ meeting new people from other places.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be too trusting of strangers. You will be living in a
city of a million people, some of whom are scumbags. The percentage
is probably no higher than in our little town, but the numbers are
greater. Be cautious. Lock your doors. This is your father
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remember to call your mom and me regularly, not just when you
need money. And don't forget about your grandparents. I know you'll
be busy, but you should check in once in a while. And before you
call, remember we're all old and likely asleep after 10 p.m., hard
as that is to believe.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep reading and writing, no matter what you end up doing for
a living. God doesn't give out many natural gifts, and you should
take advantage of the ones you're given.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most important, keep your sense of humor. Life is funny, and
yours will take many unexpected twists. That's the way it goes.
Just don't take it all too seriously, and you'll live a happier and
likely longer life.
</P>
<P>
   Congrats, Goose. I'm proud of you.
</P>
<P>
   Love,
</P>
<P>
   Dad

   TRAVEL-PIGEONFORGE _ PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. _ The people who come
to Pigeon Forge, Tenn., and enjoy it _ including those folks in
folding chairs by the side of the road are unapologetic in their
pursuit of populist pleasure. Purist Tourists. They love this Bible
Belt Las Vegas, a city of spontaneous gernation that plopped out of
the Smokies three decades ago like Darwin's fish sprouting legs. A
working man's Magic Kingdom. As a tourist destination, it provokes
sharply polarized feelings; just mention the place in a crowd and
see how may eyes roll. Although the community sits smack in the
middle of one of the South's most profoundly spritual sights _ the
Smoky Mountains rising through the mist like silent humpback whales
there's virtually nothing natural within the Pigeon Forge city
limits. (M. Longino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

 &HT;    Is it over yet? The reasons this session was a snoozer
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's potential presidential
candidacy dominated the 1999 session of the Texas Legislature. And
it was one of the most boring sessions in memory _ which is
probably exactly what Bush wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's political ambitions were not the only thing that made
it a lackluster session. Other factors included:
</P>
<P>
   _ The absence of all-controlling former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock as
presiding officer of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $6.4 billion budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   _ The absence of any major crises, either from court suits or
lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's run for the White House didn't color everything, but it
colored a lot. It was a distraction because the news media paid a
lot of attention to it, casting _ rightly or wrongly _ many of
Bush's actions or inactions in the context of presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor's staff tries to paint it otherwise, Bush
paid less hands-on attention to Texas legislators than in previous
sessions. He was busy being briefed on national and international
issues, and receiving politicians and other supplicants from
elsewhere in the country to endorse his candidacy or kiss his ring.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, lobbyists said the governor's office seemed
much more interested in the fine print of many pieces of
legislation than in previous sessions. The speculation was he
wanted to be sure that most controversial measures were either
worked out well before they reached his desk, or, like the
hate-crimes bill, sidetracked so he wouldn't be forced to choose
whether to veto or sign the controversial measure.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Bullock no longer was the Senate's wagonmaster made
that body looser and less focused, as power was decentralized more
than it ever had been under Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   The budget surplus put the Legislature and Gov. Bush in the
comfortable position of dividing up extra money between various
state functions such as a teacher pay hike and tax cuts. There
would have been considerably more pressure had the legislators been
levying new taxes, as they had done more than once in the 1980s
after the oil bust, and as recently as 1991, when Democrat Ann
Richards was the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of major crises was in stark contrast to, for instance,
Richards' first term. In 1991, she was trying to pass a
constitutional amendment to allow a lottery; raising more than $8
billion in taxes; setting up the so-called Robin Hood school plan
to achieve equity in spending between school districts; and dealing
with legislative and congressional redistricting. By contrast, all
the 1999 Legislature had to pass was the appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some observers were amazed toward the end of last week
when Bush seemed to have put himself in the awkward position of
favoring an additional quarter-billion-dollar tax cut over spending
the money on early education.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the issue that might have precipitated a
special session. The Senate, with a 16-15 Republican majority,
eventually capitulated, for the most part, apparently taking its
lead from Bush. The realization must have sunk in about the public
relations damage possible to Bush's popularity _ particularly since
he claims education is his No. 1 issue.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the issue in the closing days that could have
forced Bush to call a special session _ particularly if he
continued to insist on additional tax cuts that would come out of
education money. But creative budgeteers found an extra $100
million at the end, and enough was spread around to let the Senate
and Bush save face.
</P>
<P>
   One lobbyist who is a former legislator said one wrinkle on the
absence of Bullock, who was usually into everything, was the frosty
relationship between Bullock's successor, Republican Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry, and Democratic House Speaker Pete Laney.
</P>
<P>
   While Bullock and Laney maintained constant communication and
were centrists who worked together on many issues, the more
ideological and less engaged Perry paid much less attention to the
House and its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Perry seemed ready to do anything he could to
make Bush look better. Small wonder; Perry's iron grip on Bush's
coattails was what allowed Perry to be lieutenant governor in the
first place. Making Bush look good enough that Americans put him in
the White House would also put Perry in the Governor's Mansion.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ If your house or apartment has floors, you need a
vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Regular vacuuming is critical to the lives of rugs and carpets,
and even hardwood, tile and stone floors benefit from having
abrasive dust and grit removed.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, just knowing you need a vacuum is not enough;
you have to figure out which of the hundreds of available models is
best for you.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Scott, owner of First Class Cleaning Service, said your
choice in a vacuum should be based on how you're going to use it.
How much carpeting do you have? How often do you plan to vacuum? Do
you also have many hard-surface floors? Will you be vacuuming to
clean furniture or draperies? Will you need to carry the vacuum up
and down stairs?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't pick a vacuum because it's the No. 1 model in the
country,'' Scott said. ``You don't just get the one your neighbor
has. You don't get the one with the best commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the tool that does the job you need it to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Christy Hawley, director of housekeeping at Homewood
Suite Hotel, said the vacuums their cleaning staff uses are
powerful commercial models designed for constant, heavy-duty use.
</P>
<P>
   But their commercial machines are designed mostly for floors
only, and Scott and Hawley both use ordinary residential vacuums at
home. Scott said he has a Sanyo vacuum at home while Hawley owns a
Dirt Devil.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy an upright vacuum cleaner for less than $100, or you
can easily spend more than $1,000. The construction, motor size,
filtration systems, advertising budget and extra features affect
how much you will pay.
</P>
<P>
   Below are explanations of some of the features you are likely to
find as you compare the upright vacuum cleaners on the market today
and questions you should ask before making a purchase:
</P>
<P>
   Bodies and attachments
</P>
<P>
   Most residential upright vacuum cleaners sold today have hard,
plastic bodies with attachments such as crevice tools stored in
slots or compartments on the plastic shell.
</P>
<P>
   The business end of the vacuum holds a rotating brush inside a
suction chamber. A hose leads from the suction chamber up over the
handle of the vacuum and into filtering and storage chamber that
captures dust and dirt and expels clean air.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the plastic in the body is an important
consideration. Thin, brittle plastics will break, while thick,
pliable plastics and metals will stand up to abuse, lengthening the
life of the appliance.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be impressed by the machine with the most attached
gadgets; look instead for attachments you're actually likely to
use. Are attachments conveniently located or are they likely to
fall off?
</P>
<P>
   Pay close attention to the length of the hose and any tubes or
wands used with the attachments. Are they easy to use and long
enough to reach the housing of your ceiling fans, for example?
</P>
<P>
   Hoses on modern vacuums can become clogged. Can the hose be
easily cleared of debris? Some machines have see-through hoses that
make spotting obstructions easy.
</P>
<P>
   Some vacuums come without attachments and are just designed to
sweep floors. You may find such machines, which can offer better
suction at lower prices, are all you need.
</P>
<P>
   Does the machine use bags or does it have a dirt chamber?
Replacing bags can be a hassle and add expense to the operation of
your machine, but dirt chambers can be messy to empty and clean.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult is it to remove accumulated dirt from the machine
you are considering?
</P>
<P>
   Are the belts that turn the beater/sweeper bar easily
accessible? How sturdy are the belts and how often must they be
replaced?
</P>
<P>
   How easy is the machine to maneuver? Is the handle in a
comfortable position when you're sweeping?
</P>
<P>
   Filtration
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fussnecker of Fussnecker Sweeper Sales and Service said one
feature that consumers are demanding more than ever is air
filtration.
</P>
<P>
   But microfiltration systems that sift allergens and even smells
from the air add complications and expense to vacuuming.
Manufacturers sometimes make confusing claims to try to convince
customers their vacuums release the cleanest air.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely heard term in air filtration is HEPA, which
stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestor or High-Efficiency
Particle Air, depending on who you talk to. To carry the
designation HEPA, a filter must meet specific criteria on the size
of the particles it blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many vacuums come with designations such as ``HEPA-like'' or
``high-efficiency'' or ``allergy-safe.'' To compare the filtration
claims of one manufacturer against another, look for percentages
and microns.
</P>
<P>
   A micron is a microscopic distance equal to 1/1000th of a
millimeter. A filter that removes 99 percent of the particles that
are 0.3 microns is more effective than a filter that removes 95
percent at 0.5 microns and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Superior filtration reduces the allergens the vacuum sprays into
the air and can reduce odors. Poor filtering can allow dust to blow
out of the vacuum and settle back in your house.
</P>
<P>
   To be really effective, the air that travels through the vacuum
must be contained in an airtight stream until it passes through all
the machine's filters. Does the vacuum you are considering have
efficient filters to block dust from its motor as well as from the
air?
</P>
<P>
   Remember that most microfilters come with cartridges, typically
costing $5 to $25, that must be replaced periodically. Find out how
often cartridges must be replaced and figure the replacement costs
of cartridges when figuring the cost of running your machine.
</P>
<P>
   Motors and suction
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the more powerful the motor, the greater the suction.
The greater the suction, the better the vacuum draws deep dirt out
of carpets and other things you're cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of motor power is the amp rating of the vacuum
cleaner. A 10-amp vacuum is more powerful than a 7-amp, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Fussnecker said vacuum manufacturers have been in an arms race
the past few years to offer machines with bigger motors. He said
most have settled on 10 amps and aren't likely to go much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is many household electrical systems have 15-amp
circuits, and vacuums with larger motors are more likely to
overload circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of competition between companies is in hyping their
air-moving systems. You'll run into wind tunnels, vortexes,
whirlwinds, cyclones and other descriptions of how vacuums create
suction.
</P>
<P>
   All these systems of directing air don't mean much unless the
vacuum picks up dirt.
</P>
<P>
   To compare one machine with another, you'll have to find a
retailer that will let you spread dirt on a test carpet and clean
it up with several models.
</P>
<P>
   Other options
</P>
<P>
   _ Height adjustment: Shag rugs are coming back into fashion, so
your vacuum should adjust quickly and easily to varying heights,
otherwise the brush can bite too deeply into the pile. Some vacuums
adjust automatically to changing carpet heights, but most use a
knob or sliding switch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brush cut-off: If you plan to use your vacuum on tile or
hardwood floors, you should look for this often-neglected feature.
The switch disengages the sweeper brush so you can sweep hard
floors without the brush spreading dirt around.
</P>
<P>
   _ Self-propelled: If you have trouble moving a vacuum cleaner
around, some come with internal motors that move the machine back
and forth with a slight push or pull on a control handle. This
feature may be useful for a few physically challenged users, but it
adds cost to the machine, and most modern vacuums are very easy to
maneuver without being self-propelled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dirt sensors: This may be just a fad, but a growing number of
vacuums come with sensors that use light beams or sound to sense
dirt as it enters the suction chamber. When no more dirt is
detected, the machine flashes a green light indicating your carpet
is clean.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suction control: Extremely powerful machines can actually
produce too much suction for some applications. For example, they
could pull a set of light kitchen curtains right off the rod. Area
rugs on hard-surface floors sometimes require less suction as well.
Suction adjustments that slow down the motor or open vents on
attachments make some jobs easier.

 &HT;    Gather ye at the dunking pond for Rep. Barr's edict
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Recruits, assume the position. Congressman Bob
Barr (the one with the penlight in his teeth) has arrived to
examine you.
</P>
<P>
   You say you want to join the Army? We want you. First, you'll
submit to this inspection of your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Christian? OK. Jew? Pass. Muslim? Approved. Wiccan? You are
hereby restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's the way Barr wants the U.S. Army to do
things. In fact, he's demanding it. After finding out that a group
of Wiccans was practicing the religion at Fort Hood under
permission from the U.S. government, Barr went into the hissiest of
fits. It turned out Fort Hood was just the first of several
military bases condoning the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, the U.S. government condoning all varieties of
spiritual beliefs. It's un-American. It must be stopped. And Barr
is the man to do it.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barr, recall, who led the without-sin brigade that
railroaded Bill Clinton into impeachment proceedings. We were asked
to disregard information about the Georgia Republican's own
indiscretions, pulsating on Larry Flynt's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Now the righteous congressman wants us to get exercised over the
way Wiccans _ they do not shrink from ``witch'' _ exercise their
religion on military bases. Nip this in the bud, he tells the
Pentagon. Base commanders are ignoring Barr at this point, which
pretty much puts them in line with most rank-and-file civilians in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wicca is a neo-pagan, nature-based sect, tax-exempt as a
religion in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Barr isn't interested in ousting Wiccans, just in
prohibiting their rituals. This would be a trick. Consider for the
moment what it would entail if the military were to ban, say,
Christian rituals. Would a clasping of hands before the face
violate the code of conduct? Would a heavenward nod?
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that allowing Wiccan rituals on-base undermines
military readiness, ``to say nothing of detrimental effects on our
society'' and the military's upholding the ``spirit of 'God and
country,''' failing to properly attribute late, beloved holy man
Ayatollah Khomeini for the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of being denounced as giving aid and comfort to
infidels, Congressman Chet Edwards, whose district includes Fort
Hood, had a measured response: ``It would be terrible policy to
require each installation commander to define what is a religion
and decide which religions can be practiced by American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrible policy for military commanders, right. But it can be
good politics for self-righteous hand-wringers who truly appear to
think that government can and should authorize religious beliefs _
and that it's the majority's duty to impose its beliefs on the
minority in matters of state (and, of course, school). These people
really need to find a hobby. Totem carving, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   It should amaze all to think that people could go to Washington
and not find better ways to spend their time than finding ways for
government to control free thoughts and expression.
</P>
<P>
   The perennial push for an anti-flag desecration amendment suits
these folks fine. They want the law to delineate how one can
comport oneself around a symbol, disregarding the fact that a
symbol can take countless forms, on fabric, on paper, on
undershorts. You can skywrite a symbol. You can paint it on your
belly for the hockey game. You can print it on Silly Putty and
stretch it and compress it and bounce it off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   A law defining illegal acts involving a symbol seemingly would
be as long as the New York phone book. The same goes for a code of
prohibited religious rituals on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers have nothing better to do, government really has
become the problem.

`INSTINCT' IMITATES TRUE DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Watching the earnest ridiculousness of
``Instinct,'' alternative titles flood the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Lecter Goes Ape'' is an obvious one for this tale of a
brilliant primatologist played by Anthony Hopkins who turns
homicidal after spending too much time in the company of African
mountain gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams Goes to Prison'' _ hey, like the ring of that one
_ is another. Cuba Gooding Jr., as the psychiatrist trying to get
to the bottom of the researcher's mania, decides to uplift the
spirits of all the criminally insane inmates on his patient's cell
block, thus bringing oppressed-little-guy-vs.-heartless-institution
demagogy to surreal new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about ``I'm OK, You're OK, but I Really Prefer Animals to
People''? This film is basically about two lonely, emotionally
distant professionals who reach out and touch one another under
extraordinary circumstances. One of them unapologetically murdered
a bunch of Rwandans, but by gosh, he had his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When Hopkins' wild-haired, pre-verbally grunting Ethan Powell is
repatriated from Africa to an overcrowded Florida prison, hotshot
university shrink Theo Caulder (Gooding) figures to make his career
_ and a sweet book deal _ by bringing the scientist back to
conversational mode. Relatively fearless _ Caulder gets close to
Powell in ways correctional authorities and anyone who's seen
``Silence of the Lambs'' wouldn't dare to _ the young analyst soon
has the old apeman chattering away.
</P>
<P>
   They bond. Powell's resentful daughter Lyn (``NewsRadio's''
Maura Tierney) can't believe it; dad always kept his distance from
her, even before his simian regression.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Powell eventually tells Caulder what really happened in
that mountainous jungle. Hopkins describes the events with
mesmerizing aplomb, but his vocal dexterity can't save the story
from painful predictability, both narrative-wise and in its
unexamined, nature's nicer than mankind morality. Nevertheless,
Caulder is deeply moved and risks his career on rescuing, rather
than just explaining, his new friend.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, anyone with any sense can see that Powell should
not be rescued. However brilliant he is and emotionally
understandable the circumstances of his crime may have been, he is
still dangerously violent. We may come to understand, feel for,
perhaps even admire Powell, but Hopkins is too good at giving the
man a feral edge for us to ever feel safe about him running around
loose.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jon Turteltaub, however, marshals every trick in the
Hollywood manipulation manual to try to make us feel good about the
prospect. Turteltaub does easily digestible warm glow movies such
as ``Phenomenon'' and ``While You Were Sleeping,'' and he seems to
believe that the same kind of fake sensitivity those movies thrived
on can be as profitably applied to the deeper, much darker subject
matter ``Instinct'' explores.
</P>
<P>
   It can't, despite mighty efforts on Hopkins' and, to a lesser
extent, Gooding's part to take the material as seriously as it
demands. In the final analysis, though, ``Instinct'' only apes real
drama. &UR;  &QL;

LEFT IN A STATE OF `LIMBO' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most movies have endings. Some of them aren't
satisfying; many stretch the limits of plausibility. A few films
finish on an ambiguous note, leaving the audience to wonder what
might happen immediately after the final dissolve. But most of the
time, filmmakers throw us a bone and try to tie things up in a way
that sends us shuffling off to the lobby with the feeling that
we've seen a story _ good, bad or mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' doesn't have an ending. And it doesn't have much of a
story, either. The advertisements for this dreary disappointment
define the word ``limbo'' as a condition of unknowable outcome.
Hence, filmmaker John Sayles gives us an open-ended finale that is
intended to be haunting and profound, but comes off instead as
precious and somewhat frustrating. (For satisfying ambiguity, check
out ``Besieged.'')
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick would be even more vexing to viewers if they cared
about the story. (Interest begins to wane a good 30 minutes before
the, um, ``conclusion.'') Still, Sayles' failure to resolve the
plot prompted much derision from the audience. A few stayed in
their seats, resolutely believing that the projectionist must have
dropped a reel or that the film would pick up again after the
credits concluded. Wrong and wrong. (A mixed blessing.)
</P>
<P>
   Like other Sayles films such as ``Matewan,'' ``Lone Star'' and
``Passion Fish,'' ``Limbo'' looks at a specific place and the
diverse groups of people who call it home. Here, it's Alaska,
America's last frontier and a significantly under-used setting for
movies. Sadly, Sayles, who filmed mostly around Juneau, doesn't
manage to capture much of the state's character.
</P>
<P>
   The film's first hour mixes character introductions with some
rather heavy-handed sociopolitical commentary. We encounter the
film's three main individuals: Fortysomething singer Donna De
Angelo (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and her beleaguered teen-age
daughter Noelle (Vanessa Martinez) and a sad-sack former fisherman,
Joe Gastineau (Sayles veteran David Strathairn).
</P>
<P>
   They meet at an outdoor wedding. Donna is the singer with the
reception band. It's her last gig with the group; she kisses off
her boyfriend/bandleader with a funny song called ``Better Off
Without You.'' (The formally trained Mastrantonio has a lovely
voice, reminiscent of a shopworn Emmylou Harris.) She gets Joe to
help her move her belongings and, during this initial encounter,
indicates she thinks he's an OK guy. Soon, Joe is showing up at her
lounge shows.
</P>
<P>
   They've all been through the wringer. Sayles makes the point
rather obvious by having a tour guide often describe Alaska as a
place for ``desperate men and desperate times.'' (The sign of a
desperate filmmaker?)
</P>
<P>
   Donna has horrifically poor taste in men, and her relationship
with her daughter has suffered for it. Noelle, a gifted
storyteller, has taken to self-mutilation. Joe gave up fishing 25
years ago after an accident with his boat took two passengers'
lives. His idea of a fun first date? He takes Donna to the mouth of
a river where migrating salmon die.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of peripheral subplots involving slimy
developers looking to turn Alaska into a theme park and yokel
tourists appreciating a synthesized frontier instead of the real
thing. There are spats between old-timers and newcomers and much
talk of second chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo's'' leisurely tone takes a sudden shift in its second
hour when Joe's shady brother (Casey Siemaszko) returns to town
with a dangerous plan. At this point, Sayles leaves his treatises
behind for sheer suspense. Unfortunately, he's out of his element
here, and the movie slogs to its eventual state of limbo rather
uneventfully.
</P>
<P>
   It's all pretty cheerless, the cinematic equivalent of a long
winter's night in Alaska. Certainly it's Sayles' darkest hour. &QL;

RECORDING SESSION LEADS TO DYNAMIC DOCUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Buena Vista Social Club'' documents one of
life's happy bits of justice. A group of elderly Cuban musicians,
largely forgotten in their home country, band together, record an
album and become an international sensation. Director Wim Winders
follows these masters into the recording studio and concert hall,
recording their stories along with the transforming beauty of music
that may be on the verge of disappearing altogether.
</P>
<P>
   This splendid documentary also captures the faded beauty of a
crumbling Havana, which is filmed by Wenders in a hypersaturated
color that accentuates the island's sultry sensuality. Politics are
never specifically discussed here, but then, it's understood that
the Cuban revolution brushed these men aside in favor of younger
musicians who played different styles. That neglect gives the film
an understated melancholia, a sense of time and talent wasted for
too many years.
</P>
<P>
   American guitar great Ry Cooder originally went to Havana three
years ago to record a traditional album of sones and boleros with
musicians from Cuba and Mali. The Africans didn't make it; they
were hung up with visa problems. So Cooder searched out the
old-timers, discovering that many of them had abandoned their music
because nobody wanted to listen. The album they made, also titled
``The Buena Vista Social Club,'' sold 1.5 million copies, won a
Grammy and turned its musicians into international stars.
</P>
<P>
   The movie shows the group in the recording studio a year later,
preparing an album featuring 71-year-old singer Ibrahim Ferrer.
Wenders also mixes in footage of two concerts, one in Amsterdam,
the other last July at Carnegie Hall along with intimate portraits
of the musicians themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Wenders couldn't have asked for better documentary subjects. The
sweet, shy Ferrer lives in a run-down apartment where he keeps an
altar to St. Lazarus. Ferrer keeps the shrine stocked with rum,
honey and perfume. ``I suppose I like it _ he does, too,'' he says,
adding he knew that some day his fortunes would change because of
this faith.
</P>
<P>
   Pianist Ruben Gonzalez, 80, had not played for years, and many
thought him to be dead or incapacitated by arthritis. Not true _ he
just couldn't afford a piano. Cooder calls Gonzalez ``the greatest
piano soloist'' he has ever heard, and Wenders beautifully reveals
the graceful music from this extraordinary man.
</P>
<P>
   There's also 91-year-old composer and singer Compay Segundo, who
has five children and jokes that he's trying for a sixth; stand-up
bass player Orlando Lopez Vergara (``Cachaito''), nephew of
legendary bassist Israel ``Cachao'' Lopez; and Cooder and his son,
percussionist Joachim, reveling in the kind of collaboration that
comes along maybe once in a musician's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Wenders mostly lets the musicians and their songs speak for
themselves. The movie slowly builds toward its shining climax _ the
Carnegie Hall concert and scenes of the wide-eyed musicians roaming
the streets of New York, amazed at the enormity and wealth of their
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   One moment alone _ the tears in Ferrer's eyes as the standing
ovation from an appreciative Carnegie Hall audience washes over him
_ makes this movie a gem. But Wenders shows us many such scenes of
aching radiance. This movie, like the music these virtuosos made,
is a testament to the power and beauty of art created from passion.
Savor it now and pass it along to someone you love. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Magic realism, British wit and romantic fantasies
get the ``Sliding Doors'' treatment in ``Twice Upon a Yesterday,''
a breezy delight about second chances that understands the psyche
as well as it does the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Its main character, Victor (Douglas Henshall), is a lovable
lout, a starving actor sharing a London flat with his smart,
beautiful girlfriend Sylvia (Lena Headey). They've been together
for several years, much to the chagrin of Sylvia's friends who
think she can do better. Watching Victor dry his underwear in the
microwave, you can see their point.
</P>
<P>
   Victor is also sleeping with another woman, an actress. Sensing
something is wrong, Sylvia confronts him. Victor confesses and is
summarily dismissed from the apartment. ``Perhaps I loved him too
much,'' Sylvia laments.
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Victor, though, realizes that he didn't appreciate a good thing
when he had it and tries to win back Sylvia's love. But, she has
moved on to another man, Dave (Mark Strong), who is everything
Victor wasn't. (Example: He actually listens when she tells him
about her day.)
</P>
<P>
   All seems lost until Victor runs into a couple of Spanish
garbage men straight out of ``Don Quixote.'' These Quixote and
Sancho Panza figures cast some sort of a spell and Victor finds
himself transported nine months back in time (he wakes up in the
middle of the Notting Hill Carnival _ how's that for synergy?),
before his affair and before Sylvia removed him from her life.
</P>
<P>
   That's the set-up and first-time director Maria Ripoll, working
from a screenplay from Spanish novelist Rafa Russo, deftly blends
the surreal touches with the emotional reality of the
relationships. The story has a Latin feel straight out of Gabriel
Garcia Marquez story, which actually mixes quite well with the
self-effacing, dry wit of its talented English leads.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the film's second-chance scenario is the
way it takes several unexpected and intelligent twists. Trying to
turn himself into the perfect man, Victor loses much of the unkempt
charm that made him so attractive. But he learns a lesson or two in
the process, which captivates another beautiful woman, Louise
(Penelope Cruz).
</P>
<P>
   Could Victor go back in time only to fall for another woman?
It's one of the movie's many intriguing possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'' is the rare movie where you actually
watch characters grow and discover themselves. Much credit belongs
to the creative team of director Ripoll and writer Russo, who
display a strong sensitivity to the film's relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The acting is also uniformly good, with Cruz again establishing
herself as an actress worth watching. You simply can't take your
eyes off her. You'll feel the same about everything in this
delightful movie. &QL;

A ROAR AGAINST TEEN APATHY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Whenever I speak to groups of high school kids, I
always deliver the same message:
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure, politics is boring, and I know you don't care about
it. That's because, for all its warts, the system generally works
pretty well these days. You don't care about politics because life
is good. If you don't pay close attention to the people who hold
down public office, though, they can make life Hell for you.
</P>
<P>
   How do I know that? Because I lived through a particularly
outrageous blunder called the Vietnam War that cost 58,000 American
lives. Trust me, I always tell the kids, you ignore the political
process at your personal peril.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them listen. That's why I was so pleased recently when I
saw a school paper written by an 18-year-old Shenendehowa High
School senior named Amanda Bird. That's a big, regional high school
in the comfortable Albany suburb of Clifton Park. On May 18, school
districts across New York state held school board and budget votes.
Bird went to the polling place at Gowana Junior High School, on the
sprawling Shenendehowa campus, to cast her first ballot ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I had stepped foot into Gowana,'' she wrote, ``I
was lanky with glasses and braces ... Now was my time to shine! I
was about to vote, and people had to listen to my opinion whether
they liked it or not ...
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents directed me to a table where a very sweet senior
citizen talked with me and explained what I had to do. My mother
was allowed to come into the booth with me to `show me the ropes.'
At first, I just stood and stared at the maze of switches in
wonder. Then I focused and snapped down my decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled back the lever, stepped out of the booth and smiled.
My very first voting experience. I had no idea if my votes would
make any difference, but I had done my job. I had done everything
in my personal power to give my opinion ...
</P>
<P>
   ``On the ride home, I pondered the results of the night. I
really had no comprehension what a good turnout was. I noticed that
there were people at every booth and a variety of ages had turned
up to vote. I am not sure what I expected from this experience.
Would it be a life-changing event? In a way, yes, it had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no turning back. Now, I am an adult. I am able to
vote on the presidencies now. (There certainly won't be another
Bill Clinton if I have anything to do about it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may find it scary to think of me, Amanda Bird as an
adult. They will just have to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am woman, hear me roar.''
</P>
<P>
   You know what? I just love it when they roar like that.
</P>

'TIS THE SEASON FOR BERRY GOOD EATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As kitchen disasters go, having too many
strawberries isn't one. And after a day in the pick-your-own
fields, just about everyone has too many berries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we find people get more stuff than they want, no matter
what (crop) it is,'' said Dave Bowman, owner of Bowman Orchards in
Malta, N.Y. ``Especially if they bring kids with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Children seem to like berries best just picked, unwashed, in the
field. ``We can tell because they come out with red stains all
around their mouths,'' Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep strawberries fresher longer, cover the unwashed berries
with plastic wrap and place them in the refrigerator as soon as
possible after picking, Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortcakes and pies are favorite uses for strawberries, but here
are a few more ideas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Strawberry-stuffed French toast. Combine 1/2 cup sliced
strawberries, 1 tablespoon sugar and an 8-ounce package of softened
cream cheese in a bowl. Spread the mixture on six slices of French
or Italian bread. Top with six more slices of bread. Combine three
eggs, 1/4 cup milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla and a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
in a pie plate. Dip the ``sandwiches'' in egg mixture and fry in
melted butter until golden brown. Serve topped with confectioners'
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strawberry-chocolate milk shakes. This recipe serves two and
was adapted from ``The Ghirardelli Chocolate Cookbook'': Dump 1 cup
sliced strawberries, 1 cup vanilla ice cream, 2 tablespoons
Ghirardelli sweet ground chocolate and cocoa, and 3/4 cup milk into
a blender and hit the puree button until mixture is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strawberry salad: Combine 1/4 cup oil, 3/4 cup red-wine
vinegar, 2 teaspoons brown sugar, 1 teaspoon garlic salt and 1/2
teaspoon sesame seeds in a jar. Shake well. Place cleaned salad
greens in a bowl. Top with grated carrots and strawberries. Drizzle
with dressing.
</P>
<P>
   FRUIT SOUP
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 6 servings)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the fat-laden, cream-based soups more commonly made from
fruit, this refreshing concoction combines fruit in a clear, spiced
broth. Pair with muffins or popovers for a light lunch. From
``Splendid Soups,'' by James Peterson (Bantam, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, cut in half lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4-inch-thick piece fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 star anise, crushed
</P>
<P>
   1 (2-inch) cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 quart water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1 mango, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 papaya, peeled, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   2 kiwis, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 pint strawberries, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pineapple, peeled, cored and diced
</P>
<P>
   Combine the vanilla bean, ginger, anise, cinnamon, sugar, water
and orange juice in a 4-quart pot with a tight-fitting lid. Bring
mixture to a slow simmer. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from
heat and let cool. Strain broth through a strainer, discarding
spices.
</P>
<P>
   Combine fruit and syrup in a mixing bowl and chill for an hour.
Serve in chilled bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can make the broth ahead and chill but for best
results, dice and mix the fruit at the last minute.

 &HT;    48 hours in Pigeon Forge: Whirlwind visit to the land of
Dollywood finds that kitsch plus creativity equals fun
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, June6.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. _ Twenty five years ago, this strip of U.S.
441 was mostly cow pastures, a place you drove through on the way
to look at the quilt of fall leaves in the Smokies or to watch
candy makers pop out nutty pralines in Gatlinburg. But that tourist
town was geographically limited, walled in on all four sides by the
permanent boundaries of the great Smoky Mountains National Park. As
more people spilled into the area with money in their pockets, tiny
Pigeon Forge, just five miles away, got moving.
</P>
<P>
   A few souvenir stands popped up, such as the wonderfully tacky
Hill-Billy Village, enticing visitors to ``See Moonshine Stills
Free!!'' Then came an amusement park known by many names _ Rebel
Railroad, Gold Rush Junction, Silver Dollar City _ before it was
taken over by country queen (and hometown girl) Dolly Parton.
Dollywood became one of the mountains' most popular attractions,
and soon it begat more motels, which begat outlet malls, which
begat other amusements, which begat more motels. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 11 million tourists spend $615 million here
each year. The greatest number of visitors zoom in from Atlanta,
just four hours beyond the Perimeter up I-75.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, I decided to see what it's like to take a
quickie vacation in this fast-growing mountain mecca. Although
there are overwhelming choices in what to see and do, I opted to go
for a mix of as many attractions and food spots as possible (which
often made me feel like I was racing through a supermarket on a
game show shopping spree).
</P>
<P>
   To help you plan your trip, I've assigned grades, but keep this
in mind _ any experience here is as subjective as your favorite
color of neon.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting around: The first thing I notice as I turn onto the
Parkway, the main drag, is the wall of traffic. There are so many
cars inching their way through town it's like watching a mouse
being digested down the belly of a python. There's only one main
road, and merchants have fought plans for a bypass. Most of the
folks sitting in all these cars know what they're getting into: 78
percent are repeat visitors, according to Pigeon Forge Department
of Tourism surveys.
</P>
<P>
   It's immediately clear that a huge part of my weekend is going
to be spent sitting in traffic. I'll have to add at least 30
minutes onto any drive, as it could very well take 45 minutes to an
hour to get from one end of the five-mile Parkway to the other. I
tune in to WDLY-FM, kick back and listen to George Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D- (F if not for WDLY)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lodging: Thank God I have reservations, because there are few
vacancy signs on the more than five dozen motels that line the
road. I picked the Quality Inn, a five-story motel on the edge of
the great Smoky Mountains National Park, mainly because the chain
always has in-room coffeemakers and cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   If you're expecting valet parking, a bellboy, room service or a
little piece of chocolate on your pillow at night, Pigeon Forge
isn't for you. The fanciest amenity is an in-room Jacuzzi, which
every motel _ even ones that look like they might not have indoor
plumbing _ seems to offer. No doubt that's because 2,500 couples
get married here each year in Vegas-like chapels that dot the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   My room _ with a Jacuzzi that sits in the middle of the floor
like an altar, across from a gas-burning fireplace _ is pricey
compared with most in Pigeon Forge. It's $95 a night, dropping to
$65 on weekdays. But its proximity to the park offers a decent view
of the gateway to the mountains on the tiny balcony. There are
dozens of other motels whose rooms go for as little as $55 on
weekends ($35 Monday through Thursday), allowing parents a fairly
inexpensive family getaway.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dianna Harris from Sugar Hill is here with 32
family members to celebrate her parents' 50th wedding anniversary.
The clan has rented a downstairs meeting room to ``play cards and
get together.'' They spill out into the parking lot as darkness
falls, laughing and sipping soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lee Greenwood's Portrait of America: Greenwood's theater is
the first you spot driving in from the interstate, a hulking
monument in a motel/restaurant complex called River Bluff Landing.
</P>
<P>
   Country music fans will remember Greenwood as the former Vegas
lounge singer who became a Nashville hitmaker in the '80s. In the
'90s, however, the hits dried up. In 1996, he and investors sank
$10 million into this theater and launched a Vegas-style show based
loosely on Greenwood's most famous hit, ``God Bless the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8 p.m. show is about half full, peopled mostly by tour bus
groups welcomed by a cheery emcee: ``Chester County Seniors, say
hey!'' Then Greenwood, backed by a gaggle of buoyant young singers
and dancers, takes us on a ``red, white and blue tour of America.''
The 2 1/2 hours of song and dance is like fast-forwarding through
``American Bandstand'' and ``That's Entertainment'' simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   A Motown trio gyrates through ``Get Ready.'' Dancers do Agnes de
Mille in a quickie version of ``Oklahoma.'' A group dressed like
the Blues Brothers belts out ``Soul Man.'' Greenwood pops in and
out of the show for the really big numbers, usually as grandiose as
wind sweeping down the plain. At one point, he appears on a balcony
in mask and cape warbling ``Music of the Night'' from ``Phantom of
the Opera.'' Then Greenwood and cast compress ``West Side Story''
into a less-than-10-minute medley. Of course, the grand finale is
``God Bless the U.S.A.'' complete with giant flag and silhouette of
the Iwo Jima flag-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the show comes off as excessive and overproduced, kind
of like eating three hot fudge cakes from Shoney's.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of food, the Chicken Provencal, $14.95, next door at
LG's (Greenwood's restaurant) is surprisingly good, the best meal I
had all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An unexpected lullaby: I'm back at the motel by 11 p.m. Out my
window somewhere in the night, a bluegrass gospel group is singing,
``When I get to heaven/ I'll put on a crown and walk around/ All
over the promised land.'' Compared to the razzle-dazzle of the
Greenwood show, this is beautiful, as if the spirits of the Smokies
are singing me to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Alan Jackson's Showcar Cafe: The biggest breakfast crowd by
far this morning overflows this round restaurant, which features
``authentic home-
</P>
<P>
   style recipes from Alan's Mama's kitchen.'' This cavernous
eating spot, a temple to the yee-haw country artist from Newnan,
lends new meaning to the term ``cult of personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's pinup face is everywhere _ on T-shirts, jewelry, door
posters, a giant video screen playing nonstop hits, childhood
snapshots in every booth, even golf balls. I almost expect to see
Jackson's blond mane materializing in the biscuits and gravy like
the Shroud of Turin.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Mahoney from Surgoinsville, Tenn., making her ``seventh
or eighth'' trip to Pigeon Forge this year, says she's here today
``to see the man with the perfect body. Ooooh, I love them legs!''
</P>
<P>
   Holy cow. Turns out Jackson is indeed due to make his first-ever
appearance at the restaurant. By the time he launches into a
20-minute concert in the parking lot, fans and traffic virtually
shut down the Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+ (but only if
</P>
<P>
   you're a Jackson fan)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Applewood Farmhouse Restaurant: Sorry, even Mama's pancakes
aren't worth the crowd at Jackson's place. Instead, I head over to
this quaint little white clapboard house that sits off the main
road overlooking the Little Pigeon River. The waitress (dressed in
gingham, natch) seats us immediately, then hauls out a chuckwagon
full of country ham, grits, biscuits, applesauce muffins, apple
fritters and apple butter for just $7.25. Even Granny would be
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Outlet shopping: Dollywood may get most of the publicity, but
Pigeon Forge tourism statistics show that most people come here to
shop at the town's six outlet malls, boasting more than 200 stores.
These complexes feature the usual suspects: Anne Klein, Eddie
Bauer, Coach, Geoffrey Beene, Nike, Samsonite, Corning/Revere, the
Gap. You can find most of this merchandise within a stone's throw
of Atlanta, but there's just something about being on vacation that
makes you want to fill your kitchen cabinets with every possible
piece of
</P>
<P>
   Pfaltzgraff.
</P>
<P>
   I stop into the one discount store I've never seen before: the
Cross Outlet, under the orange-roofed Z-Buda Outlet Mall, just a
couple of doors down from Mountain Man Military Supplies. Yes, you
can actually buy just about any kind of cross of Protestant design
or taste imaginable here _ puff, 3-D, the coveted white gold, ones
with little pink roses twirling up the sides, as well as cross
rings and earrings.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A (for the overall
</P>
<P>
   outlet experience)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hill-Billy Village: Along with Pigeon Forge Pottery, this is
the town's oldest tourist attraction, a yellow-and-red trinket
market straight out of Al Capp's Dogpatch, a kitschy shrine of
political incorrectness. You can buy stuffed Smoky Mountain black
bears, Indian tomahawks, Dixie flag wall hangings, ceramic praying
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Burl, a radiologist from Berea, Ky., tries on a black
felt hillbilly hat with a corncob pipe stuck in the brim. ``It's
what you have to buy when you come to the Smokies,'' she says and
laughs.

ANOTHER ABSURDITY FROM A STUPID WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are countless absurdities in the
undeclared war we are waging against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   They range from the incredible _ military maps with the Chinese
embassy's old address on them _ to the overlooked. For example,
this by David Rieff in the New Republic magazine:
</P>
<P>
   ``The stupidest thing about this stupid war is that, for all
their talk of primordial attachment to Kosovo, almost no Serb
actually wants to live there.''
</P>
<P>
   To the pile of absurdities, add a phrase that already has become
a cliche in the language of the Kosovo ``situation.'' It has been
uttered by everyone from President Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair to the red-hots who regularly call in to radio
talk shows. Most recently, Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., said it
while discussing the deployment of NATO ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Like the bombing, Tauscher said, ground forces may be part of
what it takes to cause ``Mr. Milosevic to come to his senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the evil and black-hearted Slobodan Milosevic will abide
by the international peace agreement and end the conflict, as his
government pledged on Thursday to do.
</P>
<P>
   He will order the withdrawal of his soldiers from Kosovo. He'll
call a halt to the brutal and immoral miniholocaust that he has
waged to ``cleanse'' Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. And he'll do
nothing to stop the installation of gun-toting peacekeepers who can
oversee the safe return of Kosovo Albanians to their looted and
burned-out homes.
</P>
<P>
   Why will he do this? Perhaps one sortie too many of U.S.
aircraft will have taken out one too many Belgrade power station or
one too many of the summer homes of one too many of Milosevic's
closest pals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Milosevic's toughest general will have looked him in the
eye and told him that the latest inventory shows that the Yugoslav
army hasn't enough ammo and facilities to defeat the Campfire Girls
in a sustained ground war.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that NATO's missiles and soldiers will not cause,
however, is ``Mr. Milosevic'' to ``come to his senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Cave in? Capitulate? Cry ``uncle''? Promise to be a good boy and
a model war crimes defendant _ all the while crossing his fingers
behind his back? He could do any of these.
</P>
<P>
   But come to his senses? How can anyone _ even a congresswoman _
say such a thing with a straight face?
</P>
<P>
   Every time I hear another somber pol repeat the phrase, the same
metaphoric image leaps to mind: Distinguished-looking men and women
stand around a dog house, beating and battering its roof and walls
with baseball bats. Ten feet away, a vicious pitbull with rabies
sits and watches them.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asks the people what they are doing, they point to
the dog and say, ``We're trying to make him come to his senses.''
</P>
<P>
   If people like Tauscher truly believe that this bloody,
often-backfiring NATO campaign can actually bring a mean,
calculating SOB like Milosevic to his senses, our government is in
worse shape than I ever dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't believe it but they keep using the phrase because
it sounds nicer and more civilized than something like ``quit,''
``knuckle under'' or ``surrender,'' they need to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade is in tatters; much of Eastern Europe already feels the
economic reversal that the NATO air raids have caused, and hundreds
of thousands of the very people we want to help are living in
abject misery in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't ``the situation'' in Kosovo use one less absurdity?

<P>
   PIGEON FORGE, Tenn.:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Carbo's Police Museum: The sign screams ``See Buford Pusser's
Death Car.'' I have to stop. And sure enough, the remains of the
famous Tennessee sheriff's Corvette Stingray are here, under glass,
burnt to a crisp. So are his whup-ass sticks, and his XL
navy-and-white polyester shirt. For the $5.88 admission you can
also see a colossal collection of police hats, badges, radar guns,
billy clubs, framed photos of George Wallace and ``confiscated
items'' such as an ice pick made out of a wooden Coke bottle
opener. The whole place is lit by eerie red lights. I watch
``Cops,'' but this is a little too creepy for even my quirky
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Alabama Grill: Another celebrity theme restaurant, this
one a monument to the country group Alabama. Pictures of the boys
from Fort Payne are everywhere, including a massive mural in the
front lobby that looks like something painted by high school kids
on the gymnasium wall. There are lots of photos of other
celebrities and their memorabilia, such as a framed shot of Irlene
Mandrell on the cover of Gun World magazine. The food is mostly
burger fare. Somehow, this doesn't seem as much fun as Jackson's
joint, but maybe my home's not in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stages West Western Store: Want to get married but have
nothing to wear? This store with the Dodge City facade boasts an
entire wall of white, Western-wear wedding dresses with fringe for
$451. There's also a good collection of Western arts and crafts. I
found a pair of great pillow shams mimicking the old Roy Rogers
bedspreads from the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Comedy Barn: This huge, pink-and-yellow barn looks like
something off the set of ``Hee Haw,'' probably because it was the
home of the old cornfield comic himself, Archie Campbell, who used
to perform here during breaks from filming the TV show. It now
presents a comedy revue with skits so corny they could have been
written by Porter Wagoner bassist-comic ``Speck'' Rhodes (remember
the guy with the bolo hat and blacked-out teeth?). There's also
country music, a ventriloquist, fire jugglers, Arnold the
Mind-Reading Pig, a guy dressed up like Granny Clampett who plays
``Orange Blossom Special'' on the fiddle, and a puppet named Duffy
who hosts the whole shebang.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, this is cheesier than anything Kraft
packages, the equivalent of a clown trying desperately to make kids
pay attention at a Saturday morning birthday party. But halfway
into the show, I find myself laughing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Even when comic Stephen Knowles yanks 60-year-old John Cory
onstage, straps a Julio Iglesias mask on his face and makes him
lip-sync to ``To All the Girls I've Loved Before.'' The Marietta
convenience store owner is so game, he buys the souvenir video of
this very show for $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tastebuds Cafe: On a tip, I head up Ware's Valley Road to what
has been touted as Pigeon Forge's only gourmet restaurant. But it
doesn't depart from the mood entirely _ Tastebuds is in a
double-wide trailer. This tiny eatery, owned and operated by chef
Giacomo ``Jock'' Lijoi, turns out to be an intimate, tasty and
entertaining departure from Pigeon Forge's usual.
</P>
<P>
   Waiter Donnie Rudder humors us with his Elvis impersonation _
``Thank you, thank you very much'' _ and cajoles the diners at the
dozen tables to shout ``hello'' to customers as they walk in the
door. And the food, continental cuisine with some regional fare
including grilled pork chops, is delicious. Plus, since Pigeon
Forge is dry, you can brown bag a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Louise Mandrell Theater: As the sun sets, it's time to head
back down the Parkway to Mandrell's ornate palace, where a huge
neon sign constantly flashes the claim: ``The Smokies Most
Spectacular Show!!'' They use a lot of exclamation points here in
Pigeon Forge, and Mandrell's three-hour fiesta is the biggest one
of all. It turns out to be one of the best halftime shows I've ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Mandrell saws on her fiddle until smoke comes pouring out
(literally). She does backflips while swing dancing. She dons a
camouflage military uniform and scales netting like she's heading
to Parris Island. The show-
</P>
<P>
   stopper is when Mandrell shimmies into a NASCAR uniform and
drives a race car onstage, where it is hoisted in the air only to _
blam! _ disappear in an explosion of lights and smoke. The
extravaganza ends, of course, with a patriotic tribute and huge
American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I would've preferred fire twirling.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Robert F. Thomas Church in the Valley: Pigeon Forge is
unusually silent this morning, probably since so many of the people
who visit are religious. So I decide to go to church _ at, of all
places, Dollywood.
</P>
<P>
   If you could draw a picture of the Church in the Wildwood, this
would be it. The tiny wooden country chapel sits in the middle of
the sprawling amusement park like an anachronism, complete with
steeple and bell, wooden pews and a tinny upright piano. Full-time
chaplain Pete Owen hoists a girl on his shoulders to pull the long
rope that rings out the start of the service, a nondenominational,
30-minute worship program that makes me flash back to the days so
long ago when I would sit with my Granny in the amen corner of the
Bakerville (Tenn.) Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   We sing ``When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder,'' ``Just a Little
Talk With Jesus'' and ``Blessed Assurance.'' We pray for the sick _
Fran recovering from surgery, Richard having problems with his
heart _ then hear a short sermon. We close with ``God Be With You
'Til We Meet Again.'' After a day and a half of the gaudy and
glitzy, this is as refreshing as cold mountain water. The best show
in Pigeon Forge.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Country Tonite: This is one of the few musical productions
offering a Sunday matinee, so I drop in. It features no name acts,
doesn't advertise heavily, and no one makes a race car disappear.
Still, ``Country Tonite'' provides some of the weekend's best
entertainment. The young cast of singers and dancers serves up a
kind of country version of ``Your Hit Parade,'' where the songs are
the stars rather than the singers _ ``This Kiss,'' ``Honey, I'm
Home,'' ``I Hate Her'' and ``There's Your Trouble.'' If you're a
fan of contemporary country music, you'll enjoy it as much as
listening to a good country station on a long car trip.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Blackwood Quartet: My last stop is at Eddie's Heart &AMP; Soul
Cafe, where legendary gospel star Ron Blackwood is offering a
no-frills evening of Southern gospel music and dinner. In fact,
Blackwood and his fellow vocalists sing to a tape piping out of
what looks to be an industrial strength karaoke machine. While the
performance should rely less on contemporary tunes and stick to the
traditional, Eddie's turns out to have a souvenir shop rich with
gospel tapes, books and posters.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   As I pull out of town, I pass by a stark black-and-white sign
that asks: ``Do you know where you're going?'' Conveniently enough,
it provides an answer: ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I'm going home to the city. But my 48 hours in Pigeon
Forge turned out to be much more fun than I had anticipated, a
blend of the crass and the creative rolled up in the beauty of the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's Sunday, and I've been to church, I must be blessed. I
don't even hit traffic.

 &HT;    Pigeon Forge, Tenn., is pure, mindless entertainment _ and
millions flock here every year
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, June 6.

<P>
   PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. _ As soon as I hit the city limits sign of
this tiny tourist town at the foothills of the Smoky Mountains,
it's apparent that I've forgotten something essential for a weekend
trip to Pigeon Forge: a folding lawn chair.
</P>
<P>
   It's dusk, and hundreds of people are pulling their cars out of
the bottleneck of traffic that runs up and down this valley,
popping the hatches on their sport-utility vehicles and setting up
webbed patio seats side by side facing the highway. It's a somewhat
bizarre ritual that seems to be as natural here as the blinking
arrival of the lightning bugs. This curious gantlet stretches the
length of the five-mile Parkway (as the main drag is called) as if
people are sitting waiting for a parade or a road race to begin.
</P>
<P>
   But no floats, no runners or even marching bands are headed this
way. It soon becomes clear that the show, the event, that everyone
is there to see is Pigeon Forge itself.
</P>
<P>
   The entire town is a carnival midway of neon signs, cheap
motels, in-room Jacuzzis, pancake houses, souvenir stands,
vaudeville-style shows (with acts such as Arnold the Mind-Reading
Pig), loud go-carts, outlet malls, Elvis impersonators, stores that
sell Christmas decorations in the middle of summer, and flashing
arcade games. Hanging over it all are cranes from which people drop
toward earth at the end of a bungee cord. They dangle over this
canyon of neon and concrete like a nightcrawler stuck on a hook at
the end of a fishing line.
</P>
<P>
   The people who come here and enjoy it _ including those folks in
folding chairs by the side of the road _ are unapologetic in their
pursuit of populist pleasure. Purist Tourists. They love this Bible
Belt Las Vegas, a city of spontaneous generation that plopped out
of the Smokies three decades ago like Darwin's fish sprouting legs.
A working man's Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   As a tourist destination, it provokes sharply polarized
feelings; just mention the place in a crowd and see how many eyes
roll. Although the community sits smack in the middle of one of the
South's most profoundly spiritual sights _ the Smoky Mountains
rising through the mist like silent humpback whales _ there's
virtually nothing natural within the Pigeon Forge city limits. No
museums to distract you (unless you count the one where you can
gawk at Sheriff Buford Pusser's burned-up death car), no historic
sights or self-guided walking tours. I didn't spot one gourmet
coffee stand, and everything pretty much shuts down by 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But let's set aside the elitist viewpoint for a few minutes and
reconsider why 11 million people visit Pigeon Forge every year.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the car at the intersection of the Parkway and
Dollywood Lane at Traffic Light 8 (there are 10 in all, and people
navigate around town by referring to the numbers), I flash back to
when I was a kid let loose at the fair each fall in rural Middle
Tennessee. The grown-ups would stick change in our hands and,
inevitably, my cousin Bilbo would head straight to an arcade game
called the Steam Shovel, into which he would feed nickels,
trancelike. The trick was to lower a set of metal jaws onto a pile
of trinkets _ beads, plastic rings, whistles _ and try to haul out
as many as possible. The diversion from our rather humdrum lives
was so intense that Bilbo would spend all his money within an hour,
then cry the rest of the afternoon because the experience was over.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Pigeon Forge is: seductively mindless
entertainment. If you can accept these terms and conditions, take
the town for exactly what it is and nothing more, and let your hair
down (or stuff it up under a University of Tennessee Big Orange
cap), a summer trip here can be a heck of a lot of fun.

THE WINDBAG CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Everybody's running for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the hat is running scared to keep his job. People are
tired of Mayor Willie Brown and the ego he rode in on. The people
have to ride in on San Francisco's transit system, Muni, which is a
lot feebler than Brown's ego.
</P>
<P>
   What's Brown doing about city services? He wants to please the
unions by hiring 1,392 new city employees. That just means more
Muni drivers not showing up for work.
</P>
<P>
   The people are grumbling about poor services and Brown's polls
are in the dumper. Members of the political class in San Francisco,
which Brown spent so much effort buying off and intimidating,
aren't scared of him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is holding his campaign kick-off on June 16 in the
Children's Playground of Yerba Buena Center rather than the large
park he filled for his inauguration 3 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the phone booth already was booked.
</P>
<P>
   The political free-for-all everyone predicted for the mayor's
race in 2003 is happening four years early. There's suddenly a
great notion that Brown may be leaving office after only one term,
and a lot of new and old blood want to take his place.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's blood is in the water and his possible successors are
closing in to chew up the mayor from as many directions as they
can. What's the mayor's response? He punishes the adversaries he
can, and tries to buy everyone else off, just like when he was
speaker of the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   One potential challenger, city Supervisor Gavin Newsom, has
charged that organized labor has been intimidating signature
gatherers and signers of a petition to reform Muni.
</P>
<P>
   One union leader, a Brown ally, responded, ``We just want to
inform and educate the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are Muni union reps out on the streets bugging people,
instead of informing and educating their own workers, and helping
them avoid sick time and disability leave?
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, all kinds of people collect signatures for all kinds
of things in this town, but I've never seen a petition gatherer
surrounded by opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Is this Chicago-by-the-Bay, a Chicago where nothing works? Mayor
Richard Daley of Chicago was a heavy-handed mayor. He fit Chicago.
But now we have a San Francisco mayor whose latest law-and-order
idea is to confiscate cars from those accused of soliciting drugs
or prostitutes, even if they're acquitted of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   At least Daley just hit people over the head with clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's proposed $4.2 billion budget is Chicago pork at San
Francisco prices. He's throwing piles of money away, increasing the
budget 7.7 percent to hire new employees. Perhaps he hopes the
unions will work harder for him and people looking for plush city
jobs will vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco already has one city employee for every 30
residents, a higher ratio than just about any government besides
the old Soviet Union, where everyone was a government worker. Now
the mayor wants taxpayers to support 1,392 new city employees
through good times and bad times.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny about San Francisco. The people always talk about
supporting city workers instead of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Chicago political machine makes things work for the
citizens. The San Francisco political machine only works for those
with city jobs or appointments.
</P>
<P>
   See, Mr. Mayor, the reason they don't like you in the first
place is you were wasting their money _ at the same time their
rents were rising and parking spaces disappearing because of your
developer friends.
</P>
<P>
   They also are dubious about your recommendation to hand over the
Presidio to a powerful real estate man who can sell it off in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The people have to ask themselves a question: Why did anyone
ever trust a man who wears $3,000 suits not to waste money and
resources?
</P>
<P>
   Surely, we weren't counting on him getting his suits wholesale,
cut-rate or for free. The man may have extravagant taste, but he's
not unethical. Heavens no.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait for the mayor's race to start in earnest. There won't
be any negative campaigning. No way, not here in Chicago-by-the-
Bay.
</P>

 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Rupert Everett can just see the headline now. Hollywood's most
prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite in a glam film
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''? What else but ``King of
the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at least I'll have graduated from 'Queen of the
Fairies,''' the British actor quips dryly during breakfast at
Hugo's in Los Angeles. ``I'm moving up the fairy ladder, don't you
think? It's a laugh. And by the by, I did play Titania in the
school play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roller-coaster screen career spanning over 15 years,
Everett has learned to deal with the vagaries of fame with sharp
wit, droll insouciance and the supreme confidence that comes from
his lanky good looks. So it's easy to understand how he landed the
role of Oberon in Michael Hoffman's all-star ``Dream,'' as well as
that of the idly rich Lord Goring in a new film version of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' _ a character Wilde seems to have
based on himself. Miramax will release that film, costarring Cate
Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore, in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   And in early July, the 40-year-old actor will play the
swashbuckling villain of a Disney kid-oriented extravaganza called
``Inspector Gadget.'' He doesn't do much to dispel the notion that
that's most likely his money gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life's a money gig, don't you think?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's last major outing, ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' was
certainly his biggest grosser ever _ it made about $300 million
worldwide _ and it turned him into a bankable Hollywood star after
years of toiling in lukewarm films with intermittent stabs at pop
music (a dismal failure) and novel writing (``Hello, Darling, Are
You Working?'' and ``The Hairdresser of St. Tropez'').
</P>
<P>
   Everett bounded to fame in the mid-'80s in ``Another Country''
and ``Dance With a Stranger.'' But except for a brief,
well-received turn in ``The Madness of King George,'' it was
downhill from there _ until he walked away with his few scenes in
``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't nominated for an Oscar, I was vaguely
disappointed,'' he says of that experience. ``After all that hype,
my expectations had been high. But right around then, all these
movies that are coming out fell into place. And I did that bit in
`Shakespeare in Love''' _ an unbilled stint as Christopher Marlowe,
Shakespeare's playwrighting competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I saw Glenda Jackson do it in Ken Russell's `The
Boyfriend,' I thought it was very glamorous to go unbilled,'' he
says. ``I'd really wanted to play Shakespeare, but they'd cast Joe
(Fiennes).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's cell phone rings now and then, each time with the same
woman _ whom he drippingly calls ``darling'' and whom he'd be
squiring to dinner that evening _ on the other end. \
</P>
<P>
   He won't identify her, but it's apparently his new best friend,
Madonna, whom he met way back through Sean Penn. The two start
shooting ``The Next Best Thing'' in late May in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy here in L.A. at the moment,'' he says, ``and so
is my dog (Mo, a black lab). I was very unhappy when I lived here
until a few years ago. I was always a big failure. It's not a town
to be a failure in. You have a really victimy, horrible existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a career windfall a little bit later in life, you
really appreciate it,'' he continues. ``I know these moments don't
last forever. I'll probably be caught with my pant down at the
George Michael memorial toilet in Beverly Hills one of these
days!''
</P>
<P>
   Everett might claim to love Los Angeles, but he maintains
residences in Miami and New York's West Village, and he still jets
back to his former home cities of Paris and London now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But his devotion to Mo prevents him from moving back to England,
with its stringent canine quarantine, and he has little good to say
about Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most boring, backward, Third World country and city
you can possibly imagine,'' he laments. ``Who cares about the
architecture? You can see that in a book. It was fun and sexy in
the '70s, then ruined when that hideous, horrible Mitterrand got
into power. He ruined France, made it this awful, bourgeois Third
World country. They don't know what's going on outside their own
stupid country _ they are so insular and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jet-set existence and contrary to his reputation
(he was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama
for ``insubordination''), Everett says he's never really been too
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very middle-class background _ it's saved me
from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

<P>
   Rupert Everett can just see the headline now. Hollywood's most
prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite in a glam film
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''? What else but ``King of
the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at least I'll have graduated from 'Queen of the
Fairies,''' the British actor quips dryly during breakfast at
Hugo's in Los Angeles. ``I'm moving up the fairy ladder, don't you
think? It's a laugh. And by the by, I did play Titania in the
school play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roller-coaster screen career spanning over 15 years,
Everett has learned to deal with the vagaries of fame with sharp
wit, droll insouciance and the supreme confidence that comes from
his lanky good looks. So it's easy to understand how he landed the
role of Oberon in Michael Hoffman's all-star ``Dream,'' as well as
that of the idly rich Lord Goring in a new film version of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' _ a character Wilde seems to have
based on himself. Miramax will release that film, costarring Cate
Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore, in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   And in early July, the 40-year-old actor will play the
swashbuckling villain of a Disney kid-oriented extravaganza called
``Inspector Gadget.'' He doesn't do much to dispel the notion that
that's most likely his money gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life's a money gig, don't you think?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's last major outing, ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' was
certainly his biggest grosser ever _ it made about $300 million
worldwide _ and it turned him into a bankable Hollywood star after
years of toiling in lukewarm films with intermittent stabs at pop
music (a dismal failure) and novel writing (``Hello, Darling, Are
You Working?'' and ``The Hairdresser of St. Tropez'').
</P>
<P>
   Everett bounded to fame in the mid-'80s in ``Another Country''
and ``Dance With a Stranger.'' But except for a brief,
well-received turn in ``The Madness of King George,'' it was
downhill from there _ until he walked away with his few scenes in
``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't nominated for an Oscar, I was vaguely
disappointed,'' he says of that experience. ``After all that hype,
my expectations had been high. But right around then, all these
movies that are coming out fell into place. And I did that bit in
`Shakespeare in Love''' _ an unbilled stint as Christopher Marlowe,
Shakespeare's playwrighting competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I saw Glenda Jackson do it in Ken Russell's `The
Boyfriend,' I thought it was very glamorous to go unbilled,'' he
says. ``I'd really wanted to play Shakespeare, but they'd cast Joe
(Fiennes).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's cell phone rings now and then, each time with the same
woman _ whom he drippingly calls ``darling'' and whom he'd be
squiring to dinner that evening _ on the other end. \
</P>
<P>
   He won't identify her, but it's apparently his new best friend,
Madonna, whom he met way back through Sean Penn. The two start
shooting ``The Next Best Thing'' in late May in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy here in L.A. at the moment,'' he says, ``and so
is my dog (Mo, a black lab). I was very unhappy when I lived here
until a few years ago. I was always a big failure. It's not a town
to be a failure in. You have a really victimy, horrible existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a career windfall a little bit later in life, you
really appreciate it,'' he continues. ``I know these moments don't
last forever. I'll probably be caught with my pants down at the
George Michael memorial toilet in Beverly Hills one of these
days!''
</P>
<P>
   Everett might claim to love Los Angeles, but he maintains
residences in Miami and New York's West Village, and he still jets
back to his former home cities of Paris and London now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But his devotion to Mo prevents him from moving back to England,
with its stringent canine quarantine, and he has little good to say
about Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most boring, backward, Third World country and city
you can possibly imagine,'' he laments. ``Who cares about the
architecture? You can see that in a book. It was fun and sexy in
the '70s, then ruined when that hideous, horrible Mitterrand got
into power. He ruined France, made it this awful, bourgeois Third
World country. They don't know what's going on outside their own
stupid country _ they are so insular and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jet-set existence and contrary to his reputation
(he was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama
for ``insubordination''), Everett says he's never really been too
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very middle-class background _ it's saved me
from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

<P>
   There's no question that teens are watching youth-friendly shows
such as WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' on primetime and TNBC's (Teen NBC)
Saturday-morning shows like ``City Guys,'' but are they taking
their fashion cues from them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen television shows have a huge impact on fashion,'' said
Hayley Hill, fashion director at Teen People. ``For the first time,
shows like `Dawson's Creek' and `Felicity' have real people on them
that teens can relate to. The creators have done a lot of research
to make the characters a reality and the teens relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the actors might be accomplished through story
lines, character portrayal or their actual wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to dress trendy but comfortable, and television
shows depict this,'' Hill said. ``If you go to college campuses,
the students are wearing jeans and T-shirts like they do on
Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brands worn by stars on the show, Hill said, are
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Tommy, Polo Jeans, DKNY, Mudd Jeans, LEI and
Lucky Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our consumers are watching these teen shows,''
said Jamie Lockard, director of advertising for Lee. ``Through our
research, they've indicated the shows are very important to them.
These kids are so savvy _ they're pulling their fashion clues from
a wealth of places, and the shows they watch have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent profile of the WB Network in US magazine,
Nielson ratings for the WB Network are up 6 percent for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its popular shows include ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Smart Guy,'' ``Sister
Sister'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has 4.6 million viewers in the 12- to 34-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's teen line up includes ``Boy Meets World''; ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch''; ``Brother's Keeper'' as well as ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has launched a number of shows for its successful
Saturday-morning TNBC block of educational and informational
programming targeting teens. Its three-hour block of teen
programming includes shows like ``Saved by the Bell: The New
Class,'' ``One World,'' ``Hang Time,'' ``City Guys'' and ``NBA
Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bass is the costume designer for ``Hang Time,'' a show
based on an Indiana high school basketball team. She wardrobes
about 10 characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting show, especially when building its
wardrobe,'' she said. ``Because the guys are part of a basketball
team, they tend to look similar. It's important for me to find
their individuality. I try not to exchange the wardrobes because
each of the actors have to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass shops a variety of stores for the casts' wardrobe _ from
sporting and surf stores to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic look,'' she said. ``We do a lot of
layering with vests in nylon or neoprene, fleece with a lot of
pockets and snowboard pants. There's also lot of shorts, or even
board shorts, worn with sneakers or boots.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bass, creating the look takes priority over brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't look at the labels,'' she said. ``We work with
tight budgets and want the looks that can be found in more boutique
stores. It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bass has a number of methods that she goes by when creating the
show's looks. She scours magazines, shops showrooms and purchases
outfits from boutique and upscale retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Hang Time,'' Adam Forst plays Michael Manning, the captain
for the Deering High School basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the all-American look,'' Bass said. He wears brands
such as the Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger in a classic look
that consists of plaid shirts, T-shirts and chinos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, actor Danso Gordon who plays Kenny ``Silk''
Hayes dresses in bright, saturated colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress him in athletic looks,'' Bass said. ``Breakaway
pants, layered tank tops with T-shirt underneath. He's got a little
of a hip-hop look.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bass, the characters' looks are understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to have looks that are somewhat
accessible,'' she said. ``Our shows are a lot about the look and
kids who watch it want to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley Kyle Evans, creator/executive producer of the WB's ``The
Jamie Foxx Show,'' said fashion has a major influence because
viewers mimic characters they relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see the lead character wearing Fubu or Enyce, they
automatically realize it's a cool thing to wear,'' Evans said.
``I've had people call the show and send me fan mail, saying they
liked what the actors wear.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``City Guys,'' on the average, there are about 35 to 40
outfits per show for the principal cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is increasingly critical,'' said Charles Winston,
costume designer for ``City Guys,'' who is a 20-year veteran in his
craft. ``The target audience continues to be younger. They tune in
with fashion being the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston has experienced first-hand ``City Guys''' fashion
influence on teen looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from all over write to our chat room,'' he said. ``They
don't know where to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston answers their fashion questions and provides them with
tips on where to purchase the looks seen on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Guys'' uses a variety of brands, including Varcity, BC
Ethic, Fresh Jive, Donna Karan, J. Crew, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Enyce
and Karl Kani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purchases reflect the styles upcoming or already
established without exposing the market to logos,'' he said. ``In
most cases, we have no logos at all. I don't want any one
particular brand to overshadow the show's concept.''

   Rupert Everett can just see the headline now. Hollywood's most
prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite in a glam film
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''? What else but ``King of
the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at least I'll have graduated from 'Queen of the
Fairies,''' the British actor quips dryly during breakfast at
Hugo's in Los Angeles. ``I'm moving up the fairy ladder, don't you
think? It's a laugh. And by the by, I did play Titania in the
school play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roller-coaster screen career spanning over 15 years,
Everett has learned to deal with the vagaries of fame with sharp
wit, droll insouciance and the supreme confidence that comes from
his lanky good looks. So it's easy to understand how he landed the
role of Oberon in Michael Hoffman's all-star ``Dream,'' as well as
that of the idly rich Lord Goring in a new film version of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' _ a character Wilde seems to have
based on himself. Miramax will release that film, costarring Cate
Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore, in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   And in early July, the 40-year-old actor will play the
swashbuckling villain of a Disney kid-oriented extravaganza called
``Inspector Gadget.'' He doesn't do much to dispel the notion that
that's most likely his money gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life's a money gig, don't you think?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's last major outing, ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' was
certainly his biggest grosser ever _ it made about $300 million
worldwide _ and it turned him into a bankable Hollywood star after
years of toiling in lukewarm films with intermittent stabs at pop
music (a dismal failure) and novel writing (``Hello, Darling, Are
You Working?'' and ``The Hairdresser of St. Tropez'').
</P>
<P>
   Everett bounded to fame in the mid-'80s in ``Another Country''
and ``Dance With a Stranger.'' But except for a brief,
well-received turn in ``The Madness of King George,'' it was
downhill from there _ until he walked away with his few scenes in
``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't nominated for an Oscar, I was vaguely
disappointed,'' he says of that experience. ``After all that hype,
my expectations had been high. But right around then, all these
movies that are coming out fell into place. And I did that bit in
`Shakespeare in Love''' _ an unbilled stint as Christopher Marlowe,
Shakespeare's playwrighting competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I saw Glenda Jackson do it in Ken Russell's `The
Boyfriend,' I thought it was very glamorous to go unbilled,'' he
says. ``I'd really wanted to play Shakespeare, but they'd cast Joe
(Fiennes).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's cell phone rings now and then, each time with the same
woman _ whom he drippingly calls ``darling'' and whom he'd be
squiring to dinner that evening _ on the other end. \
</P>
<P>
   He won't identify her, but it's apparently his new best friend,
Madonna, whom he met way back through Sean Penn. The two start
shooting ``The Next Best Thing'' in late May in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy here in L.A. at the moment,'' he says, ``and so
is my dog (Mo, a black lab). I was very unhappy when I lived here
until a few years ago. I was always a big failure. It's not a town
to be a failure in. You have a really victimy, horrible existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a career windfall a little bit later in life, you
really appreciate it,'' he continues. ``I know these moments don't
last forever. I'll probably be caught with my pants down at the
George Michael memorial toilet in Beverly Hills one of these
days!''
</P>
<P>
   Everett might claim to love Los Angeles, but he maintains
residences in Miami and New York's West Village, and he still jets
back to his former home cities of Paris and London now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But his devotion to Mo prevents him from moving back to England,
with its stringent canine quarantine, and he has little good to say
about Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most boring, backward, Third World country and city
you can possibly imagine,'' he laments. ``Who cares about the
architecture? You can see that in a book. It was fun and sexy in
the '70s, then ruined when that hideous, horrible Mitterrand got
into power. He ruined France, made it this awful, bourgeois Third
World country. They don't know what's going on outside their own
stupid country _ they are so insular and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jet-set existence and contrary to his reputation
(he was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama
for ``insubordination''), Everett says he's never really been too
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very middle-class background _ it's saved me
from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

<P>
   There's no question that teens are watching youth-friendly shows
such as WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' on primetime and TNBC's (Teen NBC)
Saturday-morning shows like ``City Guys,'' but are they taking
their fashion cues from them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen television shows have a huge impact on fashion,'' said
Hayley Hill, fashion director at Teen People. ``For the first time,
shows like `Dawson's Creek' and `Felicity' have real people on them
that teens can relate to. The creators have done a lot of research
to make the characters a reality and the teens relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the actors might be accomplished through story
lines, character portrayal or their actual wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to dress trendy but comfortable, and television
shows depict this,'' Hill said. ``If you go to college campuses,
the students are wearing jeans and T-shirts like they do on
Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brands worn by stars on the show, Hill said, are
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Tommy, Polo Jeans, DKNY, Mudd Jeans, LEI and
Lucky Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our consumers are watching these teen shows,''
said Jamie Lockard, director of advertising for Lee. ``Through our
research, they've indicated the shows are very important to them.
These kids are so savvy _ they're pulling their fashion clues from
a wealth of places, and the shows they watch have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent profile of the WB Network in US magazine,
Nielson ratings for the WB Network are up 6 percent for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its popular shows include ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Smart Guy,'' ``Sister
Sister'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has 4.6 million viewers in the 12- to 34-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's teen line up includes ``Boy Meets World''; ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch''; ``Brother's Keeper'' as well as ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has launched a number of shows for its successful
Saturday-morning TNBC block of educational and informational
programming targeting teens. Its three-hour block of teen
programming includes shows like ``Saved by the Bell: The New
Class,'' ``One World,'' ``Hang Time,'' ``City Guys'' and ``NBA
Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bass is the costume designer for ``Hang Time,'' a show
based on an Indiana high school basketball team. She wardrobes
about 10 characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting show, especially when building its
wardrobe,'' she said. ``Because the guys are part of a basketball
team, they tend to look similar. It's important for me to find
their individuality. I try not to exchange the wardrobes because
each of the actors have to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass shops a variety of stores for the casts' wardrobe _ from
sporting and surf stores to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic look,'' she said. ``We do a lot of
layering with vests in nylon or neoprene, fleece with a lot of
pockets and snowboard pants. There's also lot of shorts, or even
board shorts, worn with sneakers or boots.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bass, creating the look takes priority over brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't look at the labels,'' she said. ``We work with
tight budgets and want the looks that can be found in more boutique
stores. It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bass has a number of methods that she goes by when creating the
show's looks. She scours magazines, shops showrooms and purchases
outfits from boutique and upscale retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Hang Time,'' Adam Forst plays Michael Manning, the captain
for the Deering High School basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the all-American look,'' Bass said. He wears brands
such as the Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger in a classic look
that consists of plaid shirts, T-shirts and chinos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, actor Danso Gordon who plays Kenny ``Silk''
Hayes dresses in bright, saturated colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress him in athletic looks,'' Bass said. ``Breakaway
pants, layered tank tops with T-shirt underneath. He's got a little
of a hip-hop look.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bass, the characters' looks are understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to have looks that are somewhat
accessible,'' she said. ``Our shows are a lot about the look and
kids who watch it want to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley Kyle Evans, creator/executive producer of the WB's ``The
Jamie Foxx Show,'' said fashion has a major influence because
viewers mimic characters they relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see the lead character wearing Fubu or Enyce, they
automatically realize it's a cool thing to wear,'' Evans said.
``I've had people call the show and send me fan mail, saying they
liked what the actors wear.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``City Guys,'' on the average, there are about 35 to 40
outfits per show for the principal cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is increasingly critical,'' said Charles Winston,
costume designer for ``City Guys,'' who is a 20-year veteran in his
craft. ``The target audience continues to be younger. They tune in
with fashion being the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston has experienced first-hand ``City Guys''' fashion
influence on teen looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from all over write to our chat room,'' he said. ``They
don't know where to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston answers their fashion questions and provides them with
tips on where to purchase the looks seen on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Guys'' uses a variety of brands, including Varcity, BC
Ethic, Fresh Jive, Donna Karan, J. Crew, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Enyce
and Karl Kani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purchases reflect the styles upcoming or already
established without exposing the market to logos,'' he said. ``In
most cases, we have no logos at all. I don't want any one
particular brand to overshadow the show's concept.''

<P>
   There's no question that teens are watching youth-friendly shows
such as WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' on primetime and TNBC's (Teen NBC)
Saturday-morning shows like ``City Guys,'' but are they taking
their fashion cues from them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen television shows have a huge impact on fashion,'' said
Hayley Hill, fashion director at Teen People. ``For the first time,
shows like `Dawson's Creek' and `Felicity' have real people on them
that teens can relate to. The creators have done a lot of research
to make the characters a reality and the teens relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the actors might be accomplished through story
lines, character portrayal or their actual wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to dress trendy but comfortable, and television
shows depict this,'' Hill said. ``If you go to college campuses,
the students are wearing jeans and T-shirts like they do on
Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brands worn by stars on the show, Hill said, are
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Tommy, Polo Jeans, DKNY, Mudd Jeans, LEI and
Lucky Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our consumers are watching these teen shows,''
said Jamie Lockard, director of advertising for Lee. ``Through our
research, they've indicated the shows are very important to them.
These kids are so savvy _ they're pulling their fashion clues from
a wealth of places, and the shows they watch have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent profile of the WB Network in US magazine,
Nielson ratings for the WB Network are up 6 percent for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its popular shows include ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Smart Guy,'' ``Sister
Sister'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has 4.6 million viewers in the 12- to 34-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's teen line up includes ``Boy Meets World''; ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch''; ``Brother's Keeper'' as well as ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has launched a number of shows for its successful
Saturday-morning TNBC block of educational and informational
programming targeting teens. Its three-hour block of teen
programming includes shows like ``Saved by the Bell: The New
Class,'' ``One World,'' ``Hang Time,'' ``City Guys'' and ``NBA
Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bass is the costume designer for ``Hang Time,'' a show
based on an Indiana high school basketball team. She wardrobes
about 10 characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting show, especially when building its
wardrobe,'' she said. ``Because the guys are part of a basketball
team, they tend to look similar. It's important for me to find
their individuality. I try not to exchange the wardrobes because
each of the actors have to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass shops a variety of stores for the casts' wardrobe _ from
sporting and surf stores to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic look,'' she said. ``We do a lot of
layering with vests in nylon or neoprene, fleece with a lot of
pockets and snowboard pants. There's also lot of shorts, or even
board shorts, worn with sneakers or boots.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bass, creating the look takes priority over brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't look at the labels,'' she said. ``We work with
tight budgets and want the looks that can be found in more boutique
stores. It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bass has a number of methods that she goes by when creating the
show's looks. She scours magazines, shops showrooms and purchases
outfits from boutique and upscale retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Hang Time,'' Adam Forst plays Michael Manning, the captain
for the Deering High School basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the all-American look,'' Bass said. He wears brands
such as the Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger in a classic look
that consists of plaid shirts, T-shirts and chinos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, actor Danso Gordon who plays Kenny ``Silk''
Hayes dresses in bright, saturated colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress him in athletic looks,'' Bass said. ``Breakaway
pants, layered tank tops with T-shirt underneath. He's got a little
of a hip-hop look.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bass, the characters' looks are understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to have looks that are somewhat
accessible,'' she said. ``Our shows are a lot about the look and
kids who watch it want to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley Kyle Evans, creator/executive producer of the WB's ``The

<P>
   Rupert Everett can just see the headline now. Hollywood's most
prominent openly gay actor playing a royal sprite in a glam film
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''? What else but ``King of
the Fairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at least I'll have graduated from 'Queen of the
Fairies,''' the British actor quips dryly during breakfast at
Hugo's in Los Angeles. ``I'm moving up the fairy ladder, don't you
think? It's a laugh. And by the by, I did play Titania in the
school play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roller-coaster screen career spanning over 15 years,
Everett has learned to deal with the vagaries of fame with sharp
wit, droll insouciance and the supreme confidence that comes from
his lanky good looks. So it's easy to understand how he landed the
role of Oberon in Michael Hoffman's all-star ``Dream,'' as well as
that of the idly rich Lord Goring in a new film version of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband'' _ a character Wilde seems to have
based on himself. Miramax will release that film, costarring Cate
Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore, in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   And in early July, the 40-year-old actor will play the
swashbuckling villain of a Disney kid-oriented extravaganza called
``Inspector Gadget.'' He doesn't do much to dispel the notion that
that's most likely his money gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life's a money gig, don't you think?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's last major outing, ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' was
certainly his biggest grosser ever _ it made about $300 million
worldwide _ and it turned him into a bankable Hollywood star after
years of toiling in lukewarm films with intermittent stabs at pop
music (a dismal failure) and novel writing (``Hello, Darling, Are
You Working?'' and ``The Hairdresser of St. Tropez'').
</P>
<P>
   Everett bounded to fame in the mid-'80s in ``Another Country''
and ``Dance With a Stranger.'' But except for a brief,
well-received turn in ``The Madness of King George,'' it was
downhill from there _ until he walked away with his few scenes in
``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't nominated for an Oscar, I was vaguely
disappointed,'' he says of that experience. ``After all that hype,
my expectations had been high. But right around then, all these
movies that are coming out fell into place. And I did that bit in
`Shakespeare in Love''' _ an unbilled stint as Christopher Marlowe,
Shakespeare's playwrighting competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I saw Glenda Jackson do it in Ken Russell's `The
Boyfriend,' I thought it was very glamorous to go unbilled,'' he
says. ``I'd really wanted to play Shakespeare, but they'd cast Joe
(Fiennes).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's cell phone rings now and then, each time with the same
woman _ whom he drippingly calls ``darling'' and whom he'd be
squiring to dinner that evening _ on the other end. \
</P>
<P>
   He won't identify her, but it's apparently his new best friend,
Madonna, whom he met way back through Sean Penn. The two start
shooting ``The Next Best Thing'' in late May in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy here in L.A. at the moment,'' he says, ``and so
is my dog (Mo, a black lab). I was very unhappy when I lived here
until a few years ago. I was always a big failure. It's not a town
to be a failure in. You have a really victimy, horrible existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a career windfall a little bit later in life, you
really appreciate it,'' he continues. ``I know these moments don't
last forever. I'll probably be caught with my pants down at the
George Michael memorial toilet in Beverly Hills one of these
days!''
</P>
<P>
   Everett might claim to love Los Angeles, but he maintains
residences in Miami and New York's West Village, and he still jets
back to his former home cities of Paris and London now and then.
</P>
<P>
   But his devotion to Mo prevents him from moving back to England,
with its stringent canine quarantine, and he has little good to say
about Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most boring, backward, Third World country and city
you can possibly imagine,'' he laments. ``Who cares about the
architecture? You can see that in a book. It was fun and sexy in
the '70s, then ruined when that hideous, horrible Mitterrand got
into power. He ruined France, made it this awful, bourgeois Third
World country. They don't know what's going on outside their own
stupid country _ they are so insular and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the jet-set existence and contrary to his reputation
(he was expelled from London's Central School of Speech and Drama
for ``insubordination''), Everett says he's never really been too
wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a very middle-class background _ it's saved me
from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

from autodestruction at many times in my life,'' he says. ``When I
lived in Paris, I went to the same place every night. In L.A., I
stay home all the time and I work out every day. I travel all the
time, but when I get to a new town, I never go anywhere new. I know
that's kind of narrow-minded, but I've always been a bit like that.
I fear it's creeping middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is relentlessly cast as a debauched aristocrat.
Everett doesn't see his plummy upper-class delivery as having
served him all that well, however _ particularly in his
shortest-lived career: that of singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pop star thing didn't work, probably because I didn't have
the originality necessary for it,'' he says. ``I was too tied to an
image of upper-class English carelessness. If I had thought about
it more carefully, I might have done `hoo-ray rap': upper-class
rap. But I find this upper-class thing very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   As Oberon, Everett is an aristocrat once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of laughs doing it; I was terribly amused,'' he
says, but adds, ``One problem was, the whole movie, I'm in a
loincloth _ which I didn't love. Showing the whole of your body's
always a lot harder than showing off a little of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hollywood still dishes about Everett as the first openly
gay movie star, that once-incendiary issue now causes him to erupt
in a dramatic yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such old news,'' he says. ``It hasn't shown up in any of
my recent parts. I haven't played gay since `My Best Friend's
Wedding.' The gay scripts I get are often filled with bad
characters and are tragically bad,'' he complains. ``The one I'm
doing now is a script I rewrote myself _ a very good story, but
again, the gay character was totally stereotypical in a very dull
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``The Next Best Thing,'' the story of two old
friends, played by him and Madonna, who get smashed one day and
find themselves having sex. When she becomes pregnant, they bring
up baby together _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Madonna's,'' Everett says.
``I totally believe in her as an actress and as this character in
the film. She's been disparaged as an actress because we're all so
conscious of her image. The thing with acting is, you're a good
actor in the public eye one day, and the next day, you're a bad
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's refreshingly up-front on most topics, there's still
one thing Everett remains uncharacteristically tight-lipped about:
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   He may have shouted from the rooftops that he's gay, but he's
never so much as whispered the name of someone he's involved with.
Nor is he ever photographed with a significant other _ save his
dog, who often flies on the Concorde with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal life's still a personal life, isn't it?'' he says.
``Well, I promise you, I don't have one. I'm one of those tragic
people who just climbs into a refrigerator when they go home at
night. I don't want to be a leaflet or a manual. I want to keep it
to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses for a moment before adding, ``Or I just don't have
enough of a life for anyone to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have no sympathy for anyone trying to `out' people,'' he
continues. ``I hate the whole outing thing. I saw Boy George on
television talking about George Michael _ disgusting! Who wants to
see that big blob on the telly? Too bad there's not a closet big
enough for him that hide in.''

<P>
   There's no question that teens are watching youth-friendly shows
such as WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' on primetime and TNBC's (Teen NBC)
Saturday-morning shows like ``City Guys,'' but are they taking
their fashion cues from them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen television shows have a huge impact on fashion,'' said
Hayley Hill, fashion director at Teen People. ``For the first time,
shows like `Dawson's Creek' and `Felicity' have real people on them
that teens can relate to. The creators have done a lot of research
to make the characters a reality and the teens relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the actors might be accomplished through story
lines, character portrayal or their actual wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to dress trendy but comfortable, and television
shows depict this,'' Hill said. ``If you go to college campuses,
the students are wearing jeans and T-shirts like they do on
Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the brands worn by stars on the show, Hill said, are
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Tommy, Polo Jeans, DKNY, Mudd Jeans, LEI and
Lucky Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that our consumers are watching these teen shows,''
said Jamie Lockard, director of advertising for Lee. ``Through our
research, they've indicated the shows are very important to them.
These kids are so savvy _ they're pulling their fashion clues from
a wealth of places, and the shows they watch have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent profile of the WB Network in US magazine,
Nielson ratings for the WB Network are up 6 percent for this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its popular shows include ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Smart Guy,'' ``Sister
Sister'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   WB has 4.6 million viewers in the 12- to 34-year-old bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's teen line up includes ``Boy Meets World''; ``Sabrina the
Teenage Witch''; ``Brother's Keeper'' as well as ``Two Guys, a Girl
and a Pizza Place.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC has launched a number of shows for its successful
Saturday-morning TNBC block of educational and informational
programming targeting teens. Its three-hour block of teen
programming includes shows like ``Saved by the Bell: The New
Class,'' ``One World,'' ``Hang Time,'' ``City Guys'' and ``NBA
Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bass is the costume designer for ``Hang Time,'' a show
based on an Indiana high school basketball team. She wardrobes
about 10 characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting show, especially when building its
wardrobe,'' she said. ``Because the guys are part of a basketball
team, they tend to look similar. It's important for me to find
their individuality. I try not to exchange the wardrobes because
each of the actors have to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass shops a variety of stores for the casts' wardrobe _ from
sporting and surf stores to the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very eclectic look,'' she said. ``We do a lot of
layering with vests in nylon or neoprene, fleece with a lot of
pockets and snowboard pants. There's also lot of shorts, or even
board shorts, worn with sneakers or boots.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bass, creating the look takes priority over brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't look at the labels,'' she said. ``We work with
tight budgets and want the looks that can be found in more boutique
stores. It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bass has a number of methods that she goes by when creating the
show's looks. She scours magazines, shops showrooms and purchases
outfits from boutique and upscale retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Hang Time,'' Adam Forst plays Michael Manning, the captain
for the Deering High School basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the all-American look,'' Bass said. He wears brands
such as the Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger in a classic look
that consists of plaid shirts, T-shirts and chinos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, actor Danso Gordon who plays Kenny ``Silk''
Hayes dresses in bright, saturated colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress him in athletic looks,'' Bass said. ``Breakaway
pants, layered tank tops with T-shirt underneath. He's got a little
of a hip-hop look.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bass, the characters' looks are understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important to have looks that are somewhat
accessible,'' she said. ``Our shows are a lot about the look and
kids who watch it want to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley Kyle Evans, creator/executive producer of the WB's ``The
Jamie Foxx Show,'' said fashion has a major influence because
viewers mimic characters they relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see the lead character wearing Fubu or Enyce, they
automatically realize it's a cool thing to wear,'' Evans said.
``I've had people call the show and send me fan mail, saying they
liked what the actors wear.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``City Guys,'' on the average, there are about 35 to 40
outfits per show for the principal cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is increasingly critical,'' said Charles Winston,
costume designer for ``City Guys,'' who is a 20-year veteran in his
craft. ``The target audience continues to be younger. They tune in
with fashion being the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston has experienced first-hand ``City Guys''' fashion
influence on teen looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids from all over write to our chat room,'' he said. ``They
don't know where to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston answers their fashion questions and provides them with
tips on where to purchase the looks seen on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Guys'' uses a variety of brands, including Varcity, BC
Ethic, Fresh Jive, Donna Karan, J. Crew, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Enyce
and Karl Kani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purchases reflect the styles upcoming or already
established without exposing the market to logos,'' he said. ``In
most cases, we have no logos at all. I don't want any one
particular brand to overshadow the show's concept.''

WHAT YOU STUDY IN COLLEGE MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHERE YOU GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's some good economic news for college graduates _ and
their parents _ who recently received their sheepskin: Your
earnings should be at least 62 percent higher than that of your
peers who have only a high school education.
</P>
<P>
   College grads earning advanced degrees face even better news.
The average annual salary of a bachelor's degree holder is around
$48,300 a year, but those with a master's degree earn $54,300
annually, and doctoral degree holders have mean annual salaries of
$67,500. Lawyers and doctors do even better, of course, earning
more than $90,000 on average.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the many facts gleaned from the U.S. census
and other studies in the new book ``The College Majors Handbook:
The Actual Jobs, Earnings, and Trends for Graduates of 60 College
Majors'' (Jist Works, Indianapolis, 619 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Though numerous books rate colleges and universities, this book
focuses on perhaps an even more important decision than where to go
to school: what to study once you get there.
</P>
<P>
   As the authors write: ``Clearly the choice of undergraduate
major has a powerful impact on the earnings and, ultimately, the
living standards of college graduates. ... The skills and abilities
they acquire in college have lasting and even lifetime influences
on their labor market outcomes, their status in the community,
their happiness on the job, and their standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   The three authors are all professors at Northwestern University.
Neeta Fogg and Paul Harrington are economists at Northwestern's
Center for Labor Market Studies. Thomas Harrington is a counseling
psychologist who teaches vocation psychology and career counseling.
</P>
<P>
   They have pooled their research and studies to take specific
looks at 60 of the most sought-after college degrees, from
aerospace engineering to visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information provided is from the National Survey of
College Graduates, which sampled more than 148,000 college
graduates to gather data on education, employment and earnings
experience. The survey is the largest and most comprehensive study
of college graduates ever conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The information provided for each major includes salaries,
occupations, on-the-job training and employment outlook in a
detailed discussion. Behind the numbers, the authors point out
interesting patterns about just what happens to people after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, those who choose dramatic arts, a popular major,
may find themselves on unforeseen career paths after graduation,
the authors write. According to the studies in the book, less than
20 percent of dramatic arts graduates work in jobs closely related
to their field of study. An additional 20 percent actually work in
jobs that do not require a college degree. Salaries of dramatic
arts majors also run more than $10,000 less than those of the
average college graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The employment outlook for this group looks equally grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dramatic arts majors will likely continue to have difficulty
in the labor market in the future and will more likely work in
part-time positions, be unemployed, and work in a job that does not
require a college degree,'' the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, those receiving a bachelor's degree in chemistry
are much more likely to be chemists, with more than 70 percent
working in jobs related to their major. Their average annual salary
of $55,000 is about 14 percent more than that of the average
bachelor's degree holder. Also, a whopping 56 percent of all
chemistry majors go on to obtain advanced degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The book says that, although the overall demand for college
graduates is expected to increase nearly 25 percent between 1996
and 2006, the demand for chemists is expected to grow about 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers certainly don't mean everything when making the weighty
decision of what to do with your life, but this book can bring a
heavy dose of reality to what happens after you receive that
diploma. The book should be required reading for anyone entering
college.

CHAMPIONS ON ICE INTRODUCES PROMISING NEW TALENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BETTY KWONG 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It all started with ``Twinkle, Twinkle Little
Star.''
</P>
<P>
   A tiny speck of a girl at age 6, Naomi Nari Nam swizzled her way
across the ice and jumped in place to the tune of the kiddies'
ditty.
</P>
<P>
   The audience applauded, and the judges declared it a winning
performance.
</P>
<P>
   And so began Nam's figure skating career, one that's taken her
from that first competition at an Orange County ice rink to the
1999 U.S. National Championships, where she earned a silver medal,
skating fans' adoration and the chance to tour with the world's
best.
</P>
<P>
   When the spotlight goes on at the Los Angeles Sports Arena on
Saturday afternoon, you'll see the 13-year-old Irvine, Calif.,
sprite performing along with world-famous skating stars like
Michelle Kwan, Oksana Baiul, Todd Eldredge and Alexei Yagudin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big tour, and it's my first time. I'm so excited,''
said Nam, who's scheduled to perform in 13 shows on the West Coast
leg of the 45-city tour. ``I want to make a good impression so I
can come back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll skate to an aptly named tune, ``Getting to Know You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from `The King and I' _ the cartoon!'' she says,
giggling. ``It's a very cheery song.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cast of this summer's John Hancock Champions on Ice
Tour showcases a lot of new names that spectators are just
beginning to get to know.
</P>
<P>
   There's new energy emerging out of this post-Olympic season,
with talents like Nam and West Los Angeles' Trifun Zivanovic, the
1999 national men's silver medalist, stealing some of the thunder
from the established stars of the amateur skating world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to attend the shows as a young kid with my parents and
just be in awe of all the performers. And now I get to be in it
myself, so it's pretty cool,'' said Zivanovic, 23, who trains in
Culver City and teaches skating in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Zivanovic, who's scheduled to perform on the tour's three
Southern California stops, plans to skate to Queen's ``Crazy Little
Thing Called Love,'' a program he learned only four weeks ago. ``I
just want to go out there and have fun and entertain people.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than just an opportunity to entertain, the show also
becomes an unexpected training ground for many young skaters, said
Tom Collins, owner, producer and the man at the show's helm for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always say they learn as an amateur so much on a tour,
because they skate at least five shows a week in front of a large
audience,'' Collins said. ``They can try some new footwork ... see
if the audience likes it, and if it's not right, they can correct
it. They can try their new jumps _ their triples and their quads.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, quadruple-rotation jumps. Exhibition skating shows
used to be anticlimatic follow-ups to exciting competition
performances. Instead of programs packed with difficult maneuvers
designed to leave judges drooling, skaters opted for simpler and
safer program elements.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore, Collins said. Skating-savvy audiences are demanding
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could fool them 10 years ago. Now you can't fool them,''
he said. ``On the tour, a lot of times they used to do numbers that
didn't have triples and quads in them. Now (skaters) understand you
can't get by without them. You have to skate almost like it's a
competition every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Quadruples _ even in competition _ are still a rarity, but
triples are a given expectation among male competitors these days,
Zivanovic said. ``The skill level on these tours is getting higher
and higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Those rising expectations are enough to send most teen-agers
into hiding. But not the 4-foot-10-inch, 83-pound Nam, who still
trains at the same Orange County rink that made her a 6-year-old
champion.
</P>
<P>
   She's working on upping the consistency of her triple lutz.
She's working on triple-triple jump combinations. She's working on
developing her own style.
</P>
<P>
   Three to four hours a day, six days a week, this is her training
regimen _ squeezed in between homework and hanging out with family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show the whole skating world that I'm mature enough
_ even if I'm only 13 _ to be in the senior ladies' group,'' Nam
said.
</P>
<P>
   Touring with world-class skaters in the Champions on Ice tour
sounds like a pretty good start. &QL;

   Continuing the warmly refined, rootsy sound fashioned on his
previous two albums, guitarist Frisell joins drummer Jim Keltner,
organist Wayne Horvitz and multi-instrumentalist Greg Leisz for
excursions into country, blues, bluegrass and rock that maintain a
melancholic mood throughout.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Paul Gonsalves. ``Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue.''
Twenty-seven choruses. It's one of the most famous jazz solos in
history and the defining performance of Ellington's electrifying
Newport ``comeback'' concert. This two-CD reissue finally delivers
the actual concert in its entirety and in stereo. (Columbia asked
Ellington to re-record the set in the studio the following day;
those performances are also included here.)
</P>
<P>
   Boasting 100 minutes of previously unissued prime Ellington,
this set is a priceless release, made all the better by extensive,
illustrated liner notes that beautifully put the concert into its
historical context. ``Ellington at Newport 1956'' is the perfect
album to introduce listeners to the composer's greatness on the
centennial of his birth. 4 stars

another fine effort, mixing the classic Cajun forms with some of
that regional music's antecedents, including a lovely waltz in
``Chanson Pour Tommy,'' a slinky half-blues, half-Lalo Schifrin
``L'Amour Poisonne'' and more. Their last album won a Grammy; this

</P>
<P>
   The first two issues from John Hammond's 1950s Vanguard Jazz
Showcase series, these two samplers offer solid tracks culled from
a variety of recordings. The Basie album (3 stars) features the
Count's sidemen (and, on four songs, the Count himself) doing what
they did best _ the blues. The best cuts come from a trio featuring
drummer Jo Jones, bassist Tommy Bryant and pianist Ray Bryant.
(Jones positively wails on ``Old Man River.'') The Powell album (3
stars) also comes from four sources and includes four big-band cuts
featuring vocalist Joan Wilie. Throughout, Powell demonstrates
versatile, lyrical playing that is always interesting. The two
reissues are the first of a 10-CD series devoted to
Hammond-produced recordings. We look forward to the rest.

THE REAL THING FROM RANDY NEWMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Of the sometimes autobiographical material on his
new album, Randy Newman says he's both ``seen it and lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection, produced by Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake,
depicts an aging man hooked on a young girl, a fossilized rock star
who doesn't know when to quit and a seemingly nice, sentimental
fellow who only wants to be liked. And, of course, there's an open
letter to Karl Marx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not usually talking about anyone specifically in the
songs,'' Newman said before last weekend's three-night stand at the
House of Blues. ``I mean, like the number (``Shame'') about the old
guy on the hook to a young woman _ I'm not involved in something
like that. But it can be amusing, and I've always found it
interesting to observe across a room.''
</P>
<P>
   The disc, ``Bad Love'' (DreamWorks), is only the most recent
highlight in what's been a good year for the sardonic
singer-songwriter. Last fall, ``Guilty: 30 Years of Randy Newman''
(Warner Archive), a four-disc anthology featuring the cream of his
album and motion-picture work, was issued to widespread acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Grammy- and Emmy-winning composer was
nominated for three Academy Awards, in three music categories, for
the films ``Pleasantville,'' ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Babe: Pig in
the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's been nominated for a dozen Oscars, Newman has yet
to win one of the coveted statuettes. Not that he minds much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a cliche _ but the work itself is its own
reward,'' Newman, 55, said. ``Not winning an Oscar isn't something
that breaks my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Now working on the sequel to ``Toy Story,'' Newman says he
prefers short solo tours to long treks with a band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not band-oriented,'' he explained. ``Maybe what's best
about me are the songs, unadorned.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds right to us. &QL;

DOCTORS ON THE PICKET LINE

 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Like many doctors, Dr. Byron Thomashow, a pulmonary specialist,
is fed up with managed care. He's tired of justifying the need for
clinical procedures to ill-informed HMO personnel. He's weary of
fighting endless battles in order to treat his patients. And he's
frustrated by loss of the autonomy he once enjoyed to make his own
medical decisions.
 &HT;    But unlike many of his colleagues, he's fighting back. In fact,
he's given up on managed care altogether, electing to withdraw from
the web of HMOs and health insurers that have come to dominate our
healthcare system.
 &HT;    ``I just couldn't stand it,'' he explains. ``The thought of
being put on hold by people who don't know a quarter of what you
are doing to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom''
was simply too much to take.
 &HT;    Dr. Barney Softness, a New York pediatrician, is another rebel.
When his HMO suggested that he fire his registered nurses to reduce
costs, he did something few doctors have dared to do: he fired his
HMO instead. He says he just wants ``to give the kind of care that
I think people deserve.''
 &HT;    The two mutinous physicians are not alone. Across America, state
insurance commissioners are reporting a veritable revolt by doctors
against their HMOs, and medical society officials say that more and
more practitioners are severing their ties with managed care
altogether. A recent headline in The New York Times heralded this
trend, citing a growing rebellion by doctors like Thomashow and
Softness.
 &HT;    Of course, much of the dispute revolves around the reduced fees
that insurers are paying physicians for their services.
Nonetheless, despite a glut of physicians in many specialties,
doctors' incomes have continued to rise, unencumbered by the laws
of supply and demand. For this reason, some critics have described
the controversy as much ado about money. But it is also about
something much more fundamental -- the sudden encroachment of
``outsiders'' into the practice of medicine.
 &HT;    For the first time in history, insurers are telling physicians
how to practice their profession, and the medical community is up
in arms. As an early participant in managed care, I am no stranger
to this phenomenon, and I've seen what it is like to lose your
autonomy as a doctor. It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    As a salaried physician at an HMO, I experienced firsthand the
sense of helplessness and outrage that can result when a third
party comes between you and your patients, preventing you from
caring for them the way you were trained. Indeed, after years of
advanced training and education, I felt something I'd never felt
before in my life as a doctor: the inability to have my medical
decisions carried out.
 &HT;    As any doctor can tell you, this is a dreadful feeling. It goes
to the very heart of medical practice. Moreover, it challenges some
of the basic assumptions about what it means to be a physician.
From the outset of their training, doctors are taught that they
alone bear ultimate responsibility for the fate of their patients,
and therefore they alone must have the final say -- in conjunction
with their patients -- regarding clinical decisions. They may
consult with other health professionals before reaching a
conclusion, but in the end, they must make the final call.
 &HT;    This may seem a bit autocratic to some, but because lives are at
stake, it's a necessarily authoritarian regime. When dealing with
life-and-death decisions, you can't have a committee bickering over
strategy.
 &HT;    On the other hand, medicine cannot afford to operate in a
vacuum. When dealing with one-seventh of the U.S. economy, you just
can't leave the decision to physicians alone. This is how we
arrived at the current economic crisis in the first place. The
medical community, unconstrained by managed care, continued to
inflate medical spending until it consumed a whopping 14 percent of
the nation's economic output.
 &HT;    This voracious appetite for dollars obviously couldn't be
sustained, and the need to control runaway costs eventually set the
stage for managed care. The result was the current revolution in
health care, in which the laws of economics finally held sway over
the canons of medicine. Economic pressures steadily chipped away at
the hegemony of the medical profession, and managed care ultimately
did what no other force had ever done: it turned doctors into
``employees'' on a massive scale.
 &HT;    Now, the revolution has led to another first: physicians are
clamoring to join unions as never before. Courted by everyone from
the American Federation of Teachers to the International
Association of Machinists, doctors are beginning to unionize across
the country. And they are being welcomed with open arms.
 &HT;    The Service Employees International Union, the nation's
fastest-growing labor coalition, pledged in March to spend $1
million this year to organize the nation's 600,000 doctors. Even
the United Food and Commercial Workers union has gotten into the
act, seeking to expand its base by enrolling doctors disaffected
with managed care. This could lead to some intriguing alliances, in
which doctors could find themselves walking the picket lines
alongside supermarket workers.
 &HT;    Though there is already some precedent for the concept of a
physicians' guild, unionization still raises some troubling ethical
questions for the healing profession. Perhaps the most important
issue involves organized labor's right to strike. Could doctors
actually go on strike, denying care to their patients? If so, who
would treat their patients while they walked the picket line? And
how would they reconcile withholding care with the obligations of
the Hippocratic oath?
 &HT;    These are difficult questions, but they'll have to be addressed
as we move into the next phase of the managed care revolution. In
the meantime, one thing is certain: the revolution will continue.
As insurers press on with their onslaught, doctors will persist in
the struggle, fighting a rear-guard action in the hope of regaining
some control over their fate in the new healthcare economy.

that he is one of the most influential musicians of the rock era.
</P>
<P>
   Although Costello would be entitled to cop an attitude, musical
latitude is still what matters most to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a great yearning for a place in history,'' he
says cheerfully, calling from France. ``I don't ever think like
that. First, it's kind of arrogant, and second, I don't think I've
had that much influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in my nature to ponder those things. I'll be dead and
it won't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   From his first album, ``My Aim Is True'' (1977), right up
through his recent recording project with Burt Bacharach,
Costello's creativity has known few boundaries. It's nothing for
him to hook up with a symphony in Stockholm one day, then to be
playing to an open field in New Zealand 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really satisfying to have songs that stand up to that
kind of journey,'' he says, the sense of wonder perceptible in his
voice.
</P>
<P>
   He's much too busy with the journey to pause for self-flattery.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, maybe I'll write a memoir of my music experiences,''
he says. ``I wouldn't want to stop to write, `I was born . . .' Who
cares? I don't know if writing songs qualifies you to be a writer
of other things. I have a job already and it's fun to do. A
biography doesn't interest me. I like the ones with a real
fascination or affection for the subject, or a critical view of
their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of what has been written about Costello doesn't qualify, in
his estimation. That includes a just-released book by Tony
Clayton-Lea, an Irish journalist who cobbled together assorted
interviews for a fairly balanced treatise on the star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't need to read it,'' Costello says of the book. ``I
have the accurate version, and I don't think that one has been
written. (These books) are an assignment and they're written for
money. They're not written out of a feeling for what I do, or the
person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   His work with Bacharach affords a much better glimpse of that,
as he sees it.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can expect to hear plenty from their pairing in Costello's
show with Steve Nieve, his keyboardist from the Attractions. There
also will be ``the songs people want to hear, and others that have
been overlooked for one reason or another,'' Costello promises.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 12-song ``Painted From Memory,'' done with a
24-piece orchestra conducted by Bacharach, continues to be a source
of delight to Costello. ``The shows have those songs central to the
repertoire,'' he says. ``It's presenting them as they were written.
They're perfectly suited to the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I like is that maybe my personality comes through
more in the piano-and-voice version than in the orchestral version.
Steve heightens the Costello part. I hope people don't think we're
distorting the songs to make them sound more like me.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, sounding ``more like me'' has never been easily
defined with Costello _ and he's not planning to make it any easier
on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a few sounds in my head that I haven't quite realized
yet,'' he says when asked what's left for him to accomplish. ``I've
written a lot of ballads in the last few years, and the dominant
aspect has been melody and harmony. The rhythmic aspect has been
subtly and gently expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   What's ahead, he says, might be ``driven more by rhythm . . .
while still keeping the advances I've made in color,
instrumentation and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Costello takes this seriously _ but not so much that he
didn't get a kick out of appearing in the new ``Austin Powers''
flick with Bacharach. ``When you get to guest on these things, they
make a big fuss over you,'' he says. ``They're like a holiday from
your real life.'' &QL;

 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Like many doctors, Dr. Byron Thomashow, a pulmonary specialist,
is fed up with managed care. He's tired of justifying the need for
clinical procedures to ill-informed HMO personnel. He's weary of
fighting endless battles in order to treat his patients. And he's
frustrated by loss of the autonomy he once enjoyed to make his own
medical decisions.
 &HT;    But unlike many of his colleagues, he's fighting back. In fact,
he's given up on managed care altogether, electing to withdraw from
the web of HMOs and health insurers that have come to dominate our
healthcare system.
 &HT;    ``I just couldn't stand it,'' he explains. ``The thought of
being put on hold by people who don't know a quarter of what you
are doing to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom''
was simply too much to take.
 &HT;    Dr. Barney Softness, a New York pediatrician, is another rebel.
When his HMO suggested that he fire his registered nurses to reduce
costs, he did something few doctors have dared to do: he fired his
HMO instead. He says he just wants ``to give the kind of care that
I think people deserve.''
 &HT;    The two mutinous physicians are not alone. Across America, state
insurance commissioners are reporting a veritable revolt by doctors
against their HMOs, and medical society officials say that more and
more practitioners are severing their ties with managed care
altogether. A recent headline in The New York Times heralded this
trend, citing a growing rebellion by doctors like Thomashow and
Softness.
 &HT;    Of course, much of the dispute revolves around the reduced fees
that insurers are paying physicians for their services.
Nonetheless, despite a glut of physicians in many specialties,
doctors' incomes have continued to rise, unencumbered by the laws
of supply and demand. For this reason, some critics have described
the controversy as much ado about money. But it is also about
something much more fundamental -- the sudden encroachment of
``outsiders'' into the practice of medicine.
 &HT;    For the first time in history, insurers are telling physicians
how to practice their profession, and the medical community is up
in arms. As an early participant in managed care, I am no stranger
to this phenomenon, and I've seen what it is like to lose your
autonomy as a doctor. It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    As a salaried physician at an HMO, I experienced firsthand the
sense of helplessness and outrage that can result when a third
party comes between you and your patients, preventing you from
caring for them the way you were trained. Indeed, after years of
advanced training and education, I felt something I'd never felt
before in my life as a doctor: the inability to have my medical
decisions carried out.
 &HT;    As any doctor can tell you, this is a dreadful feeling. It goes
to the very heart of medical practice. Moreover, it challenges some
of the basic assumptions about what it means to be a physician.
From the outset of their training, doctors are taught that they
alone bear ultimate responsibility for the fate of their patients,
and therefore they alone must have the final say -- in conjunction
with their patients -- regarding clinical decisions. They may
consult with other health professionals before reaching a
conclusion, but in the end, they must make the final call.
 &HT;    This may seem a bit autocratic to some, but because lives are at
stake, it's a necessarily authoritarian regime. When dealing with
life-and-death decisions, you can't have a committee bickering over
strategy.
 &HT;    On the other hand, medicine cannot afford to operate in a
vacuum. When dealing with one-seventh of the U.S. economy, you just
can't leave the decision to physicians alone. This is how we
arrived at the current economic crisis in the first place. The
medical community, unconstrained by managed care, continued to
inflate medical spending until it consumed a whopping 14 percent of
the nation's economic output.
 &HT;    This voracious appetite for dollars obviously couldn't be
sustained, and the need to control runaway costs eventually set the
stage for managed care. The result was the current revolution in
health care, in which the laws of economics finally held sway over
the canons of medicine. Economic pressures steadily chipped away at
the hegemony of the medical profession, and managed care ultimately
did what no other force had ever done: it turned doctors into
``employees'' on a massive scale.
 &HT;    Now, the revolution has led to another first: physicians are
clamoring to join unions as never before. Courted by everyone from
the American Federation of Teachers to the International
Association of Machinists, doctors are beginning to unionize across
the country. And they are being welcomed with open arms.
 &HT;    The Service Employees International Union, the nation's
fastest-growing labor coalition, pledged in March to spend $1
million this year to organize the nation's 600,000 doctors. Even
the United Food and Commercial Workers union has gotten into the
act, seeking to expand its base by enrolling doctors disaffected
with managed care. This could lead to some intriguing alliances, in
which doctors could find themselves walking the picket lines
alongside supermarket workers.
 &HT;    Though there is already some precedent for the concept of a
physicians' guild, unionization still raises some troubling ethical
questions for the healing profession. Perhaps the most important
issue involves organized labor's right to strike. Could doctors
actually go on strike, denying care to their patients? If so, who
would treat their patients while they walked the picket line? And
how would they reconcile withholding care with the obligations of
the Hippocratic oath?
 &HT;    These are difficult questions, but they'll have to be addressed
as we move into the next phase of the managed care revolution. In
the meantime, one thing is certain: the revolution will continue.
As insurers press on with their onslaught, doctors will persist in
the struggle, fighting a rear-guard action in the hope of regaining
some control over their fate in the new healthcare economy.

COMEDIAN A BUSY, BUSY GUY THESE DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ He's loud, rude, funny and very, very smart. Or
is that smart and very, very funny?
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, how about very, very smart; very, very funny; and not
least of all, comedian Chris Rock is very, very, very busy.
</P>
<P>
   He's rolling into Los Angeles on Saturday in the latest stop of
a 28-city tour, building up to a taping later this month for his
latest hourlong comedy special on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   He has a weekly talk show on HBO; executive production duties on
ABC's ``The Hughleys;'' appearances in two films; a book, record
and TV commercials; and he's developing a comedy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   All of which begs a simple question, as he's about to board the
tour bus from Milwaukee to another appearance outside Chicago: Hey,
Chris, when do you have time to breathe?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to work,'' Rock said. ``It's the only thing I do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Any time for a good time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much,'' Rock said. ``I just work, man, trying to get some
work done. I've been hot and cold before, so this time I'm doing
everything I can while I can. I think I promised myself if I ever
got hot again, I wouldn't take it for granted. `Cause if you're not
working, you're nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock grew up in one of Brooklyn's toughest neighborhoods,
Bedford-Stuyvesant, where getting his butt kicked was a regular
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they act like we used to hang out,'' Rock said of his
childhood tormentors. ``They act like them beating me up was us
hanging out.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as a young child, being a comedian sounded like a great
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much always wanted to be a comedian,'' Rock said.
``It seemed like a fun job. You got paid to talk, to make people
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the cast of ``Saturday Night Live'' in 1989 was a big
break, building his name and close friendships with cast members
such as Adam Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a dry spell for four years, before the momentum started
moving forward again, but even in his slow stretches there was
always stand-up comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand-up, the thing about stand-up, I don't have to listen to
anybody,'' Rock said. ``It's a control freak's dream. And it's easy
to count the money. There's no creative accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a man alone on a stage, trying to make a roomful of people
laugh, has other advantages as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to experiment creatively, to joke about things
you might have a hard time doing in another format: abortion, gun
control,'' Rock said.
</P>
<P>
   He resists defining his comedy as political, though it is _
deeply so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's life, I wouldn't say it's politics,'' Rock said. ``It's
political in a barbershop sense. It's guys in a barbershop
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   But it comes from a radically different angle than the full-on
bore of the Washington punditocracy, certainly, or even from most
other comedians.
</P>
<P>
   It's like being black and from Bed-Stuy and clever allows Rock
to look at topics in a number of different lights, giving him his
own unique take on things.
</P>
<P>
   It's what makes Rock interesting, not just funny.
</P>
<P>
   That view means topics such as how Harlem coped with the death
of Princess Diana. More recently, it's abortion, high school
slaughters and the related topic of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun control is a double-edged sword,'' Rock says. ``On the one
hand, we definitely need gun control. On the other hand, my people
are very oppressed. They got their asses kicked, legally, forever.
Something tells me if we could never buy a gun again, my people
would be the first ones in line getting their asses kicked again.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer: ``I think there should be bullet control. A bullet
should cost $5,000. If a bullet costs $5,000, there would be no
innocent bystanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Racism is another evergreen, even if it doesn't sound like the
most promising comedy source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences always want to hear about it,'' Rock said. ``You
listen to the radio, you want to hear a love song. You listen to a
young, black comedian, you want to hear him talk about racism.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, dubious police shootings of blacks from Riverside to
New York give him lots to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never goes away,'' Rock said. ``White police, white people
in general, still haven't learned how to differentiate. (CBS ``60
Minutes'' correspondent) Ed Bradley and (gangsta rapper) Ol' Dirty
Bastard pretty much get treated the same. Even though you try to
treat people the same in general, when you respect them, you treat
those people differently. There's a difference between how you
treat Jeffrey Katzenberg vs. Pauly Shore, for instance. That
doesn't happen to black people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Rock is honing his material in appearances such as
Saturday's before stepping onto one of the most fearsome stages in
America, the Apollo Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, the Apollo
remains one of the shrines of American black culture. Its audience
_ discriminating tastes honed by decades of seeing the cream of
black culture _ is known as one of the nation's most demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the Apollo is you've got a real honest
audience,'' said Rock. ``In the first HBO special, a guy (in an
opening act) is getting booed off the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rock is unlikely to suffer the same fate, it has happened
``a few times, far too numerous actually.''
</P>
<P>
   But he shrugs it off as the price of audacity: ``You're trying
out stuff. If you're not going to be conventional, there's always
the chance they'll turn on you. But being on the stage is the only
place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rock's many projects, what he really wants to do is,
yes, direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not crazy for a comedian to say that,'' Rock said. ``When
you're a comedian, you've got your act, there's producing, there's
writing, there's performing. If you're a comedian, your job is to
make things better than they are on paper. That's what a director's
job is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already learned from such directors as ``Lethal Weapon's''
Richard Donner, Kevin Smith and Neil Labute.
</P>
<P>
   Of the latter two, whose films he will appear in this summer, he
says, ``They're both really intense, meticulous, dark guys, the
first really A-list guys I've worked with, other than Dick Donner.
There's a big difference between an A director and a B director.''
</P>
<P>
   And the difference is?
</P>
<P>
   ``An A director is like a great corner man in a fight, who
really knows what they're doing, really knows how to tell you how
to slip the punch,'' Rock said. ``B directors tend to get scared:
`Oh, no, he's hitting you pretty hard.' The secret is preparation.
It's all preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock laces his conversation with sports metaphors, evidence of
his love of athletics. So, was he so sports-minded growing up? &QL; 
``I played everything, and I sucked at everything,'' he says
freely. And now? ``I watch everything, go to everything, and I
still suck at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Except work. That he does very, very, very well. &QL;

AL JARREAU, 59, GETTING 2ND WIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUG CARROLL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Al Jarreau has been at this singing thing for a long
time now, and it has taken him places that his boyhood dream of
playing baseball never would have.
</P>
<P>
   He has won five Grammy Awards. His distinctive, soaring tenor,
reminiscent of Nat King Cole or Johnny Mathis, is fluent in pop,
R&AMP;B and jazz. He is respected in the music business as a consummate
professional, a class act.
</P>
<P>
   So, if he's that good, how come he's still such a well-kept
secret? It's a question that Jarreau burns to answer with the next
stage of his career. At age 59, he has a new record label
(PolyGram) and a new outlook to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of the second half,'' says Jarreau.
``I'm still looking for that brass ring of reaching the numbers I
know I can reach when my music gets heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm long overdue for a big hit album. . . . There are some
mediocre singers who sell 8 to 10 million records, and I think I
have the potential to do like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau has had steady but hardly spectacular sales during a
career that took root back in the mid-'60s when he was part of a
trio headed by George Duke, with whom he still collaborates.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, name a Jarreau tune besides ``We're in This Love
Together.'' Can't? That's what we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've paid for my records with the record company and made a
few bucks,'' he says. ``But my income comes from going to Chicago
or Arizona or Bemidji, Minnesota, concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still striving to make it, in lots of ways, in my own
head. I think I haven't laid a glove on (listeners) yet. The
potential audience out there for music with something to say is
bigger than I've experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau admits his versatility may have worked against him. This
is a man who won Grammys for Best Male Pop Vocalist and Best Male
Jazz Vocalist (begin ital) in the same year (end ital) (1980). He
played Teen Angel in ``Grease'' on Broadway. He has big-band and
symphony projects he wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably carry the label of `jazz singer,' but that's not
really true,'' says Jarreau, a preacher's kid from Milwaukee who
grew up in a musical family. ``I'm not the jazz singer people
expect me to be, or like the ones who have been before. I couldn't
be pinned down as a jazz, R&AMP;B or pop singer. I have been blessed
with a love for different kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   His first album for PolyGram is due in January and will stay
true to the eclecticism that fans are accustomed to. It will
include ``God's Gift to the World,'' a duet with Vanessa Williams
that Jarreau says is ``a real anthemic, heart-and-soul song.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially refreshing is Jarreau's heart-and-soul passion for
what he does _ and the ease with which he expresses it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the joy of my life,'' he says of singing. ``It makes me
laugh and grin and smile. It's the fountain of youth. I'm so
blessed to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Jarreau thought he could make a living at
shortstop. He played baseball at Ripon College in Wisconsin and
entertained visions of a big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great and the dream was fun,'' he says. ``That's the
stuff of life, man, dreaming and seeing yourself in the future _
and having that inspire you.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, chords won out over curveballs. He has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distinctive sound of a singer or horn player is something
we strive for or hope to arrive at,'' Jarreau says. ``I'm glad to
hear that from people. They say, `A song came on the radio and I
knew it was you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Should be a fascinating second half. &QL;

biggest taboo: the day troops moved into Beijing and dispersed the

loose gravel of a decade of prosperity and, with public
soul-searching strictly forbidden, the conflicts and trauma they
evoke have been left unresolved. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

BUS SYSTEM TESTS ELECTRONIC ARRIVAL TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Muni, the San Francisco bus system, is testing
electronic message boards that post approximate arrival times of
buses for riders accustomed to waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the electronic message boards, which rely on a satellite
global positioning system to transmit bus locations, were activated
Wednesday along the 22-Filmore line. The boards are part of a pilot
project scheduled to run for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, the system could change the wait-and-see nature of
riding public buses. Riders determine arrival times of buses by
using the electronic boards or they could log on to a Web site and
time their departure from office or home to the next arriving bus.
Eventually, the system's designers said, riders could even see how
many people are on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much needed,'' said Joan Dill, a frequent rider, watching
as Mayor Willie Brown and Muni chief Michael Burns touted the
system. ``Waiting for buses has always been a problem, and this
will give us an estimation of how long you'll be standing there.
Believe it or not, they used to have something called a schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the system would improve the reliability of service
by telling both customers and Muni's command center where buses
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This line was chosen because it was selected as the most
unreliable,'' Burns said. ``If it works here, it can work
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of NextBus Information Systems, the Emeryville,
Calif., company that designed the system, said the signs were 95
percent accurate based on testing.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Maresca, chief operating officer of NextBus, said accuracy
would rise to 99 percent if the system were installed on all lines.
The cost of installing the system at the 4,500 stops in San
Francisco would be about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the city would evaluate the performance of the system
before considering whether to buy the signs. Muni could be the
first large urban transit department to install the system.

BODY'S WAR ON DISEASE PITS ANTIOXIDANTS VS. FREE RADICALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Medical researchers tell of a war that never ends.
</P>
<P>
   It takes place every day of our lives at the cellular level
between harmful elements known as free radicals and beneficial ones
called antioxidants.
</P>
<P>
   Antioxidants have been known in medical circles for 50 years,
but they've only recently surfaced in mainstream health. They occur
naturally in our bodies as enzymes. They've also been discovered in
certain fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The public is primarily aware of them as supplements added to
products that boldly tout an array of possible benefits _
everything from preventing heart disease and cancer to staving off
arthritis, eye cataracts and Alzheimer's. They're also said to slow
down the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a lot of confusion about antioxidants; even more
regarding their evil counterparts, the free radicals.
</P>
<P>
   A name reminiscent of '60s activists, free radicals are actually
volatile atoms or groups of atoms that can trigger chain reactions
capable of causing damage to biological targets, such as cells,
proteins and even DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Md., have recently implicated free-radical mechanisms in the
pathology of many human diseases, including cancer, stroke,
malaria, arthritis and neuro-degenerative diseases, as well as in
aging and HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, including Dr. Yang C. Fann, science task manager
for Information Technology Support Service in Research Triangle
Park, N.C., believe that under normal conditions, the effects of
free radicals are neutralized by antioxidants our bodies produce
naturally. Problems occur when additional troops of free radicals
are introduced, primarily through environmental sources, which
throws off the natural internal balance. ITSS is under contract to
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air pollution, smoking, alcohol, etc., contribute to oxidative
damage in our body,'' Fann said. ``Hence, these natural
(antioxidant) enzymes are not enough to defend against the
continuous onslaught of both natural and environmental free
radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why many nutritionists and physicians believe that
eating foods rich in antioxidants helps to even the score.
Antioxidants are found primarily in flavonoids, a large and unique
group of nutrients found in certain vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that certain dietary supplements, such as
vitamins A, C and E, and selenium, with their antioxidant effects,
also help in the fight against environmental free radicals.
However, less conclusive is research that synthetic forms of
antioxidants, such as vitamin supplements, are as valuable as those
found naturally in foods.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association, for example, refuses to endorse
antioxidant supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Valley health professionals offer varying opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe antioxidants found in foods as well as dietary
supplements have an effect,'' said Marcia Francis, a staff
pharmacist for CIGNA HealthCare in Phoenix. ``I take the
supplements. I think they have a real benefit, especially since we
have so much exposure to pollutants and chemicals, and all these
things that are harmful to our bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Moss, a general practitioner in Fountain Hills,
recommends antioxidants in natural food form to his patients. He's
not as sold on supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start isolating them, then you need to start looking
at them as a medicinal product and have to be careful,'' Moss said.
``A lot of people are making a lot of money on this not totally
defined product.''
</P>
<P>
   A general Internet search on the key word ``antioxidants'' turns
up page after page of entrepreneurs selling health products with
``environmental toxin fighting'' antioxidants. Most of these
products simply have antioxidant vitamins A, C or E added to them.
You can buy energy bars with antioxidants, honey with antioxidants,
sunscreen with antioxidants and much more.
</P>
<P>
   Juice bars have also jumped on the antioxidant bandwagon by
offering Smoothies and vegetable drinks with antioxidants. These
antioxidants, however, are usually the natural kind found in fresh
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karla Birkholz, a family practitioner with Your Family
Physician in Glendale, acknowledges that Americans spend ``huge
amounts of money on nothing'' in the health and nutrition fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do believe antioxidants should be part of the prevention
regimen,'' Birkholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Moss, she is not as convinced that synthetic antioxidants
have the same impact as natural ones, but she doesn't dismiss the
potential of antioxidant vitamins, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitamins C and E have been shown to have value,'' Birkholz
said. ``Minerals like selenium and zinc also appear useful at
absorbing free radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as a pharmacist, Francis said, she knows for certain
that the established medical community is writing prescriptions
featuring antioxidant vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of breast-cancer patients and Alzheimer's patients are
taking vitamin E,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   New sources of antioxidants are still being discovered, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now believe a very good source comes from grape seeds,''
Francis said. ``They've also discovered one of the most potent
antioxidants in a particular species of pine tree that grows in the
southern Mediterranean. This tree contains pycnogenol, a chemical
structure that specifically prevents sun damage to the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Francis believes in synthetic antioxidants, she points
out that it's unwise to begin taking any dietary supplement without
first discussing it with one's physician and pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people should definitely not take antioxidants,'' Francis
said. ``Patients undergoing radiation or chemotherapy could do
damage to their treatments by taking antioxidants.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, in the discussion and analysis of antioxidants, it's
looking more and more like our mothers were right in pushing the
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain healthy antioxidant levels, nutritionists recommend
two to three servings of fruit per day and three to five servings
of vegetables daily.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that supplements also help, it's generally believed
best to take a multivitamin, which offers a range of antioxidants
and nutrients.  &QL;

HMOS TAKE NOTICE: BREAST FEEDING GOOD FOR BABIES, BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA VALDEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Imagine you were an anthropologist visiting from
another planet. It wouldn't take you long to assess the
significance of female breasts in our culture: They are for
marketing and men.
</P>
<P>
   It's a conclusion based on solid evidence: Nobody in America
goes broke overestimating the selling power of the breast. From``
Playboy'' to WonderBra to Hooters, fortunes have been built on the
swell and tilt of young, human mammary glands.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the evidence in popular culture, breasts are not
primarily tools for profit or pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   They are designed to feed babies.
</P>
<P>
   And they are so good at it that a pair of University of Arizona
researchers say HMOs could take the benefits to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anne L. Wright and Dr. Thomas M. Ball of the Department of
Pediatrics at the Arizona Health Sciences Center in Tucson found
that babies who aren't breast-fed rack up bigger medical bills. In
the first year of life, each formula-fed baby costs between $331
and $445 more than one who feeds on mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   Their study was an effort to put a dollar value on the what
medical science has known for years about the wonders of human
milk. Mother's milk changes in composition as an infant's needs
change. It stimulates immunological responses, it promotes tissue
growth in the brain and lungs. It's even associated with higher IQs
in later childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Those are such amazing life-giving, health-giving benefits that
you'd think female breasts would enjoy a place or reverence in our
society. But instead of being treated with dignity as the Grande
Dames of Motherhood, they get glitzy billing as shallow starlets.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific knowledge didn't change that. Maybe cold cash can.
The study by Wright and Ball offers impressive numbers for the bean
counters who run health maintenance organizations. If it gets the
attention it deserves, attitudes toward breasts and breast-feeding
could change dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have jumbo-size buying power to use for babies' well-being.
They can influence what hospitals do by sending patients only to
hospitals that facilitate, rather than undermine, breast-feeding.
They can make it standard practice to have lactation specialists
available to provide tips and guidance to new mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Business can also play a role _ and reap a benefit _ from
breast-feeding. The researchers found that ``If a parent misses two
hours of work for the excess illness attributable to
formula-feeding, more than 2,000 hours _ the equivalent of one year
of employment _ are lost per 1,000 never-breast-fed infants.''
</P>
<P>
   Just over half of mothers nationwide start breast-feeding, says
Wright, but many give up after a short period of time. Returning to
work is one big reason women quit giving their babies the best food
there is for them, Wright says.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses can help turn that around by offering support _ and
private rooms with electricity and refrigerators _ for women who
want to pump milk after they return from maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Other women stop breast-feeding _ or don't start _ because
doctors, hospitals, family and friends are indifferent to the value
of mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have to have that support to buck what our society says
about breasts,'' says Wright.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation were photos of cleavage are far more common than
tableaus of mothers nursing infants, the ladies who lactate need
champions.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ironic if they get them because of a new
understanding of the monetary worth of breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that breasts have long been heralded more for
their performance on jiggle shows than for their value to infants,
the crassness of the motivation will be less important than the
satisfied burp of well-fed babies. &QL;

   CRASH _ LITTLE ROCK _ The pilot of the American Airlines jet
that crashed was getting a ``play by play'' about the deteriorating
weather in the minutes before the accident, a federal safety
official said today. NTSB investigators hoped to talk to the crew's
first officer, Michael Origel, today to see what he remembers about
the minutes before the crash. They were waiting for a doctor's
authorization. They're also looking at the runway's grooving and
drainage system, both of which could have preventing hydroplaning.

if Barr can't deliver on vital pocketbook issues in his district
such as the C-130J program. With Lockheed-Martin announcing that it
will reduce the size of its Marietta workforce as a result of not
getting enough contracts for C-130s, Barr's legislative abilities
are being tested. We will talk to Barr, experts on Barr's political

who investigated the case said he doesn't believe anyone struck
Campos _ who was kept isolated during his two-week stay due to
severe symptoms of alchohol withdrawal _ but he called
``questionable'' the four hours that Campos was left lying on the

it looks as though the next budget will include money for at least
4 and maybe as many as 7 of the $60 million planes. That's what can
happen when a powerful Democrat decides his local National Guard
unit absolutely needs one and the Senate Majority Leader discovers
a crying need for two in (guess where?) Mississippi. (Sherman,

FED OFFICIAL REASSURES CONSUMERS ON MILLENNIUM GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The head of the Federal Reserve's Western
district sought to reassure the public Wednesday that the Year 2000
computer glitch wouldn't ravage the nation's financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an economist, I deal with probabilities all the time,''
said Robert T. Parry, president of the Fed's San Francisco
district, which covers nine Western states. ``I think the
probabilities are very high that on Jan. 1, 2000, nothing very
unusual is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry predicted that checks, automated teller machines, credit
and debit cards, and direct deposits would run smoothly, despite
forecasts that the banking system will crash and burn.
</P>
<P>
   Parry told the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco that there may
be short-term, isolated disruptions. A widespread financial crisis
is unlikely, though, because the government and banks have taken
many precautions over the past year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 98 percent of the computer systems in thousands of banks
that do business with the Fed are ready for the date change, Parry
said. The remaining 2 percent will meet federal regulations for
2000 readiness by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The concern arises from older computers and other electronic
devices that originally were programmed to recognize only the last
two digits of a year and may fail or malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators from the Fed and other government agencies have
examined banks over the past year to ensure they can handle the
date change.
</P>
<P>
   The banks and the Fed also have set up emergency plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if there's a huge cash demand? What if there are power
outages? What if there's a disruption in armored carrier service?''
said Carol Eckert, a Fed spokeswoman. ``We don't think that'll
happen, but these are part of the contingency plans.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure what may happen to the nation's financial system,
businesses, government agencies, and transportation and energy
networks. To play it safe, tens of billions of dollars have been
spent to upgrade technology.
</P>
<P>

get a free copy of ``The Year 2000, Your Bank and You,'' from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which oversees state-chartered
banks not covered by the Fed. The FDIC can be reached toll-free at

SANTA BARBARA DUO GIVE FILM SCHOOL NEW REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ``Shadow'' knows, and so does Daniel Kutner.
</P>
<P>
   Working around the clock for nearly six months, the senior at
the University of California, Santa Barbara, got an education in
the rigors of filmmaking. With the surf and the Isla Vista party
scene raging around them, he and film-studies partner Brian Emerson
rarely left the house as they made ``Shadow of a Drought,'' their
animated student production that marked a breakthrough for UCSB's
academically oriented film school.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that talent knows no bounds, Kutner and Emerson will
take home UCSB's first-ever Student Academy Award this month when
they receive their medallion for ``Shadow,'' which is in
competition with animated entries from New York University and
California Institute of Arts near Los Angeles. Entries from UCSB _
which offers only two animation classes _ had been nominated before
but never reached the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a school where, if you're willing to kill yourself
making a film, you can make one,'' says Kutner, who served as the
co-writer and producer for ``Shadow.'' Co-writer Emerson also
handled the directing duties on their production, which employed
three types of animation: computer-generated imagery, cel and bond,
and clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no social life for months. We left the houses only to
get dinner,'' adds Kutner, who hails from La Jolla. Emerson is from
West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of ``Shadow'' follows the disappearance of
cinema's most beloved actor, who vanishes from the set of the
motion picture ``Drought.'' A tabloid reporter goes in search of
the star and, through his interviews, strings together a history of
animation and its destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The production was a combined effort of the film studies
department, engineering and computer engineering sectors on campus.
Engineering students designed and built the film's claymation set,
and computer engineering students served as on-call troubleshooters
for the production team. Cel painters for ``Shadow'' were just
anybody who would volunteer some time.
</P>
<P>
   UCSB was also a national finalist in the documentary category.
``Portraits'' by Ivan Oyco and Jesse Baldwin brought an added
measure of acclaim to the campus known more for its surf and party
atmosphere than rigorous academic standards. For Kutner, beating
the odds and more prestigious universities with their better
equipment and famous alumni only reinforces his belief about the
essence of moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter because in the end, it's how well you tell
the story.'' &QL;

A CASUALTY OF WAR :  FEWER TRAVEL TO CENTRAL EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ The pretty, cobblestone streets that wind through the
city's picturesque Castle District are usually almost unnavigable
this time of year, as throngs of tourists line up for a look inside
the Matyas Temple, or the view of the Danube from Fisherman's
Bastion.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, the queues are short and the outdoor cafes are
nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a casualty of war, or maybe just the end result of years
of dozing during geography class. Hungary's tourism industry is
suffering from what frustrated Hungarian officials call an unfair
and inaccurate idea that the Central European nation is in a war
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary _ and Budapest _ is one of the safest places in the
world,'' says Peter Kraft, the country's newly named state
secretary for Tourism. ``Now that we are in NATO, we are safer than
in anytime during our 1,000-year history.''
</P>
<P>
   True, those countries look close on the map. There's Yugoslavia,
being bombed every day for 71 days by NATO. And there's Hungary,
right on Yugoslavia's northern border.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there haven't been any war-related incidents on the
Hungarian side, although residents who live near the border report
they have sometimes heard the bombing. Still, some tourists have
been afraid to come, and the nervousness could end up costing
Hungary hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism industry in Hungary has been growing exponentially
since the political changes of 1990, and last year brought in $2.5
billion in revenues. Factor in the ``grey economy'' _ for example,
private homeowners who rent their rooms to travelers _ the number
is closer to $5 billion, Kraft estimates.
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to a startling 10 percent of Hungary's Gross
Domestic Product _ money it can't afford to lose because of some
silly misperceptions by foreigners, Kraft notes.
</P>
<P>
   GKI, a respected Hungarian research firm, estimates that
Hungary's surplus revenues from tourism could drop from $1.3
billion last year to $1 billion this year. The Hungarian Chamber of
Industry and Commerce projects a drop of $250 to $400 million in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations in the region are feeling the hit as well.
Croatia, which was just beginning to recover from the drop in
tourism resulting from the Balkans wars of 1995-97, is again being
victimized by the current war.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, too, is being affected _ not just because of its
proximity to Yugoslavia, but because the anti-NATO sentiment among
some of the populace makes Westerners skittish. Flughafen Wien AG,
which runs Vienna's International Airport, reported Wednesday that
air traffic was lower in April and May because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has affected us dramatically,'' said Janos Kurucz,
director of Vista, a leading Hungarian tourist agency. Croatia and
Greece _ longtime favorite holiday destinations for Hungarians _
have greatly decreased, he said. Air packages to Greece have
dropped by 20 percent, while bus trips to Greece have sunk by 60
percent, Kurucz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reasons are mainly psychological,'' he said.
``People simply feel uneasy traveling abroad'' when there's a war
on, Kurucz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to go to Greece, but we decided not to do it. Our
parents were against it, because they thought it was dangerous,''
said Shelly Tymkow, 20, a student at New Jersey's Rowan University.
So she decided to come to Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   But if their elders knew they were in Hungary, ``they'd die,''
said Tymkow's traveling companion, 21-year-old Jaime Zazzara, as
she stood near Budapest's St. Stefan's Basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Making a strong offense their best defense, Hungary has been
aggressively pushing itself to tourists. Some $300,000 of the
tourism budget has been redirected to a special marketing campaign
to combat unfounded war hysteria. Kraft has been personally
visiting European capitals to work with the Hungarian tourist
agencies there.
</P>

TELEVISION COMES TO BHUTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THIMPU, Bhutan _ They missed the first moonwalk, the O.J.
Simpson trial, the final episode of ``Seinfeld,'' and thousands of
hours of televised coverage of President Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky. In fact, most people here haven't heard of Neil
Armstrong, O.J. or Bill _ or, for that matter, television.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night, inhabitants of this remote kingdom tucked
in the Himalayas officially welcomed the talking box, taking a step
closer to a modern world kept at bay for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded into homes and shops equipped with TV sets, some stared
and others cheered and whistled at the nation's inaugural broadcast
_ the 25th anniversary celebration of their king's coronation.
Masked dancers twirled on the screen before them, clad in colorful
skirts and pointed metal helmets that, to Western eyes, looked
straight out of the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, after orange-robed monks blessed fruits, rice,
and ornate silver jugs of salty, buttered tea _ and the country's
first Internet service provider _ one of the king's four wives
pressed a button that launched the nation into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shangri-La, the fictional Himalayan paradise of the 1930s
classic novel ``Lost Horizon,'' where inhabitants of the secluded
valley never aged, so too the kingdom of Bhutan has managed to
shelter itself from the outside world and largely freeze its
culture in time.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of TV and the Internet to mark the anniversary
of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck's coronation is the latest move in a
gradual campaign to bring this poor nation out of isolation, but it
is also the most controversial. In a country that had only one
murder last year and where officials say only one person has died
of AIDS, some worry that throwing open a window to the outside
world could usher in a torrent of social ills unimagined by most
people here, and reshape the very fabric of Bhutanese life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go home and watch TV, it means you won't be talking to
your grandmom,'' said Karma Gallay, 27, who works for his family's
construction company in Thimpu. ``I'm afraid TV will glamorize
foreign culture. . . . Material possession is counted as such
success in the West, but here, you'll see a farmer saving every
chhetrum (penny) to build a monastery or a stupa for religion. I
don't want to lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are others such as Chencho Gyeltshen, 17, a
crimson-robed monk, who see a benefit to the changes: ``It's good
to have TV so we can know what other countries are doing. I know
India's below and China's above, but what happens there, I don't
know. On the other hand, I can see it as an evil, because someone
who never knew of stealing or murder could see it on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing the good and evil of the modern world is a familiar
challenge in Bhutan; its leaders have tried for three decades to
follow a path to progress with one foot planted firmly in the past.
King Jigme's oft-repeated motto is to promote ``gross national
happiness'' _ the notion that material wealth and development
should not supplant spiritual well-being, cultural traditions, and
environmental preservation. Bhutanese people say that as much as
they might have to learn from the modern world, the West could also
stand to learn from Bhutan's example.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan is the only remaining independent Buddhist kingdom in the
Himalayas. Tibet, Sikkim, and Ladakh have all been annexed by
neighboring China or India, and perhaps that is why Bhutan has so
fiercely guarded its heritage and shied away from outside contact.
Tourism began only in 1974, and is limited by a $200 daily tourist
tax. Last year was the highest number ever _ a mere 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   This is a country of 700,000 people with 9,000 phone lines, not
a single traffic light, where the pace is so unhurried that dogs
sun themselves lazily in the road, and more people are killed by
bears than cars. It is a place with negligible crime, no lawyers,
and 5,000 underemployed soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side of preserving heritage and nature has been,
until recently, a lack of modern advances to improve people's
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, this country of spectacular, rugged topography had
no roads, and all travel was by horseback on winding mountain
passes. The country has no postal system or paper currency, not to
mention hospitals, running water, electricity or telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a small airport and 2,100 miles of road traverse
the country, though many people still live several days' walk from
the nearest road. The government says a majority of villages have
access to a health center, a primary school, piped water, and
latrines. Nearly 32,000 households have electricity, though 70
percent of homes still do not. Since 1985, the infant mortality
rate has halved, literacy has doubled to 54 percent, and life
expectancy has jumped by 20 years to 66.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutan's per capita income of $645 is poor by Western standards,
but it is the highest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the country is largely poor, hungry, and inadequately
educated. That is why many here think television and the Internet
could become powerful teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, watching TV was illegal in Bhutan, though
hundreds of people had set up satellite dishes and were watching
foreign programs, from wrestling to Hindi movies. Officials
estimate that there are 5,000 computers in the country, most in
offices, and about 4,000 TV sets, most of which were being used to
watch imported videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an advantage'' to TV and the Internet. ``Bhutan is
landlocked and one of the world's least developed countries, and
we'd like to copy and learn from other countries' experiences,''
said Sherub Tenzin, 49, the governor of Paro district. ``The
challenge is for people themselves to choose good from bad. But we
are so deeply rooted in our culture and religion that I think what
is bad or good can easily be seen by any humble person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kencho Pem, 41, a farmer in Pangzhi, a village less than an
hour's drive from the capital, has never seen a television, but
likes the idea of a box that is like a radio with pictures. She
would be willing to save as much as $200 toward buying one, but
first has to wait for electrical lines.
</P>
<P>
   Pem understands that TV would bring puzzling information from
faraway places, but says ``it would be good to have this TV. People
should have a positive attitude to whatever they see. Forget what's
bad and just take the good. Even if someone doesn't know how to
steal and sees it on TV, that doesn't mean they will pick up that
habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Novice news anchor Tshewang Dendup, 29, has seen American news
and received two days of TV training last month. But he isn't
trying to emulate Tom Brokaw or Larry King. Like everything Bhutan
does, he said, ``We're trying to take the best from the West and
also the cream of Bhutan culture _ the middle path. It's a
tremendous challenge, especially in a society where half the
population is illiterate and what you project is going to be very
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Karma Ura, director of the Center for Bhutan Studies, worries
less about viewers aping bad habits from TV, and more about them
starting to question their own way of life. He has seen a few
moments of ``Baywatch,'' which he described as ``statuesque people
surfing in their underwear,'' and did not see the value of such a
show to the 85 percent of Bhutanese who are farmers.
</P>
<P>
   For villagers, ``TV will at first be a source of fascination and
excitement. People will see things they've never conceived of as
possible _ how tall others are, how rich they are.'' But he frets
that the next, perhaps inevitable, stage is to start to feel
inferior to an imaginary Hollywood life.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a carpet in front of his computer and an old-style,
unbound book of Buddhist writings, Ura reflected that ``Bhutan
balances tradition and modernity, environmentalism and development,
materialism and spirituality. It requires great courage not to
follow international trends . . . especially when your choice is so
divergent.''

UNEASE SETS IN AS ISRAELI-BACKED MILITIA EXITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEZZINE, Lebanon _ From a stone tower above the army post, a
white statue of the Virgin Mary cast a merciful glance down upon
the Israeli-paid militiamen as they nervously watched their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's proxy forces, known as the South Lebanon Army, early
Thursday completed the first staged retreat of the last active
warfront in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, while pulling back from positions in the
surrounding villages, six soldiers stood guard around a rusted, old
tank at the entrance to this town. They trained automatic rifles at
cars approaching the checkpoint, occasionally firing warning shots.
</P>
<P>
   Inside one such car, a woman with children screamed: ``We are
going to the school!''
</P>
<P>
   The SLA is on edge these days, but with reason.
</P>
<P>
   To the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas gaining ground in
their war of attrition against Israeli occupation of South Lebanon,
the SLA soldiers in this Christian enclave are collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   To the Lebanese government, which is officially in a state of
war with Israel, the SLA forces are traitors who face treason
charges in court that could carry the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   To the Israelis, they provide a foothold in places like this
strategic enclave just north of Israel's self-proclaimed ``security
zone.'' Israel pays the militiamen $550-a-month in US currency.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the SLA fighters claim they signed up to support their
families, or because they were coerced into joining by the
occupying Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are halfway through the withdrawal,'' said the regional SLA
commander, who asked that his name not be used because he feared
for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are scared, very frightened. . . . The Lebanese
government is saying we are collaborators, but we are like any
Lebanese. We are the people,'' said the 40-year-old SLA major.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of this commander and the SLA forces who serve with him
hangs in the balance as this initial withdrawal could set the stage
for a larger withdrawal of Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has vowed to bring home
2,000 Israeli troops within one year from the 6-to-10-mile-wide
swath of land it has occupied in south Lebanon since 1985 to
protect its northern border against incursions and rockets. The
withdrawal was a campaign promise that resonated with many voters
who see Lebanon as Israel's Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA major recently inherited the job of regional commander
after two consecutive predecessors were killed in roadside bombs.
He will soon join his family which has retreated deeper inside the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
   A feeling has set in that the SLA forces are unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier at the checkpoint, who also asked his name not be
used, said, ``I will go to Israel. We will be safe with them.'' He
added, ``If I stay, they'll beat me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those planning to turn themselves in, he added, ``They are
making a big mistake. They will end up in jail. Or they will end up
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another SLA soldier, younger, thinner, and chain smoking
Marlboro Lights as he spoke, said he was planning to stay in
Jezzine, where he was born, and take his chances despite the dire
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would camp out on the outskirts of town and see if
Lebanese army moves troops in. If Hezbollah forces take control of
the area, he said he would run for his life.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was worried that he would be tried by the
Lebanese as a collaborator, he said, ``If they put me in jail, they
would have to put all Jezzine in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Jezzine, the center of a rocky valley of hillside villages set
among terraced vineyards and citrus groves, is now nearly empty.
Its population was more than 20,000 in the mid-1980s and is now
less than 5,000. More families in this predominantly Christian town
fled in recent days. Many of them, especially those who sided with
the SLA, fear reprisals from the Hezbollah fighters and their
guiding clerics.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, which is roughly 75 percent Muslim and 25 percent
Christian, the specter of sectarian violence always lurks. But it
casts a more pronounced shadow these days over what many hope is
the beginning of the end of this war.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah press attache Ibrahim Musawi insisted Wednesday that
``the Christian fears are irrational'' and added, ``It is Israel
that is stirring these primitive instincts and fears of sectarian
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   A cliffside Maronite Christian monastery several miles from
Jezzine has opened its doors to take in a frightened population.
Rev. Paul Khawand, of the Maronite order, has also gathered the
names of 203 militiamen who have deserted the SLA and are willing
to surrender and face legal action. Khawand met with Hezbollah
leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah to help ensure the safety of the SLA
deserters and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was very positive,'' said the Rev. Abdel Alam.
``It's a volatile situation, but people are working very hard to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Farid Khazen, a political scientist at American University of
Beirut, said the Lebanese government must exert influence
immediately after the SLA pullout and that it should adopt an
amnesty bill pending in the parliament for SLA soldiers who turn
themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is not handled properly by the Lebanese government, it
will polarize the people further along religious lines,'' Khazen
said. ``But if it is handled properly, it will help rebuild
national unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Muslim-Christian tension lurks beneath the surface, for
many families the key issue is security. Three generations of the
Nawfals were sitting on a patio in front of their home. They are
Christian, but said they get along fine with their Muslim
neighbors. What they want is an end to the violence and a chance to
build a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time it is bombs and explosions here,'' said Charbel
Nawfal, 40. As if on cue, the thunder of shelling rumbled in the
hills.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a turn in the road, a blackened patch of earth 75
yards away, where just 10 days ago an SLA commander and his driver
were killed by a roadside bomb, the deadly signature of Hezbollah.
The blast blew out four windows in the home where he lives with his
wife and four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against the violence,'' he said, ``no matter where it
comes from.''

TEN YEARS AFTER TIANANMEN, CHINA IS STILL TYRANNICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 11 days in the late fall of 1993, a group of senior Chinese
policymakers gathered behind closed doors in the Jingxi Hotel in
Beijing. They came together to lay out a long-term military and
foreign-affairs strategy for China; among the participants were
high-ranking officials from the Communist Party (including its
powerful Central Committee) and the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed report on the group's consensus was subsequently
leaked to the Hong Kong journal Cheng Ming. It began with these
words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whom does the Communist Party of China regard as its
international archenemy? It is the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The report went on to charge that a key goal of US foreign
policy was ``to control and sanction China'' into bending toward
the West; to subsidize ``hostile forces both inside and outside
Chinese territory'' in order to ``stir up turbulence''; to punish
China with economic sanctions while whipping up regional fears of a
Chinese threat; and ``to manipulate Japan and South Korea'' into
following America's anti-China strategy.
</P>
<P>
   This was, to repeat, in late 1993 _ nearly a year into the
Clinton administration, well after the president had conspicuously
retreated from his campaign attack on George Bush for ``coddling
tyrants'' and agreed to renew China's most-favored-nation trade
status.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Clinton would be explicitly de-linking trade from
human rights and embarking on a policy of ``engagement'' with China
that would elevate business considerations above all others.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing's view of the United States would not soften. In
mid-1996, ``China Can Say No'' would become a runaway Chinese
best-seller. Its thesis: America is China's implacable enemy and
must be fought diplomatically, economically, politically, and
culturally. Books are not published in China unless the Communist
rulers want them published; this one even included an introduction
by Chai Zemin, China's first ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In short, no one should have been astonished at the riots that
raged outside US government offices in China last month following
the unintended bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
Beijing's dictators have been feeding and nurturing anti-American
hostility for years. The surprise was not that the government
fanned the fires of public hysteria _ it repeatedly asserted that
the embassy tragedy was no mistake and that NATO's Kosovo operation
is a vicious campaign of American aggression _ but that it turned
off the violence after only four days.
</P>
<P>
   What was on display in China last month was no aberration. The
government that bused demonstrators to the US embassy in Beijing so
that they could hurl rocks and Molotov cocktails through its
windows is unchanged in any important respect from the government
that sent the tanks and machine guns into Tiananmen Square 10 years
ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are more computers in China today than there were in
1989. There are more cellular phones and tabloid newspapers, more
Michael Jordan T-shirts and Nike sneakers. But there is not more
freedom. There is less.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1989, millions, literally, of Chinese took to
the streets _ men and women, old and young, from every walk of
life, in Beijing and 80 other cities _ to plead for democracy and
an end to repression. It was a moment of hope and courage
unparalleled in China's long history; it ended in screams and blood
and mass-murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since then, China's Communist tyrants have
strangled every attempt to revive the movement for liberty and
reform. Every known democracy activist of 1989 has been killed,
imprisoned, or exiled. Political dissidents continue to be rounded
up, convicted in sham trials, and thrown behind bars. Many have
been tortured.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, like George Bush before him, has embraced the
fiction that trade leads to democracy, that the more we ``engage''
the Chinese with business deals and summit meetings, the freer and
friendlier China will become. Clinton has taken this
Sino-appeasement to depths even Bush didn't plumb _ inviting the
Chinese general who presided over the Tiananmen slaughter to the
White House, for example, and approving the sale to China of
missile-guidance technology.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't worked. Appeasing totalitarians never does. Ten years
after Tiananmen, the junta in Beijing remains a deadly threat to
Chinese citizens who denounce Communist rule, to devout Christians
who refuse to worship in state-approved churches, to the free
people of Taiwan who refuse to bow to Chinese hegemony. Ten years
after Tiananmen, Tibetan monks and nuns are still beaten and
jailed, the laogai slave labor camps still operate, and women are
still subjected to forced abortions and sterilization. Ten years
after Tiananmen, China has missiles targeted at the United States
and has spies employed in stealing America's nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Some engagements are better off broken. The Bush-Clinton China
engagement is one of them. To whom, after all, do we owe our
loyalty? The dictators of Beijing, who treat America as an
``international archenemy?'' Or the men and women of the Chinese
nation, who once filled the streets in a plea for democracy _ but
who know they would be killed if they tried it today?

GENETIC FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their original form, tomatoes were white, woody, and roughly
the size of a Ping-Pong ball. They got to be red, juicy, and plump
through a haphazard series of experiments undertaken over the years
by farmers and agronomists in search of a ``better'' tomato. By
trial and error, Ping-Pong ball tomatoes were transformed into the
product you buy today.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the genetic structure of food has been going on for
centuries. The technology now exists to modify food genetically on
purpose, so that it can be better for you, more resistant to
blight, and capable of delivering pharmaceutical benefits as well.
Major agribusiness companies are hard at work developing lima beans
that are twice as nutritious, soya that kill pests while growing,
and spinach that can help relieve hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of biotechnology and agriculture holds enormous
promise for the future. If agribusiness can harvest better food,
then the world's growing population can be fed and properly
nourished. If agribusiness can harvest vegetables that have
medicinal benefits, then the world's population might live
healthier (and presumably happier) lives. If agribusiness can plant
food that is pest-resistant, then crop yields will grow
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a hitch. The hitch is that, inevitably, the genetic
engineering of food will have unintended consequences. The big fear
is that genetic engineering might lead to some kind of genetic or
environmental accident. Two weeks ago, the scientific journal
Nature published an article that raised this fear to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   The article, written by three distinguished scientists, reported
that a genetically modified form of corn, known as Bt corn,
produces a wind-borne pollen that can kill monarch butterflies that
breed in the heart of the American Corn Belt. As The New York Times
reported, ``Academic researchers praised the study as a first step
in understanding a previously unsuspected risk,'' saying that it
``provided the first evidence that pollen from a transgenic plant
can harm nonpest species.'' Major agribusiness concerns, like
Monsanto and Novartis Agribusiness Biotechnology, challenged the
study's findings, demanding further research before any regulatory
decisions were made.
</P>
<P>
   Bt corn has proven to be a wildly popular agricultural
technology here. It produces a toxin that kills corn-boring pests
as it grows. Roughly 20 million acres of America's 80-million-acre
Corn Belt are planted with Bt corn, and that number is expected to
double in the near future. American farmers swear by the product,
which saves time and expense and makes their fields far more
productive.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that major markets for American agricultural
products are in an uproar over genetically modified (GM) food.
Opposition in Europe is reaching a crisis level. Fewer than 1
percent of Britons recently polled by Market Opinion Research
International said they would eat GM food, and major agribusinesses
(like Nestle) are now labeling their food products as ``not-GM'' in
order to assuage British consumers.
</P>
<P>
   British opposition to GM food is led by no less than Prince
Charles (leading one genomics scientist to suggest that perhaps the
royal family should be genetically modified). The prince's
opposition has sparked a revival of his popularity with the British
public, who had turned on him at the time of Princess Diana's
death. British politicians have taken note of this swing in the
prince's approval rating, attributed it to his stance on GM food
and mimicked his rhetoric accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to GM food in Britain is particularly acute, of
course, because of the ``mad-cow'' disease scare of a few years
ago. Once burned, twice shy. But it is a major issue throughout the
European community and in Japan as well. US agricultural exports to
these countries are considerable ($11.3 billion to Japan alone) and
the consequences of losing these markets because of a GM food scare
would be severe for the American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of GM food (and fear-mongering about it) are particularly
problematic because Japanese and European politicians have a
history of erecting trade barriers to American agricultural
products. If these politicians can plausibly argue that GM food
represents an environmental hazard, that might enable them to break
off existing trade agreements, which would simultaneously please
two key constituencies: farmers and environmentalists. Politicians,
like everyone else, love a two-for-one deal.
</P>
<P>
   Without US leadership and resolve on this issue, the possibility
exists that genetically modified food may soon become a political
third rail in major markets around the globe. That would be bad
news not just for Monsanto, Novartis, and American farmers, but for
a highly promising technology that could well be the future of
nutrition and public health.

AMID TRENDY STRIP, A HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Newbury Street, the strip of trendy boutiques and brick
row houses with some of the nation's most upscale real estate, will
also be the home of some of the city's most destitute citizens when
a homeless shelter opens on the glitzy stretch next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the two extremes _ the opulent and those just
getting by,'' said Tom Philbin, spokesman for the Department of
Neighborhood Development, which helped fund the shelter in the
basement of Emmanuel Church.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, about 20 mentally ill women have been
sleeping in Back Bay alleys and on benches, in effect choosing the
cool cement of that affluent neighborhood over others, and
impressing their faces on the minds of wealthy shoppers and
residents who step over them.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence in the Back Bay neighborhood is truly a study of
the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the street from the church where six of the women
sleep on any given night is Giorgio Armani, where a woman's
lavender jacket costs $2,300. A few doors down is the Ritz-Carlton
hotel, where a room for the night can cost $800.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the way the city should be,'' said Philip
Mangano, executive director of the Massachusetts Housing and
Shelter Alliance. ``The best cities welcome everybody. Any kind of
exclusivity makes the city soulless.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, street outreach workers have developed
relationships with the women, who have refused to live anywhere but
the streets of Back Bay. Eventually, a half-dozen of the women
agreed to move into the shelter, said Laureen Sandler of the
Tri-City Mental Health and Retardation Center, the organization
that will manage the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on Newbury Street can tell you about these women.
They are women who would normally never use a homeless shelter,''
said Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the church on a recent weekday, Lauren
Wilson sat on the curb shaking a Starbucks cup toward passersby.
``Can you help a lady?'' she asked. ``I come to this corner every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't always feel like anyone gives us a second chance _ so
we give up, commit suicide, or keep getting high. But this shelter
will help us,'' said Wilson, who is now off the streets and living
in an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   People can be generous on Newbury Street, she added. It's not
unusual to be given a $100 bill on a holiday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody has been so welcoming of having a shelter in
Back Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you are going to have some opposition. There is
always going to be some resistance,'' said Mangano. ``People are
concerned of any change; change is scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Luanne Pryor, a Back Bay resident, said that initially residents
were concerned that the church basement's back entrance _ in the
center of a busy and dangerous alley _ would be unsafe. But shelter
organizers, with the help of city and private funds, moved the
entrance to the front of the church, said Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to affect anything in Back Bay,''
said Geoffrey Reynolds, a Newbury Street real estate broker. ``Back
Bay is the most expensive neighborhood in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Other real estate brokers say Back Bay is the second-most
expensive neighborhood and retail strip in the country, behind only
Fifth Avenue in New York.

<P>
   The monthly rent on a 400-square-foot apartment is $1,500 to
$1,600, while office-space rental can cost up to $110 a square
foot, said Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is saying they want to help the homeless, to give
them a place to sleep, as long as it's not next to me,'' said
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Mangano and others who work with the homeless say the shelter
will help curb fatalities. Within the past year, 140 homeless
people have died in Boston and 12 of them died on the streets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the dead of winter, there are usually nearly 30 mentally
ill women roaming the streets, said Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino,
who spoke at a recent ceremony to celebrate the shelter's opening.
</P>
<P>
   With all its posh and high price tags, Newbury Street is no
stranger to the obviously needy. Panhandlers often sit on curbs,
some singing for spare change. Recently, a rumpled man lifted
himself up from a bench to ask for 45 cents to buy medicine for his
sniffles.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cattan, who on a recent sunny day was sipping coffee and
taking a drag of a cigarette, said she sees them every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you say it?'' asked Cattan, a native of Cyprus,
struggling for the right word to explain how people on the streets
ignore the homeless. ``We tune them out. So I think it's good they
are building a shelter on Newbury Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black Prada pants, white Armani shirt, and
spit-and-polish Gucci shoes, Steven Masters, a hairstylist at
Avanti Salon, is the symbol of Newbury's hipster scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is wonderful,'' he said of the shelter, as he
strolled down the street balancing an armload of coffee cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many shops and people have been so blessed with so much
around here, I think it's time to give back,'' he said. ``This is
such a beautiful street. I don't think it should just be for a
certain group.''

FRIENDS SHARED DINNER; NOW THEY SHARE A HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The four friends had known one another for 20 years.
They traveled in tandem, created and ate countless meals at one
another's homes, raised children together, and shared plenty of
laughter, tears, and prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one evening over dinner, someone tossed out the idea of
buying a house together. Everyone laughed. But the idea kept
gnawing away at them, especially after children went off to college
and family homes became too large for the parents left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the home-sharing talk turned serious. And Candace
Chang, Ann and Peter Anderson, and Paul Brown set out to find a
house that would accommodate their individual tastes and need for
privacy, but would also provide the sense of ``intentional
community'' that all were longing for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the extended family feel, and we were looking to have
people, friends, close by,'' says Peter Anderson, 55, a judge.
``Our children and parents and siblings are so spread out, we
decided to be each other's close families.''
</P>
<P>
   The foursome met at church and are part of an even larger
``gourmet group'' of friends who would cook elaborate dinners,
alternating homes every month or so.
</P>
<P>
   They all knew they wanted to live in a diverse Boston
neighborhood. After many years as suburban dwellers, the Andersons
and Chang especially longed for the energy of urban life. Brown,
46, a family shelter director, had been living in the Jamaica Plain
community for several years; he sold the others on the
up-and-coming neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   After the group looked at several homes, including a large
Victorian in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood that they almost
bought, the Andersons went to an open house in Jamaica Plain on a
whim last summer. They fell in love with a house they never thought
would suit their tastes or needs: a traditional Boston
triple-decker.
</P>
<P>
   The turn-of-the-century house needed some work, but it had
certain charms _ built-in mahogany china cabinets, hardwood floors
_ and it abutted a magnificent community flower garden that all
agreed they wanted to live near.
</P>
<P>
   The group decided to purchase the home as three separate
condominiums, ``so anyone could sell at any time, in case we got
sick of each other,'' jokes Chang, 50. They call the association
The August 11 House, which is engraved on a plaque on the front
door. Peter Anderson, Chang, and Brown all share that birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The next major step was to get the house in shape, and to craft
each identical apartment _ all have two bedrooms, a living room, a
dining room, one bath, and a small kitchen _ into more individual
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   First floor
</P>
<P>
   The Andersons, who chose the first-floor apartment, have done
the most extensive reconstruction. They wanted to add on to the
house, but knew they had to do it carefully: Because three deckers
are so linear, additions can tend to look out of place.
</P>
<P>
   So they hired Boston architect Bill Boehm to help conceive and
design a bump-out sun room/family room where the dining room had
been. The result is a bright, octagonal space with long windows
that gives the apartment a very modern feel. The walls were painted
sky blue to bring the outdoors in.
</P>
<P>
   Boehm took space away from the kitchen _ which is now a small
but very workable space open to the family room _ to give the
Andersons the large gathering spot they desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had the largest dining room in the group, and we
didn't want that to change,'' says Ann Anderson, 55, who works
helping people with disabilities receive affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Boehm also increased the size of the master bedroom by knocking
out a wall and including a small porch in the footprint. The room,
at the back of the home, has sweeping views of the flower garden,
making it a very serene space.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also had a more pressing design need: They wanted
their apartment to be wheelchair accessible so Peter's mother, who
lives in a nearby assisted living facility, could visit frequently
and comfortably. A ramp was installed as part of a new back deck
design, and they added a second bathroom that's twice as wide as
the original. The Andersons also note that the accessibility
feature is something they may need to use themselves someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're prepared to grow old here,'' Peter Anderson
says, laughing. ``Yeah,'' quips Chang, ``the last one standing
brings in the groceries!''
</P>
<P>
   Second floor
</P>
<P>
   Chang, who lives on the middle floor, chose to put her rehab
energies and funds into the apartment's smallest rooms: the kitchen
and bath.
</P>
<P>
   A gourmet cook, Chang took one look around the ``really, really,
really nasty'' original kitchen, with its orange paint and prefab
cabinets, and set to work designing a cheery, state-of-the-art
space that would be the furthest thing possible from ``the ugliest
kitchen I ever saw in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are Corian countertops and beadboard cabinets, a work
island with stools, built-in cubbies for appliances, and a huge
window above the sink for bird-watching. Chang chose Salt Marsh
Pottery from Cape Cod as tiling accent pieces, and the wildflower
motifs add just the right splash of color to the yellow and white
room.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the first home that Chang, a director at a family
services center, has owned, and it may well be her last, she
figured she would splurge on a Jacuzzi for the bathroom. The old
clawfoot tub was a neat antique, she said, but it would do nothing,
comparatively, to pamper her renovation-weary muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most tiring part of her renovation was the laborious
steaming of ancient wallpaper from the dining and living room
walls. Plaster fell out in chunks in the process, but Chang
persevered until all the surfaces were smooth and ready for fresh
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Third floor
</P>
<P>
   On the third floor, Brown did his share of paper steaming and
plaster repair. Brown lived in the house before everyone else moved
in and well before his apartment was fully refurbished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived with no kitchen and barely a bath,'' Brown recalls as
he gives a tour of his place. ``I was the pioneer of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, Brown tore down some built-in bookshelves
that he found obtrusive and rebuilt the archway that leads to the
dining room. He also installed new kitchen cabinets and rearranged
the side pantry so that he could fit not only a refrigerator, but
also a laundromat-hater's dream: a stacked washer and dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's kitchen is much simpler than Chang's. The cabinets are
new but simply done, in white with black accents and novelty drawer
knobs shaped like frogs. He left space for only a small table and
chairs but splurged on a skylight, a feature that's uniquely his,
as the top-floor resident.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also has a small porch off his master bedroom, and the
majestic tree in the back yard sways close by, making the little
balcony feel like a private treehouse. The flower garden expands
below, and the treetop views defy the home's city address. It is
his favorite feature of the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just so silent and beautiful up here,'' Brown says. ``I
like to make the others jealous,'' he adds with a chuckle, ``by
reminding them I have it and they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The four friends decided that, even though they are living in
their own apartments, they would need rules of the house, since
they would be sharing back yard and deck space, and each would have
a key to the others' apartments for sugar-borrowing and
plant-watering purposes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things they decided was that the spare bedrooms
in each flat had to be open to everyone. Chang has two children and
the Andersons have four, all of whom threaten to visit often.
</P>
<P>
   An important rule for these foodies was to be sure everyone knew
the setup of everyone else's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important when you're cooking in groups that
everyone knows where the saute pans are or what shelf you keep the
olive oil on,'' says Chang. ``And it's even more important if
someone's not home and you need to borrow something. You can sneak
right in and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Food is a major thread through this friendship. So much so that
Ann Anderson talks wistfully about the first pot of soup she will
whip up in her new kitchen, and how she can just call out into the
main hallway for her neighbors to ``come and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang looks forward to stepping out of her front door and
ringing a hand bell when she has finished a batch of homemade
cookies and is ready for milk and company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ugh. It's going to sound like this is a commune or
something,'' Chang jokes. ``But it's really an intentional
community . . . where we borrow food and feed each other's cats and
live like a family of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But all families have conflict, and the foursome is gearing up
for its first clash: where the Andersons will put their plastic,
light-up Santa at Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that thing!'' says Brown. ``It will have to go on the
back porch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe you will,'' says Chang, and the friends share another
of a million laughs.

REMEMBERING THE ONES THAT GOT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of Boston's finest gardens survive only in the library of
the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, which
houses 20,000 architectural plans and 400,000 historic photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Gardens of New England,'' a display of 40 garden images
from 1790 through 1930 that opened last month in SPNEA's newly
rented office and gallery space in downtown Boston, mines this
trove. It features watercolors, historic photographs, plans, and
even an antique stereoscope for looking at 3-D stereo views of
19th-century landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The title is a bit of a misnomer, as some parts of some of the
gardens survive, though not in the full high-maintenance glory
depicted here. One completely lost garden in the exhibit is the
Kidder Estate, known as The Lilacs, which existed in Medford,
Mass., from 1810 to 1905. It had extensive, elaborate terraces
crowned with a lattice summer house and geometric vegetable and
cutting gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Another goner is the 1855 Rand Home in Cambridge, Mass., which
had a 2-acre Victorian garden with a wisteria-draped gazebo, an
orchard, and a well-designed period garden that survived in the
family for a century, until it was paved over to become a shopping
center in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The show reflects the new importance that SPNEA, like the rest
of the preservation community, is attaching to garden history since
hiring Betsy Igleheart as its first director of landscapes last
year. Good thing, too. With 35 house museums scattered through New
England, SPNEA is the region's largest owner of historic
landscapes. It is restoring several of these gardens, including
those at the Lyman Estate in Waltham and the Codman Estate in
Lincoln, with help from the Massachusetts Historical Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden popular interest in historical gardens is reflected in
the success of the three-year-old Traditional Gardening magazine,
published in Southborough, and the certificate program in
landscape-design history that the Radcliffe Seminars in Cambridge
initiated six years ago. The nine-year-old New England Garden
History Society and the Garden Conservancy, founded in 1989 to help
preserve significant gardens, are also part of this trend.
</P>
<P>
   Like architecture, garden design has historic periods, and
``Lost Gardens'' delivers a brief primer on three New England
themes.
</P>
<P>
   One wall devoted to ``Gardens of the New Republic'' (1780-1830)
explores the heavily English-influenced gardens of the
post-Revolutionary era. These came in two styles: the ``ancient,''
or geometric, form and the naturalistic park-like approach
pioneered by English designer Lancelot ``Capability'' Brown. His
nickname came from his ``capability'' to do huge, sweeping feats of
landsculpting, and his style was employed on major country estates
such as Theodore Lyman's The Vale in Waltham. It impressed visitors
with its deer park, ``beautiful serpentine river,'' and ``elegant
swans swimming about.'' In 1822, landscape author J. C. Loudon
called it ``one of the most beautifully and artistically arranged
estates in the country.'' Visitors used to approach on an elegant
bridge over a pond, but the entry road was moved, presumably by the
owner, when the town of Waltham tried to tax the bridge.
Greenhouses that are still home to the Lymans' heirloom grapes and
camellias do survive, however.
</P>
<P>
   Symmetrical style
</P>
<P>
   High-style residents of New England's prosperous cities and port
towns like Portsmouth, N.H., and Newburyport also built elaborate
gardens during this early period. Working on relatively small urban
plots, they favored the more symmetrical style that fit the ordered
context of city life. Old photographs of the Brockway garden in
Newburyport, for example, show a complex design of geometric beds.
</P>
<P>
   SPNEA's 1807 Rundlet-May property in Portsmouth, N.H., is among
the minute fraction of town gardens that survive with their
original geometric layout from this early period. It's open to the
public. James Rundlet kept detailed expense records that show he
spent a total of $104 for many dozens of trees and roses.
</P>
<P>
   Artfully pruned food-producing vines and trees were often
highlighted instead of ornamentals in gardens like these. Why grow
flowering dogwoods when you could grow apples, peaches, cherries,
pears, and plums that flowered just as well, and yielded fruit too?
The Yankee ethic held that food-producing plants were more morally
uplifting and less materialistic than ornamentals. One of SPNEA's
current projects is to re-create an orchard of espaliered fruit
trees against the restored 425-foot-long brick ``peach wall'' on
the Lyman property. (The heat retained by the brick helped tender
fruits survive and ripen more quickly.)
</P>
<P>
   In the next historical period, between 1840 and 1910, the
American middle-class suburban ideal developed, inspired by the
writings of Andrew Jackson Downing. He promoted two major types of
landscapes: the ``beautiful'' style, with serpentine lines, lawns,
and groups of deciduous trees, and the ``picturesque,''
incorporating irregular lines, rocky outcroppings, and pointed
evergreens. The latter was used at the Bowen House in Woodstock,
Conn., which SPNEA is also restoring.
</P>
<P>
   Suburbs ``offered all the benefits of rural pleasures and many
of the benefits of park scenery without relinquishing the luxuries
of town life,'' wrote Downing's disciple, Frank J. Scott, in 1870.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man could have envisioned today's total triumph of the
featureless American lawn. Their idea of a suburb was Jamaica Plain
or Cambridge, both represented in the exhibit by old photos of
Victorian gardens awash in ornamental plantings, fruit trees, and
grape trellises, per Downing's recommendations. The exhibit has a
drawing of the picturesque garden of the 1856 Merriam House on
Chestnut Street in JP. That house still stands as a private
residence, but the garden was sacrificed to subdivisions,
reflecting the longstanding practice of preserving historic
buildings but not their landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Revival gardens
</P>
<P>
   Today, we are witnessing the second coming of the ``revival
garden'' phase, which began in the late 19th century. These
deliberately ``old-fashioned'' gardens often frame Colonial Revival
buildings but borrow from many historical periods and cultures. The
fenced-in front-yard garden of Colonial times has been only one
model. The 1899 sunken Italianate garden of the Codman Estate, The
Grange, is a revival garden inspired by classical Rome. The formal
gardens of French chateaux served as another style source. These
gardens boast of the owner's European travels and refinement. The
old ones often contained a terra-cotta Bacchus or ancient pot,
souvenirs from abroad that are now subject to theft, because the
revival style has become so popular again that everyone wants one.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious goal of the exhibit is to highlight SPNEA-owned
gardens. Another, says Lorna Condon, SPNEA curator of Library and
Archives, is ``to inspire new garden design to be compatible with
historic houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners no longer restore a historic home down to its
doorknobs, then purchase standard-issue landscaping. They want
gardens that are roughly in period with their house.
</P>
<P>
   Some lucky homeowners find the original garden plans for their
own old houses in the SPNEA archives, Condon says. ``We have
thousands of users who call us every year and say, `Do you have a
photo of our old house?' Almost every week someone comes in and
finds original photos or plans for their house or garden. They jump
for joy.''
</P>
<P>
   The SPNEA library, now closed for renovation, will reopen to the
public June 30 by appointment; call 617-227-3957, ext. 225. Hours
will be Wednesday through Friday, 9:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and
there's a $5 fee for nonmembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Gardens of New England'' is the third show at the new
gallery at the corner of Cambridge and New Chardon streets. The
gallery stands between Government Center and SPNEA's headquarters
at the Harrison Gray Otis House, which houses the library. The show
will run through Sept. 17, Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4
p.m., and is free to the public. (For gallery information, call
617-570-9105.)
</P>
<P>
   Like the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, SPNEA serves as
a grandmother's attic of cultural history, and only half its
objects are on display in the house museums. This gallery space
will allow some of those items a brief respite from storage. The
previous show, titled ``Walk Right In,'' featured 50 pairs of
shoes, the oldest from the 1600s and the newest a pair from
gastronome Julia Child.

FOUNDATION LEAK CALLS FOR ASPHALT CAULK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have 3 feet of paving on one side of the foundation. There
is a small gap of about 110-inch between paving and foundation. I
think some water is getting in there and wetting my basement. What
can I do?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BALBIR SINGH, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. For a 110-inch gap, insert an asphalt caulk. It comes in a
caulking cartridge, and you should be able to squeeze quite a bit
in that joint. Make it as deep as practicable. Although such a
narrow gap seems too small for water to go through in sufficient
volume to wet the basement, water can do so many things as it seeks
its own level.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get much caulk in the joint, widen it by chipping
out old paving so more caulk can be inserted. Make the gap an inch
deep.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have had a bucket of driveway black-top sealer stored away
for six years. It has never frozen. Is it still good to use?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
I.S., Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The proof is in the opening. Open the can, and if it looks
viable (can be stirred, and is not stiff as a board), then you can
use it. Remember, though, that driveway sealer is mostly cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help! I'm in the middle of a project. I put a hole in the
wall for an outlet box. I saved the patch I cut out so I can fill a
nearby hole where I removed the outlet box. I have another, smaller
hole that also needs to be filled; it is quite a bit smaller than
the outlet box hole. How can I best fill those holes?
</P>
<P>
   ART KRUSINSKI, Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For the hole with the ready-made patch, butter liberally the
edges of the hole with joint compound (not spackling), and also
butter the edges of the patch. Place it in the opening, and let the
compound dry. Then smooth off the seams with more joint compound,
let dry, sand smooth, and do it twice more.
</P>
<P>
   For a smaller hole, butter the edges liberally, but don't try to
fill the hole. Let that dry. Butter the edges again, making the
hole even smaller. Repeat until the hole is filled, let dry, sand
smooth, and repaint the walls. You might get away with
spot-painting the patches; latex wall paint can often be
patch-painted without the patch showing.
</P>
<P>
   Lay the joint compound in thin layers to prevent cracking when
it dries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The white cedar shingles on my garage look terrible after the
garage roof was replaced. How can I clean them up?
</P>
<P>
   FRAN ARCAND, Scituate, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. How to treat the shingles depends on what caused them to look
terrible. First, when you say white cedar shingles, I assume they
are untreated, unpainted, and unstained, and left to weather
naturally. If they are scarred and marked from falling asphalt
shingles (sloppy roofers!), there is little you can do but scrape
off the asphalt marks, and maybe sand a little to get rid of the
gross marks.
</P>
<P>
   If they are excessively black, you can treat them with household
bleach and water in a 1-to-3 solution, then rinse the bleach off
and let them continue to weather. Or, apply one thin coat of a
bleaching oil, which will turn them light gray and hasten
weathering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a second-floor slider that opens on to a deck with a
rubber roof. After the roof was installed, water has continued to
leak in through the wall under the slider, particularly in a
driving rain. The floor swells up and is damp, and the paneled wall
puckers up in the room below. How can that be fixed?
</P>
<P>
   MARGO STARK, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With great difficulty, especially if there is no step-down
from slider to roof. With the slider threshold just inches or less
from the roof, the space below the threshold is difficult to patch,
flash, or caulk. I suggest you caulk that space, immediately under
the threshold, with an asphalt roofing caulk or roofing cement. And
make sure the space where the roof meets the wall is caulked as
well. This is assuming that the slider itself is not leaking.
</P>
<P>
   If all this does not solve or improve the situation, I suggest
you bite the bullet and raise the slider so there is at least a
7-inch step-down. This will allow you to flash the space (install
lead or aluminum flashing) for much more security against leaks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had my floors sanded and finished. The finisher used
moisture-cured polyurethane, which is neither oil- nor water-based.
I had to be out of the house for two days during the installation,
but I am concerned about toxic fumes afterward. Are there any, and
what can be done about them?
</P>
<P>
   M.O., Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is true that the fumes are highly toxic, but since the
homeowner must be out of the house for two days during installation
and curing time, it must be assumed that the fumes are toxic only
for those two days. Other than staying out of the house for another
week or so, I suggest you ventilate it thoroughly by opening all
windows and putting fans in some of the windows for exhausting the
air.

SURVEY POINTS TO GROWING SHIFT TOWARD CAREER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some employees define loyalty as working hard
for a company today, not staying there for decades. They want pay
based on performance, not longevity. They want mentoring, but don't
care as much about a clear career path. And they don't see anything
wrong with job hopping.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new generation of workers. But it's not Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   Generation Xers are no more likely to emphasize those qualities
than are people in their 50s, according to a survey by Interim
Services Inc. and Louis Harris and Associates. The national survey
of 1,001 adults says 22 percent of workers are ``emergent,'' people
with those types of attitudes, while 29 percent think more
traditionally, emphasizing job security and a clear career path.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 49 percent of respondents are described by Ray
Marcy, the president and chief executive of Interim, as
``migrating.'' These are people with some traditional values and
some emergent ones.
</P>
<P>
   He believes they are changing toward the emergent mind-set of
``career security'' rather than traditional job security because of
the waves of layoffs over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Several items on the survey particularly illustrated the
differences in attitudes:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An employer is responsible for providing a clear career
development path for employees.'' Overall, 85 percent of
respondents agreed with that statement, and 93 percent of
traditional workers did. But only 64 percent of emergent employees
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An employer has a moral obligation to keep long-term
employees as long as they meet the requirements in the job
description.'' Overall, 83 percent agreed; among traditional
workers, 95 percent agreed; among emergent workers, 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Loyalty is being willing to stay with an employer for the
long haul.'' Overall, 75 percent agreed; traditional, 94 percent;
emergent, 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My level of commitment to an employer depends on the
likelihood of long-term job security.'' Overall, 72 percent agreed;
traditional, 89 percent; emergent, 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Long-term career advancement depends on staying with an
employer for a long time.'' Overall, 56 percent agreed;
traditional, 85 percent; emergent, 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An employer who expects all employees to follow the rules
and regulations, regardless of the circumstances.'' Overall, 60
percent of workers found that to be an attractive quality, and 76
percent of traditional employees did. But only 39 percent of
emergent workers were attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Although age and experience made little difference in the ratio
of emergent workers to traditional ones, a couple of demographic
factors did. Those with college degrees or annual salaries of more
than $50,000 were far more likely to be emergent employees than
traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy said one aspect of the survey particularly surprised him:
He expected that traditional workers would be more comfortable in a
traditional environment, and emergent employees would prefer an
emergent one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey dispelled that, saying that a traditional worker
was comfortable in each environment,'' Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 50 percent of traditional workers in traditional
companies said there was a good to excellent likelihood of them
staying there for at least the next five years. For traditional
workers in emergent companies, though, the likelihood of staying
actually increased to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the same question was asked of emergent workers, only 31
percent said they were likely to stay for the five years in a
traditional company. In an emergent company, however, the
likelihood increased to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy said that traditional employers _ ones who avoid hiring
people who have changed jobs every few years, don't discipline or
fire poor performers and apply the same set of rules to all workers
_ will continually find themselves drawing from a smaller hiring
pool as more employees find more satisfaction at emergent
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not moving toward an emergent workplace,'' he said,
``you've really got to evaluate your chances of survival.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of significant advantages of emergent workplaces that
are gaining in popularity are flexible work hours and opportunities
for mentoring. Of the three things that all the people surveyed
liked most about their jobs, the one mentioned most frequently was
``a work schedule that meets my needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy said that although workers don't emphasize clear career
paths as much as they used to, they do expect the company to help
them grow. ``People were more than twice as likely to look for
another job if there weren't adequate mentoring opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   He said companies can also attract more emergent employees by
granting workers more independence, encouraging debate and limiting
the need for memos, especially those that workers and bosses use
for ``covering their tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's survey didn't consider which industries the workers
were in, but Marcy hopes to include that next year. Still, he knows
from experience that certain industries are more likely to stick to
the traditional mold than others are.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the high-tech industry, you're going to find
more of an emergent environment than in, say, a law firm.''

SANTA BARBARA DUO GIVE FILM SCHOOL NEW REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ``Shadow'' knows, and so does Daniel Kutner.
</P>
<P>
   Working around the clock for nearly six months, the senior at
the University of California, Santa Barbara, got an education in
the rigors of filmmaking. With the surf and the Isla Vista party
scene raging around them, he and film-studies partner Brian Emerson
rarely left the house as they made ``Shadow of a Drought,'' their
animated student production that marked a breakthrough for UCSB's
academically oriented film school.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that talent knows no bounds, Kutner and Emerson will
take home UCSB's first-ever Student Academy Award this month when
they receive their medallion for ``Shadow,'' which is in
competition with animated entries from New York University and
California Institute of Arts near Los Angeles. Entries from UCSB _
which offers only two animation classes _ had been nominated before
but never reached the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a school where, if you're willing to kill yourself
making a film, you can make one,'' says Kutner, who served as the
co-writer and producer for ``Shadow.'' Co-writer Emerson also
handled the directing duties on their production, which employed
three types of animation: computer-generated imagery, cel and bond,
and clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no social life for months. We left the houses only to
get dinner,'' adds Kutner, who hails from La Jolla. Emerson is from
West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of ``Shadow'' follows the disappearance of
cinema's most beloved actor, who vanishes from the set of the
motion picture ``Drought.'' A tabloid reporter goes in search of
the star and, through his interviews, strings together a history of
animation and its destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The production was a combined effort of the film studies
department, engineering and computer engineering sectors on campus.
Engineering students designed and built the film's claymation set,
and computer engineering students served as on-call troubleshooters
for the production team. Cel painters for ``Shadow'' were just
anybody who would volunteer some time.
</P>
<P>
   UCSB was also a national finalist in the documentary category.
``Portraits'' by Ivan Oyco and Jesse Baldwin brought an added
measure of acclaim to the campus known more for its surf and party
atmosphere than rigorous academic standards. For Kutner, beating
the odds and more prestigious universities with their better
equipment and famous alumni only reinforces his belief about the
essence of moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter because in the end, it's how well you tell
the story.'' &QL;

HOW THE DEATH OF A LOVED REUNITED ONE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Margaret Kennedy died this April at age 98, she left behind
two of her six children, 45 grandchildren, and 97
great-grandchildren who live all over the country, from Maine to
California and everywhere in between. Margaret had been the hub of
this great wheel of a family, the central point at which they all
connected. Now scattered, the different branches of this extended
family hardly ever came together, and the cousins knew very little
about one another's lives.
</P>
<P>
   It took Margaret's death to turn them into the Kennedy clan.
</P>
<P>
   As one of her grandchildren put it: ``During those 10 days, and
in the days and weeks following, cousins burst into life for each
other like desert flowers suddenly blooming after a spring rain.
This new landscape of relationships was Grandma's final gift to us.
It's a gift of love, which blossomed because of technology. It
happened through e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The day she went into the hospital with a stroke, her grandson,
Paul, sent e-mail to everyone whose address he could get hold of:
``We are going to try to have someone with her at all times. I will
pass on more information when I get some. Please keep her in your
prayers, and I know this sounds wrong, but don't pray for a
recovery. Pray she will go to God after having lived a life that
touched so many people in so many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Margaret 10 days to die, days in which her descendants
shared their memories and celebrated her generous spirit, her
idiosyncracies, and her fun-loving nature. Their stories made their
way to Margaret's bedside and filled her last hours with
companionship, bringing her the comforting news that none of her
loving had been in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma just wrote and apologized for not coming and taking
care of her nursing duties as I just had surgery. You should have
seen her the last time. She arrived at the hospital at the age of
93, wearing a shower cap and her white jacket, and announced that
my private nurse from Boston had arrived. Let me tell you, I did
recover fast after that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Grandma came, there were card games every night! I know
heaven awaits her entry with open arms and a deck of cards.''
</P>

CRITICS FOAM   OVER WRITER'S BEER AD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWTIZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of it as Beauty and the Beast sell beer. In a bit of
awkward byplay sponsored by Miller Lite, middle-aged Sports
Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly spars with stunning supermodel
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos over what men really want in a sports
magazine: sharp writing or fishnet bikinis. Needless to say, he is
outdebated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was good press for Sports Illustrated. I thought
it was a lark,'' says Reilly, of the TV spot that has aired since
March and which Miller plans to continue through the summer. ``I
can't believe I'm getting all this crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Reilly's life has been pretty good lately. Devoutly
coveted by SI's new rival, ESPN The Magazine, he sparked a bidding
war and became sportswriting's first free agent. Reilly ended up
staying at SI, but not before nailing down a salary of close to
half a million and perks that include writing three movies for the
magazine's corporate cousin, Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   But as a serious print journalist collecting cash to shill for
suds, Reilly has crossed one of the few remaining boundaries
separating journalism from abject commercialism. And for that, he's
taking his fair share of well-deserved ``crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Yates, sports editor of The Dallas Morning News and
president of the APSE (Associated Press Sports Editors), says the
beer ad leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. ``It's kind of tacky,
he says. ``It's sort of demeaning to both of them. . . . It's hard
to compare good journalism with the swimsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's SI colleague (and former Boston Globe sports staffer)
Jackie MacMullan chooses her words carefully but pointedly when
discussing a journalist's decision to become an ad pitchman. ``It's
their credibility, not mine,'' she says. ``It's something I've
chosen not to do.'' MacMullan says she's been offered several
commercial opportunities, but SI ``did not want me to do it and I
understood why.'' (SI spokesman Joe Assad says, ``We take each
(request) on a case-by-case basis.'')
</P>
<P>
   And on his weekly ESPN show, ``The Sports Reporters,'' Dick
Schaap took a shot at Reilly's Miller commercial, asserting that
``I think that's having your cake _ and drinking it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Reilly's problem here is the dreaded hypocrisy factor.
In a high-minded February column asking his boss, Time Inc., to
discontinue its sponsorship of the scandal-ridden Olympics, he
proclaimed that ``all we have to trade on is our integrity.'' Now,
he has invited critics like Bob Steele, director of the ethics
program at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, to warn that
``it's very dangerous territory for journalists of any stripe to be
promoting products. What it really is is an issue of what I'd call
conflicting loyalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly seems genuinely taken aback by the controversy. He says
he doesn't cover events _ like auto racing _ that are sponsored by
Miller. Assad concurs, stating that ``we felt there was no conflict
coming across between Rick doing the commercial and Rick doing his
job at the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated colleague (and former Globe staffer) Leigh
Montville thinks Reilly's being unfairly pilloried based on
idealistic but obsolete values. ``Now everybody does everything,''
he says of the mingling of media and money. ``Everybody does books
on people they cover. I think that whole (ethical) line has
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly also thinks he's a victim of changing times, recalling
how SI senior contributing writer Frank Deford had done famous TV
beer ads years ago and nobody even raised an eyebrow. Now, Reilly's
being badgered by a breed of journalists who didn't even exist back
then. ``You know,'' he says of his tormentors, ``it's mostly been
media writers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the perception of conflict of interest, author Carol
Felsenthal is making that accusation against two pillars of the
media establishment _ The New York Times and the Columbia
University Graduate School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Felsenthal, who has written biographies of Katharine
Graham and Phyllis Schlafly, published ``Citizen Newhouse,'' an
unauthorized bio of media magnate S. I. Newhouse Jr. It then
garnered a very unflattering review from Columbia Journalism School
Dean Tom Goldstein _ who called it ``a rather dull hatchet job'' _
in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein wasn't her only critic. Felsenthal admits the book got
a ``horrendous'' review in The Washington Post and took a trashing
in the New York Observer. But says she was taken aback by the
negativity of the Goldstein review. And now she believes she has
found a smoking _ or at least warm _ gun.
</P>
<P>
   Doing some sleuthing, In These Times magazine learned that the
Newhouse Foundation had donated $30,000 a year to the Columbia
Journalism School in 1996 and 1997, the last two years in which
records were available. In a May 6 letter to Times book editor
Charles McGrath, Felsenthal cried foul and asked for ``an `editor's
note' or some form of correction'' to the review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a nonissue,'' says McGrath, adding that ``it
stretches credibility'' that Goldstein would write a tough review
to curry favor with the Newhouse benefactors. ``I'm very sensitive
to ethical and conflict issues,'' adds Goldstein. And ``there is no
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one other little twist to the episode. Back in 1994,
Felsenthal wrote to McGrath _ who was then at Newhouse's New Yorker
_ asking to interview him for the biography. In a polite return
letter, McGrath informed her that he could not comply unless
Newhouse himself was cooperating.

LAMENTING THE LOSS OF A GENTLEMEN'S ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE FENCING MASTER &QL; 
By Arturo Perez-Reverte (translated, from the Spanish, by Margaret
Jull Costa) &QL; 
Harcourt Brace, 245 pp., $24 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They eyed each other across the desk like fencers waiting to
strike,'' wrote Arturo Perez-Reverte of two antagonists,
archibishop and priest, in his last novel, ``The Seville
Communion,'' surely the most amusing and disturbing thriller of the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   By another writer, a sentence like that could be dismissed as a
cliche, and a dated one at that. Who among writers today knows
anything about fencing? Perez-Reverte does, and his new novel,
``The Fencing Master,'' set in Madrid in 1868, is among other
things a lament for a skill, an art, that has lost its place in
society; gentlemen duelled with pistols then, and they don't duel
at all now.
</P>
<P>
   Don Jaime Astarloa, the fencing master, is the last of a
vanished breed, courtly, well-spoken, old-fashioned, 56 and aging,
down on his luck, devoted to honor, to his art, and to abstract
principles that are also a matter of life and death. He is writing
a treatise on fencing, and his secret is an unstoppable thrust that
he is determined to bring to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Many students have asked the fencing master for his secret, but
he will impart it only to those he deems worthy, and there haven't
been many of them. As ``The Fencing Master'' begins, Don Jaime is
approached by the most unusual applicant of his career, a woman,
Dona Adela de Otero _ dark-haired, violet-eyed, mysterious, a scar
at the right corner of her mouth ``which seemed to impress on the
mouth a permanent, enigmatic smile.'' Dona Adela marshals every
skill of persuasion, but Don Jaime is reluctant to teach her, even
when she raises the stakes. He learns what a skilled fencer she is
in conversation, and then, in a trial lesson, discovers she is an
athlete, an intellectual athlete of extraordinary training, skill,
discipline, cunning, and ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   He agrees to teach her; Dona Adela confirms his love of his art,
and awakens turbulent feelings in Don Jaime that he thought he had
put to sleep decades before. What Don Jaime does not know is that
his lessons with Dona Adela will draw him into a murky intrigue in
which nothing is quite what it seems to be _ politics intersect
with revolution; there is deception, revenge, compromising
documents, and murder; sex is a weapon as lethal as an unbuttoned
foil. The moves of the practice studio, the classical thrusts and
parries of fencing, parallel the events outside the studio, much as
chess moves permeate an earlier novel of Perez-Reverte's, ``The
Flanders Panel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fencing Master'' is Perez-Reverte's fourth novel, and his
methods are now familiar. His work, like that of Don Jaime, pays
homage to the 19th-century masters (specifically Dumas) while
extending it along nontraditional lines. He is a careful and
scrupulous researcher who takes considerable pains to get things
right; there is a lot of fencing lore in the new novel _ science,
mathematics, psychology, and mystique. Perez-Reverte has mastered
it so fully that he doesn't feel he needs to supply a primer, to
explain a lot of it, to show us how it looks, how it works. He just
gives us the technical language, like an old-school ballet critic,
or the kind of music critic who (according to George Bernard Shaw's
first editor) was always going on about Bach in B-minor.
</P>
<P>
   This may enthrall some readers as much as it irritates others.
What everyone can agree upon is that he has extraordinary feeling
for place and time, and 19th-century Madrid becomes as much a
presence, and indeed a character, in the novel as contemporary
Seville does in his ``Seville Communion.'' He knows all the
old-fashioned secrets about maintaining a proportion between action
and suspense that keeps the reader engrossed, and he is not averse
to melodrama, mistaken identities, washed-up corpses, a key paper
fallen out of sight, and secrets from the past only now coming to
light.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Perez-Reverte irresistible _ and one of the world's
best-selling writers, now coming into his own in America _ is the
thoroughly modern, intelligent, and sophisticated sensibility that
plays so subtly upon the unsubtle events that are his subject. A
synopsis of a Perez-Reverte plot would be exciting, but not nearly
as interesting as his books, each of which creates a psychological
climate that is the most compelling thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that ``The Fencing Master'' may prove of more
limited interest to readers than ``The Seville Communion'' _ it
lacks the Shakespearean clowning of that book, and all of
Perez-Reverte's considerable skill cannot make 19th-century Spanish
politics as fascinating as the perennial questions of faith and
works that engage and define the characters in the earlier book.
Some of the hinges of the plot creak and need oiling. But the crux
of the matter, as always, is disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Don Jaime is a 19th-century Don Quixote with a mind at once more
modern and more old-fashioned than those around him; he can make
his life meaningful only by making it meaningless.

THE 3 PLAGUES OF PAINT: PEELING, BLEEDING, AND MOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memorial Day is the traditional day for planting in the garden
because it's the last day of possible frosts. And, it's nice and
warm to be grubbing in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The merry day, last of the month, is also a good time to start
painting outdoors, although it has been safe to paint for more than
a month.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub. Your house looks terrible after just a few
years since the last paint job. It's full of mildew, and the
peeling is horrendous.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge: how to paint the house so all these obnoxious
things don't happen. After all, a professional paint job, can cost
$5,000 to $10,000, a not-so-pretty penny for something that won't
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways that paint fails, but there are also many
ways to make sure it does not fail in the future.
</P>
<P>
   One preventive measure is to use a top quality paint; bargain
paints just won't hack it. You have to pay for the quality, but in
the long run it is well worth even up to $30 a gallon for a paint
that will perform properly for up to eight years or more.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where John G. Stauffer comes into the picture. He is
director of the Rohm &AMP; Haas Quality Paint Institute of Spring
House, Pa., and is on a tour of the nation, beating the drums for
quality paint and how to solve all those paint problems so many of
us have.
</P>
<P>
   Stauffer uses his own house as a success story on how paint can
work for many years. His is a 1935 tudor with stucco walls and
half-timbering, all painted.
</P>
<P>
   He used an elastomeric paint on the stucco, the best, he said,
for masonry. Elastometric paint is a tough coating that goes on
thick and is elastic (hence the name), expanding and contracting
with the stucco affected by moisture content and temperature. Two
coats are needed.
</P>
<P>
   But for new masonry, Stauffer recommends a seal coat on masonry
less than 30 days old. Surface preparation and caulking of cracks
are also important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The half-timbering, which was originally stained and varnished,
is now painted a dark brown with acrylic house paint, after the
requisite removal of some or all of the varnish and heavy sanding.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet the paint Stauffer used is of high quality, because
that is the linchpin of his institute, called QPI for short. The
institute, launched in 1989, manufactures raw materials for all
kinds of paints, stains, caulks, inks, sealers, and even roof
tiles. It also consults for paint manufacturers, and maintains
paint and stain testing facilities in different parts of the
nation, each with different climate and weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   And the emphasis is on acrylic (water- based) paints, which
Stauffer says provide good adhesion. They stick, he said. Water
evaporates qauickly, so acrylic paints are fast drying. And, being
resistant to alkalies, they're good for masonry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us have problems with our painted or stained houses, but
the three most important ones, and most frustrating, are peeling
paint, cedar bleed, and mildew and its prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling paint
</P>
<P>
   This plague has several causes.
</P>
<P>
   1. Old stain and paint will oxidize, said Stauffer, and new
paint over that will fail. Several coats already on the wall can
cause the newest coat to peel, he said. Paint will not stick to
weathered wood, either, or old paint that has exposed weathered
wood.
</P>
<P>
   To combat these problems, sand heavily to remove as much of the
old paint as posisble, and, if posisble, sand enough to reveal new
wood.
</P>
<P>
   Sanding old paint is also important, Stauffer said. It will
smooth out the little craters created by blistering and peeling.
While the sides of these craters are very small, they are enough to
allow primerand/or paint to bridge over them, making the paint coat
very thin on the edges, with resulting premature peeling and wear.
Feather those craters with sandpaper, Stauffer said, and this won't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the primer, said Stauffer. Relatively new but
taking up half the market are latex primers.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion and contraction, due to moisture and temperature
changes, will cause paint to peel. The solution is to sand heavily,
use a high quality paint, and apply it according to label
instructions. So, read the labels and follow the instuctions, said
Stuaffer. Follow the rules as to how thin or thick a coating should
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned more with too thin a coat,'' said Stauffer. If
you apply a paint to cover 500 square feet per gallon as opposed to
the recommended 300 square feet, you are applying it too thinly.
</P>
<P>
   How paint dries can affect its behavior. One that is allowed to
dry before its time will fail. This often happens, Stauffer said,
if the paint is applied on a very hot day, on a breezy day with low
humidity, on a too-cold day, and on a porous surface. So, again,
read the label and follow the instructions, said Stauffer.
</P>
<P>
   Water vapor migrating through the wall from inside the house is
still another factor, and may be a particular plague in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   What happens: Water vapor builds up in the house, makes its way
through the vapor barrier because the barrier has nail holes in it,
goes through insulation, and ends up against the back of the
sheathing boards, where it condenses on those cool boards, coming
through eventually, the claphboards or shingles, pushing the paint
clear off. The symptom of this is paint peeling down to the bare
wood.
</P>
<P>
   A possible cure is to place 1/2-inch Styrofoam insulation on the
outside of the sheathing, under shingles or clapboards. This
insulation will keep the sheathing warm, and water vapor will not
condense. This is normally done with new construction. On a
retrofit, the insulation is installed under new shingles or
clapboards.
</P>
<P>
   And, short of that rather elaborate arrangement, Stauffer said
the proper use of a primer on the clapboards or shingles can help
prevent the water vapor migration through the siding.
</P>
<P>
   The use of stains _ solid latex stains on old paint and bare
wood, and semitransparent stains on bare wood _ can help solve the
problem because the solid stains resist peeling and semitransparent
stains do not, indeed, peel.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar bleed
</P>
<P>
   Cedar bleed, the dreaded brown stains that appear on a painted
surface, are a New England plague because so much red cedar is used
for siding. The bleed is caused by water behind the cedar leaching
out the tannins in the cedar and depositing them _ as brown stains
_ on the surface. White cedar is not as much of a problem because
it contains fewer tannins.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar bleed can be washed off, but it becomes a constant,
paint-in-the-neck maintenance chore.
</P>
<P>
   The bleed is a bigger plague in the Northeast, said Stauffer,
because of the vast amount of red cedar used as siding.
</P>
<P>
   Latex paints are more vulnerable to tannin stains, said
Stauffer. To cure them, apply a primer; latex or oil is acceptable.
In fact, half the primers used today are latex, a far cry from just
a few years ago. Use a latex primer containing zinc oxide.
</P>
<P>
   Two coats of primer should block most tannins, Stauffer said. Do
not prime when it is damp. Read the labels and follow instructions,
he said. That goes for the rule against priming, painting, and
staining under 50 degrees, and for two days after if the
temperature threatens to drop under 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Mildew, another plague
</P>
<P>
   Mildew or mold? Look for it, identify it, and treat it, said
Stauffer. It's not hard to find; it appears as black smudges,
spots, stains, and little dots on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Treat it with a solution of one part household bleach and three
parts water. Leave it on for 20 mintues, then scrub with a scrub
brush. It is important to rinse it off for two reasons: Bleach is
incompatible with all finishes. And bleach left on will break down
the oils and fibers of all woods. Rinsing will reduce the damage to
the wood, Stauffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Glossy paints resist mildew better than flat ones, and latex
paints better than oil paints, because there are fewer nutrients in
latex paints for mildew to feed on.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Stauffer, quality paints contain a mildewcide that
will retard the growth of mildew; cheaper paints usually do not
contain mildewcides.
</P>
<P>
   Painting other siding
</P>
<P>
   There is a paint for everything, and that includes asbestos
siding, aluminum siding, and even vinyl siding.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is no special paint for asbestos siding, said
Stauffer, but old asbestos siding is very absorbent, and needs a
sealer such as masonry sealer to stabilize the surface. Wait
overnight after seealing before painting with an acrylic house
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you have to clean the old siding. With asbestos
siding, do not power-wash or scrub; that could release asbestos
fibers. Instead, wash with a detergent and water and use a sponge
or cloth, and rinse with a hose.
</P>
<P>
   As for aluminum siding, sand it and clean it with detergent and
water, and apply a top quality 100 percent acrylic latex paint,
which has excellent adhesion and good resistance to chalking and
fading.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while vinyl may be final, the colors sometimes can
fade, and vinyl too can be painted. The procedure is similar to
what you'd do with aluminum, but do not sand the vinyl because it
can cause permanent scratches. Use an acrylic latex paint for the
greater flexibility that allows it to expand and contract with the
siding when temperatures change.
</P>
<P>
   The only taboo: Paint vinyl a color that is no darker than the
original. Dark colors tend to absorb heat, which can cause panels
to warp and buckle irreversibly.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now you can enjoy the rest of the long weekend, if you can
stop thinking about those three plagues of paint.

ON-LINE FILM IS THE NEXT WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, kids who patronized a certain Buster Brown store in
New York could put a coin in an antique nickelodeon, turn the
crank, and watch old black-and-white shorts featuring guys in funny
suits clowning around. The images were grainy and small, and the
film jumped up and down, like a visual hiccup. But it was still
thrilling, this view into the past.
</P>
<P>
   Today, films of similar quality are providing a glimpse of the
future. And they don't cost even a cent.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about film on line, the uncelebrated but
inevitable revolution in new media. The recording industry has been
twisting itself in knots about on-line music, yet there has been
less of an uproar in the film industry. High-quality music files,
after all, can be easily downloaded on any personal computer,
raising thefear of piracy. But a pirate wouldn't peddle serious
films (as opposed to pornography) in cyberspace _ at least not yet.
Film takes up too much computer memory, and the quality is similar
to the old nickelodeons. There's only so much time you can peer at
a screen the size of a credit card before you get terminal squint
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology is getting better, and it won't be long
before films are made on ordinary desktop computers and then
marketed, distributed, and exhibited on line. ``Wherever audio
goes, video follows,'' says filmmaker Lance Weiler. ``It's just a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Weiler should know. Three years ago, he and fellow filmmaker
Stefan Avalos had an idea for a feature. Rich in vision, yet short
on cash, they decided to produce the entire film using equipment
you can buy at your ordinary electronics store. Total budget: $900.
``Typically, it's been an elitist occupation,'' Weiler says. ``You
had to know the right people, you had to raise the money, and then
you had to compromise your vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo finished its psychological thriller, ``The Last
Broadcast,'' early last year; in October, they released the film
via satellite, a first, beaming it out to five theaters nationwide,
including one in Providence. It was featured last week in a digital
exhibition at the 52d Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to make a film, you can just do it,'' says
Jonathan Sarno, a New York director who started the WebCinema
listserv for independent filmmakers. ``It's more like writing a
novel or a poem. You don't have to be good at going to country
clubs or have a trust fund or a rich uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   And if everyone is making films _ rich uncles or not _ then it
only makes sense that they're going to be shown on line. Sites that
feature short films pop up every week. Like much of the free music
offered online, many of these short films are glorified home
movies. But some of them show promise, and, squint disease aside,
there's something appealing about seeing raw talent stream across a
computer screen. It's like being back in the days of the
nickelodeon, waiting for the big discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Has the next Orson Welles emerged in cyberspace? Not yet, but
it's sure to happen. Already, filmmakers are showing their short
films on such sites as www.dfilm.com, www.atomfilms.com, and
www.iFilm
</P>
<P>
   .net. These sites are a godsend for young independent filmmakers
like Nisha Ganatra, a New York University graduate who is currently
showing her award-winning short ``Junky Punky Girlz'' on iFilm. A
girlfriend flick about cultural identity, ``Junky Punky'' has
received raves from on-line viewers. ``The Net is a great way to
tap into a new audience,'' says Ganatra. ``You want it to be seen
by as many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, iFilm presented the world premiere of ``Dead
Broke,'' a thriller starring Paul Sorvino and Tony Roberts, on its
Web site; at the same time, it broadcast the movie over the
Internet to a digital projector at the Tribeca Film Center in New
York. It was the first time a film premiered both on line and in a
theater, but it won't be the last. The folks at iFilm are doing it
again on June 16, with the premiere of Rob Nilsson's ``Chalk,'' a
film about the homeless in California.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the debut of ``Dead Broke'' was a bit of a chore to
watch on line; the technology is still too primitive for
feature-length films. ``It's still early, but it is safe to say
that the revolution has begun,'' says iFilm founder Rodger
Raderman. ``And it's only going to grow from here.''

STUDY TIES DISTRESS, ALTERNATIVE THERAPY;  
 DISCOURAGING NEWS ON AN AIDS VACCINE;  
 POOR NUTRITION HITS ELDERLY IN HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who turn to remedies like
massage, herbs, and relaxation in addition to standard cancer
therapy are more likely to be emotionally distressed than patients
who don't use such remedies, a Harvard study of 480 women shows.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to alternative or complementary medicine appears to be a
marker for anxiety and depression, say Drs. Harold J. Burstein,
Jane C. Weeks, and their colleagues from Harvard Medical School and
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in this week's New England Journal
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, all the women had similar mental health
characteristics, according to their recollections of how they felt
before diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   But three months after surgery, the use of alternative therapies
was greatest among those with more depression, fear of cancer
recurrence, and lower scores on questionnaires about mental health,
sexual functioning, and physical symptoms. The tendency for more
distressed women to seek complementary therapy was independent of
the type of standard cancer care they received and their prognoses.
(All had relatively early, stage I or II breast cancer.)
</P>
<P>
   There was no difference in distress indicated by the type of
complementary therapy sought, the researchers add. Women either
tended to use several complementary approaches, or none.
</P>
<P>
   By 12 months after diagnosis, most patients, whether they used
complementary remedies or not, were happier, although those who had
turned to nontraditional remedies still reported less sexual
satisfaction and more fear of recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The findings contrast with the view that people who seek
alternative remedies are ``self-assertive, psychologically strong,
and well-adjusted,'' notes Dr. Jimmie Holland, a psychiatrist at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York in an
accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
   These women ``were not psychologically strong. On the contrary,
they turned to alternative medicine to alleviate their distress,''
she writes. Doctors should recognize this, she says, and offer
counseling to people who use complementary medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging news on an AIDS vaccine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Australian researchers studying people infected with a mild
strain of the AIDS virus that scientists had hoped to use as a
vaccine have found that some of those patients now show signs of
immune damage, discouraging news for AIDS vaccine developers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
does not entirely dash hope that live, attenuated versions of the
mutant strain could be used as a vaccine, said Dr. John Sullivan, a
University of Massachusetts pediatrician and AIDS researcher,
though it does mean ``a single gene deletion does not attentuate
the virus enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study does provide ``another cautionary note with
respect to the use of live attenuated HIV strains as vaccines,''
says an editorial accompanying the report.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, 13 people in Australia got transfusions from
a donor infected with an AIDS virus missing a gene called ``nef.''
Eight became infected. The transfusions occurred before there were
tests to detect the virus in donated blood.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the eight have died: two from causes unrelated to AIDS
and one from possibly unrelated causes. The five others and the
donor have been symptom free for 14 years, evidence that the mutant
virus is slower to wreak havoc than the common forms.
</P>
<P>
   Three still have undetectable viral loads, but the other three
now have detectable virus and decreasing immune cells.
</P>
<P>
   Poor nutrition hits elderly in hospitals &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many hospitalized elderly patients get such poor nutrition that
they may be at increased risk of death, a study in this week's
Journal of the American Medical Association shows.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Little Rock, Ark., studied 497 patients age 65
or older who were hospitalized for at least four days. The patients
were equally sick and had similar blood levels of a protein called
albumin, often used to gauge nutritional status.
</P>
<P>
   But in the hospital, one in five got so little to eat, often
because their doctors ordered ``nothing by mouth'' and did not
offer alternatives such as feeding by intravenous or stomach tubes,
that they got less than half the calories they needed.
</P>
<P>
   The poorly nourished patients were eight times more likely to
die in the hospital than those who got adequate calories and three
times as likely to die in the 90 days after discharge.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear which comes first, poor nutrition or
worsening medical status, says Dr. Dennis H. Sullivan, director of
the geriatric research, education and clinical center at the
Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System. But he says doctors
should boost nutritional intake whenever possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JIM THORPE, Pa. _ The big pickup truck rumbles along a high
ridge here in what used to be the heart of coal country. It
scampers over rocks, splashes through the big pools of water that
the locals call ``sips,'' and rolls easily through muck and gravel.
</P>
<P>
   As it breaks from the woods, the four-door, V8 engine,
six-passenger Toyota Tundra is shifted from 4- to 2-wheel-drive.
When it hits the pavement, it runs as smoothly and as quietly as
any family sedan. New this year, the Tundra will be the first
foreign challenge to absolute domestic dominance of the big truck
market in North America. It is a market that Sandy Allen
Lobenstein, a senior market planner for Toyota, calls ``the
largest, most competitive, most lucrative segment in the auto
industry today.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look in the rearview mirror now, but the next set of
lights looming high behind you may not be a trendy SUV. Instead, it
will probably be a big-cab, four-door pickup truck, carrying a
family of six on its way to a soccer game or a campsite. All the
major US truck manufacturers are rapidly expanding their capacity
to build them.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps even more significant is that even makers of luxury
cars are looking to satisfy the growing demand for big-cab pickups.
Lincoln will build one and call it the Blackwood, essentially its
Navigator SUV with a cargo bed, and industry reports say even
Cadillac will match it with a pickup/SUV of its own.
</P>
<P>
   These trucks, once the virtually sole domain of construction
crews, are becoming a family vehicle of choice across the country.
People saw the trucks and realized a big cab with four doors and
seating for six and a pickup bed on the back ``meets the demands of
the whole day,'' says Al Giombetti, the group truck brand manager
for Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   He says customers justify the purchase this way: ``It's got
versatility and utility: I can use it for work, to go to the
restaurant, to pick up my kids at soccer _ and I can also carry
sheets of plywood in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giombetti says the trend started with an industry innovation
aimed at a narrow niche, but mushroomed into a broad customer
expectation. And it is a wave within a wave. In 1998, Americans
bought more vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs than they did cars.
Pickups alone, in the first quarter of this year, accounted for
46.3 percent of General Motors sales; 60.6 percent of Ford sales;
and 70.3 percent of the Chrysler portion (which includes Dodge
trucks) of the newly merged Daimler-Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is the industry's largest seller of pickup trucks, and when
it offered a four-door option on its F-series of trucks for the
1996-97 model year, that option accounted for just 5 percent of
truck sales. By the 98 model year, it was up to 30 percent. By the
end of 1999, Ford predicts it will be 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Dodge, 71 percent of the sales of its popular Ram pickup are
big-cab models, and 90 percent of those are four-door. By the end
of this year the company will add the four-door option to its
Dakota series of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   And Chevrolet, which in the past year saw its pickup sales go
from 486,000 to 686,000 _ even though its primary entry in the
big-cab market was a three-door _ will offer a four-door version of
its Silverado for 2000, complete with a full back seat and
headrests. In addition, the company, which acknowledges it
underestimated the pickup truck market last year, will offer a
Blazer model with a pickup bed, and a variation of the Suburban
that will also have a bed, Ron Zarella, president of GM North
America, told Automotive News this week.
</P>
<P>
   Four-door ``crew cab'' trucks, with full-size doors that open
toward the front like car doors, have been around for years, but
they tended to be loud, spartan, utilitarian brutes. The new,
better-riding, and quieter truck has large doors for front-seat
passengers, and smaller doors, which open toward the rear, for
back-seat riders. And some companies _ Ford among them with a 2001
SuperCrew _ are preparing elegant models of the old crew-cab style
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The shift, say industry analysts, is part of an evolution as
American car buyers moved from minivans to SUVs. They liked the
ability of minivans to cart kids around. They liked the ability of
SUVs to not only carry whole families and gear in comfort, but also
the safety their height and size offer and the performance of
four-wheel-drive in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   And then they noticed the big-cab, four-door pickups, which
offered all these things, plus a bed in back to haul lumber for
weekend building projects, manure for gardens, stones for walls,
bags and buckets for trips to the recycling center, and, with a cap
or tarp added, camping and other recreational gear _ all while the
entire family rides in sedan-like comfort. In addition, these
trucks, from the mid-teens to high $20,000 range, are often priced
$10,000 or lower than comparable wagon-like SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   The utility of the truck is precisely what lured Glenn Fiore of
Norwell, Mass., out of his two-door SUV and behind the wheel of a
Ford F-150 SuperCab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed more doors. I needed a pickup truck,'' says the
father of two, who works in building maintenance at Harvard
University and has projects going on around the house every
weekend. ``Plus, my son Michael always wanted a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Quirk, the manager at Quirk Ford in Quincy, Mass., where
Fiore bought his truck, says he saw the shift in truck sales start
about three years ago, when big cabs had two doors, ``then they
went to three, and now they've gone to four _ and that's because of
the families that want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's entry, even its competitors acknowledge, is a sign that
it is a strong market. The Tundra, Toyota's first V8, is the size
of the base-level big trucks. The company will produce 100,000
vehicles at a plant in Indiana, thus avoiding high import fees, for
the 2000 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Hoyt, a Toyota spokesman, tells the story of how Toyota
came to produce a V8.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Japan were meeting with American dealers and
talking about a new truck, Hoyt says, when one dealer rose and
said, ``If you don't have a V8, you might as well go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the strength of the big-engine, big-cab truck market in
this country, a vehicle ``unique to North America,'' says Toyota's
Lobenstein. He calls the market ``easy to identify, but difficult
to win over'' because of brand loyalty that is passed down through
the generations. If your father was a Chevy man, or Ford or Dodge,
then so were you.
</P>
<P>
   But trucks are not just for men anymore, and women are either
buying them _ many for a sense of safety or for convenience _ or
telling their husbands that if they want a truck, it's got to be a
truck the whole family can ride in.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that ``women in particular like sitting up
higher'' for reasons of safety, says Dan Hubbert, a spokesman for
Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   David Bostswick, the director of corporate market research for
Dodge, likens the switch from two-door, single-seat trucks to the
switch people _ mostly men _ had to make from two-passenger sports
cars to sedans and vans once they had families.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be able to justify it, or else it was just a matter
of indulgence,'' he says of vehicles that, while fun, were not
practical for families. Many owners had to give up their sports car
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Bostwick says that ruggedly individualistic pickup drivers
either found or were directed to another route: the big cab,
four-door, six-passenger truck. Gone are the days when dad can't
stop to pick up the kids from soccer on his way home from the
lumberyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you can be a rugged individual father,'' Bostwick says.

NASCAR BRINGS A LITTLE HOWYABEEN TO NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Welcome Race Fans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign you see in little towns and larger cities out on the
spokes that lead to the hub that is Loudon, N.H., home of New
Hampshire International Speedway, New England's largest sports
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the howdy, howyabeen, family atmosphere that
big-time NASCAR racing has brought to New England, and you'll find
the signs all the way up near the Canadian border, over near the
Maine coast, virtually everywhere New Hampshire touches another
border.
</P>
<P>
   Around 100,000 people pour into Loudon for each of the two
Winston Cup races held there each summer, forming a large,
informed, transitory and _ surprise to cynics of the sport _
wealthy city. The median family income at these races at the top of
the sport is around $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the wonderful world of wheels, there are many cliques: sports
car savants, muscle car mavens, antique car buffs. And all of these
break down into cliques of their own. Even in the world of
motorcycles, cliques can be snobbish little groups: Harley riders
don't like riders of Japanese bikes; BMW riders try to set
themselves aside; riders of old Harleys look down on riders of the
new Evo Harleys and complain of this new, richer breed of rider _
never mind that had this new breed not come along to buy the bikes,
there would likely be no Harley-Davidson company &UR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  I'm thinking about cliques because it has long disturbed me
that many of the more self-proclaimed ``classy'' breed of auto
enthusiasts have long looked down on stock car racing fans. In
concert with elitists who know nothing about cars or racing, they
see stock car fans as a bunch of toothless goobers with low IQs.
</P>
<P>
   Talk radio in Boston makes fun of them; coverage of the sport _
except when the Winston Cup races are held at Loudon _ can be
sporadic across the media spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to watch a bunch of cars go round and round?'' is
the common cynic's question.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the athleticism (that's right, athleticism) of
drivers who endure heat, fatigue, pounding, noise and pressures
that would challenge any athlete from any sport _ and probably
leave your average football lineman dehydrated and prostrate.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the wonderful teamwork that a crew must weave from
the moment it arrives at the track early on race week to the
split-second differences they can make in all-important pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind the sophisticated engineering and technology and
body sculpting that is fine-tuned day after day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is as much to be written about tuning a Winston Cup
engine, setting up a suspension, adjusting tires, as there is to be
written about any expensive sports car or muscle car or antique or
exotic.
</P>
<P>
   And to tell you the truth, more Americans can relate to a
Winston Cup car, a Busch series car, even a converted Camaro racing
around a dirt track somewhere in Maine than they can to any of the
above.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and business knows this; even the auto magazines
favored by nonrace fans have come to the realization. Motor Trend
and Car and Driver have expanded race sections.
</P>
<P>
   AutoWeek, an industry trade journal, has a section at its back
devoted to racing. Last week's issue featured a story on the France
and Penske racing families merging their tracks, which include
Daytona, Talladega, Phoenix, Darlington, Watkins Glen, California,
Michigan and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The ad on the back cover of the magazine showed Pontiac Racing's
Interstate Batteries race car with the proclamation, ``Wider is
Better.'' Beneath it was a Widetrack Pontiac Grand Prix, a consumer
vehicle. Under the skin, the cars have nothing in common, but from
the flared-nostril nose, up and over the roofline, they look much
the same. And that is testimony to the adage developed over the
last three decades of auto racing: ``Win on Sunday. Sell on
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just the auto industry that has spotted the
economic potential of race fans _ 40 percent of whom are women, by
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Studies done for advertisters show that nearly three-quarters of
NASCAR fans say they buy the products they see advertised on their
favorite cars or racetrack walls. Basketball? It gets 38 percent
product fan support.
</P>
<P>
   And at nearly $500 million each year in sponsorship money,
NASCAR racing takes in more than professional baseball, football,
basketball and hockey combined.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a national obsession with wheels and speed _
is Steve McQueen's car chase in the movie ``Bullitt'' a scene that
thrilled film afficianados, really so different from watching a
good race on a track?
</P>
<P>
   This is why, at hundreds of tracks around the country every
year, families gather on weekend nights for hours of racing. From
little spots like Spud Speedway up in Aroostook County, Maine, to
Unity Raceway in Unity, Maine, to other small tracks across New
England, and right up to the big one, Loudon, it happens here.
</P>
<P>
   It is exciting. It is family entertainment. And its fans are not
a bunch of toothless goobers.
</P>
<P>
   So let's occasionally bring some racing to this column on
Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   We won't talk race results or favorite drivers or point
standings.
</P>
<P>
   But let's meet some of the folks who run crews for drivers like
Jeff Gordon or Dale Earnhardt. Let's meet the guys who change the
tires and fill the tanks in those hotflash pitstops.
</P>
<P>
   Let's find out what's in a NASCAR engine, how you tune it, how
long it lasts. And what about aerodynamics, tire pressure, tire
wear, suspension setups? How do you build one of these cars from
the ground up?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, maybe we'll even take one out for a spin and share the ride
with you in this column.
</P>
<P>
   Because, in the world of Automobilia, there is a place for this;
there is a place because race cars have wheels and have engines and
have fans who want to know how one powers the other.
</P>
<P>
   So today, because there is a place for race fans, let's erect
another one of those signs that welcomes you under this big tent.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome Race Fans.

REACTIVE VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all sat in front of the television, listening to lying
politicians and ignorant film stars, and responded with a litany of
insults. When interactive TV finally arrives, it'd be fun to have a
ticker tape running at the bottom of the screen during ``Larry King
Live,'' featuring snide remarks from jaded viewers. But currently,
all of these bilious comments go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Even the interactivity of the Internet has its limits. If you'd
like to pick a public quarrel over something you read on the Globe
Web site, you can send an e-mail to the editor. But even if your
note is published, many visitors to the site will never see it.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose you could add your own commentary to any article on
the Globe Web site, or any other document on the Internet? On those
rare occasions when I write something stupid, you could say so,
right on the same Web page containing my blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Such power is now yours, thanks to the efforts of some clever
programmers from Singapore. Their new product, Third Voice, makes
any Web page your own, by letting you add comments and criticisms
that can be read by other visitors to the site.
</P>
<P>
   It's been called digital graffiti, but Third Voice is far more
sophisticated than a can of spray paint. Besides, it does no harm
to the Web sites on which it's used.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses Third Voice's own server computers, and a piece
of client software downloaded from the Third Voice Web site
(www.thirdvoice.com) and run on the user's machine. When you want
to comment on something at, say, the CNN Web site, you can select
the text, and use the Third Voice client to attach a note. This
note resides on the Third Voice server. CNN's own Web content is
completely unaffected. Nobody will see your note unless he or she
is also running the Third Voice client software. Visit a page with
a note attached, and a small icon flashes red, to let you know that
a fellow Third Voicer has weighed in on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of Third Voice have added a stack of features that
enhance the value of their product. You can add personal notes to a
site, for viewing only by you. You can also set up groups of users,
and post notes only they can read. This way, Third Voicers can
create impromptu discussion groups at any site.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that Web sites would hate the idea that another
company is piggybacking on their popularity. But Leo Jolicoeur,
Third Voice's vice president of business development, believes
otherwise. In fact, Jolicoeur is scrambling to set up deals with
major Web portals to promote Third Voice. The portal sites are
desperate for ways to increase their ``stickiness'' _ the amount of
time visitors spend at the site. A site such as CNN might welcome
Third Voice visitors who come for headlines and stay to swap
messages with other newshounds.
</P>
<P>
   Third Voice is a clever idea, though not an original one. A band
of open source software writers came up with the same idea a couple
of years ago, and turned it into a Web site called Crit. But like
that other famous open source program, the Linux operating system,
Crit is hard to use. As a result, few people bother with it _
though you're welcome to try, at crit.org.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not many people currently use Third Voice, either.
The product premiered only a couple of weeks ago. As a result, few
of my favorite sites are adorned with comments from Internet
kibitzers. Besides, the Third Voice software now works only with
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4 browser. The newest Microsoft
browser, Internet Explorer 5, is off limits. And forget about using
any Netscape browser for now, though Third Voice promises to
support more browsers in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems loom. No doubt we'll see people posting libelous
material under phony names, as they've been known to do at Yahoo's
Web bulletin boards. And I've already come across a new form of
spam _ get-rich-quick notes attached to unsuspecting Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Third Voice is too good an idea to be entirely ruined.
And it's come along just in time for next year's elections.
Already, candidates are setting up their Web sites. In a few
months, when those sites are covered with snarky retorts from
cynical Third Voice users, the pols may wish they'd skipped the
Internet and stuck with ``Larry King Live.''

HEADS TURN, TRAFFIC STOPS IN HOMAGE TO HUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
 AUTOS-REVIEW-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you emerge from the local store and spot a pair of legs
protruding from beneath your automobile, it means one of two
things: 1. You weren't paying enough attention when you drove in
and you will soon be discussing the mishap with the authorities, or
2. You drive a Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, feet sticking out beneath the driver's side door,
scrambling out when he heard the driver approach. Sorry, he said,
just had to see what it looked like underneath. Drive a Hummer and
trips take longer than most _ trips to the drug store, the
supermarket, a North Country campground. You need to build in time
to socialize with those who want to talk about your Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a growling, crawling, eye-catching rig, and at more than
seven feet wide and distinctly military in its bearing, AM General
Corp.'s Hummer may be the most recognizeable vehicle on American
roads.
</P>
<P>
   And that is remarkable given that, ever since it went into
civilian production for the 1992 model year, only 6,500 of them
have been sold. Of course, appearances of the military version _
the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (hence, HUMVEE) _
on American television screens during the Gulf War helped tenderize
us for the civilian model.
</P>
<P>
   So did the Hummer's appearance in such action films as
``Independence Day,'' ``Broken Arrow,'' and a half dozen others in
the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian Hummers share the same driveline, chassis, and
basic body construction with the 170,000 military beasts AM General
has built since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   We are fascinated, but most of us will never ride in one and far
fewer will ever drive or own one. So let's go for a spin.
</P>
<P>
   Settle into the driver's cockpit _ and with the wraparound dash,
comfortable leather seat, shift levers and myriad display gauges
and switches, it feels like you're in an airplane. There are round,
analog gauges for fuel supply, engine temperature, oil pressure, a
voltmeter, speedomoter, tachometer and a clock.
</P>
<P>
   A backlit ``status center'' lights up to report on a range of
features from coolant supply to lights to drive train operation.
There are no-nonsense push switches for wipers and lights and a
switch to change from main diesel fuel tank (25 gallons) to
auxiliary (17 gallons). There is even a switch, with gauges for
front and rear tires, to deflate the tires for running on soft sand
and reinflate them, using a built-in compressor, on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   While the driver has plenty of room, this four-passenger
hardtop, with small pickup bed, seats the passengers in tight
quarters. But packed in may be a good thing when the Hummer gets
offroad, and lowrange, first gear gives its four tires the feel of
creeping steel dozer tracks rather than rubber tires.
</P>
<P>
   To take the offroad pounding, the Hummer has four-wheel, fully
indepenent suspension and heavy duty springs. It has 16 inches of
clearance, a low-center of gravity, and massive shock absorbers.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension not only lets the cab bounce stiffly (yet
comfortably) up and down, but also back and forth, a sensation I
had not felt since riding in a big Diamond Reo hauling a gasoline
tanker from New Hampshire to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its offroad bite are geared hubs at each wheel for a
gear reduction of almost 2:1. To picture this, think of your
bicycle, which shifts down to more teeth on the front sprocket, but
can then also shift to more teeth on the back for extra torque.
</P>
<P>
   Its TorqTrac 4 system senses wheel slippage and transfers torque
to the wheels with the most purchase.
</P>
<P>
   All of which asks the question: Where will it go?
</P>
<P>
   Almost anywhere. Put its front tires against a 22-inch vertical
step along the trail and the rear wheels will follow. It will run
through 30 inches of water (the doors have rubber seals and the air
intake sits above the hood), a foot-and-a-half of mud, three feet
of snow. It will climb 30-degree hills (and probably more, though
the builder does not promote this feature).
</P>
<P>
   It does it all with a snarly, sure dexterity, and in New
England, where the woods are thick, the biggest danger is that what
is inside and underneath this vehicle is capable of taking it
places that endanger the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Can you get it stuck? Yes, even a bulldozer can get stuck, so
stick the Hummer's wheels on one side in enough mud that the wheels
on the other don't have any purchase and you are stuck. Been there,
done that. But that is a hazard with any offroad driving and the
Hummer should not be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   To get offroad, you need to travel overroad, and since, I
suspect, many Hummers don't get all that far offroad, you need to
ask how it does on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   It's loud. Diesel engines and great, knobby tires do not lend to
a quiet ride. It gives off a steady hum at lower speeds and it gets
louder, even as it cruises smoothly at 70 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quick (0-60 in 18 seconds) and that can be problematic
in merging into traffic on highways as you come up the exit ramp.
Because of its size, drivers whizzing by tend to let it in; a
smaller car accelerating this slowly would spend a lot of time
waiting for the right opening.
</P>
<P>
   But once it gets moving, it is fine on the highway, though it
shouldn't linger in the passing lane on today's highways, where
speeds of 80 and higher are common.
</P>
<P>
   In about 10 days of driving, from commuting to Boston from New
Hampshire to some pretty heavy offroad testing, it averaged about
11.5 per gallon of diesel fuel. A gasoline engine would do far
worse and that may be why Hummer does not offer a gasoline model
any longer.
</P>
<P>
   At prices from $60,000 to more than $90,000, this is a pricey
toy (and I can't imagine having it as my sole transportation). It's
built for a niche, within a niche, within a niche. But for those
folks, it is truly an amazing piece of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hummer should find a better use for the large, flat deck that
separates the two rear seats. Storage? A jump seat option?
</P>
<P>
   _ At prices approaching $100,000, the Hummer ought to have a
radio that has decent AM reception.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   _ Overhead lights whose lenses are also the switches that turn
them on and off.
</P>
<P>
   _ The web straps connecting door to cab beside the hinges. Open
one of these broad doors in a stiff wind and it could be torn off.
The straps prevent that.

FAMILIES DRIVING SALES OF BIG-CAB TRUCKS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JIM THORPE, Pa. _ The big pickup truck rumbles along a high
ridge here in what used to be the heart of coal country. It
scampers over rocks, splashes through the big pools of water that
the locals call ``sips,'' and rolls easily through muck and gravel.
</P>
<P>
   As it breaks from the woods, the four-door, V8 engine,
six-passenger Toyota Tundra is shifted from 4- to 2-wheel-drive.
When it hits the pavement, it runs as smoothly and as quietly as
any family sedan. New this year, the Tundra will be the first
foreign challenge to absolute domestic dominance of the big truck
market in North America. It is a market that Sandy Allen
Lobenstein, a senior market planner for Toyota, calls ``the
largest, most competitive, most lucrative segment in the auto
industry today.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look in the rearview mirror now, but the next set of
lights looming high behind you may not be a trendy SUV. Instead, it
will probably be a big-cab, four-door pickup truck, carrying a
family of six on its way to a soccer game or a campsite. All the
major US truck manufacturers are rapidly expanding their capacity
to build them.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps even more significant is that even makers of luxury
cars are looking to satisfy the growing demand for big-cab pickups.
Lincoln will build one and call it the Blackwood, essentially its
Navigator SUV with a cargo bed, and industry reports say even
Cadillac will match it with a pickup/SUV of its own.
</P>
<P>
   These trucks, once the virtually sole domain of construction
crews, are becoming a family vehicle of choice across the country.
People saw the trucks and realized a big cab with four doors and
seating for six and a pickup bed on the back ``meets the demands of
the whole day,'' says Al Giombetti, the group truck brand manager
for Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   He says customers justify the purchase this way: ``It's got
versatility and utility: I can use it for work, to go to the
restaurant, to pick up my kids at soccer _ and I can also carry
sheets of plywood in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giombetti says the trend started with an industry innovation
aimed at a narrow niche, but mushroomed into a broad customer
expectation. And it is a wave within a wave. In 1998, Americans
bought more vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs than they did cars.
Pickups alone, in the first quarter of this year, accounted for
46.3 percent of General Motors sales; 60.6 percent of Ford sales;
and 70.3 percent of the Chrysler portion (which includes Dodge
trucks) of the newly merged Daimler-Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is the industry's largest seller of pickup trucks, and when
it offered a four-door option on its F-series of trucks for the
1996-97 model year, that option accounted for just 5 percent of
truck sales. By the 98 model year, it was up to 30 percent. By the
end of 1999, Ford predicts it will be 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Dodge, 71 percent of the sales of its popular Ram pickup are
big-cab models, and 90 percent of those are four-door. By the end
of this year the company will add the four-door option to its
Dakota series of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   And Chevrolet, which in the past year saw its pickup sales go
from 486,000 to 686,000 _ even though its primary entry in the
big-cab market was a three-door _ will offer a four-door version of
its Silverado for 2000, complete with a full back seat and
headrests. In addition, the company, which acknowledges it
underestimated the pickup truck market last year, will offer a
Blazer model with a pickup bed, and a variation of the Suburban
that will also have a bed, Ron Zarella, president of GM North
America, told Automotive News this week.
</P>
<P>
   Four-door ``crew cab'' trucks, with full-size doors that open
toward the front like car doors, have been around for years, but
they tended to be loud, spartan, utilitarian brutes. The new,
better-riding, and quieter truck has large doors for front-seat
passengers, and smaller doors, which open toward the rear, for
back-seat riders. And some companies _ Ford among them with a 2001
SuperCrew _ are preparing elegant models of the old crew-cab style
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The shift, say industry analysts, is part of an evolution as
American car buyers moved from minivans to SUVs. They liked the
ability of minivans to cart kids around. They liked the ability of
SUVs to not only carry whole families and gear in comfort, but also
the safety their height and size offer and the performance of
four-wheel-drive in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   And then they noticed the big-cab, four-door pickups, which
offered all these things, plus a bed in back to haul lumber for
weekend building projects, manure for gardens, stones for walls,
bags and buckets for trips to the recycling center, and, with a cap
or tarp added, camping and other recreational gear _ all while the
entire family rides in sedan-like comfort. In addition, these
trucks, from the mid-teens to high $20,000 range, are often priced
$10,000 or lower than comparable wagon-like SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   The utility of the truck is precisely what lured Glenn Fiore of
Norwell, Mass., out of his two-door SUV and behind the wheel of a
Ford F-150 SuperCab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed more doors. I needed a pickup truck,'' says the
father of two, who works in building maintenance at Harvard
University and has projects going on around the house every
weekend. ``Plus, my son Michael always wanted a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Quirk, the manager at Quirk Ford in Quincy, Mass., where
Fiore bought his truck, says he saw the shift in truck sales start
about three years ago, when big cabs had two doors, ``then they
went to three, and now they've gone to four _ and that's because of
the families that want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's entry, even its competitors acknowledge, is a sign that
it is a strong market. The Tundra, Toyota's first V8, is the size
of the base-level big trucks. The company will produce 100,000
vehicles at a plant in Indiana, thus avoiding high import fees, for
the 2000 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Hoyt, a Toyota spokesman, tells the story of how Toyota
came to produce a V8.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Japan were meeting with American dealers and
talking about a new truck, Hoyt says, when one dealer rose and
said, ``If you don't have a V8, you might as well go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the strength of the big-engine, big-cab truck market in
this country, a vehicle ``unique to North America,'' says Toyota's
Lobenstein. He calls the market ``easy to identify, but difficult
to win over'' because of brand loyalty that is passed down through
the generations. If your father was a Chevy man, or Ford or Dodge,
then so were you.
</P>
<P>
   But trucks are not just for men anymore, and women are either
buying them _ many for a sense of safety or for convenience _ or
telling their husbands that if they want a truck, it's got to be a
truck the whole family can ride in.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that ``women in particular like sitting up
higher'' for reasons of safety, says Dan Hubbert, a spokesman for
Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   David Bostswick, the director of corporate market research for
Dodge, likens the switch from two-door, single-seat trucks to the
switch people _ mostly men _ had to make from two-passenger sports
cars to sedans and vans once they had families.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be able to justify it, or else it was just a matter
of indulgence,'' he says of vehicles that, while fun, were not
practical for families. Many owners had to give up their sports car
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Bostwick says that ruggedly individualistic pickup drivers
either found or were directed to another route: the big cab,
four-door, six-passenger truck. Gone are the days when dad can't
stop to pick up the kids from soccer on his way home from the
lumberyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you can be a rugged individual father,'' Bostwick says.

A NEW PRO WITH AN OPEN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ As she made her way from the 16th green to
the 17th tee Tuesday at Old Waverly Golf Club, Jenny Chuasiriporn
stopped and signed dozens of autographs. Her playing partners
waited patiently on the tee, and when Chuasiriporn arrived, one of
them had some friendly advice: ``You should shorten your name.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn laughed and showed off the pleasant smile that had
made the golf world take notice a year ago. Her improbable run as
an amateur at the US Women's Open last July, punctuated by a 40- to
50-foot birdie putt on the 72d hole to force a playoff, is fresh on
everyone's mind as the 54th renewal of the most prestigious
championship in women's golf got under way here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed for this daughter of Thai immigrants. She is
now a professional and while the game is still golf, many of the
dynamics have changed. Refreshingly, it is a process she has not
jumped into.
</P>
<P>
   ``No logos on me,'' she said. ``No rush. There'll be time.''
</P>
<P>
   At 21, Chuasiriporn is still innocent enough to think tomorrow
is a long way away. Too many others know better, so they are
reaching for a piece of her now, while the image of her dramatic
play last year is a hot commodity. Last July, she stood on the 18th
hole at Blackwolf Run in Wisconsin, shocked, almost apologetic as
her putt rolled in. Though she lost to Se Ri Pak on the 20th
playoff hole, Chuasiriporn captivated our hearts and reminded us
that the soul of the game does not revolve around money.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, there are still those reminders. Like her
golf bag, which has not yet become a corporate billboard,
displaying only the Duke University logo on the side. And her
brother Joey, who will carry her bag again this week. And her clubs
are still Callaway because she has this idea that she has done OK
by them to this point. There is a small incentive deal with
Titleist, said Chuasiriporn, but for the most part she has tried to
push all this to the side while she concentrates on golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of disappointment (that she lost the playoff
last year), but I am just a big believer in things happening for a
reason,'' she said. ``I could kind of go back and imagine had I
won, and it would have just been really hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity did more than knock on her door last year; it kicked
the thing in. But Chuasiriporn wanted no part of the quick money
that surely would have been tossed at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in me that wanted to turn pro at that
time,'' said Chuasiriporn, who returned to Duke for her senior year
and helped lead the Blue Devils to the national championship. It
accomplished a personal goal, though she concedes that her play was
not up to her high standards. ``I was kind of distracted a little
bit, with the golf side and the school side. I took a little break
in the winter, and it always takes me a couple of months to get
back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to the pro life, Chuasiriporn spent a lot of
time deciding on a management company before settling on Pros,
Inc., run by Vinny Giles. People who know her say it was agonizing
for her because in a short period of time she had made lots of
friends. Saying no did not come easy to her.
</P>
<P>
   That decision made and her collegiate career completed, the
recipe for Chuasiriporn has been simple. ``Focus. Visualize. Forget
mechanics,'' said Ted Sheftic.
</P>
<P>
   A professional instructor in Hanover, Pa., Sheftic was
introduced to a 12-year-old Chuasiriporn and has been her only
teacher. He had two televisions set up in his home last July so he
wouldn't miss a minute of the playoff, but this year he's taken
time off to be at the Open in person.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Sheftic about Chuasiriporn and he doesn't talk about
one-piece takeaways or ball-striking or great rhythm. ``She has a
great smile, doesn't she?'' he said. ``She's such a great kid. No
regrets about last year. She told me she wasn't ready to win. She
said, `I'll win someday. I'm just happy for Se Ri.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The world of women's professional golf, it appears, is happy to
have Chuasiriporn, though there are warnings about what lies ahead.
``I'm sure she'll feel a lot of pressure,'' said Nancy Lopez, who
can relate to Chuasiriporn's situation. As an 18-year-old amateur,
Lopez finished second in the Women's Open. Two years later, she
made her pro debut at the 1977 Open and finished second again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first turn professional and you're out here, and
after having the Open that she had last year, she is probably going
to have more pressure than a lot of people. I think probably more
so from herself,'' said Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   This is not lost on Chuasiriporn. ``I realize there is a lot of
expectations. I ran into a little problem toward the end of my
college career because I did have a lot of expectations. But I
learned so much from that. You can't really golf with all those
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Learning curve
</P>
<P>
   To ease into the pro world, Chuasiriporn asked her brother to
carry her bag again. They are very close, and he has been with her
at both US Women's Opens in which she has made noteworthy splashes.
(At Pumpkin Ridge in 1997, Chuasiriporn was low amateur.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been busy, very busy for her,'' said Joey, a scratch
golfer who played at Penn State. ``But she's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared so Tuesday during her practice round at Old Waverly
when Chuasiriporn showed off the game that nearly made her just the
second amateur to win the Women's Open. Consistently she hit it
15-20 yards inside of her playing partners, veteran LPGA players
Cindy Figg-Currier and LaRee Sugg. She usually hits irons into the
par 4s, whereas many of her opponents must hit 5- and 7-woods.
</P>
<P>
   She also took note of her mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-4 sixth, a 348-yarder that doglegs right and leaves
you an approach from an elevated fairway, Chuasiriporn dropped her
second shot into a bunker. She dropped another ball and put that
shot into the rough. A third try. This one pin high, 8 feet left.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hit a half-wedge, then three-quarters,'' said Sheftic.
``Then a full wedge. Now she knows, it's a full wedge to get it to
the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn also knows that while it's the Open, there is much
more ahead. Already, she has accepted sponsor's exemptions into
three consecutive events beginning July 1 _ Jamie Farr Kroger
Classic, Michelob Light Classic, and JAL Big Apple Classic. Barring
the long shot _ that she wins one of these events or earns enough
money to gain her card _ Chuasiriporn accepts the prospects of
playing on the Futures Tour and going to Tour School in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But that's getting too far ahead. She doesn't think last year's
performances should necessarily make her a favorite this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I really care about is I want to hit the ball well,'' said
Chuasiriporn. ``I am not really worried about finishing a certain
way again.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey has pro aspirations himself and Tuesday he will play in
Summit, N.J., in an effort to qualify for the men's US Open at
Pinehurst, N.C. It would be nice to prepare, he said, but his
loyalty to his sister comes first.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just wants to tee it up. I think she'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she'd be more comfortable when her parents _ Pornpimol
and Supoj _ come in from Baltimore with her 11-year-old brother
Jimmy. They flew in Wednesday, having closed the family restaurant,
The Bangkok Place, for just the second time ever. The first time,
naturally, was a result of the Blackwolf theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   This US Women's Open stuff may be good for her golf career, but
it's hurting the family business.

VIDEO GAME MAKERS DISPLAY LATEST WONDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sony vice president Phil Harrison stood beaming by
a large monitor while, at his feet, a smallish box of blinking
lights and electronics deftly handled the imposing mathematical
task of drawing and moving dozens of oddly shaped and colored balls
on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not look like much, but graphics engineers think this
stuff is amazing,'' Harrison said to a group of journalists,
analysts and developers at the recent Electronic Entertainment
Expo.
</P>
<P>
   And he's right. Just as humans might be challenged to juggle 50
or 100 balls at a time, so too would a computer or video-game
console trying to draw and move that many balls on screen. But that
was before the technologically imposing PlayStation 2 came along.
</P>
<P>
   The box, a prototype shown in closed-door sessions to select
people during the event called ``E3'' in geekspeak, was one of the
massive electronic game trade show's highlights, albeit one that
most attendees never saw.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its techno wonders, the PlayStation 2 wasn't the
only big news at E3, even among next-generation gaming consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Sega said its entry in that race, the Dreamcast, will have 15
titles available Sept. 9, the day the machine hits U.S. store
shelves, with 30 by the holidays and 100 by Christmas 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That wealth of titles early on may be crucial to the Dreamcast's
_ and Sega's _ chances of success against Sony and Nintendo over
the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo also announced the first notable technological details
about its next-generation machine, code-named Dolphin and also due
in the United States by the holidays of 2000. It'll have a DVD
drive and a computer brain by IBM that Nintendo officials promise
will outperform even the PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nintendo and Sony left many key details undisclosed, such
as a likely price, a strategic silence designed to give them more
chances to beat up on Sega.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Motorola showed off prototypes of the ``Blackbird''
set-top boxes that use VM Labs' powerful Nuon chip, which not only
replaces the graphics chips that run DVDs but helps give the
Blackbird the ability to also play interactive games, handle
Internet chores, voice and video-phone calls, and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The box wars weren't E3's only notable events, which also
included:
</P>
<P>
   APPLE AS A GAMER PLATFORM: The company's ice-cool demo room away
from the crazy main show halls showcased how recent efforts to make
Apple computers more game-friendly has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps two-dozen developers, including some of the biggest, are
creating top-drawer titles for both Mac and PC, as are numerous
accessory makers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the games coming soon for the Mac: Falcon 4.0, Age of
Empires, Total Annihilation, Unreal Tournament, Quake III Arena and
girl game titles from a resuscitated Purple Moon. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW AND/OR COOLER HANDHELD GAME DEVICES:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nintendo, who finally goosed up its venerable Game Boy last
winter with a color screen and more memory, is offering new
external colors. Expect a boatload of new titles to take advantage
of the Color Game Boy's power.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Electronics is dressing up its inexpensive handheld
alternative, the Pocket Game.com, with a variety of wacky case
designs, while arcade veteran SNK is offering an even more powerful
handheld.
</P>
<P>
   SNK's Neo Geo Pocket is a 16-bit machine, roughly the equivalent
of an SNES console, and able to show three times as many colors as
the 8-bit Color Game Boy. It'll have about 15 titles, many of them
ports from SNK's fighter-heavy arcade library.
</P>
<P>
   TONS OF GAMES, EVER MORE GRAPHICALLY AMAZING AND HOPEFULLY
ENGROSSING, INCLUDING:
</P>
<P>
   Quake III Arena and its chief first-person shooter competition,
Unreal Tournament. Both looked truly wonderful, if painfully
politically incorrect. And both emphasize the unpredictability of
online multiplayer matches.
</P>
<P>
   Homeworld from Sierra looked absolutely smashing, mixing space
combat, strategy and role-playing elements in a remarkably smooth
3-D world. Another good-looking space adventure _ Tachyon the
Fringe _ is coming from Nova Logic. Choose a side and work your way
through dozens of interrelated missions as pilot of a space
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Two best-selling adventure game franchises _ Mission Impossible
and GoldenEye 007 _ will get sequels, though GoldenEye will be
minus one long-time license to kill. Instead of James Bond, Perfect
Dark on the N64 will use an improved version of the GoldenEye game
engine to follow a female agent named Joanna Dark.
</P>
<P>
   The Stone, an unclassifiable online puzzle game, is sold through
outlets such as the Museum Store. Buy the stone, with a code on it
that gets you onto the Web site, then work through riddles that
unspool over two years to solve a larger mystery. Very different.
</P>
<P>
   Final Fantasy VIII brings the usual absorbing adventure, action
and great graphics of that durable role-playing franchise along
with something new: romance.
</P>
<P>
   A ``digitally remastered'' Myst. Despite the egregious marketing
speak, the all-time best seller's new version promises richer
graphics and sound for a gaming classic.
</P>
<P>
   Donkey Kong 64 is going 3-D for the first time, on the N64,
while a cartoony but quite fun sci-fi shooter, Jet Force Gemini, is
also nearing release.
</P>
<P>
   Working Designs is about to release an absolutely gorgeous
collector's version of Lunar Silver Star Story with a 100-page
manual, a soundtrack disk, a ``making of'' documentary and more.
</P>
<P>
   Fly! _ a great-looking flight simulator that features detailed
maps of Los Angeles, four other cities and 20,000 airports _ should
challenge Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 for civil air domination.
</P>
<P>
   A first-person title based on ``Star Trek's'' ``Deep Space
Nine,'' The Fallen lets you play each of three DS9 characters
fending off aliens. To get the whole tale, you have to play through
all three story lines.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a handsome sequel to the world-building Age of
Empires called Age of Kings, with remarkably complex structures
from a wide range of cultures. There's even a regicide option. Long
live the king.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also debuted Asheron's Call, an online-only game that
allows newbies to ally their vulnerable characters with protective
senior players in allegiance and fellowship relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamestorm online gaming site has a great World War II flying
simulation, Air Warriors, that had me quite enchanted, albeit
quickly shot down over the skies of France.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund is patching up navigational problems in its
all-encompassing CD-ROM and DVD-ROM collections of National
Geographic editions and is updating its fabulous eight-disc
collection of National Geographic maps. And blessed be, it's also
issuing a digital collection of more than 500 Mad magazine issues.
What? Me worry?
</P>
<P>
   For children, DK Interactive Learning featured My First Amazing
Diary, which helps children begin writing about themselves and
their lives. One minus: no password protection yet, even for an
upcoming school version. So much for keeping those innermost
thoughts private.
</P>
<P>
   OOL PERIPHERALS:
</P>
<P>
   Karna LLC has an ultra-high-resolution Razer mouse coming to the
market this fall. The hi-res mode means a twitch of the wrist sends
a cursor flying across the screen, while allowing very precise
positioning, both of which can be boons for gamers.
</P>
<P>
   Benwin is offering BW2000 flat-panel speaker systems that take
up virtually no room, sound great and provide eerily 360-degree
sound. Even the subwoofer is tiny, while the minijack connects the
speakers to everything from a game console to a Walkman to a TV.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's Pokemon Stadium game probably will come with an
accessory that will let you swap information between a Game Boy
cartridge and an N64. This accessory could open up an array of new
N64-Game Boy interactions _ if developers take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Interact Accessories' Sharkline gives a PlayStation or N64
limited online access (mostly e-mail and Interact's Web site). I'm
dubious about the connection costs ($10 a month for a few hours),
but it shows how fast the idea of a computer is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Interact's Dexdrive also blurs the differences between computer
and console, allowing you to use your PC to save and manage all the
console game data you've saved. Never buy another memory card.
</P>
<P>
   The Game Buddy from Battery Technologies (www.bti.com) gives you
22 hours of Game Boy Pocket play with a battery pack that doubles
as a night light when it's recharging.
</P>
<P>
   Nyko's Shock 'n' Rock pack provides even more for your Game Boy:
rumble feedback, amplified stereo, a 10-hour rechargeable battery
and an AC adapter connection. No night light, though.
</P>
<P>
   Nyko's RF Max 900 sends low-power radio signals between your
controller and PlayStation, N64 or Dreamcast. Eleven Engineering
also has a radio-based wireless controller for the PlayStation (and
eventually the Motorola Blackbird machines) called the Airplay. In
each case, no wires, no infrared beam and no little brother
blocking the infrared signal. &QL;

LEARNING TO LIVE WITH CELLULITE IS A HARD PILL TO SWALLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's ``The One and Only Cellasene,'' a dietary supplement that
helps eliminate cellulite, or so its distributor, Rexall Sundown,
claims.
</P>
<P>
   I bought it even though I know that ridding the female body of
cellulite by taking a pill is almost certainly an impossible dream.
It was an impulse purchase. A sign in the drugstore announced:
``The product that caused riots in Australia.'' There was no
rioting at my local drug store, but there were only two packages of
the stuff left, and I decided I'd better grab some while I could.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian riots broke out when rumors of a Cellasene
shortage began circulating. What if the same thing were to happen
here? I didn't want to chance being trampled by a herd of
cellulite-crazed women.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, who will remain nameless if I value my life, has been
taking Cellasene for nearly three weeks. Has she noticed any
change? ``I think maybe yes,'' she says. ``But it could be all in
my head.''
</P>
<P>
   If only cellulite were all in our heads. Unfortunately, it's all
on our thighs and backsides. It's the bane of the female body, even
the slim female body. Women of every size and shape are plagued by
cellulite. The connective tissue that separates a woman's muscles
from her skin is shaped like a honeycomb. Fat gathers in these
little pockets and the result is cellulite. It has been described
as looking like orange peel, or cottage cheese, or sponge. It's not
pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Men don't get cellulite. Men's connective tissue doesn't dimple.
It just lies there, maddeningly smooth.
</P>
<P>
   In the package are 30 blood-red Cellasene softgels, each big
enough to choke a goat. The recommended dosage is three pills a
day, after meals. The 30 pills cost $37, about $1.23 each.
According to the instructions, ``benefits are best realized after 8
weeks of continuous use.'' Which adds up to $206.64, or $103.32 per
thigh. Then there's maintenance, one pill a day forever, or until
your cellulite totally disappears, which basically amounts to the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   How is Cellasene supposed to work? An explanation on the
distributor's Web site is somewhat vague, claiming that the product
increases blood flow and metabolic rate, thus ``freeing'' trapped
fat and eliminating cellulite. Cellasene is a dietary supplement,
not a drug. The ingredients include gingko biloba, borage, sweet
clover, fish and vegetable oils, and bladderwrack, which isn't the
potent diuretic its name implies but an iodine-rich sea vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   But does Cellasene work? Reports in the Washington Post and
elsewhere have quoted Cellasene's inventor, Italian chemist
Gianfranco Merizzi, claiming that his product doesn't just reduce
the appearance of cellulite, it ``cures'' the condition. But
Merizzi's critics in the medical community say that his unpublished
studies of the product are unreliable. The word ``fraud'' has been
bandied about in connection with the product. Obesity expert Dr.
Michael Rosenbaum, associate professor of clinical medicine at
Columbia University and coauthor of a recently published study on
cellulite, has been widely quoted as saying that Cellasene simply
doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever seems to go broke marketing cellulite-related
remedies and nostrums. Herbal wraps. Rubber undergarments.
Massagers. Firming creams and lotions. Now Cellasene. No wonder
there were riots in Australia when women feared the supply was
running out. If any cellulite eliminator really worked, could there
ever be enough to go around?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should try to look at cellulite in a different light,
try to view it as a sign of beauty. Or perhaps not. We may have to
learn to live with our cellulite, but learning to love it is a lot
to ask.

WEB DESIGN AS AN ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Web design is one of the most interesting art forms to arise in
recent years. It's a demanding form that combines traditional arts,
such as drawing and photography, with technical skills like
computer programming and layout design. A good Web designer also
needs equal parts wit and writing skill. Some Web sites even employ
music. The resulting creation can be interesting, compelling,
informative, even mobilizing.
</P>
<P>
   A well-designed Web site can also reach beyond the conventional
bounds of art by allowing communities of people to form and grow.
And artistic Web sites can even offer services _ that is, they can
become useful art, like a well-designed chair. And because Web
sites can continually change and grow, they can remain fresh and
thereby keep an audience over an extended period of time _ like a
museum with an ever-changing collection.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many people today don't think of Web design as an
art. That's because most Web sites people see and use on a daily
basis lack the fundamental essentials of artistic integrity.
Instead, they are designed to sell something or boost a company's
image. And while some sites also entertain or teach, few inspire.
</P>
<P>
   Web creation in the corporate world is largely a team activity.
A group of writers creates the content. A digital artist might
create images or retouch photographs. Finally, a Web ``designer''
pieces together the words and some templates.
</P>
<P>
   Web design can also be a very rewarding solo activity. It is a
uniquely affordable one, as there are no paints to buy, no film to
process, and no dangerous chemicals. And while a Web designer does
need a computer, he or she doesn't need to purchase his own. In
fact, the only thing a real Web designer needs is time _ time to
learn the latest techniques, time to try them out, and time to
build a complex creation.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site that demonstrates the potential of this new medium
is ``Escalation,'' a simulation that follows the US involvement in
Vietnam. In this Web site, which is loaded with historical
documents and photographs, you play the role of President Lyndon
Johnson. As the simulation progresses, you are faced with the
choices of increasing economic aid to South Vietnam, stepping up
military presence, or doing nothing. There are plots, raids, and
all sorts of political military intrigue _ all happening as the
number of people killed and wounded steadily mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Escalation was created by Nathaniel Duca, a 17-year-old high
school junior from Wenham. Duca is one of the finalists for the
ArsDigita Prize, a $10,000 cash grant that will be given annually
to a person 18 or younger who has created the most artful,
tasteful, noncommercial Web-based service. Seven runners-up will
each be given $1,000 prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screaming banner ads and graphics are the antithesis of
Web-site-as-art-form,'' says Philip Greenspun, creator of the prize
and Cambridge-based Web design firm ArsDigita. An artful Web site,
says Greenspun, ``does a job well. It's as simple as possible. It
doesn't have a user's manual. It's obvious how to make it work.
(And) it's aesthetically unobtrusive _ it doesn't hammer you with
its design.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspun is a great believer in the potential of Web technology
and is one of its greatest advocates. His company, a prototypical
MIT spinoff, has created Web sites for companies such as America
Online, CNN, and ePLAY. If you order custom made blue jeans from
the Levi Strauss Web site, you are using Greenspun's code. And his
new book, Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing (Morgan
Kaufmann, April 1999), offers insightful comments on the Web
economy and the future of the information marketplace, as well as
nuts-and-bolts information on building on-line creations.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspun's greatest contribution to the future of the Web
may well be the ArsDigita Prize. Beyond the money, all of the
finalists will be flown to MIT for a special one-day class on Web
design and technique. (The class is also open to the public; see
http://arsdigita.org/ for registration information.) And then, says
Greenspun, he will give these young artists the tools of corporate
giants and turn their creative energies loose on the world.
</P>
<P>
   And ArsDigita will give the winners free use of high-powered
computers with screaming-fast Internet connections for their next
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of what we are doing is letting these people use
our servers in the future,'' says Greenspun. ``We are finding
people that we are going to invest in for the next 10 or 15 years
by helping with the infrastructure part. They will have the
infrastructure of the best Web publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   The finalists in the ArsDigita Prize, including Escalation, are
all on the Web at http://www.arsdigita.org/prize/. Drawn from 155
submissions from around the world, many of the finalists have a
somewhat utilitarian theme. There is a Web-based calendar, now used
at Earlham College; a message board, used at Western Washington
University; and a guide to the theater _ complete with important
advice to stage parents.
</P>
<P>
   The winners will be announced on June 23. You'll probably be
hearing from them again, and not before long.

HEADS TURN, TRAFFIC STOPS IN HOMAGE TO HUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
 AUTOS-REVIEW-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you emerge from the local store and spot a pair of legs
protruding from beneath your automobile, it means one of two
things: 1. You weren't paying enough attention when you drove in
and you will soon be discussing the mishap with the authorities, or
2. You drive a Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, feet sticking out beneath the driver's side door,
scrambling out when he heard the driver approach. Sorry, he said,
just had to see what it looked like underneath. Drive a Hummer and
trips take longer than most _ trips to the drug store, the
supermarket, a North Country campground. You need to build in time
to socialize with those who want to talk about your Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a growling, crawling, eye-catching rig, and at more than
seven feet wide and distinctly military in its bearing, AM General
Corp.'s Hummer may be the most recognizeable vehicle on American
roads.
</P>
<P>
   And that is remarkable given that, ever since it went into
civilian production for the 1992 model year, only 6,500 of them
have been sold. Of course, appearances of the military version _
the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (hence, HUMVEE) _
on American television screens during the Gulf War helped tenderize
us for the civilian model.
</P>
<P>
   So did the Hummer's appearance in such action films as
``Independence Day,'' ``Broken Arrow,'' and a half dozen others in
the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian Hummers share the same driveline, chassis, and
basic body construction with the 170,000 military beasts AM General
has built since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   We are fascinated, but most of us will never ride in one and far
fewer will ever drive or own one. So let's go for a spin.
</P>
<P>
   Settle into the driver's cockpit _ and with the wraparound dash,
comfortable leather seat, shift levers and myriad display gauges
and switches, it feels like you're in an airplane. There are round,
analog gauges for fuel supply, engine temperature, oil pressure, a
voltmeter, speedomoter, tachometer and a clock.
</P>
<P>
   A backlit ``status center'' lights up to report on a range of
features from coolant supply to lights to drive train operation.
There are no-nonsense push switches for wipers and lights and a
switch to change from main diesel fuel tank (25 gallons) to
auxiliary (17 gallons). There is even a switch, with gauges for
front and rear tires, to deflate the tires for running on soft sand
and reinflate them, using a built-in compressor, on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   While the driver has plenty of room, this four-passenger
hardtop, with small pickup bed, seats the passengers in tight
quarters. But packed in may be a good thing when the Hummer gets
offroad, and lowrange, first gear gives its four tires the feel of
creeping steel dozer tracks rather than rubber tires.
</P>
<P>
   To take the offroad pounding, the Hummer has four-wheel, fully
indepenent suspension and heavy duty springs. It has 16 inches of
clearance, a low-center of gravity, and massive shock absorbers.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension not only lets the cab bounce stiffly (yet
comfortably) up and down, but also back and forth, a sensation I
had not felt since riding in a big Diamond Reo hauling a gasoline
tanker from New Hampshire to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its offroad bite are geared hubs at each wheel for a
gear reduction of almost 2:1. To picture this, think of your
bicycle, which shifts down to more teeth on the front sprocket, but
can then also shift to more teeth on the back for extra torque.
</P>
<P>
   Its TorqTrac 4 system senses wheel slippage and transfers torque
to the wheels with the most purchase.
</P>
<P>
   All of which asks the question: Where will it go?
</P>
<P>
   Almost anywhere. Put its front tires against a 22-inch vertical
step along the trail and the rear wheels will follow. It will run
through 30 inches of water (the doors have rubber seals and the air
intake sits above the hood), a foot-and-a-half of mud, three feet
of snow. It will climb 30-degree hills (and probably more, though
the builder does not promote this feature).
</P>
<P>
   It does it all with a snarly, sure dexterity, and in New
England, where the woods are thick, the biggest danger is that what
is inside and underneath this vehicle is capable of taking it
places that endanger the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Can you get it stuck? Yes, even a bulldozer can get stuck, so
stick the Hummer's wheels on one side in enough mud that the wheels
on the other don't have any purchase and you are stuck. Been there,
done that. But that is a hazard with any offroad driving and the
Hummer should not be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   To get offroad, you need to travel overroad, and since, I
suspect, many Hummers don't get all that far offroad, you need to
ask how it does on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   It's loud. Diesel engines and great, knobby tires do not lend to
a quiet ride. It gives off a steady hum at lower speeds and it gets
louder, even as it cruises smoothly at 70 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quick (0-60 in 18 seconds) and that can be problematic
in merging into traffic on highways as you come up the exit ramp.
Because of its size, drivers whizzing by tend to let it in; a
smaller car accelerating this slowly would spend a lot of time
waiting for the right opening.
</P>
<P>
   But once it gets moving, it is fine on the highway, though it
shouldn't linger in the passing lane on today's highways, where
speeds of 80 and higher are common.
</P>
<P>
   In about 10 days of driving, from commuting to Boston from New
Hampshire to some pretty heavy offroad testing, it averaged about
11.5 per gallon of diesel fuel. A gasoline engine would do far
worse and that may be why Hummer does not offer a gasoline model
any longer.
</P>
<P>
   At prices from $60,000 to more than $90,000, this is a pricey
toy (and I can't imagine having it as my sole transportation). It's
built for a niche, within a niche, within a niche. But for those
folks, it is truly an amazing piece of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hummer should find a better use for the large, flat deck that
separates the two rear seats. Storage? A jump seat option?
</P>
<P>
   _ At prices approaching $100,000, the Hummer ought to have a
radio that has decent AM reception.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   _ Overhead lights whose lenses are also the switches that turn
them on and off.
</P>
<P>
   _ The web straps connecting door to cab beside the hinges. Open
one of these broad doors in a stiff wind and it could be torn off.
The straps prevent that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY, Mass. _ In the incredible universe of electronic games,
the force is clearly with Hasbro Interactive Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Monopoly Star Wars, Frogger, Tonka Workshop, and Em(at)il
Scrabble are just a few of the tricky titles that have sent the
multimedia division of toy giant Hasbro Inc. of Rhode Island
soaring to the top of the nation's $5.5 billion video game
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years, Hasbro Interactive, pioneer of the casual
and family game market, has emerged as the world's third largest
video game company, with sales expected to top $300 million this
year, from $35 million in 1996, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have put amazingly strong numbers on the board,'' said
analyst David Leibowitz of Burnham Securities. ``They are clearly a
force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fast-growing company, already fending off the likes off
Microsoft and Sony, faces a new challenge from its old rival Mattel
Inc., which last month completed its $3.5 billion acquisition of
Cambridge-based Learning Co., the nation's second largest maker of
entertainment and educational software.
</P>
<P>
   Now armed with such popular titles as the Carmen Sandiego and
Reader Rabbit series, along with best-selling strategy games Myst
and Riven, Mattel has been transformed overnight into a $1 billion
behemoth in the explosive interactive industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're players. They've gained a significant amount of market
share in a short time,'' says Doug Lowenstein, president of the
Interactive Digital Software Association, a trade group
representing computer and video game companies. ``Their acquisition
of the Learning Co. is a pretty strong statement about their
commitment to the interactive industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hasbro Interactive is prepared to battle its old nemesis on
new turf. ``Our goal is to knock all of our competitors out of
business,'' said Hasbro Interactive president Thomas Dusenberry in
a recent interview at the company's Beverly headquarters. ``Mattel
is about as good a competitor as you will ever get, but we see the
competition as anyone who takes up shelf space. We don't dwell on
Mattel specifically.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, going forward, Hasbro Interactive still faces tough
challenges from nimble competitors Havas Interactive Inc., a
French-owned maker of strategy games, and California's Electronics
Arts Inc., which specializes in sports titles. As of April, the
companies ranked first and second, respectively, in overall PC game
sales, according to PC Data, a Virginia software sales tracking
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Said Leibowitz: ``The market is very fast moving. Hasbro has to
come up with titles that are fresh, exciting, and that capture the
consumer's imagination. That's a very tall order.''
</P>
<P>
   And MattelMedia, the toy giant's interactive division in El
Segundo, Calif., seems ready to meet it. Since starting three years
ago, the company's on-line and CD-ROM products have focused mostly
on the always-fashionable Barbie, and Hot Wheels. Still, sales for
the division soared to $100 million last year, from $20 million in
1996, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, which posted a $17.9 million first-quarter loss because
of sagging retail sales in its traditional business segments, is
now gunning for a bigger piece of the fast-growing interactive
children's and family game market.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on the technology of Learning Co., Mattel said last
month it will spend $50 million to create a new Internet
subsidiary, Mattel.com, which will bring together its top brands,
such as Barbie, Carmen Sandiego, and American Girl, for both sales
and play. Mattel expects total e-commerce revenues to reach $60
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with all our interactive products, we want to do things
that relate to the basic play patterns of these properties,'' said
Glenn Bozarth, a Mattel spokesman. ``We see a lot of synergy
between the Learning Co. titles and our own brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, wherever Mattel's Barbie goes, Hasbro's G.I. Joe is
not far behind. Hasbro Interactive took a step toward the Internet
last year, introducing a line of Em(at)il Games. Hasbro's signature
boardgames including Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit are played
on-line through agreements with Microsoft and Sony Online
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Its line of CD-ROM games, which now includes 85 titles, contains
computer chips to convert to Internet play. And in the last year,
the company has expanded its playing platforms from PCs to Nintendo
64s, Sony PlayStations, Windows CE, and personal e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Dusenberry won't say whether Hasbro
Interactive will launch a separate Internet subsidiary, saying
only, ``We know we need to apply technology into our business even
more than we already have.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one analyst expects Hasbro Interactive soon will
launch its own Internet gaming site. ``What they've done is take
all their core properties and put them onto new platforms, first
with PCs, and now with video game consoles,'' said analyst John
Taylor of Arcadia Investment Corp. ``They're well positioned for an
on-line gaming strategy. They've got the brands everyone knows and
loves.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hasbro Interactive entered the video game business armed
with an arsenal of top consumer brands, including Parker Brothers,
Milton Bradley, and Playskool. ``We have gone after the mass market
with known brands with proven play patterns,'' said Dusenberry, a
former vice president of new product development at Milton Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, aided by falling computer prices, has helped build
Hasbro Interactive into a growing powerhouse for parent Hasbro Inc.
Although the unit's sales still account for less than 10 percent of
the company's total revenues, it holds the greatest growth
potential _ the interactive industry is expected to grow an average
of 15 to 25 percent in the coming years, according to the
Interactive Digital Software Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a key driver for Hasbro in the next couple of
years,'' said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by sales of its popular chattering Furby and the
Teletubbies, Hasbro reported a 77 percent jump in first-quarter
earnings, to $13.8 million, up from $7.8 million for the year-ago
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Hasbro Interactive made three strategic
acquisitions, making it a player in the top-selling action and
strategy game segments.
</P>
<P>
   The Atari brand of video games, purchased from JTS Corp., gave
Hasbro Interactive top titles such as Centipede, Missile Command,
and Pong. It also bought MicroProse Inc. and Avalon Hill Inc., two
small, cutting edge makers of strategy and action games, and it
entered into a strategic partnership with SmartGames, a Salem game
company that specializes in puzzles and other brainteasers.
</P>
<P>
   These moves have allowed Hasbro Interactive to focus more on
research, development, and distribution, and boost its overall
product portfolio. The CD-ROM version of Monopoly, among the first
titles it released, has sold over 1 million units. Frogger, a
souped-up version of the old Atari arcade game, has become one of
the top-selling action titles. In all, the company now markets 85
titles, which range in price from $14.99 to $39.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a virtual publisher until we made those acquisitions.
But now we have four studios and 12 development teams,'' Dusenberry
said. ``We can now control our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly headquarters handles marketing, sales, distribution,
game design, quality control, and financial and manufacturing
services. A third-party manufacturer in North Carolina ships the
finished products to Beverly for testing.
</P>
<P>
   New licensing agreements will bring Em(at)il NFL Football and a
line of NASCAR racing-themed games, and a new line of kids'
computer and video games based on Nickelodeon's popular CatDog and
Nicktoons.

SAUCONY FINDS SHOE THAT FITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early spring of last year, when the world was still awash
in excess inventory of Nike sneakers, John Fisher placed his faith
in 1981 technology to get sales moving again at Saucony Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Peabody, Mass., company, which was still known as Hyde
Athletic Industries Inc. at that time, tried to make the tricky
leap from performance shoes to fashion statements and latched on to
a powerful ``retro'' trend that has propelled Saucony stock.
</P>
<P>
   Saucony shares have more than tripled since February to 16 1/2
and peaked last week at 18 3/4. The stock had been stuck in a
narrow price band of 4 to 6 per share for nearly five years before
the move. The catalyst: first quarter earnings that more than
tripled and a powerful sales growth trend still in full force.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about sneaker companies playing the fickle
and sometimes dangerous market for hot shoe fashions, but Saucony
seemed like the last company you would expect to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Saucony reintroduced its Jazz running shoes, which helped build
the company's reputation for high-performance products when they
first hit the market 18 years ago. The original Jazz can't compete
with today's running shoes on technology, but they are still
comfortable and fit well. Priced in the $40 to $60 range, they were
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started to kick in over the last nine months, but it didn't
really become apparent before the last six months,'' said analyst
Jennifer Black of Black &AMP; Co., who initiated coverage of Saucony
with a ``buy'' rating in May.
</P>
<P>
   A company that was accustomed to placing ads in Runner's World
started to showcase its Jazz Originals in magazines like Spin, Vibe
and XXL.
</P>
<P>
   How different is this world from Saucony's traditional clinetele
of serious jocks? The line got perhaps its biggest boost when it
was featured as part of a fashion forecast in an issue of Teen
People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher, the chief executive at Saucony, won't say he's in
the fashion business. He's reluctant to even use the word. ``Style
driven is the term we use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good reason for his reticence. Shoe fashions can
change on a dime. The retro trend favoring a return to oldies,
which Fisher ascribes to products from the Volkswagen Beetle to Gap
kakhis, may be in style today but surely not indefinitely.
Athletic-shoe companies lime Reebok International Ltd. that make a
fortune in fashion typically fall hard when they go out of style
and choke on inventories of footware no one wants to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to this type of selling is to be on board, not
overboard,'' said Fisher. ``If you trace some of the problems of
the top-tier (athletic-shoe) vendors, you'll find inventory glut
became a real stumbling block. We're not large enough to sustain
the kinds of hits inventory glut can cause and we want to learn
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Saucony assembles and manufactures most of its shoes at a
factory in Bangor, Maine, and is making Jazz Originals in volume
only to match orders. Fisher is making the shoes relatively scarce
to limit inventory and maintain the allure of the brand, which now
comes in many variations. ``We are taking essentially a zero
inventory position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saucony's other business lines, which include shoes for running
and walking, high-end bicycles and sportsware, are doing just fine.
But Fisher said 44 percent of all the company's year-to-year sales
growth and most of the company's backorders are for Jazz Originals.
</P>
<P>
   All that begs the question, what's in it for investors who buy
Saucony shares now? Even if the company completely escapes the
fashion inventory trap, the engine behind its growth can't last
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Among other problems: liquidity in Saucony stock is terrible.
The company only has 6.3 million shares outstanding and trades just
20,000 on a typical day. Fisher owns about 22 percent of the stock
and his brother-in-law, chief operating officer Charles Gottesman,
holds another 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher agrees liquidity of Saucony stock is an issue for
investors. As for sales growth, he insists there is plenty of
opportunity for more ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz Originals are still spreading across the country and
international sales are virtually untapped. More importantly, the
Jazz success has created visibility for Saucony that it never had
before.
</P>
<P>
   Saucony shoes, which had been in about 200 Foot Locker stores,
are sold in about 1400 stores today, according to Fisher. Its shoes
are available in 900 Lady Foot Lockers, up from 600 historically.
</P>
<P>
   Even if fashions change, the broader exposure to Saucony's brand
will boost sales well into the future, Fisher thinks. ``It will
raise the brand, in the worst case, far beyond what it was when we
started,'' he said. ``We think there's a lot of mileage in front of
us.''

POLL SHOWS GORE TRAILING BUSH, DOLE IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Long before the attack ads, televised debates
and campaign rallies, California voters lean toward Republicans
George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole as their choice over Democratic
Vice President Al Gore, according to a poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows Bush and Dole with solid support among female
voters in head-to-head matchups with Gore, providing the chance for
Republicans to overcome the so-called gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a window of opportunity ... to close the gender gap
and get women voters,'' said Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville,
Md., which conducted the poll for the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, and Dole, the former president of
the American Red Cross, still face a formidable challenge in
balancing their moderate images to sustain the support of women
voters while at the same time satisfying conservatives who dominate
the party nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that if the election were held now, Bush would
lead Gore 49 percent to 44 percent, with 7 percent undecided. Dole,
pitted against Gore, was favored by 48 percent of those surveyed to
46 percent for the vice president _ a statistical dead heat _ with
6 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bush-Gore contest, women voters favored the vice
president 46 percent to 45 percent with 9 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   When Dole was matched against Gore, she was chosen by 51 percent
of the women to 43 percent for Gore with 6 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll comes more than nine months before the California
presidential primary and well before the general election, a point
Gore's spokesman was quick to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are like 17 months away from the general election,'' said
Roger Salazar, Gore's campaign spokesman. ``Many people have not
had an opportunity to focus on the candidates, what they stand for
and what they're all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very confident that as we get the vice president out
there to talk about his issues, and his ideas for the American
people and where he wants to take them, people will respond in a
very positive way,'' Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has visited California more than 50 times since he and
President Clinton won election to their first term in 1992, will
again visit the state as part of a national campaign swing after he
formally launches his candidacy for president on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 810 Californians who vote regularly in statewide
elections was conducted May 27 to 29. It has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-two percent of those surveyed said Clinton was doing an
excellent or good job, the same number as an Examiner poll in
September 1998 at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-three percent opposed Clinton's handling of the war in
Kosovo, while 41 percent approved of his actions, and 6 percent
were not sure.
</P>
<P>
   The poll focused on the 2000 presidential campaign in which
California, for the first time in the modern era of presidential
primaries, will play a significant role in deciding the party's
nominees. Most of delegates will be won in March 2000 when big
states _ led March 7 by California, New York, Massachusetts and
Ohio _ have scheduled their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Among 373 Democratic voters surveyed by Research 2000 about
their party's nominating campaign, Gore topped his chief Democratic
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, 54 percent to 33
percent with 13 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Among 300 Republican voters asked their choice in the
11-candidate GOP field, Bush won 31 percent. Dole was next with 16
percent, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona tallied 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates received single-digit support with 11
percent of the Republican voters undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the popular two-term governor and son of former President
George Bush, is relatively unknown in California. He intends to
make his first full-blown campaign swing here at the end of the
month.

SANTA BARBARA DUO GIVE FILM SCHOOL NEW REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Corrects reference to California Institute of the Arts in 3rd
graf)  
By BOB MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ``Shadow'' knows, and so does Daniel Kutner.
</P>
<P>
   Working around the clock for nearly six months, the senior at
the University of California, Santa Barbara, got an education in
the rigors of filmmaking. With the surf and the Isla Vista party
scene raging around them, he and film-studies partner Brian Emerson
rarely left the house as they made ``Shadow of a Drought,'' their
animated student production that marked a breakthrough for UCSB's
academically oriented film school.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that talent knows no bounds, Kutner and Emerson will
take home UCSB's first-ever Student Academy Award this month when
they receive their medallion for ``Shadow,'' which is in
competition with animated entries from New York University and
California Institute of the Arts near Los Angeles. Entries from
UCSB _ which offers only two animation classes _ had been nominated
before but never reached the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a school where, if you're willing to kill yourself
making a film, you can make one,'' says Kutner, who served as the
co-writer and producer for ``Shadow.'' Co-writer Emerson also
handled the directing duties on their production, which employed
three types of animation: computer-generated imagery, cel and bond,
and clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no social life for months. We left the houses only to
get dinner,'' adds Kutner, who hails from La Jolla. Emerson is from
West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of ``Shadow'' follows the disappearance of
cinema's most beloved actor, who vanishes from the set of the
motion picture ``Drought.'' A tabloid reporter goes in search of
the star and, through his interviews, strings together a history of
animation and its destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The production was a combined effort of the film studies
department, engineering and computer engineering sectors on campus.
Engineering students designed and built the film's claymation set,
and computer engineering students served as on-call troubleshooters
for the production team. Cel painters for ``Shadow'' were just
anybody who would volunteer some time.
</P>
<P>
   UCSB was also a national finalist in the documentary category.
``Portraits'' by Ivan Oyco and Jesse Baldwin brought an added
measure of acclaim to the campus known more for its surf and party
atmosphere than rigorous academic standards. For Kutner, beating
the odds and more prestigious universities with their better
equipment and famous alumni only reinforces his belief about the
essence of moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter because in the end, it's how well you tell
the story.'' &QL;

GUIDE TO WHO'S A BOUNCIN' BABY BOOMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I was born in 1966, and a co-worker said that I'm a baby
boomer. What years are covered by the baby boom?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.K., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The dates vary in different news reports, but here's how they
often break down:
</P>
<P>
   The ``baby boom'' occurred from 1946 to 1964, adding 76.8
million children to the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X was born between 1965 and 1978. There were 52.4
million babies born during those years, which are sometimes called
the ``baby bust'' because of a declining birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Generation Y arrived in 1979 and extends to the present. With
77.6 million children born as of last year, Gen Y-ers now outnumber
baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to Marvel Comics after it declared bankruptcy?
Is the company still in business?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.N., Denton, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The comic-book publisher was reorganized in 1998 as part of a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy case and is now a subsidiary of Marvel
Enterprises, formerly known as Toy Biz.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed for bankruptcy in December 1996 because of
losses and an inability to repay debt incurred by the acquisition
of the trading-card companies Fleer and SkyBox International.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which trades as MVL on the New York Stock Exchange,
had $232 million in sales in 1998 and 1,600 employees.
</P>
<P>
   More information is available from the company's Web site at
www.marvel.com/biz.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to George Lucas?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the filmmaker in care of Industrial Light and Magic,
Box 2459, San Rafael, CA 94912.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who turned 55 a few days before ``The Phantom Menace''
opened, is working on the script for the sequel, which has an
estimated budget of $100 million and a scheduled release date of
June 2002.
</P>
<P>
   After financing the $112 million ``Phantom Menace'' by himself,
Lucas could earn as much as $1 billion from the movie: $700 million
from the box office and $300 million from merchandising.

   ``Can God Be Trusted?''
</P>
<P>
   By John G. Stackhouse Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press, $25
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   You're almost afraid to ask, but ... almost five decades after
C.S. Lewis' ``Mere Christianity,'' has John G. Stackhouse Jr.
written this generation's successor to that classic work of
religious sensibility?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbing effects of ``a never-ending stream of
tragedy, disaster, selfishness, and absurdity,'' the Canadian
scholar writes in ``Can God Be Trusted?,'' ``every once in a while
a story grips us, we sit up straight, and the old questions return:
`How could this happen? What kind of a world is this?' And we might
ask one of the oldest questions of all, `How could a good and
almighty God possibly allow such evil to occur?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse does not have an unassailable answer to that
question, which is one of his central points. But after making some
valid suggestions, he goes on to argue that Christianity depicts a
God who can be trusted nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse's work is marked by the same kind of commonsensical
yet penetrating arguments that made Lewis such a beloved figure.
Readers of ``Can God Be Trusted?'' may find that they have
discovered something wonderful.

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ On Sunday, they came at dawn, the smoke rising above
the Belgrade suburbs in a grey blanket, the thump of bombs broken
by the bells of the early 19th-century Church of the Communion and
the scream of starlings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, they arrived just after dusk to bomb the
Bezanijska Kosa power station and plunge us all into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   So when Ljubo Ososlija turned up for coffee at my hotel Tuesday
morning with wounds to his legs and feet, he had a bone to pick
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just walking with a neighbor and we were 200 meters (650
feet) from the power station when we saw the first missile,'' he
said, sipping Turkish coffee because the hotel has run out of
espresso. ``The second one got me. It blew me five feet into the
air and almost broke my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Ososlija is a publisher who is currently signing up volunteers
to pay for new volumes of best-selling fiction and children's
stories: all profits go for the purchase of cigarettes for soldiers
at the war front. NATO, of course, bombed the tobacco factories
more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ososlija, I hadn't taken a shower Tuesday morning. The
power cuts have severed the water supply again. My taps roar at me
like a sick lion and the red plastic bucket on my balcony collects
an inch of grey rainwater from Belgrade's polluted skies;
definitely not for brushing my teeth, maybe _ just _ enough to
flush the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   No power, no water, no cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels and London and Paris, you might be forgiven for
believing that NATO's wishful thinking represents reality; that
Serbia is on its knees, that its people are on the verge of
insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But returning to Belgrade after a month away is a weird
experience. The mood is harder, more cynical, more resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The moment I walked into the candlelit office of ``The
Independent's'' Belgrade travel agent, I was met with fury. ``This
is not a war like you people claim,'' he shouted. ``It's an attack.
If I was ordered to go down to Kosovo now, I would go at once and
fight there. Here I sit and wait and can do nothing. We cannot
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't understand the mentality of the Serbs. We are
stubborn. At the beginning of this, I might have given up. But now,
I will never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   I heard much the same from the icon-seller on the end of Knez
Mihailova street. A bearded refugee from Krajina _ site of the most
unreported ``ethnic cleansing'' in the Balkans, presumably because
the Serbs had the cleansing done to them rather than the other way
around _ he offered me a black Angel Gabriel painted on the back of
a broken wooden floorboard. He only wanted 65 pence.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO told the Hague tribunal to charge Milosevic and I know
what that means,'' he said, leaning against his wall opposite the
Tsar Cafe. ``NATO is burning Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans won't be able to negotiate with someone they
call a war criminal. So they don't want to talk. They don't want
Chernomyrdin to succeed. So the war will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a new joke making the rounds _ even Goren Martic, a
Yugoslav government minister was passing it on Tuesday _ based on
the premise that NATO will always sabotage peace hopes when the
Russians try to negotiate: ``Watch out!'' the joke goes,
``Chernomyrdin's coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   And it sometimes feels like that. Every night, the jets go for
Rakovica where, so the rumors have it, the Yugoslav military
hierarchy work from a bunker deep beneath the airfield runways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to destroy the bunker but they don't know
exactly where it is,'' a Serb friend says. ``It was built after the
breakup of the old Yugoslavia _ the Bosnians and the Croats who
were in the Yugoslav army don't know its location so can't give it
to the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real bunker lies, I suspect, within every Serb. Not so
much the stubbornness that my travel agent talked about. Certainly
not any maniacal loyalty to President Slobodan Milosevic. More a
refusal to lie down, an absolute unwillingness to accept the
demands of foreign powers, right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Serbs are not being told of the terrors visited upon
the Albanians of Kosovo. Only opposition news agencies report an
anti-war rally banned in Cacak and the sentencing of three military
conscripts to almost five years' imprisonment for failing to return
to their units.
</P>
<P>
   But even the chairman of the Cacak municipal assembly is now
saying that his protest was of ``a civil and patriotic character,''
one which shared every Serb's abhorrence of ``NATO aggression.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   I've come across only one man who has been truly broken by the
bombings. I saw him last a month ago, weeping in the arms of his
neighbors and promising to commit suicide because he had survived
the NATO bomb which killed his wife, son, daughter-in-law and all
his grandchildren in Surdulica.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the town on Monday _ after NATO had killed another 18
innocents when it scored a direct hit on the local hospital _ I
asked a friend of Vojeslav Milic if he had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The man shook his head. ```Voja' is very bad,'' he said. ``He
has a big poster of photographs of all the members of his family
who died _ and now he goes around town and sticks their pictures to
the windshields of parked cars. We try to keep him sedated. You
see, in the past two weeks he has tried to kill himself twice.''

<P>
   BELGRADE _ On Sunday, they came at dawn, the smoke rising above
the Belgrade suburbs in a grey blanket, the thump of bombs broken
by the bells of the early 19th-century Church of the Communion and
the scream of starlings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, they arrived just after dusk to bomb the
Bezanijska Kosa power station and plunge us all into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   So when Ljubo Ososlija turned up for coffee at my hotel Tuesday
morning with wounds to his legs and feet, he had a bone to pick
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just walking with a neighbor and we were 200 meters (650
feet) from the power station when we saw the first missile,'' he
said, sipping Turkish coffee because the hotel has run out of
espresso. ``The second one got me. It blew me five feet into the
air and almost broke my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Ososlija is a publisher who is currently signing up volunteers
to pay for new volumes of best-selling fiction and children's
stories: all profits go for the purchase of cigarettes for soldiers
at the war front. NATO, of course, bombed the tobacco factories
more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ososlija, I hadn't taken a shower Tuesday morning. The
power cuts have severed the water supply again. My taps roar at me
like a sick lion and the red plastic bucket on my balcony collects
an inch of grey rainwater from Belgrade's polluted skies;
definitely not for brushing my teeth, maybe _ just _ enough to
flush the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   No power, no water, no cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels and London and Paris, you might be forgiven for
believing that NATO's wishful thinking represents reality; that
Serbia is on its knees, that its people are on the verge of
insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   But returning to Belgrade after a month away is a weird
experience. The mood is harder, more cynical, more resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The moment I walked into the candlelit office of ``The
Independent's'' Belgrade travel agent, I was met with fury. ``This
is not a war like you people claim,'' he shouted. ``It's an attack.
If I was ordered to go down to Kosovo now, I would go at once and
fight there. Here I sit and wait and can do nothing. We cannot
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't understand the mentality of the Serbs. We are
stubborn. At the beginning of this, I might have given up. But now,
I will never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   I heard much the same from the icon-seller on the end of Knez
Mihailova street. A bearded refugee from Krajina _ site of the most
unreported ``ethnic cleansing'' in the Balkans, presumably because
the Serbs had the cleansing done to them rather than the other way
around _ he offered me a black Angel Gabriel painted on the back of
a broken wooden floorboard. He only wanted 65 pence.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO told the Hague tribunal to charge Milosevic and I know
what that means,'' he said, leaning against his wall opposite the
Tsar Cafe. ``NATO is burning Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans won't be able to negotiate with someone they
call a war criminal. So they don't want to talk. They don't want
Chernomyrdin to succeed. So the war will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a new joke making the rounds _ even Goren Martic, a
Yugoslav government minister was passing it on Tuesday _ based on
the premise that NATO will always sabotage peace hopes when the
Russians try to negotiate: ``Watch out!'' the joke goes,
``Chernomyrdin's coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   And it sometimes feels like that. Every night, the jets go for
Rakovica where, so the rumors have it, the Yugoslav military
hierarchy work from a bunker deep beneath the airfield runways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to destroy the bunker but they don't know
exactly where it is,'' a Serb friend says. ``It was built after the
breakup of the old Yugoslavia _ the Bosnians and the Croats who
were in the Yugoslav army don't know its location so can't give it
to the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real bunker lies, I suspect, within every Serb. Not so
much the stubbornness that my travel agent talked about. Certainly
not any maniacal loyalty to President Slobodan Milosevic. More a
refusal to lie down, an absolute unwillingness to accept the
demands of foreign powers, right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Serbs are not being told of the terrors visited upon
the Albanians of Kosovo. Only opposition news agencies report an
anti-war rally banned in Cacak and the sentencing of three military
conscripts to almost five years' imprisonment for failing to return
to their units.
</P>
<P>
   But even the chairman of the Cacak municipal assembly is now
saying that his protest was of ``a civil and patriotic character,''
one which shared every Serb's abhorrence of ``NATO aggression.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 800. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   I've come across only one man who has been truly broken by the
bombings. I saw him last a month ago, weeping in the arms of his
neighbors and promising to commit suicide because he had survived
the NATO bomb which killed his wife, son, daughter-in-law and all
his grandchildren in Surdulica.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the town on Monday _ after NATO had killed another 18
innocents when it scored a direct hit on the local hospital _ I
asked a friend of Vojeslav Milic if he had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The man shook his head. ```Voja' is very bad,'' he said. ``He
has a big poster of photographs of all the members of his family
who died _ and now he goes around town and sticks their pictures to
the windshields of parked cars. We try to keep him sedated. You
see, in the past two weeks he has tried to kill himself twice.''

   BELGRADE _ On the banner of Serbia, it is written: ``Only Unity
Saves the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic will be quick to take
advantage of the disunity of the outside world as his visitors
present him with a peace plan whose authors were denying some of
its contents the moment the envoys set off for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The disunity was as preposterous as it was potentially tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Even as European Union and Russian envoys were flying to
Belgrade to present it to Milosevic, NATO and Russia fell out over
their latest Kosovo ``peace plan'' Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Russian Balkan envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, an
international peace force could be sent to Kosovo composed of
Russian and NATO troops under separate commands _ a plan that
looked suspiciously like the partition of Kosovo; but in less than
an hour, both NATO and the U.S. State Department spokesmen were
insisting that a peacekeeping force must be under NATO's sole
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The EU's envoy, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari who also flew
to Belgrade Wednesday night, was facing the monumental task of
explaining these hopelessly different versions of the
U.S.-Russian-EU proposals to Milosevic _ a task made more difficult
because they were supposed to be a concrete and united plan that
the Serbian leader would be forced to accept if NATO's bombardment
of Yugoslavia was to end.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's demands for a return of all Albanian Kosovo refugees to
their homes, the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and the
presence of an international force in the province, are all
familiar to the Serb leader. But he has always insisted that NATO
would not be allowed to lead such an army.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's remarks will have found favor with Milosevic _
which is one reason why both Jamie Shea, NATO's spokesman, and
James Rubin, the U.S. State Department's spokesman, were so quick
to deny what he said. A peace force, Rubin insisted, must be under
NATO control, whatever the degree of Russian participation.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Rubin who stated on Tuesday that Ahtisaari has ``all
the detail that he needs so that when the Belgrade authorities ask
the question `what is the precise timetable, exactly what will the
force be composed of, how will it be verified?' he (Ahtisaari)
believes he's got sufficient answers.'' Clearly, this was not the
case Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Serbs have suspected that the West intends to divide
Kosovo, to give the south to the Albanians and leave the north for
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Serb nationalists have produced copies of Second World War maps
which show Kosovo divided between its German and Italian occupiers
and suggested that the world now has similar plans to divide the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   But few Albanians would trust Russian troops under non-NATO
command to guarantee their safety from Russia's Serb allies. And
NATO's insistence that all of the Albanian refugees must return to
their homes in Kosovo suggests that Chernomyrdin's ideas of a
separate Russian force will never be approved by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The Chernomyrdin-Ahtisaari proposals _ which are supposed to be
the joint work of Moscow, Washington and the EU _ are supposed to
form the basis of a U.N. Security Council resolution mandating the
international force.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government has long accepted the idea of a U.N.
resolution but has refused to accept such an international
peacekeeping army with NATO ``at its core.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and EU envoys were therefore arriving in Belgrade
Wednesday night divided over the one issue which Milosevic refuses
to concede. An imminent end to the latest Balkan war, therefore,
seemed less likely, even after 71 days of air bombardment by the 19
nations of NATO against a country of 10 million people. &QL;

<P>
   SURDULICA, CENTRAL SERBIA _ Not far from Milena Malobabic's
young body, we found the notebook of love poems she wrote for her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's jets had killed her and at least 18 other patients in the
tuberculosis sanatorium just a few hours earlier and Milena's body
lay in the shade of a pine tree, her long black hair drifting over
her face in the breeze, a silver earring still sparkling in her
left ear.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy here to report that the deaths of Milena and
her mother and two brothers and the other 14 patients we found dead
_ not to mention the three elderly people whose shredded remains I
also discovered in the sandwiched concrete of the sanatorium _ is
an atrocity. And it would be true.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombs destroyed a hospital Monday and they called it _
heaven spare us again _ ``collateral damage.'' But Milena's death
alone constitutes a unique tragedy of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you only knew how much I suffer now,'' she had written in
her first poem in the notebook in childish Biro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's wrong, but I want to go back to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Milena still loves you, but I feel my wounds so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can still kiss you.''
</P>
<P>
   The poem had been written at least two months ago and across the
side of one page, Milena had inscribed the words _ in capital
letters and in English _ ``I LOVE YOU DEJANE!''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb woman who translated Milena's poem to me broke down in
tears. No going back to Dejane now. The wounds are too many.
Suffering is best not spoken of.
</P>
<P>
   Beside Milena's body was her mother _ both feet torn off but
placed gently beside her severed legs _ and Milena's two brothers,
one of them with an arm bent over his face as if still cowering
from the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-uniformed Yugoslav rescue teams covered all of them
with bloodstained sheets to protect them from the flies. They lay
only a few meters from a pile of concrete and torn clothes and old
papers. That's where we found Milena's notebook.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 patients at the Special Hospital for Lung and
Tuberculosis were also seriously wounded when the NATO bombs fell
on them just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the two-story 75-year-old hospital simply caved in on
the men and women in their beds which is where most of them died _
although one old man whose body I saw was still dressed in a pair
of old blue trousers and a torn striped shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It was an elderly people's home as well as a tuberculosis
clinic. It was a hospital, set in a pine forest, marked on every
map.
</P>
<P>
   Branislav Ristic, the commander of the local civil defense unit,
had been among the first to reach the scene of horror. ``When I got
here,'' he said, ``there was fire and smoke in all the trees and
people screaming in the darkness and terribly wounded people trying
to crawl out of broken windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was screaming for help. But because this city is
bombed every six hours or so, we had a problem at first to get
enough people to help.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, he said, no military target in the area. So I took a
little walk up into the pine forest, joined hurriedly by none other
than Ristic. ``There is nothing, you see, no military target,
nothing,'' he said as we walked between towering stinging nettles,
the trees alive with bird song.
</P>
<P>
   But in a small glade perhaps half a kilometer from the hospital,
I found the remains of two camp fires _ the ash was still warm in
my hands _ and four ``foxholes'' - the kind of rectangular pits
that soldiers dig to protect themselves from bombs. Down another
track were another 12 ``foxholes,'' all newly dug.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital staff were worried about the bombs, Ristic said. They
probably built them. The unwounded patients had sat by the fires
after they were evacuated from the bombed building.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what is called a likely story. Had there been some
military vehicle here, a missile launcher perhaps? Not so, insisted
the Yugoslav authorities when I raised with them such a heretical
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   However there was, they said, a radio repeater station a
kilometer away, which was a regular NATO target. Perhaps defense
personnel for the station had been camped here, I was told. ``Maybe
engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it most certainly was not the barracks or munitions depot
which NATO claimed it was targeting Monday. There was no barracks
here.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the old problem of reporting civilian deaths in the
Yugoslav war.
</P>
<P>
   To find the slightest, most minimal reason why a hospital might
be bombed is to transfer the guilt of the slaughter to the
Yugoslavs and thus to say that Yugoslavia killed its own people
even when they are torn to pieces by NATO bombs. And any Yugoslav
who hears such a remark regards it, not unnaturally, as an
obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva Conventions _ so assiduously produced by NATO in the wake
of war crimes against Albanians in Kosovo _ state quite
specifically that civilians must be protected even if they are in
the vicinity of military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the patients at Surdulica were not given that protection.
Nor were the other 450 dead (more than half of them Albanian) in
NATO's other 16 ``mistakes'' during this Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partisans were treated here during the Second World War
and the Germans knew they were here but never touched them,''
Ristic said as we walked back beneath the pine stands, filtered
sunlight blessing the smashed concrete and glass and the patients''
clothes which had been blasted high into the branches of a silver
birch tree.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that they took the bodies of Milena and her family
off the grass and loaded them onto an orange-painted dump truck for
their journey to the local morgue. &QL;

<P>
   SURDULICA, CENTRAL SERBIA _ Not far from Milena Malobabic's
young body, we found the notebook of love poems she wrote for her
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's jets had killed her and at least 18 other patients in the
tuberculosis sanatorium just a few hours earlier and Milena's body
lay in the shade of a pine tree, her long black hair drifting over
her face in the breeze, a silver earring still sparkling in her
left ear.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy here to report that the deaths of Milena and
her mother and two brothers and the other 14 patients we found dead
_ not to mention the three elderly people whose shredded remains I
also discovered in the sandwiched concrete of the sanatorium _ is
an atrocity. And it would be true.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombs destroyed a hospital Monday and they called it _
heaven spare us again _ ``collateral damage.'' But Milena's death
alone constitutes a unique tragedy of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you only knew how much I suffer now,'' she had written in
her first poem in the notebook in childish Biro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's wrong, but I want to go back to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Milena still loves you, but I feel my wounds so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can still kiss you.''
</P>
<P>
   The poem had been written at least two months ago and across the
side of one page, Milena had inscribed the words _ in capital
letters and in English _ ``I LOVE YOU DEJANE!''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb woman who translated Milena's poem to me broke down in
tears. No going back to Dejane now. The wounds are too many.
Suffering is best not spoken of.
</P>
<P>
   Beside Milena's body was her mother _ both feet torn off but
placed gently beside her severed legs _ and Milena's two brothers,
one of them with an arm bent over his face as if still cowering
from the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-uniformed Yugoslav rescue teams covered all of them
with bloodstained sheets to protect them from the flies. They lay
only a few meters from a pile of concrete and torn clothes and old
papers. That's where we found Milena's notebook.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 patients at the Special Hospital for Lung and
Tuberculosis were also seriously wounded when the NATO bombs fell
on them just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the two-story 75-year-old hospital simply caved in on
the men and women in their beds which is where most of them died _
although one old man whose body I saw was still dressed in a pair
of old blue trousers and a torn striped shirt.
</P>
<P>
   It was an elderly people's home as well as a tuberculosis
clinic. It was a hospital, set in a pine forest, marked on every
map.
</P>
<P>
   Branislav Ristic, the commander of the local civil defense unit,
had been among the first to reach the scene of horror. ``When I got
here,'' he said, ``there was fire and smoke in all the trees and
people screaming in the darkness and terribly wounded people trying
to crawl out of broken windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was screaming for help. But because this city is
bombed every six hours or so, we had a problem at first to get
enough people to help.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, he said, no military target in the area. So I took a
little walk up into the pine forest, joined hurriedly by none other
than Ristic. ``There is nothing, you see, no military target,
nothing,'' he said as we walked between towering stinging nettles,
the trees alive with bird song.
</P>
<P>
   But in a small glade perhaps half a kilometer from the hospital,
I found the remains of two camp fires _ the ash was still warm in
my hands _ and four ``foxholes'' - the kind of rectangular pits
that soldiers dig to protect themselves from bombs. Down another
track were another 12 ``foxholes,'' all newly dug.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital staff were worried about the bombs, Ristic said. They
probably built them. The unwounded patients had sat by the fires
after they were evacuated from the bombed building.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what is called a likely story. Had there been some
military vehicle here, a missile launcher perhaps? Not so, insisted
the Yugoslav authorities when I raised with them such a heretical
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   However there was, they said, a radio repeater station a
kilometer away, which was a regular NATO target. Perhaps defense
personnel for the station had been camped here, I was told. ``Maybe
engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it most certainly was not the barracks or munitions depot
which NATO claimed it was targeting Monday. There was no barracks
here.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the old problem of reporting civilian deaths in the
Yugoslav war.
</P>
<P>
   To find the slightest, most minimal reason why a hospital might
be bombed is to transfer the guilt of the slaughter to the
Yugoslavs and thus to say that Yugoslavia killed its own people
even when they are torn to pieces by NATO bombs. And any Yugoslav
who hears such a remark regards it, not unnaturally, as an
obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva Conventions _ so assiduously produced by NATO in the wake
of war crimes against Albanians in Kosovo _ state quite
specifically that civilians must be protected even if they are in
the vicinity of military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the patients at Surdulica were not given that protection.
Nor were the other 450 dead (more than half of them Albanian) in
NATO's other 16 ``mistakes'' during this Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partisans were treated here during the Second World War
and the Germans knew they were here but never touched them,''
Ristic said as we walked back beneath the pine stands, filtered
sunlight blessing the smashed concrete and glass and the patients''
clothes which had been blasted high into the branches of a silver
birch tree.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that they took the bodies of Milena and her family
off the grass and loaded them onto an orange-painted dump truck for
their journey to the local morgue. &QL;

 And CHARLES ARTHUR  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   American doctors are preparing to ban blood donations from
people who have visited Britain for as little as six months, to
guard against the spread of the human form of ``mad cow disease,''
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
   The decision to stop the donations has already been made by
experts advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who
are now considering what criteria to use.
</P>
<P>
   They were expected to exclude only long-term visitors to Britain
who would have been here during the 1980s, when many BSE-infected
cattle were used for food.
</P>
<P>
   Their fears are that visitors to Britain may have absorbed the
BSE agent through eating contaminated food, and could then pass on
``new variant'' Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (v-CJD) by donating their
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, scores of people could be infected by a single
donation if it is pooled with others. Because there is no way to
detect the BSE or v-CJD agent, thought to be a single protein,
conventional blood tests and filtering are useless.
</P>
<P>
   BSE has not been a big issue in the U.S.: no cases of BSE have
been officially recorded, nor any cases of v-CJD. But scare
stories, and growing publicity such as that by the talk-show host
Oprah Winfrey on the beef industry's practices, have pushed it up
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities now clearly want to head off any crisis of
confidence in blood supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Ending blood transfusions from people who have been to the UK
for six months or more would cut the U.S. blood supply by about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the FDA banned the use of blood products from people
with ``sporadic'' CJD _ the form of the disease with no known
cause, which usually affects people over 60.
</P>
<P>
   But all forms of CJD apparently have a long incubation period in
which the victim shows no symptoms: this can last decades before
they show failing memory and coordination, and die within a couple
of years.
</P>
<P>
   In the UK, 40 people have so far died of v-CJD. The Department
of Health said Tuesday night: ``In this country we use
leucodepletion, which removes the white blood cells, as a
precautionary measure against this theoretical risk. The U.S.'s
measures are up to their regulatory authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman emphasized that the risk remains theoretical, with
no recorded cases of any form of the disease being passed by blood
products.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night evidence was presented to the FDA's Transmissible
Spongiform Encephalopathies Advisory Committee about blood donors
who have lived in Britain for various periods, to assess the risk.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the U.S. Veterans' Affairs Department found that no
one seems to have caught CJD from infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   Abid Rahman, an epidemiologist with the Department of Veterans'
Affairs Office of Public Health, said it appears there is only a
``small, theoretical risk'' of getting it that way. ``It at least
gives us some evidentiary basis for no transmission through blood
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Blood Services has already decided to refuse blood
donations from people who have visited the UK, and has asked an
expert committee to decide on the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the close historical ties between Canada and Britain,
the decision could have a much more serious effect on Canadian
blood supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to defer donors has essentially been made,''
Graham Sher, vice-president of the blood services division, said
last week. ``It's a matter of what the criteria are that we will
use to determine who should be deferred.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey found that 22 percent of its donors had visited Britain
since 1980. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Is the new ``Star Wars'' movie racist?
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the hotly awaited American release of ``Episode
1: The Phantom Menace,'' otherwise die-hard fans of George Lucas's
space opera are beginning to wonder about the wholesomeness of
noseless baddies who speak in high-pitched Japanese accents, a
filthy bloated insect who sounds either Greek or Arabic, and a
computer-generated idiot alien who talks like a Caribbean
galley-slave.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, which has engaged film critics, university academics
and literally thousands of online ``Star Wars'' fans, doesn't
appear to have hurt the blockbuster film's box-office fortunes:
with more than 200 million dollars in revenue, it is by several
measures the fastest-grossing film of all time so far.
</P>
<P>
   But it could influence the filmmakers when it comes to deciding
who to keep and who to leave out of Episodes 2 and 3, which are due
for release in 2002 and 2005 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of the criticism has focused on Jar Jar Binks, member
of an underwater alien race called the Gungans, who theoretically
provides the film's comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   With a head like a sea horse, a whiplash tongue like an anteater
and bulbous frog eyes, Jar Jar comes across as the idiot of the
galaxy and utters lines like ``da force is maxi big'' in a
Caribbean patois that fans find both inane and demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet user observed: ``He is the worst character in `Star
Wars's' history, a pathetic excuse to sell toys.''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old comic-book shop assistant from Seattle has founded
an International Society for the Extermination of Jar Jar Binks and
set up a website called jarjarmustdie.com, which is lobbying hard
for his exclusion from future episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm, which produced the movie, has denied any racist
intent, but that has done nothing to dampen the furore.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ``Star Wars'' saga, George Lucas has drawn on a
wide variety of popular culture sources, particularly old Saturday
morning adventure serials.
</P>
<P>
   His noseless leaders of the Galactic Trade Federation are
clearly a throwback to the Yellow Peril characters popular in
``Flash Gordon'' and other series, but risk being interpreted as a
racial slur just as much as a fond cultural reference.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise the revolting fly Watto, a corrupt mechanic on the
planet of Tatooine, might remind film buffs of the Greek car
repairman in Robert Aldrich's ``Kiss Me Deadly,'' but also looks
uncomfortably like an eastern Mediterranean stereotype. &QL;

who to keep and who to leave out of Episodes 2 and 3, which are due
for release in 2002 and 2005 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of the criticism has focused on Jar Jar Binks, member
of an underwater alien race called the Gungans, who theoretically
provides the film's comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   With a head like a sea horse, a whiplash tongue like an anteater
and bulbous frog eyes, Jar Jar comes across as the idiot of the
galaxy and utters lines like ``da force is maxi big'' in a
Caribbean patois that fans find both inane and demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet user observed: ``He is the worst character in `Star
Wars's' history, a pathetic excuse to sell toys.''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old comic-book shop assistant from Seattle has founded
an International Society for the Extermination of Jar Jar Binks and
set up a website called jarjarmustdie.com, which is lobbying hard
for his exclusion from future episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm, which produced the movie, has denied any racist
intent, but that has done nothing to dampen the furore.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ``Star Wars'' saga, George Lucas has drawn on a
wide variety of popular culture sources, particularly old Saturday
morning adventure serials.
</P>
<P>
   His noseless leaders of the Galactic Trade Federation are
clearly a throwback to the Yellow Peril characters popular in
``Flash Gordon'' and other series, but risk being interpreted as a
racial slur just as much as a fond cultural reference.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise the revolting fly Watto, a corrupt mechanic on the
planet of Tatooine, might remind film buffs of the Greek car
repairman in Robert Aldrich's ``Kiss Me Deadly,'' but also looks
uncomfortably like an eastern Mediterranean stereotype. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three decisions by the Supreme Court in the 1990s have outlined
duties of federal judges in controlling the quality of evidence
presented to juries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Daubert vs. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., 1993. Two
California youths, including 19-year-old Jason Daubert of San
Diego, claimed pre-natal use of Merrell Dow's morning sickness
drug, Bendectin, by their mother led to their birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said that judges should act as ``gatekeepers''
and screen evidence to ensure that juries hear information that is
``not only relevant but reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ General Electric et. al. v. Joiner, 1995. Robert K. Joiner, a
longtime electrician for the Water and Light Department of
Thomasville, Ga., was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1991.
Contending that the chemicals known as PCBs inside electrical
transformers ``promoted'' his lung cancer, he sued General Electric
and Westinghouse Electric, manufacturers of the transformers, and
Monsanto Corp., maker of the PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district court declared Joiner's expert unreliable and
would not permit his testimony. The case was then thrown out of
court. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta reversed
the judge, saying he lacked authority to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court ruled that when a judge makes a decision
under his new ``gatekeeper'' responsibilities, the decision cannot
be appealed except on grounds of abuse of discretion by the judge.
The ruling made it much more difficult to force a federal judge to
allow scientific or technical evidence to a go to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 1999. Patrick Carmichael and his
family of eight were traveling to Alabama when a rear tire on their
Ford minivan blew out. The van rolled over, injuring most of the
passengers and killing the Carmichaels' 11-year-old
</P>
<P>
   daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmichaels sued Ford, which paid a settlement, and Kumho
Tire Co., the South Korean maker of the steel-belted radial,
claiming a defect caused the blowout. The company said the tire was
old and worn and should have been replaced. A federal district
judge, citing the Daubert decision, barred the testimony of a tire
tester that the Kumho tire was faulty.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Carmichael got the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta to reverse the trial judge on the grounds that
his ``gatekeeper'' authority applied only to scientific testimony,
not to experts who rely on their experience and observation. The
Supreme Court reversed the Appeals Court, saying the ``gatekeeper''
responsibility applied to all expert witnesses, not merely
scientific witnesses.

 &HT;    780&AMP;add. With EXPERTS-CASES. For release Sunday, June 6.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ University of Georgia law professor Ronald Carlson
calls them ``jukebox experts,'' court witnesses who sing the tunes
they're paid for.
</P>
<P>
   With more and more cases involving complicated scientific or
technical questions, the opinions of expert witnesses can sway
juries deciding issues involving millions of dollars in claims.
Weighing their conflicting testimony is becoming a problem for the
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Did experiments on animals place a pharmaceuticals manufacturer
on notice that a particular drug would cause birth defects in the
offspring of women who take it?
</P>
<P>
   Was the design and manufacture of a tire responsible for a fatal
car crash?
</P>
<P>
   Is the number of cases of a chronic disease among persons
exposed to a toxic chemical significantly higher than the number
occurring among persons who were not exposed?
</P>
<P>
   Expert opinion about such issues ranges from absolutely to
absolutely not. Opposing lawyers often show up with experts from
opposite extremes of scientific opinion.
</P>
<P>
   And while a case's winner looks around for the nearest bank or
shakes hands with the lawyers who just averted a hemorrhage of
cash, the loser cries ``junk science'' or ``bought science.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that the witnesses are paid to testify.
Juries find out about that shortly after the cross-examination
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in an increasingly scientific and
technological world, finding where the truth may lie between
extremes of scientific opinion is imposing an increasingly serious
burden on the court system, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much accelerated scientific development out there
that a poor judge can't be expected to keep up with these things,''
Carlson said. ``They need some way they can go to get prepped by an
expert who has no dog in a particular fight, no axe to grind.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson applauded a new project by the American Association for
the Advancement of Science to help federal judges find such
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Under a five-year demonstration project called Court Appointed
Scientific Experts, or ``CASE,'' the association, in cooperation
with the American Bar Association, will provide judges with lists
of respected and impartial scientists in specific fields.
</P>
<P>
   The project, funded by grants from the Open Society Institute
and the Leland Fikes Foundation of Dallas, will be overseen by a
committee of lawyers, federal judges and scientists. Beginning in
September, federal judges will be able to request assistance in a
particular field and receive from the CASE project a list of
experts who have been screened for conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   It would be up to the judge to decide whether to rely on the
selected expert for private advice about technical issues or to
testify before the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proper administration of justice depends on a
decision-making process that is fair and impartial and reasoned,''
said 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Pamela Ann Rymer, who
will chair the project advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges often come from liberal arts educations and generalist
legal backgrounds,'' Judge Rymer added. ``The system has typically
depended on the adversary system to educate and inform the judge.
Many of us have felt increasing need for education that goes beyond
that, both for ourselves and ultimately, for juries.''
</P>
<P>
   Although federal judges have long had the authority to appoint
independent experts, without a neutral source for such experts this
has not been feasible in most cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the Supreme Court has issued a series of opinions
that place growing responsibility on federal judges to serve as
``gatekeepers'' of expert testimony. Judges must ``scrutinize''
such testimony to make sure it is valid regardless of the
scientist's qualifications, and the right to appeal the judge's
decisions in that regard are restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some lawyers think the courts already have gone too far in
screening scientific testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, we have developed into a system that has decided that
juries cannot be trusted,'' said Barry Nace, a Washington tort
lawyer. ``How this has happened is not a great mystery. The call
for tort reform and huge sums of money spent in a public relations
campaign convinced judges that they had to 'do something' to
protect the system.''
</P>
<P>
   This happened, he said, during a time when the judicial system
has fallen more and more under control of conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nace said he was invited to participate in the ``CASE'' project
but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the courts have been busy deciding such important issues
as how to eliminate evidence, real people have been trying to get
justice,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, speaking to the
science association's annual meeting last year, said that an ``age
of science'' had imposed new demands on the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   He listed some of the scientific issues that have come before
the Supreme Court in recent years, including the potential toxicity
of some chemicals; whether medical technology's ability to reduce
pain affects a person's ``right to die;'' the validity of DNA
sampling, voice prints or experts' predictions of the ``future
dangerousness'' of an individual; the reasonableness of a
government agency's conclusions about the safety of a drug; the
risk to wildlife of a proposed dam, and the risks associated with
nuclear waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bryant of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, a public
interest law firm in Washington, agrees with Nace that ``there has
been an enormous campaign by some corporate defendants'' to keep
scientific evidence away from juries.
</P>
<P>
   He said the CASE system, if federal judges use it properly,
``could end up aiding the adversary system, rather than hindering
it.''

 &HT;    'FAITH IS THE CENTER OF MY LIFE,' GORE SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Saturday, June 5.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is usually thought of as a
politician who understands science and technology, so it is
surprising to see a Bible-quoting Gore running for president by
talking about his ``personal faith tradition'' and enlisting
``faith-based organizations'' to help government tackle social
ills.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, a former divinity student, told a small group of
reporters at the White House last week (May 29) that his religious
ideals and government service have never been separate in his mind,
and that he frequently consults the Bible in order to better
understand current events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the Earth circle the sun and still believe in
God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a holist. He believes that dividing the world into
different categories _ fact and value, science and religion, art
and morals _ misses the most important point, that the world is a
living, integrated whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific revolution has given us, as a civilization,
previously unimaginable power to dissect each little narrow slice
of the world, `` Gore said. ``But (it) took away an appreciation
for many of the gestalts and many of the most important meanings
that are found only in the whole and not in the sum of its parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the breach between science and religion is on the
mend, he said, and science's ``contempt'' for a belief in God is
``giving way to a more tolerant blend and a more nuanced
intellectual view that, yes, maybe there is something to this idea
of faith and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith is the center of my life,'' he said in response to a
question about his personal religious beliefs. ``I don't wear it on
my sleeve. But I'm happy to respond to your question by affirming
my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think the purpose of life is to glorify God. I
turn to my faith as the bedrock of my approach to any important
question in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rare that presidential candidates speak so openly of their
personal faith, especially Democratic candidates. Jimmy Carter, a
self-described ``born-again'' Christian who won the White House in
1976, was the exception in a party that is largely agnostic in
terms of religious values _ one reason for its poor standing among
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's soulful speeches of late, as well as his new proposal
to provide government subsidies to religious groups doing social
work, have met hardly a peep of protest from Democratic activists
or political allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a change in the larger structure of philosophical
debate within which our civilization moves along that makes it
easier for people to make reference to faith-based principles that
are important to them,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Gore believes, is the profound affect the
deaths of 15 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
has had on the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the aftermath of the tragedy at Columbine, a lot of us did
a lot of soul searching,'' he said. ``And when you look hard enough

<P>
   In fact, he added, ``I not infrequently will look for scriptural

</P>
<P>
   He also frequently consults all manner of religious texts. Most

Soul,'' by Ken Wilber, who lives in Boulder, Colo. Wilber's idea is
that modern civilization is a ``flatland'' lacking depth and
meaning because it exalts the rational and the material over the
spiritual and the emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Gore inherited the faith of his father, Southern Baptist. But
growing up, he and his family alternated attending services at his
father's church and at his mother's, the Church of Christ. Then,
too, there were the daily chapel services he attended while a
student at the Episcopal-run St. Albans school in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attended a year of divinity school at Vanderbilt University
in 1971 after returning from military duty in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to intensively explore those questions I had which
seemed then _ and seem now _ to be the most important questions
about life: What is the purpose of life? What's our relationship to
the Creator? What are our spiritual obligations to one another?''
he said. ``I didn't find all the answers I thought I might, but I
found better questions. And I found a process of living out better
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's faith was tested in 1989 when his young son was struck by
an automobile and nearly died. The introspection that resulted led
to his best-selling book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' which is as
much about Gore's search for an ``inner ecology'' of faith as it is
about environmental threats to the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's recent emphasis on religion has been viewed with some
cynicism by critics. GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer
suggested it has more to do with ``the political calendar and
polls'' than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But in his book, which was published in 1992 before Bill Clinton
selected him as his running mate, Gore sounded many of the
value-laden themes now common in presidential campaigns in both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about the ``retreat into the seductive tools and
technologies of industrial civilization'' that has left people
feeling isolated and disconnected from their roots, about ``a
spiritual crisis in modern civilization that seems to be based on
an emptiness at its center and the absence of a larger spiritual
purpose, of the need for faith as ``the primary force that enables
us to choose meaning and direction and then hold to it despite all
the buffeting chaos in life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can often say the same thing in a secular framework,''
Gore said at the White House meeting. ``And I have often in the
past and still do try to say it both ways, because it's true that
some people are still uncomfortable with a faith-based
vocabulary.''

 &HT;    'FAITH IS THE CENTER OF MY LIFE,' GORE SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Saturday, June 5.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is usually thought of as a
politician who understands science and technology, so it is
surprising to see a Bible-quoting Gore running for president by
talking about his ``personal faith tradition'' and enlisting
``faith-based organizations'' to help government tackle social
ills.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, a former divinity student, told a small group of
reporters at the White House last week (May 29) that his religious
ideals and government service have never been separate in his mind,
and that he frequently consults the Bible in order to better
understand current events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the Earth circle the sun and still believe in
God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a holist. He believes that dividing the world into
different categories _ fact and value, science and religion, art
and morals _ misses the most important point, that the world is a
living, integrated whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific revolution has given us, as a civilization,
previously unimaginable power to dissect each little narrow slice
of the world, `` Gore said. ``But (it) took away an appreciation
for many of the gestalts and many of the most important meanings
that are found only in the whole and not in the sum of its parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the breach between science and religion is on the
mend, he said, and science's ``contempt'' for a belief in God is
``giving way to a more tolerant blend and a more nuanced
intellectual view that, yes, maybe there is something to this idea
of faith and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith is the center of my life,'' he said in response to a
question about his personal religious beliefs. ``I don't wear it on
my sleeve. But I'm happy to respond to your question by affirming
my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I think the purpose of life is to glorify God. I
turn to my faith as the bedrock of my approach to any important
question in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is rare that presidential candidates speak so openly of their
personal faith, especially Democratic candidates. Jimmy Carter, a
self-described ``born-again'' Christian who won the White House in
1976, was the exception in a party that is largely agnostic in

MIDWESTERN RETAILER AIMS FOR SHARE OF NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The store on the edge of New York City boasts wide aisles,
aircraft-hangar dimensions, and a mile-and-a-half of shelves loaded
with everything from clothing to designer tea kettles. In fact, the
store is so big that entrances are color-coded so shoppers can
remember where they came in.
</P>
<P>
   The store is Target, which seeks to offer the best of two retail
worlds: merchandise comparable in quality to that of a department
store, at a discounter's prices.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers seem to like the formula. In 1998, Target's sales
exceeded $23 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get good values,'' said Wayne Wexler of Queens, after
he and his wife spent $400 at a Target in New York last week.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of Caldor going out of business, Minneapolis-based
Target is preparing to invade New England. Over the next few
months, the highly successful chain plans to open its first eight
stores in the region, including stores in Danvers, Holyoke, North
Attleborough, and Taunton in late July.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, Target, a division of Dayton
Hudson Corp., could operate as many as two dozen stores in New
England within three years as it rapidly grows to 1,000 stores from
coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Tough competition helped put Caldor out of business. Will
Target's arrival mean more retail casualties as the Midwestern
giant brings its high-volume, low-margin formula to New England?
</P>
<P>
   Target likes to bill itself as ``an upscale discounter,'' notes
retail consultant Walter F. Loeb of Loeb Associates.
</P>
<P>
   That means it can compete with both discount chains and
department stores. And given its flair for fashion, some of the
smaller offprice apparel retailers could feel the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Braintree-based Bradlees Inc. insists Target is not a major
threat. Both chains compete for customers with household incomes of
about $50,000. But with the high cost of living in New England,
$50,000 doesn't go as far here as it does in some Midwestern
markets where Target has thrived, Bradlees claims.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New Englanders in the $50,000 income bracket are
far thriftier than their counterparts elsewhere, suggests Bradlees
chairman and chief executive Peter Thorner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers want jeans in the $12 to $16 category,'' he
says. ``They wouldn't buy a pair for $22.''
</P>
<P>
   In the roughly 20 locations where the two chains compete head to
head in New York and New Jersey, Bradlees's lower prices have
helped fend off the Target challenge, Thorner claims.
</P>
<P>
   According to Target, nearly half of its customers _ or
``guests'' as Target prefers to call them _ have incomes above
$50,000. About 80 percent are college educated. Target customers
tend to be younger than those who shop other discount chains.
</P>
<P>
   In the size of its big-box stores and its no-frills ambiance,
Target is somewhat similar to a Wal-Mart or a Kmart, its chief
rivals, but Target's merchandise has more of a fashion focus.
</P>
<P>
   Target will look for inspiration in a ``Pottery Barn or a Crate
&AMP; Barrel'' and then try to make something that's ``a little more
affordable,'' said Barrett LaMothe Ladd, a product manager at
Management Ventures Inc., a consulting firm in Cambridge that
follows the retail industry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the chain recently got a lot of ink after hiring
celebrity architect Michael Graves to design an exclusive line of
home products for Target. If you want a tea kettle with swell
racing lines or a toaster that some might mistake for art, Graves
is your man.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with clothing. As Target spokeswoman Carolyn
Brookter notes, what other discounter has its own New York fashion
show?
</P>
<P>
   Target's department-store heritage may account for some of its
fashion sense and sensitivity to trends, Ladd said. Target's
corporate parent also operates such Midwestern department store
chains as Dayton's, Hudson's, and Marshall Field's.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that fashion sense has persuaded some women to think of
Target as an alternative to department stores and offprice apparel
retailers when shopping for clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the country, Target takes some business away
from such department store chains as J.C. Penney and Sears,
Roebuck, and that's likely to be the case in New England as well,
says Midwest Research analyst Jeff Stinson.
</P>
<P>
   To keep prices low and profits high, Target relies heavily on
its own private-label merchandise. With its huge size, Target has
plenty of buying power to leverage vendors and back up its
marketing slogan of ``Expect more. Pay less.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Target sell? It's almost easier to list what it
doesn't sell. Among the items that can't be found at most Targets
are personal computers, heavy appliances such as washing machines,
and big furniture pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But most Targets do stock milk, bread, clothing for the whole
family, TV sets, home furnishings, patio furniture, jewelry,
cameras, toys, bikes, sporting goods, prescription drugs, and
best-selling books, movies, and music. Some even sell eyeglasses.
And in places like Iowa, Nebraska, and Utah, the chain is testing a
SuperTarget, which combines a Target with a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Even without groceries, all that merchandise means a Target
needs a huge amount of space. The first stores in New England are
expected to range in size from about 117,000 square feet to about
157,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   That means Target stores in the Northeast are more likely to be
found in the suburbs than in a big city's downtown shopping area,
where such big spaces are rare and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Target traces its roots to 1962 when its corporate parent
identified a need for a department store alternative. The idea was
to find a more convenient format than a department store, then fill
it with less expensive goods.
</P>
<P>
   Occupying a niche that seeks to combine the best of both the
department store and the discount worlds, Target has proved to be a
retail powerhouse in its native Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Now growing at the rate of 60 to 65 stores a year, the chain has
duplicated its success throughout most of the country, arriving in
the mid-Atlantic states within the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   With stores up and running in New York and New Jersey, Target is
now poised to enter New England. Analysts see no reason why Target
can't be as successful here as it has been in most other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New England's demographics and Target's customer
demographics match up very well,'' said Ladd of Management
Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   For its most recent quarter, Dayton Hudson said overall Target
revenues were up 14 percent and profits were up 23 percent _
impressive results even in a strong economy. At the end of the
quarter, Target operated 859 stores.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Target generated just under 75 percent of Dayton
Hudson's total revenue of $30.95 billion; Dayton Hudson's 1998
profits rose 24 percent to $935 million.

   TAX-SHELTERS (Washington) _ Concerned about keeping ahead of the
blizzard of tax-avoidance strategies being developed and marketed
by accountants and lawyers to corporate clients, the Clinton
administration has asked Congress for broad new powers to
discourage the use of tax shelters. In the process, the
administration has set off a sharp debate in Congress and among
accountants and tax lawyers over how big a problem there is and the
degree to which giving the IRS more power is the solution. By

`EXTREME': DAREDEVILS AND DIRECTORS DEFY DEATH! 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As pretty as a gas-station calendar, as covered with sponsors'
names and insignia as a stock car, ``Extreme'' is the latest of the
Imax films that uses the couch potato's favorite medium, the
screen, to deify those who thrill to the challenges of the great
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Everest,'' the visible heroes of ``Extreme'' risk life
and limb to ski or snowboard from peaks of remote mountains, to
ride the roaring tunnels of towering waves, and to haul themselves
up the sheer faces of forbidding rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The all but invisible heroes, led by the film's director, Jon
Long, are recording these flirtations with death from helicopters
or suspended from cables, seen only in a few outtakes among the
final credits.
</P>
<P>
   What they have achieved is mesmerizing at its best, commercial
puffery at its very least, and more a tribute to the rapturous
essence of nature than to the dozen and a half professionals who
ski, snowboard, surf, windsurf, rock climb and ice climb their way
through the film's 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The narration, with cliches about ``a place where time doesn't
exist'' and less than poetic comments from its subjects about fear
and freedom and self-reliance and pushing the self and harmony with
mountains and adrenaline, poses no threat to the oratory of
Demosthenes, Lincoln or Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   But the pristine snows and blue-green waves, the sunlight
filtered through sea, the orange sunsets, the rust-colored rock
chimneys, the enormous spread of icicles hanging from a
mountainside like the pipes of some heavenly organ provide
``Extreme'' with its true eloquence.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for vacation season, this celebration of the
adventurous and a vicarious journey to Alaska, Hawaii and Utah
provide a pleasurable excursion into escapism. &QL;

`DESERT BLUE': A LIFE-OR-DEATH PLOT, FOR DREAMS AND FOR
TEEN-AGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, a group of teen-agers growing up in a desert
town so far off the beaten track that television remains something
of a mystery might not seem like interesting company.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Desert Blue,'' the graceful literary and directorial
touch of Morgan J. Freeman turns these youngsters into individuals
rather than cinema's customary caricatures, and before long they
manage to command attention, engage emotions and generate curiosity
about what will become of them.
</P>
<P>
   In its low-key, sometimes quirky way and despite a foreseeable
conclusion, this modest film by Freeman _ not the actor but the
writer and director of ``Hurricane Streets,'' an award winner at
Sundance in 1997 _ is a life-or-death story.
</P>
<P>
   On one level it is a tale of the life or death of dreams and
ambition and of the life-or-death circumstances that envelop the
fictional desert town of Baxter, Calif., population 87, when a
tanker truck overturns while carrying the concentrated secret
formula for Empire Cola, manufactured in a forbidding plant on the
edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   Because the driver, splattered with the concentrate, soon dies,
Baxter is quarantined by the Environmental Protection Agency and
FBI. All the inhabitants, who seem mainly to be teen-agers, are
trapped there, as are a divorced professor of cultural studies
(John Heard) from San Francisco and his teen-age daughter from Los
Angeles, Skye (Kate Hudson), the star of a television show called
``Maggie's World.''
</P>
<P>
   They have come to town so the professor can see its claim to
roadside fame, a towering re-creation of an ice cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   Skye, at first standoffish and impatient to return to her milieu
of agents and auditions, eventually accepts the company of Baxter's
teen-agers, especially Blue (Brendan Sexton III), who is still
coming to terms with the death of his father six months earlier in
a mysterious fire that destroyed the town's motel.
</P>
<P>
   Blue's father, it seems, was the spirit behind the giant cone
and the dreamer who had hoped to put the old gold mining town back
on the map with a beach-and-ocean park in the desert until his
potential water supply was diverted to Empire Cola.
</P>
<P>
   So Blue still toils away in his father's sand pit of dreams,
painting canoes, while his friend Pete (Casey Affleck) dreams of
winning the coming all-terrain-vehicle race, Cale (Ethan Suplee)
dreams of becoming the sheriff's deputy, and the smoldering Ely
(Christina Ricci), the sheriff's daughter, dreams of blowing up the
whole place with her handy supply of know-how and explosives. That
is, of course, if they don't die first from the Empire Cola spill.
</P>
<P>
   In the night, around fires on the edge of town, hemmed in by the
government, these teen-agers drink, ponder their long-range future
and consider what they might do if there is to be no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   To such big questions, Freeman brings a light touch but an
effective one. &QL;

`INSTINCT': PHILOSOPHICAL POPCORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big thespian guns are rolled out to lay down a barrage of
philosophical popcorn in the psychological mystery ``Instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   The big guns are the Academy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and
Cuba Gooding Jr. The philosophical popcorn runs along these lines:
Nature is good. Civilization is bad. Animals are pure. Man is evil.
Peace is preferable to war. Put love, particularly the love of
children and family, above ambition and career.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Instinct,'' the medium is more palatable than
the saccharine message because Hopkins and Gooding know how to put
on a show. As is known by those who have attended his Lecter in
``The Silence of the Lambs,'' Hopkins masters in portrayals of the
violently homicidal. Terrifying though he may be in these
depictions, Hopkins is, bar none, a moviegoer's ideal prison
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gooding (``Jerry Maguire''), his cherubic face and bright
spirit in the face of adversity make him pleasant, sympathetic
company even in the most blighted surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two of them, they keep ``Instinct'' afloat on its
sea of simplisms through a succession of climaxes until at last it
reaches its unavoidable ending.
</P>
<P>
   In this film, directed by Jon Turteltaub (``Phenomenon'' and
``Cool Runnings''), and written by Gerald DiPego (``Phenomenon''
and ``Message in a Bottle''), Hopkins plays Ethan Powell. For the
most part resembling Robinson Crusoe in manacles and leg irons,
this mute, shaggy creature is first seen in an African prison where
he has been held for murder and assault.
</P>
<P>
   But because he is an eminent anthropologist and primatologist,
Powell is being turned over to U.S. officials for repatriation.
Mysterious and volatile, he is placed in a truck with snarling
dogs, but by journey's end, he has reduced them, shades of
Crocodile Dundee, to docile Dobermans.
</P>
<P>
   Why has this scholarly man first vanished into the Rwandan
forest for two years, and why has he clubbed two park rangers to
death and injured three others? As the movie puts it, how does a
man become an animal?
</P>
<P>
   These are the questions that Gooding, in the role of Theo
Caulder, a most promising and very ambitious resident from the
University of Miami Department of Psychiatry, hopes to answer if
his mentor, Ben Hillard (Donald Sutherland, wise, cunning and
bearded) gives him the chance to evaluate the silent prisoner.
Success in this endeavor can propel Caulder on a meteoric ascent to
professional renown and perhaps even the top of the best-seller
list.
</P>
<P>
   Is Powell to remain imprisoned, or does the solution to the
mystery of the man hold some justification for freeing him after a
competency hearing?
</P>
<P>
   So, like Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter in ``The Silence
of the Lambs,'' Caulder and Powell match wits in the moldering
confines of the Harmony Bay Correctional Facility, where Powell has
been caged among the psychiatric prisoners after turning
explosively on his escorts at the Miami airport.
</P>
<P>
   The prison is one of those places characterized by neglect and
sadism, particularly in the person of Dacks (John Ashton), a brutal
guard, and Bluto (Paul Bates), a hulking inmate. Besides trying to
deal with the volatile Powell and other prisoners, young Caulder
must contend with the inhospitable warden and the defeatist prison
psychiatrist, John Murray (George Dzundza).
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the facile shallowness of ``Instinct'' that
when Caulder at last manages to enlist the prisoners in defying the
unfair system that allots one of them a half-hour daily in a patch
of high-walled yard, Dr. Murray gazes at him as if he had just
witnessed the second coming of Freud.
</P>
<P>
   Caulder previously has wasted no time breaking through Powell's
silence, which is not to say that he has the upper hand in this
two-way struggle to achieve understanding, which takes him into the
life of Powell's rejected daughter, Lyn (Maura Tierney), and, in
flashbacks, among the great apes of the Rwandan forest.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Powell and Caulder emerge the wiser; moviegoers,
despite the efforts of the stars, somewhat the poorer.
</P>

`BUENO VISTA SOCIAL CLUB': A CUBAN BAND'S TESTAMENT TO THE POWERS
OF THE MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most incandescent moment in Wim Wenders' exhilarating
documentary portrait of the Cuban ensemble Buena Vista Social Club
is a concert performance of the song ``El Cuarto de Tula'' filmed
last July at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sung by the band's septuagenarian lead singer, Ibrahim Ferrer,
who is described as a Cuban Nat (King) Cole, the song is a sexy
musical fire alarm alerting the world to a blaze in the bedroom of
a woman who forgot to blow out a candle before falling asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Shouted fervently by Ferrer, who bears a marked resemblance to
Nelson Mandela, the song is more than a scintillating erotic
metaphor; it is an impassioned assertion of an unquenchable lust
for life.
</P>
<P>
   The performance is one of many stirring moments in ``Buena Vista
Social Club,'' a documentary that mixes music with impressionistic
glimpses of urban life in contemporary Cuba. Filmed in Amsterdam
and New York, the concert scenes find the stage awash in such
intense joy, camaraderie and nationalist pride that you become
convinced that making music is a key to longevity and spiritual
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   That conviction is underscored in an interview snippet shown
moments before the performance in which Ferrer recalls having given
up singing two years before the formation of the Buena Vista Social
Club, whose principal musicians come from Cuba's pre-revolutionary
musical old guard.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few are in their 70s, 80s and 90s. As the movie makes
clear, the assembling of this band by the American guitarist and
producer Ry Cooder was a profoundly rejuvenating experience for the
members.
</P>
<P>
   Until Cooder discovered them, most were retired or forgotten.
Now, suddenly, they are stars. ``The Buena Vista Social Club''
(Nonesuch), an album of 14 Cuban mambos, boleros and cha-chas
dating as far back as the 1920s, became a phenomenon, selling more
than a million copies worldwide. And Nonesuch has just released a
solo album by Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   As Cooder recalls, he had originally intended to produce a
record mixing Cuban and West African musicians, but at the last
minute the Africans were sidetracked in Paris. He forged ahead
anyway and recorded an all-Cuban record that won a Grammy Award
(for best tropical Latin album) and set off a wave of interest in
Cuban music.
</P>
<P>
   Before the band was assembled, Ferrer was shining shoes, and
Compay Segundo, a lead guitarist in his early 90s, rolled cigars.
Interviewed in the film, Segundo boasts of being the father of
five. He still hopes to sire a sixth child, he confides
mischievously, and the energy he effuses suggests that this would
not be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   We also meet Ruben Gonzalez, the band's keyboardist, who
suggests a white-haired figure from an El Greco painting. Gonzalez
plays the piano with a lean, spiky elegance embellished with
classical flourishes that never turn flowery.
</P>
<P>
   Another important figure, Barbarito Torres, who is many years
younger, tells of the history of his 12-string lutelike instrument
known as the laud, which originated in Saudi Arabia. Juxtaposing
the songs with shots of Havana's grand but crumbling seaside
architecture, the film reinforces the music's evocation of a
vanished glittering world of sensual ballroom dancing.
</P>
<P>
   That music, which bridges the eras of swing and salsa, sounds
timeless. Many of the interviews are conducted in large empty rooms
in which the subjects are posed almost like weather-beaten living
monuments, reflecting the architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has a fairy tale ending in which Ferrer, wandering the
streets of New York, rhapsodizes about the beauty of midtown
Manhattan, a place he never imagined he would visit. Then in the
final moments we're back in Havana for a final glimpse of the
cityscape and a sign proclaiming ``We believe in dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The dreams that Ferrer and his colleagues have realized, of
course, do not reflect the austere collectivist vision of Fidel
Castro. They are the echoes of a world that the Communist
revolution may have erased in physical fact but not in memory. &QL;

 &HT;    Georgia lawmakers aim to convince other states to buy C-130Js
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some members of Georgia's congressional delegation
hope they are as fortunate as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
whose ability to direct defense spending to Marietta, Ga., won him
a dubious honor.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich merited an entry in a government watchdog group's 1999
Congressional Pig Book when last-minute horse trading brought an
additional $112 million for two Lockheed Martin KC-130J tanker
planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Against Government Waste called the funds for the
planes, a modified version of the company's transport plane, an
``expensive going-away present'' for Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   While the Georgians do not especially want to find themselves in
the Pig Book, they might live with the distinction if it means more
money for Lockheed Martin, which builds the planes and employs
9,200 people at its Marietta plant.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said last month that such funding
would not be wasteful: ``It is my view that the C-130J is not a
'pork' project.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell argued in a letter to Appropriations Committee member
Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) last month that the program ``is not
only a military necessity but also carries significant import for
the state of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   He is making the same argument to Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott (R-Miss.) and other colleagues, hoping that they will push for
money to buy several C-130Js for Air Force and Marine Corps bases
in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., is home to a squadron
of WC-130s that have been modified to track storms. Keesler's
Hurricane Hunters already fly two modified C-130Js.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell is trying to persuade Lott that the base needs two
more planes next year, Coverdell spokeswoman Burson Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell and Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) also are trying to
convince Pennsylvanians that their state's Air National Guard needs
a C-130J next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), the ranking Democrat on the defense
appropriations subcommittee, is a strong advocate for
Pennsylvania's military units and a longtime supporter of the C-130
program.
</P>
<P>
   The annual appropriations process will be in full swing in the
coming weeks, and members of Congress will be looking to protect
programs that benefit their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy the Georgians are employing is simple. And it
mirrors the practice of defense contractors, who have spread their
production facilities over various states to increase the number of
advocates in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgians are trying to enhance their clout, diminished by
Gingrich's exit, by convincing colleagues of the need for the
planes in their states.
</P>
<P>
   The task is complicated by the absence of any C-130Js in the
Pentagon's budget request for the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But the plane's backers in Congress have made some headway. The
House Armed Services Committee has authorized four planes, at a
cost of about $60 million each. The Georgians think they can get
support for as many as four more.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin told the Georgia delegation this year that the
U.S. government must buy 12 planes next year and in 2001 to keep
its production line running without laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that number is realistic or merely a negotiating
position is a matter of debate within the Georgia delegation.
</P>
<P>
   In a written plea for administration support, Coverdell told
Defense Secretary William Cohen that Lockheed Martin could accept a
buy of eight planes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Lockheed Martin is saying little. ``The mark-up
process is kind of a long process. We'll see what's there when it's
over and done with,'' said Sam Grizzle, a spokesman in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockheed lobbyists in Washington are in close contact with
Georgia's representatives and senators, visiting their offices
regularly and even attending campaign fund-raising receptions. At
one recent event for Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Chambliss huddled
with Chuck Monroe, Lockheed's point man in Washington for the
C-130J.
</P>
<P>
   The concern appears to be short-term. Hundreds of earlier models
of the C-130 perform a variety of functions for both the Air Force
and Marine Corps, including moving people and cargo in the ongoing
war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Both armed services say they will replace their aging transport
and tanker fleets with C-130Js beginning in 2002 and 2005,
respectively.

NEW VIENNA (CIRCA 1900) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``To the Age, It's Art'' was the rallying cry of the Vienna
Secessionists in 1900, when the architect Josef Hoffmann and the
other founders of the Secession were proclaiming the need for a new
style for a new era.
</P>
<P>
   They had rejected the historicism of the late 1800s, when the
Emperor Franz Josef commissioned a Greek temple Parliament, a
Gothic City Hall and Baroque apartment houses on the Ringstrasse,
the wide boulevard that circles Vienna. The Ringstrasse became a
metaphor for everything antiquated and passe, and helped galvanize
a design revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Writers have long sought to explain the atmosphere of the turn
of the century; one was Robert Musil in ``The Man Without
Qualities.'' ``Out of the oil-smooth spirit of the two last decades
of the 19th century, suddenly, throughout Europe, there rose a
kindling fever,'' he wrote in 1930. ``People were standing up on
all sides to fight against the old way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The design revolution spread across Europe to Scotland and,
eventually, to the United States. It included architecture, design
and all the decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   As Kirk Varnedoe, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, has
written, ``The challenge from the outset was to recover richness
from reduction, to rephrase simplicity with a reticent elegance
that would render superfluous the conventional luxuriance they were
eliminating.''
</P>
<P>
   The icons of this explosive age have been a 20-year passion for
Maurice and Margo Cohen, a Detroit couple who are selling their
collection of early-20th-century decorative arts at Christie's on
June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their works were purchased through the New York dealer
Barry Friedman, who said he had tried unsuccessfully to buy the
collection back when the Cohens decided to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of museum-quality pieces there,'' Friedman
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered such a serious collection that Dr. Christian
Witt-Dorring, a curator at the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna,
wrote the introduction to the catalog for the Cohen sale.
</P>
<P>
   In it he tells how the creations of designers like Christopher
Dresser in England, Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Scotland, Carlo
Bugatti in Italy, and Otto Wagner and Hoffmann in Vienna ``are
evidence of the enormous creative power released at the turn of the
century and directly resulting in bold manufacturing opportunities
and marketing innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens were truly cosmopolitan in their collecting,
concentrating on Austrian works but also including Scottish,
Italian, English and American pieces. From Vienna they bought some
of the earliest examples of bentwood furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner and Hoffmann produced designs for J.&AMP; J. Kohn, a company
that pioneered the use of bent wood. The sale is to include some
models that have been highly sought since 1986, when they were seen
in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition ``Vienna 1900: Art,
Architecture and Design.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several examples of the chair Hoffmann devised in 1904
for the dining room of the Purkersdorf Sanatorium, a modern spa he
designed on the outskirts of Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last Purkersdorf chair sold at auction went for about
$60,000 in May in London,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   The only design motif on the chair is the circle. The back splat
is pierced with 30 small round holes, lined up in pairs like
marching soldiers. The circle motif is echoed beneath the seat by
two wood spheres attached to each chair leg, a structural support
that is also decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Cohen chairs are being sold individually, with an
estimate of $20,000 to $30,000 apiece. One lot is a set of eight of
the chairs, with an estimate of $160,000 to $240,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's great triumph in Vienna was the 1904 Postal Savings
Bank, planned as a total work of art for which he designed the
building, the fixtures and all the furniture, which was
manufactured by Kohn's rival, Thonet, in ebonized wood with
aluminum studs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens are selling the set of bookshelves from the
director's office at the bank (estimate: $50,000 to $80,000); a
sleek armchair with aluminum-capped feet from the board room
($40,000 to $60,000) and a desk with aluminum stringing and studs
($40,000 to $60,000).
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said a Hoffmann brass chalice, circa 1925, designed for
the Weiner Werstatte cooperative was among 300 made; in 1928 it
cost $18.75. Its estimate is $10,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   From Italy the Cohens bought a pair of ebonized slat-wood side
chairs designed around 1900 by Carlo Bugatti, an Italian architect
who was much influenced by Islamic furniture. The chairs are inlaid
with pewter, brass and copper. The estimate for the pair: $26,000
to $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s the market for great turn-of-the-century Viennese
antiques was overheated, then cooled down. Now, experts say, it is
strong &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Doyle Galleries' sale of 20th-century art and design on
Monday includes several superb vessels by a Polish-born potter, Lea
H. Halpern (1899-1986), whose work has been forgotten in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Known in the Netherlands as the van Gogh of potters, Ms. Halpern
liked simple shapes and complex surfaces. She considered herself to
be an artist and never intended her pots to be used. She gave them
names like ``Rainy Day,'' ``Black-Eyed Daisy,'' ``Comet'' and
``Spider's Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Schooled in painting, modeling and ceramics in Vienna, she
worked in Gouda, the Netherlands, until World War II, experimenting
with glazes, special effects and innovative pigments. The quality
of her work was recognized early; both Queen Emma and Princess
Juliana bought work at her first show in 1931. The following year
the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam gave her a one-woman show and
bought some vases.
</P>
<P>
   Her work has great variety; while the shapes are classic (like
Shang bronzes), the textures vary from satin smooth to eggshell to
lava. The palette is often wild: turquoise with splashes of purple,
or orange with gold. Subtle shades like pale green celadon often
have the crackled surface of ancient Chinese ware. The pieces beg
to be touched.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 Ms. Halpern was offered a show at Holland House in
Rockefeller Center, which she accepted. She was so concerned about
shipping her works that she sailed with the collection on the liner
Rotterdam. She planned to return home, but the outbreak of war made
it impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halpern decided to remain in the United States permanently,
marrying and settling outside of Baltimore, where she continued to
work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 the Frans Halsmuseum in Haarlem had a Halpern show; in
1976 the Baltimore Museum of Art had one. The British Museum, the
Victoria and Albert, the National Collection of Fine Arts in
Washington and the Metropolitan Museum of Art have collected her
pottery.
</P>
<P>
   R.L. Hobson, former curator of ceramics at the British Museum,
called her ``a rare flower in this mechanical age.''
</P>
<P>
   It is even rarer for so many of her pieces to come up for sale
at one time. The estimates range from $300 to $5,000 apiece.

</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's tale of tangled matchmaking jumps forward 250
years or so and moves to Tuscany, where ``the necklines are high,
parents are rigid and marriage is seldom a matter of love.'' As if
by illustration, Egeus (Hill) petitions Theseus (Strathairn), the
Duke of ``Monte Athena,'' to order Egeus' daughter, Hermia (Ms.
Friel), to cease her affections for Lysander (West) and marry
Demetrius (Bale).
</P>
<P>
   The law being the law, the duke can only direct Hermia to wed as
her father wishes. With all not well by the ``left pap where the
heart doth pump,'' Hermia and Lysander take off for the forest on
bicycles, pursued by Demetrius, who is stuck on Hermia, and Helena
(Ms. Flockhart), who is smitten with Demetrius.
</P>
<P>
   In the wood all of them fall prey to fairies who are of robust
libido themselves. Having problems with his wildly romantic queen,
Titania (Ms. Pfeiffer), the smoothly amorous fairy king, Oberon (
Everett), finds it in his interests to tamper with her affections
and those of the humans who have cycled into their midst.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he dispatches the horned sprite Puck (Tucci) with
instructions to squeeze mind-altering drops onto the eyelids of the
queen and the mortals as they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Puck, though, gets his characters and potions confused. Titania
awakes to find herself in love with Bottom (Kline), a member of a
local acting troupe, who temporarily has the head of an ass. And
now Demetrius loves Helena, leaving the field clear for Hermia and
Lysander. But only the duke can assure that ``Jack will have Jill
and naught will be ill.'' &QL;

make a useful exercise, though that's not exactly the strongest
enticement. The sex isn't that bothersome by most standards, nor is
the racy talk, but there is plenty of attentive listening to be
done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Teen-agers shouldn't expect ``Shakespeare in

matters), Anna is free to find William charming enough to step
right up and give him a pretty good smooch. One encounter leads to
another. He's hooked, albeit cautiously, and she's leaning.
</P>
<P>
   William has a gently bumbling way about him, a self-deprecating
wit, an affable slob of a flat mate (Ifans), a sweet ditz of a
sister (Ms. Chambers) and several nicely eccentric friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing with the hoi polloi is a new experience for Anna, but she
tries hard and is as self-effacing as the next person. Now 29,
she's been on a diet since she was 19 and has had some cosmetic
surgery to correct a couple of wayward features. She also allows
that she's not that long in the talent department.
</P>
<P>
   When her schedule allows, she gets back to London and reconnects
with William. She's the instigator, but there comes a point when
her fame will separate them forever if he doesn't step up and carry
her off to relative oblivion. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Ms. Roberts and Grant don't generate sexual heat (one gets
the feeling they might break), but Anna and William make love
off-screen, reappearing in bed for a benign, photogenic look-see
after the fact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Swear words are heard and seen stenciled on a T-shirt,
though the mood is jokey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9 They wouldn't suffer irreparable damage, but clearly
this isn't a film for young children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 Both stars will appeal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP One sees this movie to ogle Ms. Roberts and Grant
and be carried along by the fantasy. That will strike some
teen-agers as dumb, though not others. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   THE WINSLOW BOY
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam, Rebecca Pidgeon, Gemma Jones,
Guy Edwards &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by David Mamet &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G 110 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Mamet's film, based on Terence Rattigan's play and a
real-life incident, Ronnie Winslow, 13, stands in the rain in his
naval academy uniform, clutching a letter from the British
admiralty. The boy, according to the letter, has been expelled for
stealing a five-shilling postal order.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Arthur (Hawthorne), a moderately well-to-do
Edwardian family patriarch until this business develops, tells
Ronnie that he won't blame him but that he should not lie because
it will be apparent if he does. Did he steal the postal order? No,
Ronnie answers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins a protracted defense that consumes Arthur and his
hard-headed daughter, Catherine (Ms. Pidgeon); drains the Winslow
coffers; threatens Catherine's marriage prospects, and drives the
press and British government to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   On the favorable side of the ledger, the Winslows secure the
services of Sir Robert Morton (Northam), a brilliant barrister and
a member of the House of Commons. Morton is a cold character, but
when Ronnie survives his private cross-examination, he takes the
case and ultimately pursues it with ardor even after Arthur wants
to drop the matter. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;

<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10 Just to prove it can be done, here's a serious
feature film without bloodshed, sex or foul language. Too bad small
children won't understand a word. Older viewers in this category
will get the general idea, but the going will be too slow and wordy
to retain interest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-12 If parents gave a push, the film could catch hold
with some viewers (admittedly not many). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Teen-agers choose their own movies. If they're
willing to try something different, they will be rewarded. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hum Is Audible Off Broadway
</P>
<P>
   Heard enough about the Tonys? Good. While the good people of
Broadway engage in their Tony festivities, the denizens of Off
Broadway and the world beyond are busy finalizing their schedules,
settling down in new homes and closing up shop.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news comes first, as a pair of long-running Off Broadway
shows reach the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   At the Soho Playhouse, ``Killer Joe'' closes on Sunday. The
play, about a murder scheme hatched in a trailer park, had strong
reviews and even stronger box office figures after opening in
October. But sales began to drop after its original stars, Amanda
Plummer and Scott Glenn, left early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Several replacement casts have been tried out with mixed
results. Two weeks ago, Lori Petty, of ``Tank Girl'' fame, left
earlier than expected, said Darren Lee Cole, the producer. A call
to Ms. Petty's manager in Los Angeles was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said that ``Killer Joe'' had earned back about 80 percent
of its initial $350,000 investment and that productions in San
Francisco, Boston and Toronto are likely. A film deal is also
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful Thing'' is also planning to close, on June 27. The
story of two male teen-agers in the blush of first love, the play
ran five months and will have recouped its $265,000 investment,
said Roy Gabay, one of the producers. A production in Los Angeles
looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go through July and August,'' Gabay said.
``And if I go out, I'd rather go out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlantic Theater Company, ``The Cider House Rules,''
Peter Parnell's ambitious seven-hour adaptation of John Irving's
novel, may remain half seen in New York. The piece's first half,
which received mixed reviews, closes on Sunday. Neil Pepe, the
Atlantic's artistic director, said this week that the mixed reviews
had made financing the second half _ which would cost about
$300,000 _ difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for an angel,'' said Pepe, who added that
producers had about a third of the money needed for the second
part. ``It's been an extraordinary journey. It would be a shame to
leave it halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, new productions are being lined up. At the Variety
Arts, producers said this week that the musical ``A Good Swift
Kick'' will open on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   The show, by John Forster, is described in press materials as
``20-odd musicals in 90ish minutes,'' with songs on subjects
ranging from ``Thomas Jefferson's DNA, to cultural imperialism, to
the final thoughts of a deer crossing the turnpike.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   At the Manhattan Theater Club, ``Y2K'' by Arthur Kopit is
confirmed for the fall, with Bob Balaban directing. It joins three
other new plays, ``An Experiment with an Air Pump'' by Shelagh
Stephenson, ``Fuddy Meers'' by David Lindsay-Abaire and ``Proof''
by David Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   And the Signature Theater Company, which devotes each season to
the work of one playwright, has chosen the lineup for next year's
tribute to Maria Irene Fornes. Two short works, ``Mud'' and
``Drowning,'' both directed by David Esbjornson, will open on Sept.
26, followed by ``Enter the Night'' on Dec. 5, and then a world
premiere of an untitled new play in February 2000. The season will
also include cabaret performances of some of Ms. Fornes'
experimental musical work.
</P>
<P>
   A Script in Hand
</P>
<P>
   The last time F. Murray Abraham was on stage in New York was in
1997, in ``Triumph of Love,'' the short-lived musical at the
1,078-seat Royale Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Abraham (``Please call me Murray'') has been busy
acting in movies, where he made an indelible mark _ winning an
Oscar _ in the 1984 film ``Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was during one of these job excursions last year that
Abraham found the script that brings him back to the stage. While
in Melbourne, Australia, Abraham said, he was approached by a young
woman with a script in hand. It is not an uncommon occurrence, he
said, but his reaction was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one seemed so good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So starting next month, Abraham, along with Joyce Van Patten,
will appear in ``It's My Party and I'll Die If I Want To,'' by
Elizabeth Coleman, at the Arclight Theater, a 99-seat theater on
West 71st Street. It is, as the title suggests, a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   How does the jump from Broadway to the lands Off Off feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going back to the roots,'' said Abraham, with a laugh.
``It's like performing in a cave.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost Home
</P>
<P>
   For 13 years, Ellie Covan has been opening her home, a
second-floor loft on the Bowery, to the public, inviting complete
strangers to sit on her couches and watch play readings,
performance art and dance. The Blue Man Group started there as did
performers like John Leguizamo and Lisa Kron. The actors were paid
a little for their labors, and no show had tickets costing more
than $12. Ms. Covan called her homey performance space Dixon Place;
many artists simply called it home.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Ms. Covan told the crowd at the Obie Awards that
she had lost her lease and would have to close.
</P>
<P>
   So people in the downtown theater scene heaved a collective sigh
of relief this week when the Vineyard Theater announced that it had
offered Ms. Covan its old theater on East 26th Street for the year
to continue her unique style of developmental work. The Vineyard
moved to a larger space on Union Square in 1989 and was using the
old theater for rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Covan said she was surprised and thrilled by the offer. She
said the new space will open, with ``a slightly different feel,''
just after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll bring some of our finer couches,'' she said,
adding that she won't be living there. ``That's the best part.''

   Ideal Time For Wilde?
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Oliver Parker says that if there is one thing he has
learned in his career in theater and film as a writer, actor and
director, it's that Oscar Wilde is not a good candidate for screen
adaptations. Hollywood has been busy mining the canon of English
literature, from Austen to Shakespeare, but Wilde has been
conspicuously ignored. ``Too theatrical,'' Parker said he had
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   And so Parker is understandably in a reflective mood as he
prepares for the release of his adaptation of Wilde's play ``An
Ideal Husband'' on June 18. The movie, which Parker wrote and
directed, stars Rupert Everett, Jeremy Northam, Cate Blanchett,
Julianne Moore and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde is a bit frightening, and the language is so dense and
rich,'' Parker said. ``But something niggled me.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``niggled'' was the obvious relevance of a story about a
noble-minded but flawed politician ( Northam), desperate to conceal
a secret about a past financial indiscretion and how that collides
with the high-minded principles of his wife (Ms. Blanchett). All
this takes place as the world's greatest power (Britain in this
instance) contemplates its role at the end of a century (the 19th).
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get it out this year, of course,'' said Parker, an
Englishman. ``You can see why. It was so rooted in pertinence.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker's only other major film was ``Othello,'' which starred
Laurence Fishburne, Irene Jacob and Kenneth Branagh, so he has
experience adapting material for a contemporary audience. He said
that although he had rejected an ``Ideal Husband'' adaptation out
of hand when it was first proposed, he was intrigued enough to play
with a script that simplified the plot and developed some of the
characters differently.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Parker said, was taking liberties with the play while
preserving Wilde's razor-sharp wit and dissection of social
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said he removed many of the farcical elements and made it
less of a sendup of a drawing room comedy. Instead he emphasized
the role of a woman, played by Ms. Moore (with an English accent),
who blackmails Northam's character. Parker had great fun giving
Everett free reign as London's most marriage-resistant and clever
bachelor, Lord Goring.
</P>
<P>
   Parker also invented a bet on which the future of every major
character turns, a device that makes the movie's conclusion both
unexpected and, well, highly theatrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun thing about a period piece is it gives some
perspective on contemporary events without being embarrassing,''
Parker said. ``I had British political life in mind. It felt to me
like a seediness had become a regular part of the day. But I guess
you could see some pertinence to America.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde has been so transformed in Parker's eyes, he said, that he
is now considering a new adaptation, of ``The Importance of Being
Earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing Strikes
</P>
<P>
   When young men dream of breaking into major league baseball,
they often dream of Cape Cod. No, not lying on the beaches there,
but playing in a summer league that, though little known beyond
baseball circles and the cape's clam-roll stands, has long been a
training ground for some of the best professional talent. Think of
players like Mo Vaughn and Jeff Bagwell. The Cape Cod League, to
which a select number of college players are invited each year,
represents the cusp of making it or not for many hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   And so Mike Tollin, who has built a career in part as a producer
of sports movies, has chosen ``Summer Catch,'' a script about a
young man in the Cape Cod League, for his debut as a feature
director. He expects to begin shooting this summer for a possible
release early next summer through Warner Brothers. The actors have
not been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Tollin has had a distinguished career as a producer, most
recently of ``Varsity Blues.'' He and his partner, Brian Robbins,
also produce the HBO series ``Arliss,'' about a sports agent, and
they received an Oscar nomination for their 1995 documentary ``Hank
Aaron: Chasing the Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer Catch'' had first been accepted at Fox, with Matt Damon
set to star as an aspiring pitcher and Keri Russell of the
television show ``Felicity'' as his love interest. The deal fell
through, and Tollin said he jumped at the opportunity to do a
picture about the league and to focus on directing for a change. He
likened the experience being the pitcher in a ball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole other level of creative control to
directing,'' said Tollin, adding that he would seek the kind of
authenticity found in such films as ``Bull Durham.'' ``Being on the
mound, there's nothing that compares with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The film follows a pitcher named Ryan who grows up in the shadow
of the league's ramshackle ball park, cutting lawns for his
father's landscaping business. His arm propels him into the league,
suddenly making him a contender for the affections of a young woman
whose lawn he used to mow. It also sets him against his friends,
who are used to squaring off against the outsiders who show up each
summer to play ball and drink at a local bar before heading off to
grander things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about that last shot at the pros before the inevitable
encroachment of reality,'' said Tollin, who is from Philadelphia
and is a staunch Phillies fan.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he said, the film will be a celebration of a
pursuit he and most of the other people involved in the movie
adore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all baseball fanatics,'' he said. ``We all love the game
and have great respect for the game. That's what this really is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Tea With Zeffirelli
</P>
<P>
   These days of war in Yugoslavia may not seem like the wisest
time to wager on the shared connections within Europe and between
Europe and the United States. But then Franco Zeffirelli has never
been conventional. So he has placed his bets more or less across
the board on unity rather than division.
</P>
<P>
   Zeffirelli's current movie, the autobiographical ``Tea With
Mussolini,'' searches for and finds these common cultural roots
amid the hostilities of World War II in Florence. The movie tells
of a group of eccentric British and American women who took him in
and raised him, and of how brutally they were treated by
Mussolini's government and the Germans. The film is ultimately a
love letter to these affectionate if naive esthetes for the
enduring values they imparted to an impressionable young man.
</P>
<P>
   Zeffirelli, 76, discussed these cultural ties from his home in
Florence, where he is campaigning for a seat in the European
Parliament. His platform is to focus and build upon the commonality
within Europe and between Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love America very much,'' Zeffirelli said. ``Your country
has given the world so much. I've only one virtue in my
personality, gratitude and loyalty. That is what has driven me in
the movie and in my political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The film and the political campaign reflect an unmistakable
optimism that Zeffirelli said he has not always had. The killing
and brutish behavior he witnessed during World War II left deep
scars, he said, but in ``Tea With Mussolini,'' ``the scars have
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It needed a long sedimentation period, the memories,'' he
said. ``They needed to become objective. If I had done this 30
years ago, it would have been much darker. But the story has been
well guided by destiny, I think. It's very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Zeffirelli said he takes a hopeful attitude toward
cultural cooperation among European nations and especially between
Europe and the United States. One proposal he has championed, he
said, is the construction of a huge international performing arts
center in Florence on a 30-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope this would be done with the help of America,'' he
said, a stand that is sure to meet some opposition from Europeans
who resent American cultural influence.
</P>
<P>
   Another plank in his platform, Zeffirelli said, is to encourage
greater cooperation between the United States and Europe in
filmmaking, an issue over which tempers have sometimes flared.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than resisting Hollywood's influence and its cultural
hegemony, as some Europeans have described it, Europe should
welcome American investment in European films and film companies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be more open,'' Zeffirelli said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament election takes place in mid-June, two
days before Zeffirelli flies to Hollywood, he said, to begin
negotiations on two new movie projects.

   Tracing 30 Years Of Gay Life
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of the word lesbian, but I knew enough to
hide,'' says a woman from North Carolina in ``Before Stonewall,''
the 1984 Emmy Award-winning film by John Scagliotti, Robert
Rosenberg and Greta Schiller. Like dozens of homosexuals reared in
the '20s and '30s who were interviewed for the documentary, she hid
her differences as best she could in the decades before June 27,
1969, when a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in New York City
touched off three nights of rioting and effectively launched the
gay movement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, First Run Features will release ``Before Stonewall''
and, for the first time on video, ``After Stonewall,'' a second
chapter by Scagliotti, Janet Baus and Dan Hunt, which will have its
first television showing on PBS on June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two films are a history of gay life. ``The first
one took much longer because material wasn't available then,''
Scagliotti said. ``Homosexuality wasn't even a topic in the
national archives.'' The second film, completed this year, was
easier, though by the late '90s sources wanted to be paid for their
information. ``There's been such a fundamental change in
recognition,'' he said. ``We could go all over the country. People
were more aware of what gay and lesbian lives are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Stonewall'' begins in the '20s, when homosexuality was
grounds to be committed to a hospital in some states but became a
call to the bohemian life from the Barbary Coast of San Francisco
to Greenwich Village and Harlem in New York. The film touches on
the writings pouring from the likes of Langston Hughes, Gertrude
Stein and Tennessee Williams, the so-called code of decency that in
1935 banned any reference to homosexuality in films, and other
repressive measures that took hold amid the economic and social
strains of the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   One of the better passages covers World War II, when gay people
of both sexes volunteered for the military in large numbers. Men
tell of joining the Marines to prove that homosexuals could
withstand tests of macho physicality (even though, as one man
reports, they ``threw like girls,'' which gave them trouble with
hand grenades). Working in the defense plants, women, including
lesbians, flooded urban areas and discovered themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 the Kinsey report said that there were 20 million
homosexuals. That kind of number was excuse enough to link
homosexuality with communism. Gay people fought back. ``We began
asking, `Why are we being intimidated by a bunch of jerks who know
nothing about life?''' the poet Allen Ginsberg says in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality is officially removed from the list of psychiatric
disturbances in 1974. Lesbians split from male homosexuals, finding
them sexist, and feminists distance themselves from lesbians.
Poetry soothes the hurts. ``Thank God for bad poetry,'' says a
lesbian. Harvey Milk is assassinated. Anita Bryant wants to save
our children. ``Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals,'' reads a
headline in The New York Times. In the film, AIDS brings a loss of
all innocence. ``By '86 people started getting angry,'' Scagliotti
said.

   In a razor-sharp performance, Ian McKellen is the director James
Whale, who died mysteriously in 1957. Adapted from Christopher
Bram's hypothetical novel, Bill Condon's film catches Whale, a
marvelously urbane English homosexual, after a small stroke has
left him with painful thoughts of the past and particularly
receptive to an obsession with his young gardener (Brendan Fraser).
Taking off from Whale's complex nature, Condon, Janet Maslin wrote
in The New York Times, builds ``an immensely touching character
study that is heightened by well-chosen glimpses of Hollywood's
past.'' 1998. Universal. $99.91. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

   The room rate at the Bates Motel has jumped to $36.50, but
little else in Gus Van Sant's color imitation of Alfred Hitchcock's
film (1960) strays far from the master's blueprint. Anne Heche's
Marion bleeds orange in the shower scene, and she is more
headstrong and flirty than Janet Leigh was the first time. The one
major falloff is Vince Vaughn, whose beefy and rather obvious
Norman Bates is a far cry from Anthony Perkins' sneaky, birdlike
presence as the original Norman. If Van Sant is no Hitchcock,
neither does he botch an ``artful, good-looking remake (a modest
term, but it beats plagiarism)'' (Maslin). 1998. Universal.

virginity, she gets the help of Richard (Kenneth Branagh), a failed
painter who builds primitive flying machines. Richard is not to be
the lover, but he is to conduct the search, beginning with
employment agencies and finally leading to a suave professional
escort who will be paid for his services. To finance that, Richard
decides to rob a bank, but he's never more than an allegorical
construction in a film that ``might be described as a

in an old couple's gabbeh (a wool carpet woven to tell a story)
come to life and relate a tale of a wandering clan and requited
love. Gabbeh (Shaghayegh Djodat), a character in the rug, is
followed across the countryside by a horseman in black whom she
would like to run off with if responsibilities and social
conditions within the clan would ever permit, which they never seem
to. Grandly poetic and richly reportorial, ``Gabbeh'' is ``woven
with art'' (Lawrence Van Gelder). 1996. New Yorker. $89.99. 75

<P>
   LEHZE, Albania _ It is early June, but the talk is of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, it is already stifling in this old
warehouse that was used in communist days to house tractors for
cooperative farms. The moist smell of perspiration is heavy in the
concrete block building that is now home to more than 560 refugees
from Kosovo. They have been here six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people on Earth must live this way?'' asks Nugret
Termkolli, a leader of the refugees who come from the tiny Kosovar
village of Bardhi I Madh(CQ). ``We are like animals in a barn only
worse,'' he says, walking down a row of cardboard boxes, blankets
and foam mattresses arranged into individual family living spaces.
``We have no toilets or suitable places to wash. The world has
forgotten us.''
</P>
<P>
   Families here sleep on makeshift beds laid on the hard concrete
floor. The women take turns at three propane-fueled stoves to cook
meals of beans and crude fried bread for their families. Food is
scarce, brought every week or so by an Englishman the refugees only
know as ``George.''
</P>
<P>
   Their water comes from a single outside hose. The children have
diarrhea. Two refugees have died. No one knows why. Doctors have
visited here twice.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of spending the winter here horrifies Termkolli.
``It's impossible,'' he says, with a tone of frustration changing
to panic. ``We have no way to keep warm and there will be an
epidemic of diseases. We would be better off taking our chances
with the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, it becomes more likely that winter will
come and go before the souls in this tractor warehouse see their
homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's acceptance of an international peace plan by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's government, refugees and
aid officials here alike consider it a foregone conclusion that the
nearly 450,000 Kosovar refugees in Albania will be away from home
months -- perhaps years.
</P>
<P>
   There are still the mines, they say. Many of the homes have been
burned to the ground. But most important, they just don't trust
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to believe Milosevic any more. But if NATO
goes into Kosovo, we will follow immediately,'' said Istref Veseli,
a 43-year-old from Vucitrn who had been imprisoned by Serbs for 21
days and arrived in Albania two weeks ago after being released.
</P>
<P>
   His family is still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to sit in tents in Kosovo than tents in Albania,''
he said, referring to the fact that many homes back home had been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Kosovo have been through so much, but it is now
almost certain that they must endure much more. The next few weeks
will be grim. Balkan summers are hot, with many days bringing
temperatures above 100 degrees, while many refugee camps are built
on flat, treeless plains. Aid workers worry about dehydration and
disease among weakened refugees, particularly the old, infirm and
infants.
</P>
<P>
   And then they will confront the cold, wet winter with its
specters of exposure and even more disease.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many camps in Albania were thrown up on sites
that don't meet minimal standards for health and safety. But relief
groups, under the double pressure of sheltering the flood of
refugees and getting out of the military's way, say they have
little choice but to use what they know are unsuitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of land the government provides is not really usable,''
said Carsten Voelz, the manager of Camp Hope, a U.S. camp for
20,000 being constructed in southern Albania. ``But you do what you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Land ownership in this country, which until 1990 forbade private
citizens from owning property, is a complex issue that renders most
sites useless. Aid groups have begun erecting shelters only to have
armed men interrupt their work to evict them. Consequently, many of
the sites made available by the Albanian government were so
undesirable that nobody was willing to fight over them.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Hope, Albania's largest camp, is on a broad, flat plain that
offers no cover from the sun in the summer or wind and rain in the
winter. The 200-acre site is below sea level, and drains poorly, a
situation made worse by the fact that local farmers for decades
have flooded the land as a way to irrigate it. It offers little
water -- the ultimate factor that limits capacity -- so camp
planners hope to pipe water from a well being dug about 10 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   At Spitalli, a German camp designed for 6,000 near the port city
of Durres, conditions are worse. The camp was placed across a
gravel road from a 20-foot wide channel that carries raw sewage
from Durres to a pool from which it is pumped untreated into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   However, the aging pumps -- a best guess places them at about 30
years old -- often breakdown, creating a pool of smelly, putrid and
ultimately unhealthy soup to gather near the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the system of ditches dug between the rows of
tents was so poorly engineered in the haste to build the camp that
water doesn't drain away from the camp. It stands brown and frothy
behind the tents and has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes
and other sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disaster,'' said Roland Amvhein, a C.A.R.E.
International engineer who has been frustrated in his struggle to
correct the problem. ``We try to help these people, and then we put
them in a place like this. Does this make any sense?''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Taillfer, Spitalli's manager, believes the camp must
be abandoned as soon as possible -- certainly before winter. ``It
was not a good site to begin with; in fact, it was a bad site,''
she said. ``The next step must be to move these people to hard
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The nagging, unresolved question is where.
</P>
<P>
   So far, aid workers are far from having an answer even as time
is running out to prepare shelter by September in the mountains and
October in the lowlands. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is
trying with rising urgency to find winter shelter for the refugees
and already is shipping in 15,000 winter tents. But its efforts
thus far have fallen well short of the projected need.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency has identified more than 150 sites both
in buildings and parcels of land for shelter. Yet, only slightly
more than half have been opened to refugees. The maximum identified
capacity is less than 350,000 -- still more than 100,000 less than
the total of refugees now in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Few existing camps provide conditions for refugees to survive
the winter and will have to be radically modified or refugees will
have to be moved to vacant buildings adapted for them the choice
aid workers prefer.
</P>
<P>
   But, far too few buildings remain identified, and the general
condition of vacant buildings in Albania is exceedingly poor --
making it expensive to make them livable.
</P>
<P>
   In the Korca district, for example, city officials have
identified about 40 buildings that can be converted to housing for
about 50 refugees each, or about 2,000 refugees. Yet, one camp in
the district already has 2,700 refugees who will have to be
relocated to winter quarters, while the French army is finishing a
pair of summer camps that will house up to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   As she awaits word on the proposed peace plan that would halt
the NATO bombing and allow the refugees back into Kosovo, Marci Van
Dyke, a Relief International worker who manages the Qatromi camp,
worries about the arithmetic. ``We also are hearing that we may see
another 60,000 refugees from Macedonia,'' she said over coffee in a
shaded canteen at the sun-baked camp. ``There's no way that would
work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, pressures are mounting on Albania to accept
even more refugees, perhaps driving the total to 1 million.
Officials in Macedonia, where there are 250,000 refugees, are
demanding that they be relocated. And NATO officials are pressing
to move the 30,000 refugees near the Yugoslavian border with
Albania in Kukes, which has been the scene of increasing military
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a hurry to relocate them because something bad is
going to happen in Kukes,'' said Paul Giannone, an emergency
planner from C.A.R.E.'s Atlanta office. ``We have absolutely no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, conditions in Albania already are fragile. The crisis thus
far has been contained because of the hospitality of Albanian
families, who are housing an estimated 250,000 refugees in their
homes. But officials worry that their generosity cannot last
forever and that the burden of housing and feeding the refugees
will severely strain the resources of so many families in Europe's
poorest nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government is offering each host family a monthly
supplement of $10 per refugee with a maximum of $120, but officials
worry this is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Kujtim Dashi, a municipal official in the Lezhe prefecture in
northern Albania, said the strain on host families of having
usually more than 10 refugees in their homes is immense. ``In
Albania, we say that 'Our house belongs to God, and our guests,'
but this is very difficult for them,'' said Dashi, who said that
nearly 29,000 refugees have registered in his prefecture. ``Even
Albanians have their limits.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The strain already is proving too much. Aid workers report that
growing numbers of refugees are leaving host families to seek other
shelter. The British-built Qatromi camp in the mountains near
Macedonia already has received 1,000 refugees who had been with
host families.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the rising tension among Albanian families, there
is growing hostility among the refugees who are frustrated by the
harsh realities of life as a ward of relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the mounting pressure of the refugee crisis may be too
much for Albania to bear. Genc Ruli, the president of the Institute
of Contemporary Studies, worries that Albania is sitting on a
ticking refugee bomb. ``This relative stability we see now is
fragile and temporary,'' Ruli said. ``There is a real chance that
we could descend into chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Near the tiny village of Balldren, a mechanic's garage provides
shelter to 58 refugees. They have lived there seven weeks. Among
them are women as old as 90 and newborn babies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few men, Shaban, Krasniqi, a 42-year-old welder,
speaks longingly of his two-story home near Pristina, Kosovo's
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if my home is burned down, I would go back there,' he
says, considering the prospect of spending the next months living
in the garage. ``Even there, we could face the winter when it
comes, making the best of it with our families in our own places.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks at the white concrete block building and shakes his
head. ``But here,'' he says. ``NATO must not let the winter catch
us here.''

FALL FOR THE SEDUCTIVE QUALITIES OF THE VERSATILE ARTICHOKE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photo available on NYT database) 
(Eds.: Also see: Food-artichokes-recipes) 
 
By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you had been the first person to tackle an artichoke, do you
think we still would be eating them today? First you encounter
prickly stickers at the end of the leaves. Then you work your way
through the tough leaves to the fuzzy, inedible thistle. At last,
you reach the small heart.
</P>
<P>
   The miracle is that someone dared to persevere, to discover that
once artichokes are cooked and ``dissected,'' they are a delicious
treat, although only the soft part of the leaves, the heart and the
bottom are edible.
</P>
<P>
   Artichokes are one of the world's oldest known foods _ actually
they are flower buds _ and they are very versatile. They can be
marinated, sauteed, boiled, added to stir-frys, or simmered in
stews and pot roasts.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more elegant as a first course than a steamed
artichoke with a dipping sauce. For a luncheon or light meal, stuff
artichokes with seasoned crumbs, seafood salad, cheese rarebit,
pasta salad or creamed chicken _ or even a favorite cooked frozen
entree.
</P>
<P>
   Baby artichokes are increasingly popular. They have no fuzz or
fibrous leaves in the center, so you can trim them for a completely
edible artichoke.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, artichokes are mature when picked, whether
baby or jumbo size. Artichokes of various sizes develop on the same
plant; the baby chokes grow at the bottom where they are protected
from the sun by the plant fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Most artichokes grown in the United States come from California.
They are available year-round, but the season peaks from March to
May. The fall crop usually peaks in October. This year's crop
matured later than usual, and we should have a good supply into
June. It won't set a record, but is the best recent crop. The past
three years' bad weather in California caused severe losses.
</P>
<P>
   To store, do not wash artichokes before refrigerating. They will
keep as long as two weeks if you drizzle a few drops of water on
each artichoke, then seal in an airtight plastic bag and
refrigerate at 32 to 34 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Basic preparation is the same for large or baby artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   For whole, medium or large artichokes, wash under cool running
water, pull off the lower outer petals, and cut stems to 1 inch or
less. Snip off the tips of petals if desired, and drop artichokes
into water acidulated with lemon juice to preserve the green color.
</P>
<P>
   For baby artichokes, bend back the lower, outer petals until
they snap off easily near the base. Cut off the top third or just
below the green tips of the petals with a sharp stainless-steel
knife. Pare remaining dark green areas from bases. Cut off stems.
Halve or quarter as desired. If center petals are purple or pink,
remove them and the fuzzy centers. If the interior of the baby
artichoke is white, the whole artichoke is edible. Dip it in lemon
juice, or rub all surfaces with lemon juice. Cook as directed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COOKING METHODS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ To boil: Stand artichokes in a large pan with 3 quarts
boiling, salted water. If desired, add olive or vegetable oil,
lemon juice and seasonings. Cover and boil gently 20 to 40 minutes
according to size or until a petal near the center pulls out
easily. Drain. For baby artichokes, cook 10 to 15 minutes. After 10
minutes, test with a toothpick stuck in the base where stem was
cut.
</P>
<P>
   _ To steam: Place artichokes on a rack above boiling water,
cover and steam 25 to 40 minutes depending on size or until petal
near center pulls out easily. (Baby artichokes require only about
10 minutes). Because of steam, remove lid carefully.
</P>
<P>
   _ To microwave: Rinse artichokes well in cool water. Pull off
the lowest petals and trim stem even with bottom of choke. There's
no need to snip the prickly, pointy tip from each leaf because the
tip softens during cooking. Do cut 1/2 inch off the top, however.
For 1 medium artichoke, place it upside down in a glass custard cup
or measuring cup. Cover with vented plastic wrap. Microwave on high
4 to 5 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. If stuffing, spoon out the
fuzzy choke.
</P>
<P>
   To microwave several at a time, place them upside down in
custard cups or a single large casserole. For 2 artichokes,
microwave 7 minutes; 3 artichokes, 10 minutes; 4 artichokes, 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Artichokes are an important source of vitamin C, folic acid and
magnesium. They are virtually fat-free and are low in sodium. A
12-ounce artichoke provides 25 calories, 3 grams protein, 6 grams
carbohydrates, 185 milligrams potassium and 75 milligrams sodium.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid discoloration, cook artichokes in a nonreactive metal,
enamel or ceramic pan and cut with a stainless steel knife.

detected years ago

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORREON, Mexico _ The first studies indicating that lead dust
was poisoning children in this northern Mexican industrial city go
back about 20 years, enough to produce two generations of victims.
</P>
<P>
   That was long before Julio Cesar Olage, 4, and his sister
Guadalupe, 1, were hospitalized in May with enough lead in their
blood to put them in a coma and cause permanent brain damage and
physical harm.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mother, Esperanza Olage, fears it may be too late
for her toddlers despite the treatment they are receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my other children have been in special education,'' she
said, fighting grief and exhaustion. ``Just look at that one over
there, Maria Elena. She's 18 now, and she can't read or write.''
</P>
<P>
   Olage's youngest children, who have spent two weeks in the
hospital, are among the more than 2,800 children under 12 in
Torreon who have been identified in recent months as having
unacceptable, even extremely dangerous levels of lead in their
blood that could cause mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Torreon has fast become synonymous with neglect and
the tragic consequences of letting industries pollute the
environment, no matter how many jobs they provide.
</P>
<P>
   In one Torreon neighborhood, more than 90 percent of all the
children are contaminated with lead, many at levels so high they
should be under close medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
   That neighborhood, the working-class barrio of Luis Echeverria,
is just a fence away from Met-Mex Penoles, the world's
fourth-largest metal refinery.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Del Pilar family, whose house is next to the
fence, lead has poisoned two generations that has breathed and
ingested dust from the refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Julieta del Pilar was 3 in 1981 when she tested high for lead
during a survey of schoolchildren here conducted by Mexican
university researchers.
</P>
<P>
   She had 34 micrograms of lead for every deciliter of blood,
which at that time was considered abnormal in the United States and
now is considered enough to cause mental retardation if exposure is
not reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican environmental officials failed to react to the research.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Julieta -- who was never able to learn to read or
write -- gave birth to a son, Juan Alberto, 1. He recently tested
at an alarming 60 and Julieta, who was tested because she was
breastfeeding, was told her level was now 67.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta consider a lead
level over 10 unacceptable. Children with levels over 25 should be
in treatment and removed immediately from contaminated sites. Those
with levels over 70 are considered a medical emergency. Children
are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning because their bodies
and brains are still developing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 2,800 contaminated children of Torreon, 732 measured
at levels between 25 and 39. Another 604 registered levels between
40 and 69. The total of children over 70 is not known yet.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 children have been hospitalized so far, including
4-year-old Julio Cesar Olage, who was admitted at a potentially
devastating 96 and 1-year-old Guadalupe Olage, who measured 83.
</P>
<P>
   Torreon, a stark, desert city 300 miles south of the Texas
border, was forced to confront this epidemic earlier this year,
when the Coahuila state government here ordered the Penoles
refinery to conduct a massive clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   This includes installing new equipment to contain the lead dust
released from raw ore trucked into the refinery, and working with
health officials to hospitalize some children and make sure others
are treated with vitamin and mineral supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Using a $6.4 million fund it has established, the company must
also buy the families' property in Luis Echeverria so it can be
demolished and cleansed of heavy metals and the families relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Many families here are fighting with the company over offers for
their houses, which they say are too low. Meanwhile, the majority
of the affected children are still living in the neighborhood,
which Penoles sweeps and cleans every day with industrial vacuums
and ordinary brooms in an attempt to lower the lead count in
children remaining in the barrio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have children with long-term damage. I can't deny
that,'' said Edmundo Mesta, a doctor and occupational health
specialist who has worked for Penoles for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Mesta has been put in charge of registering children, cleaning
the barrio and trying to reverse Penoles' credibility gap with the
community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 and 1995, Penoles was audited by environmental officials
and ordered to improve equipment to reduce dangers inside the plant
and threatening emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking inside the plant, at our workers and their
health,'' Mesta said. ``But no one took the time to stop and think
about what we have done to the community in our almost 100 years of
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesta and environmental officials say that lead dust wafting
over the fence from deliveries of raw minerals is the prime source
that's been poisoning the children. Neither emissions from
processing or a giant heap of slag that towers over the refinery's
property are culprits, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say the full magnitude of Torreon's
environmental health disaster -- one of Mexico's worst to date --
hasn't yet been measured.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians and toxicologists say children should also be
tested for traces of other heavy metals, including cadmium and
arsenic. Both are carcinogenic and are so abundant around the
Torreon factory they too pose a major health risk, according to a
study by Dartmouth Medical School published in April.
</P>
<P>
   More children living in barrios beyond Luis Echeverria should
also be tested, said Jose Manuel Velasco, a Torreon pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could a minimum of 6,000 children affected,'' Velasco
said. ``The government's work is not over with.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Velasco found lead in alarming quantities in infants
and toddlers he was treating for other ailments. He reported to
state health officials, who did nothing, and then brought his
grievances to the state legislature, which ordered testing.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been slow to adopt standards governing lead emissions
and other safety requirements that could have prevented the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists argue that studies indicating that Torreon
was in trouble have long been dismissed because officials were
reluctant to crack down on powerful industries.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicologist Lilia Albert began surveys of lead in Torreon's
children in 1978 while she was affiliated with Mexico City's Center
for Investigation and Advanced Studies of the National
Polytechnical Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities ``tried to minimize our findings,'' Albert said. ``I
think the problem was that they didn't want to affect the economy
because the refinery employs so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penoles refinery, owned by Alberto Bailleres, one of
Mexico's wealthiest men, employs about 2,100 here.
</P>
<P>
   Torreon, a city of 500,000, is a company town, where Penoles
distributes coloring books to children about a happy miner and a
main street is called Metallurgical Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although she can't recall exactly when, Albert reported her
initial findings of high lead levels at an academic conference not
long after she took hair samples from children in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   She also informed federal environmental officials.
</P>
<P>
   They told her the hair samples were too few and were
insufficient proof of a problem, Albert said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert's findings as well as the conclusions of other surveys
taken in 1981 were published in a document in 1986 she says was
also ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The company and federal environmental officials argue that the
studies were not corroborated or widely disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a toxicologist at Mexico's University of Durango
-- working in cooperation with the refinery -- published a study
that also confirmed that children were contaminated by lead.
</P>
<P>
   That helped spotlight Torreon's epidemic, although some in the
community had already been demanding action for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story of complicity between the company and the
government,'' said Francisco Valdez, a university science professor
in Torreon who said he called studies to officials' attention more
than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, parents keeping vigil at Torreon hospitals and those
with children still in the barrio are worried their children are
not receiving proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 children in hospitals are receiving succimer, a
drug that removes lead from the body in extreme cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's how many they're treating, that's nothing,'' said
Andres Lugo of the West Texas Regional Poison Center in El Paso,
Texas. He was asked to go to Torreon to give doctors training in
the treatment of heavy metal poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo recommended that many more children be given the drug. But
the company says it has to evaluate each child first and make sure
he won't be returning to Luis Echeverria after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 days in a hospital, 3-year-old Alfredo Mendiola, for
example, was still undergoing a battery of tests to determine the
extent of his poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   In April Alfredo tested at 71 and was admitted to the hospital
at 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the company is a killer. It is killing our children,''
said his mother, Eva. ``What will happen to them in the future?''

LAWMAKERS VOTE TO EXPAND HATE CRIMES LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California's hate crime law would get
beefed up for murderers of gays, lesbians and the disabled under a
measure approved by the Assembly with strong Republican support.
</P>
<P>
   Current California law requires a sentence of life in prison
without parole or the death penalty for anyone who deliberately
sets out to kill someone because of race, color, religion or
nationality.
</P>
<P>
   A measure written by Assemblyman Wally Knox, a Democrat from Los
Angeles, would add disability, gender and sexual orientation to
that list with one important caveat: It would not give jurors the
option of imposing the death penalty in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his own objections and concerns from gays and
lesbians, Knox's bill would instead increase the penalty from the
current 25 years to life in prison, to life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district attorneys literally were having cases where
people confessed that they had murdered people because they were
gay or lesbian, and could not charge them with special
circumstances,'' Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   His measure passed the Assembly Wednesday with a 55-17 vote and
now moves to the Senate. The bill got the support from some of the
most conservative Republicans, who saw the legislation as tough on
crime.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican, Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose, offered an
amendment Wednesday to add the death penalty to the bill, but was
turned down by the Democrat-controlled Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Knox bill, a prosecutor must prove the victim was
intentionally killed because of his or her actual or ``perceived''
disability, gender or sexual orientation. The bias must be an
actual cause or substantial factor in prompting the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Justice said 10 people had been
murdered in the state between 1995 and 1997 as a result of hate
crimes, although a number for gay-related murders was not
available. There were 112 gay-related hate crimes, none of them
murders, in San Francisco last year, according to the city Hate
Crimes Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted in part by the murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie,
Wyo., last year, more than 450 bills have been introduced in
legislatures around the country this year on issues important to
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is tracking several in
California, including a measure to protect gay and lesbian high
school students from discrimination.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS MAY FACE CHALLENGES OVER BUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When does a software bug cross over from
annoying glitch to class-action lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed in New Jersey challenged imperfect versions of
software, in this case leading the software publisher to release a
free fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a line drawn between a bug and a design
defect,'' said Michael Boni, the Philadelphia lawyer who filed the
class-action case against Franklin Electronics Publishers Inc. of
Burlington, N.J. ``And the courts have to do that drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer users expect occasional software bugs, the errors that
hamper a software title's performance. Consumers either wait for
the software publisher to issue a fix or hope that the bug is
repaired in the next version to appear, which they usually have to
pay for.
</P>
<P>
   It's an uneasy relationship that's akin to buying a new car that
sometimes refuses to start.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the car, though, government-ordered recalls and
consumer lawsuits are common remedies. In the case of defective
software, users have been content to complain to customer support
lines, hunt the Internet for fixes or simply give up and buy new
software.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey man, Jacob Winigrad, refused to follow that route.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Winigrad bought a REX PC companion, a
best-selling credit card-sized electronic organizer that let him
track his phone list, keep a calendar and to prioritize a to-do
list.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Winigrad's REX PC companion had an
annoying habit of scrambling the order of his to-do lists, contrary
to the claims of Franklin Electronics Publishers, the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   When Winigrad called Franklin's product support line, he was
told the company knew of the problem, but that it could not, or
would not, fix it _ an all-too-familiar scenario for home software
users.
</P>
<P>
   Winigrad also alleged he was charged for every minute he was on
Franklin's product support telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus,'' his complaint states, ``plaintiff was advised that he
would be billed $2 per minute, just to learn that the product he
purchased, and which was under warranty, was defective and would
not be repaired or replaced by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, 1998, Winigrad filed a class-action lawsuit against
Franklin in Camden County, N.J., Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   In his multicount complaint, Winigrad accused Franklin of
negligence, breach of warranty and violation of New Jersey consumer
protection laws. Winigrad alleged that the REX he and others bought
was defective in design.
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement reached last month, Franklin announced it would
issue a free software upgrade to fix the REX's to-do list priority
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Franklin vigorously denies any liability,'' the
company said, ``it has agreed to settle the case to avoid the
burden of continued litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin did not return phone calls seeking comment on the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent PC World magazine poll, almost 80 percent
of its subscribers said they had bought software that contained
bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buggy software is a huge problem,'' said Scott Spanbauer, PC
World contributing editor who writes the magazine's monthly ``Bugs
and Fixes'' column. ``It's a massive waste of time and utterly
frustrating, and we pretty much take it lying down.''
</P>
<P>
   The software industry counters that producing bug-free software
is impossible, given the different combinations of computers,
printers, scanners, Internet connections and other configurations
that users install software on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can test and retest and retest software in as many
configurations that you can think of, and there will always be
someone who will use the software in a way you didn't anticipate,''
said Lauren Hall, chief technology officer for the Software and
Information Industry Association, a Washington, D.C., software
publishers group. ``It's just impossible to create bug-free
software titles.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One proposed package of legal remedies for software bugs is the
Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act, which would help
state lawmakers and courts arbitrate software defect disputes. The
guidelines will be voted on in July when the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws meets in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   These guidelines, backed by software industry heavyweights such
as the Microsoft Corp. and IBM, have been roundly criticized by
consumer groups as favoring software publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines ``permit software sellers to write contracts that
sidestep the usual statutes and case law protecting consumers,''
said Jamie Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a
Washington, D.C., advocacy group started by Ralph Nader. ``They
want to elevate themselves above the law, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery Simon, counselor with the Washington, D.C.-based Business
Software Alliance, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   The Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act was drafted by
a committee of specialists, said Simon, whose group represents
software companies.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal ``was created to ensure uniformity in dealing with
these problems, not overturn or otherwise do harm to existing
law.''

  THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES: IAN McDIARMID RETURNS TO `STAR WARS'

 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., JUNE 14, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Ian
McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine in ``Star Wars: The Phantom
Menace.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ever since the words ``The Phantom Menace'' first leaked out of
Lucasfilm headquarters, ``Star Wars'' aficionados were tortured by
the mystery: Never mind what is the matrix _ who or what was the
phantom menace?
 &HT;    The Internet offered various contradictory, unsubstantiated
ideas, none of them very convincing. The trailers didn't provide
any hints. The cast and production staff were uniformly unhelpful.
 &HT;    Nobody seemed to know, and everybody yearned to.
 &HT;    Well, everybody except for Ian McDiarmid, who wasn't yearning at
all. And no wonder, since he himself is the phantom menace.
 &HT;    As both Senator Palpatine and the evil Sith Lord Darth Sidious,
it's McDiarmid who wreaks all sorts of cosmic havoc on Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Queen Amidala
(Natalie Portman) in ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    It shouldn't have been so great a surprise _ after all, we'd
already seen McDiarmid back in 1984 as the merciless but aged
Emperor Palpatine in ``Return of the Jedi,'' and it was clear that
the Emperor knew more than a little about the Dark Side.
 &HT;    As for McDiarmid, he had a ball.
 &HT;    ``It was an incredibly unique opportunity,'' the gentlemanly
McDiarmid says during a conversation in the bar at the Almeida
Theatre, headquarters of the London company which he serves as
co-artistic director. ``I was under four hours of Nick Dudman's
very expert makeup for `Return of the Jedi,' and in `The Phantom
Menace' I am basically myself _ though I got about 10 years' help
from a hairpiece.
 &HT;    ``For all intents and purposes, Palpatine looks like me,'' he
said. ``That's sort of fascinating. In my career as an actor I've
often played older than myself, but you don't often go backwards in
time _ when you're really 15 years older _ to play a character
younger than yourself, and far younger than the same character
you've already played.''
 &HT;    McDiarmid spends much of ``The Phantom Menace'' wearing a
bemused, knowing smirk, and he never raises his voice. In one of
the film's tastiest scenes, Palpatine cryptically informs Anakin
Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) _ who we know will emerge as the Emperor's
deadly henchman, Darth Vader _ that he plans to watch the boy's
career very closely.
 &HT;    ``We actually shot that scene about a month before the film came
out,'' McDiarmid says. ``Anyway, it's true what they say about
playing kings and rulers, whether it's in Shakespeare or in `Star
Wars' _ it's not so much what you do, it's what everyone else
around you does.
 &HT;    ``The actor playing the king or ruler must relax and be the
center of it all. That's what I attempted to do throughout the
film.''
 &HT;    The Scottish-born McDiarmid knows from epics _ his credits
include 1981's ``Dragonslayer'' and 1995's ``Restoration,'' as well
as such stage shows as ``Volpone,'' in which he co-starred with his
``great friend'' Denis Lawson.
 &HT;    That makes a third ``Star Wars'' connection for Lawson, who not
only played Wedge, the X-Wing Red Leader in all three of the first
trilogy, but also happens to be Ewan McGregor's uncle.
 &HT;    The whole firestorm of publicity over ``The Phantom Menace'' has
been rather amusing to the 50-something actor, who had never been
associated with an event movie previously. He hadn't paid a lot of
attention to the gathering ``Star Wars'' hype over the last couple
of years, he reports.
 &HT;    In fact, until ``Star Wars'' honcho George Lucas called out of
the blue to invite McDiarmid out for a drink to discuss ``The
Phantom Menace,'' the two men hadn't seen each other in 15 years.
 &HT;    But McDiarmid was delighted to work with Lucas again, especially
since this time he would actually be directed by Lucas, who had
served only as producer on ``Return of the Jedi.''
 &HT;    ``George is, literally, physically and in every other way, in
charge,'' McDiarmid says. ``There are no suits, there's no studio
pressure, there's just George _ and that allowed us to concentrate
on the essence of the film.
 &HT;    ``I am thrilled that George seems determined to be at the helm
in every sense again for `Episode II' and perhaps even for `Episode
III,''' McDiarmid says. ``That's great for everybody, for the cast
and crew and for the fans of `Star Wars.'
 &HT;    ``I think `Star Wars' is as important to George as `The Ring'
cycle was to Wagner. It's absolutely in his blood.''
 NEXT WEEK  
 &HT;    Director Barry Sonnenfeld takes an advance look at ``The Wild,
Wild West.''

WHEN STYLE MEETS MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Retransmission for clients)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From designer Maurice Malone's new record company to Vogue's
supplement on music and style to rapper Master P's sports
management company, record company, and clothing company, there's a
revolution brewing in popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Rappers are launching clothing lines. Designers are starting
record labels. Sports magazines are publishing style guides. The
name of the game is fusion, and extending your brand name is the
ticket to greater glory _ and gold.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweights in these industries are emulating each other's
winning styles to arm themselves for the marketplace of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs an advertising budget anymore? ``You can use your
music videos and your artists on your label to show your clothes,''
says Malone, who has designed sportswear under his Mo Jeans and
Malone Sport labels since 1994. He launched the company Hostile
Takeover Records in December with the rationale: ``You can talk
about your clothes in the songs and hype the name,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, magazines, apparel companies, and musicians share
the same target audience, so the ability to cross over is not
surprising. The popularity of a flashy music producer/rapper like
Sean ``Puffy'' Combs (also known as Puff Daddy), is enough to
persuade consumers to try his new clothing line, Sean John, and his
new lifestyle/fashion magazine, Notorious. (He's co-publisher.)
Likewise, hip-hop clothing brand FUBU is focused enough on
athletics that its new official NBA collection _ which features
FUBU and NBA team logos on apparel _ is a natural progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-promotion only makes sense,'' says Chris Wilder,
executive editor of The Source Sports, a one-year-old sports
magazine whose coverage includes sneaker previews and spreads of
athletic clothing. The Source Sports is patterned after its sister
publication The Source, an 11-year-old hip-hop music, cultural, and
political magazine. ``The same people who are buying hip-hop
clothing are buying hip-hop music'' and watching sports, says
Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is gaining momentum at a time when boundaries that
have traditionally divided areas of culture are breaking down.
``Fashion has become part of the entertainment world,'' says Todd
Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the University of Southern
California's School of Cinema and Television. ``You don't have to
be an actor or a musician to be a celebrity anymore. Supermodels
are very visible celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's supermodels who've been bumped off the covers
of many fashion magazines by a new force in fashion _ pop and
hip-hop divas. For Vogue's Music &AMP; Style supplement in April (which
featured stories on the music and fashion industries), the magazine
chose singer Lauryn Hill for its cover.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement is ``the logical evolution of the Hollywood and
fashion collision that's going on now,'' says Katherine Betts,
Vogue's fashion news director. ``It seems designers who reached out
to Hollywood are now reaching out to the music world. . . . And a
lot of young musicians, especially in the hip-hop world, want to
wear designer clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports and music have always been connected to fashion in
various ways, of course. ``Sports has probably been the main
influence on men's fashion in the 20th century,'' says Valerie
Steele, chief curator of the museum at the Fashion Institute of
Technology in New York. ``Especially the mania for sneakers and
sweats.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hilfiger, the brother of designer Tommy Hilfiger, is also
vice president of public relations for Tommy Jeans and founder of
the record label AH! ``In the '60s, everybody wanted to check out
the Stones and Jimi Hendrix to see what they had on. Rock stars
always made fashion statements,'' says Hilfiger, a performer
himself who plans to release a classic rock album next year. ``I
remember Tommy used to look at album covers and wonder where to
find Mick Jagger's snakeskin boots or leather pants.''
</P>
<P>
   But recent cultural developments have made the combination of
music, sports, and fashion all the more appealing financially. With
business casual dress codes gaining popularity in the workplace,
there are more opportunities for consumers to wear sports- and
music-inspired clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer ghettoized as a youth thing,'' says Steele.
``Suddenly Wall Street guys are wearing baseball caps backwards (to
and from work). The insignia of being cool and hip is wearing
sporty clothes. The clothes have all the association of people who
are strong and physically confident _ and by extension, virile and
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The reign of hip-hop as a dominant cultural force has also
played a major role. ``Hip-hop is a materialistic lifestyle. To
express themselves in their songs, artists talk about the cars they
drive and the clothes they wear,'' says Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason a lot of artists are going into fashion themselves
is because they realized they were making money for other companies
by talking about their clothes in their songs. They weren't getting
paid for it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many of the people involved in the trend don't have
the expertise or background necessary to become CEOs of record or
clothing companies. But in today's society, experts say, it doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more money you have, the more power you have. In our
culture, you can market yourself in any way you want if you have
enough backing,'' says Jill Carey, assistant professor of fashion
history at the Institute of Fashion Technology at Lasell College in
Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole trend toward one company doing everything has been
evolving over the past 15 years. It's a mega mentality. It kind of
reminds me of Wal-Mart. That's a mega store. These are mega people.
And I don't think we're critical anymore. . . . Andy Hilfiger?
There's no negative connotations associated with him. I don't know
what he sounds like. But most people are open to listening.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two trendsetters say their motives for launching record
companies aren't strictly financial. Malone, a Detroit native, has
been involved in music for years. In the early 1990s, he operated a
night club and a clothing store called the Hip Hop Shop, where he
hosted open-mike nights for rap artists to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is something I knew I would do eventually,'' he says.
``I wanted to wait until I could finance the project and make it
work.'' So far, Malone has signed Proof, a Detroit rapper, and
Bullets and Gunsmoke (BAG), a rap group from Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hilfiger, who sings and plays the guitar and bass, has also
been linked to music for years. ``I played in a lot of bands,'' he
says. ``When I started working for Tommy, I started dressing a lot
of groups. My department became an A&AMP;R department. I got demo tapes
and letters. Musicians wanted sponsorships, product placements, and
they wanted to be models. We became a whole music department
through fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Hilfiger was dressing Snoop Doggy Dogg and Coolio
for ``Saturday Night Live'' and consulting with Quincy Jones's
record label Qwest Records. ``Quincy told me to start bringing him
music,'' says Hilfiger, who has about 1,000 demo tapes in his
office. So he started AH! last September. ``I'm a talent scout for
Quincy. I sign the group. He distributes and markets it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hilfiger empire continues its expansion plans. Tommy
Hilfiger has declared 1999 the year of music since 90 percent of
his promotions are music-related. The company is sponsoring concert
tours for the Rolling Stones, Lilith Fair, and Britney Spears. All
those musicians will wear Hilfiger items onstage. Its ads in
fashion magazines depict staged scenes from those concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also financing an upcoming exhibit in New York at
the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art tentatively
titled ``Icons of Rock Style.'' The exhibit, which will run from
December to March 2000, will spotlight classic rock performers and
their influence on fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is an integral part of my life and my career
inspiration,'' says Tommy Hilfiger. ``As a company, it makes sense
for us to be involved in the music industry because music is of
interest to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Where will the trend end? Will rappers one day own sports
franchses? Malone says he plans to produce movies eventually.
``That's what I originally wanted to do before I got into
fashion,'' he says. ``After `Star Wars' came out, I intended to be
a special-effects artist.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment though, Malone has his hands full. With so many
professional basketball and football players hanging out at his New
York office to check out his latest sportswear designs, Malone is
scheming. ``I'm really interested in getting these guys some
suits,'' he says. ``They need special sizes. When they go to their
own tailor, the tailors don't do that good a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking `Hmm. There's a good market.' ''

   LEHZE, Albania _ Since NATO began its punishing air campaign
against Serb forces in Yugoslavia on March 24, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that about 855,000
people, the vast majority of them ethnic Albanians, have left
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Another 500,000-700,000 -- of Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic
Albanians -- is believed to be displaced within the embattled Serb
province.

 &HT;    KUKES: A POOR ALBANIAN CITY HOSTS EVEN POORER REFUGEES
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., June 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ In the cool springtime mornings here, acrid
smoke hangs close to the ground from the burning garbage in a dump
at the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   The water supply, now rationed to two-hours per day, is low and
only the lucky few who rise before the sun will have showers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everywhere is the rank odor of open sewage and sweat as
the sun inches higher in the sky, and the temperature rises with
it.
</P>
<P>
   So begins the day for 25,000 locals in Kukes and four times as
many refugees living in and around the ramshackle town now
distinguished as the home to Kosovo's dispossessed ethnic
Albanians. Roughly 400,000 refugees have passed through Kukes, and
100,000 have remained in dusty tent camps and crowded private
homes, making it the epicenter of Europe's biggest humanitarian
crisis since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of fame we could have done without,''
concedes Mayor Safet Sula, 37, a democratic reformer and former
university professor. ``It goes without saying that we have big
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a tide of impoverished refugees descending on a similar
small town in the United States. Now, imagine this town was already
dirt poor, falling apart and rife with unemployment before the
influx of newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of Kukes, a town blessed with beautiful
mountains and cursed by fate. Situated in remote northern Albania
and, like the rest of the country, severed politically for much of
this century from the rest of the world, Kukes is a town that
history largely passed by.
</P>
<P>
   The current town, with its deteriorating block apartments and
potholed streets, was built between 1962 and 1978 after the
construction of a huge hydro-electric dam, whose reservoir flooded
the valley and the historic village of Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the people residing among the Alp-like Vikut
Mountains here stretch back to the Illyrian tribes, identified by
the Greeks when they settled the coastal areas of what is now
Albania in the 7th century B.C. Next came the Romans, whose
spreading empire incorporated the area as part of the province of
Macedonia in 146 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Turks followed to encompass the remote area as
part of the Ottoman Empire. But frigid in the winter and broiling
in the summer, Kukes never showed much promise for settlement or
commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, historian Edward Gibbon wrote of Albania
that ``within sight of Italy is (a land) less known than the
interior of America.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   No one can seem to agree on why the place is called Kukes (which
Albanians alternatively pronounce ``kook-ESS,'' ``KOOK-see,'' or
simply ``KOOKS''). One legend says Kukes derives its name from the
cuckoo bird. Others believe two more plausible theories: that the
name either comes from the Illyrian word for ``forest,'' or that
Kukes took its name from a 17th century Turkish military leader who
commanded a garrison nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its roots, it was never a large place. A 1938 estimate
put the population at only 1,800. Electricity did not arrive until
1946, when engineers plundered a German tank left behind after the
war and used its diesel engine as a generator.
</P>
<P>
   Italian engineers carved the roads across the rough mountains in
the 1920s and little has been done to improve them since. Until
1991, private ownership of cars was restricted by the communist
regime, so few automobiles plowed the paths now being chewed up by
heavy trucks delivering supplies and moving refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In the region's knotty history, schoolchildren learn of
legendary battles fought in the Kukes valley between Albanian
militias outnumbered by powerful armies -- the Turks in 1909 and
the Serbs in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In Communist times, under the rule of Albanian dictator Ever
Hoxha, Kukes was eyed as a potential tourist spot, as it sits
astride the man-made lake and scenic mountains. But mining of
copper and chromium, once the town's major job-producer, dumped its
by-products directly into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   When Communism fell, the mines went out of business, leaving
people in Kukes without jobs and with a lake tainted by heavy
metals.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest public building, the whitewashed Mosque of Salim Ben
Mahfuz, was opened in 1995, financed by an Egyptian religious
foundation. But almost no one attends it. While Albania is a mostly
Muslim country, its legacy of Communism means there are few devout.
</P>
<P>
   The annual per capita income of Albania, a country of 3.4
million, is $830, the lowest in Europe. Officially, unemployment in
Kukes was 40 percent before the onset of the refugee crisis.
Unofficially, the figure is put at 80 percent. gap???
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the refugees live in private homes, not the
camps, stretching the resources of Kukes to their breaking point.
The city has asked international relief agencies for help to expand
its aging water system. The mountains of garbage being generated by
the population boom are simply being piled at the northern end of
town and torched.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very poor place. There are no jobs for the Albanians
who live here, much less for the refugees,'' said Imri Gashi, 38,
who worked as a construction foreman in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The main occupation is trading, much of it illegal. Since
Communist rule collapsed in Albania in 1991, the government has
been unable to control its borders. Bandits rule in much of the
northeast, emblematic of the nationwide lawlessness following a
coup in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the world will never really know us -- ever,''
laments Nasif Dukle, a local teacher and the town's historian.
``I'm afraid it will be a strong and lasting memory of war and of
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis has been a boom to local hotels and restaurants
in the town. English-speaking Albanians are earning as much as $100
a day working for aid agencies and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like it was sent from heaven. It is raining money, and
maybe it will last only another month. But everyone is making as
much as they can now,'' says Jonas, a local translator.
</P>
<P>
   One tangible gift of the refugee crisis is a new dirt and gravel
airfield, built by engineers from the United Arab Emirates and
replacing an unusable runway built in 1937 by the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   The town's mayor wants more. He puts faith in NATO that the
Balkans can be put straight, and Kukes will for the first time in
its history have a chance to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that things will change in a good way,'' Sula, the
mayor, says. ``If the problems of Kosovo are solved and the border
is open, we can have new markets for our goods and new friendships.
This could be an important crossroads for that.''

`HURRAH AT LAST': MAKING MINCEMEAT OF BOOMER VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It comes as only a small surprise that a character in
``Hurrah at Last'' suddenly breaks into an Italian aria, since the
scale of Richard Greenberg's eccentric new comedy, which opened
Thursday night at the Gramercy Theater, is nothing if not operatic.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this offbeat piece, full of what can only be
described as good-natured bile, is BIG, from the ego of the hero,
played by a wondrously stewing and sputtering Peter Frechette, to
the kitchen cabinets, towering pine behemoths out of a shelter
magazine for circus freaks.
</P>
<P>
   Even the ``vast dog,'' in Greenberg's memorable phrasing, that
runs amok in the Act I loft party looks like a midsize Oldsmobile.
He's a 200-pound English mastiff named Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, whose urbane yuppie dramas, like ``Eastern Standard''
and ``Three Days of Rain,'' have earned him renown as a boomer
balladeer, is aiming here for something big: big laughs, that is,
at the expense of the generation he has so assiduously chronicled
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hurrah at Last'' he takes his sharply observed points and
plunges them in the backs of these selfish and insecure people.
Many of the sacred boomer concerns _ infertility, disposable
income, tortured parental relationships, obsessions with status and
creature comforts _ are ground up and re-served as souped-up
satire.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the potshots he takes are exceedingly funny, like when
Frechette, playing a broke and miserable gay writer named Laurie,
sneezes wetly into the face of the friend's baby he's been
compelled to swaddle.
</P>
<P>
   Or when he calls his terminally disgusted Jewish mother (the
droll Dori Brenner) on the carpet for putting up with a dry
marriage not unlike ``a Saturday morning cartoon written by August
Strindberg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurrah at Last,'' presented at the Gramercy as part of the
Roundabout Theater Company season, ultimately doesn't hold together
particularly well, despite the brisk production by David Warren and
some spicy banter from Frechette, Ms. Brenner, Larry Keith and
Judith Blazer.
</P>
<P>
   Target practice is mostly what Greenberg is engaged in; the
scenes, imagined and real (and punctuated by John Gromada's music
for winds and percussion, which sounds a lot like the incidental
music in ``Art''), are mere excuses for Laurie to confront the
people in his life and the demons in his head, and to get some
things off his chest. The proceedings seem to flail along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no matter how scattered, it's not an unpleasant purging;
Greenberg's epigrams are often delivered in juicy sound bites. ``It
doesn't buy happiness,'' says Laurie's friend Oliver (Paul Michael
Valley), speaking of money. Yes, the broke Laurie replies, ``but it
upgrades despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie _ ``I'm the only boy who was named after a character in
`Little Women''' _ is indeed in desperate straits. He's a starving
novelist, sick and embittered, surrounded by wealthy relatives and
friends whose success only infuriates him further.
</P>
<P>
   They gather at a Christmas party thrown by his sister Thea
(Ileen Getz), who has been having no luck in her efforts to
conceive a child with her husband, Eamon (Kevin O'Rourke), an Irish
multimillionaire. Along with their mother and father (Ms. Brenner
and Keith) Thea invites Oliver, a vapid playwright with a big hit
under his belt; his shockingly fertile wife, Gia (Ms. Blazer), and
the leviathan Thunder (played, according to the credits, by
Dreyfus).
</P>
<P>
   Frechette is at his most engaging when he is foaming at the
mouth. Jealous of Oliver, resentful of his mother, contemptuous of
his sister, Laurie is an impossible brat who exists chiefly to
carp, and what he is most upset about is money. Much of the first
act is consumed with Laurie's complaint that the only intimate
details people guard zealously are about their finances.
</P>
<P>
   This is the setup for a scene in which Oliver strips naked for
Laurie but refuses to reveal how much he is being paid to adapt
Laurie's novel for the movies.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as close to profound as ``Hurrah at Last'' gets. It
has been packaged attractively; they could start taking orders
today for the interiors by the set designer Neil Patel, especially
Thea's killer kitchen. The play, too, is all surface. Like Thunder,
it throws its weight around, in a harmlessly playful sort of way. &QL;

 &HT;    HOME SCHOOLERS AT BEES BEAT THE ODDS
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. Optional material is usable as a separate box.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fast-spreading home schooling movement got
another boost from this year's national spelling and geography
bees.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, at least 5 percent of the
participants in the National Spelling Bee were being educated by
their parents at home, rather than in a public or private school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess cream rises to the top,'' joked Bry(cq) Conley of
Newark, Calif., as she discussed the strong showing by her son Sean
and the dozen other home schoolers among the 249 students in the
spelling bee.
</P>
<P>
   In the televised climax Thursday, two of the eight finalists
were home-schooled. They were Ann Foley, 13, of Marion, Ohio, who
tied for sixth, and George Thampy, 11, of Maryland Heights, Mo.,
who tied for third.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, five of the 55 contestants in the National Geography
Bee were home schoolers, and David Beihl of Saluda, S.C., became
the first home schooler to win the geography bee. In the spelling
bee, the first and only home schooler to win so far was Rebecca
Sealfon of Brooklyn, N.Y., two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spelling and geography bees offer confirmation that home
schooling can work very well indeed,'' said Michael Farris,
president of the Home School Legal Defense Association in
Purcellville, Va., which helped topple many legal barriers to home
schooling. ``I think the movement's coming of age.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing by home schoolers really beats the odds. U.S.
Department of Education studies indicate that their numbers have
more than doubled in this decade, and now probably exceed 1
million. But that is still less than 2 percent of all children of
school age.
</P>
<P>
   Home schooling ``is excellent for a very few parents, with very
strong motivation,'' said K. George Thampy, shortly before his
son's third-place finish Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thampy works as a biochemist and physician, and his wife Bina
teaches young George, his two brothers and three sisters at their
home near St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision to home-school our children was scripturally
based,'' Thampy said. ``We wanted their education to stress
character development and godly values which are not promoted in
local schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Conley, on the other hand, said she and her husband, Mike, a
software engineer, were primarily interested in creating
``customized educations'' for Sean, 11, and his two younger
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's cool about home schooling is that you can pick up
whatever method, subjects or approaches work for your family and
for your kid,'' said Conley. She said her sons will sometimes
concentrate on one to three subjects for two to three months in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents who try to reproduce the factory-school system _ you
sit at the kitchen table and study the same courses as regular
schools from 9 to 3 _ burn out after two or three years,'' Conley
said. ``But that's what's great about home schooling: If you don't
agree with me, you can do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of all home schooling parents are motivated by
religion, usually Christian,'' said policy analyst Kevin Welner of
the graduate school of education at the University of Denver,
Boulder. ``But there is great diversity within that group, and
among the rest of the home schoolers, both in pedagogical theory
and in (ideological) orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, some wouldn't want their children to
compete in bees.

   Thomas Jefferson was taking questions from the audience, all
reverential, about the Louisiana Purchase, his interest in wine
making and the men who shaped his mind. (Sir Isaac Newton, Sir
Francis Bacon and John Locke, he replied.) Skittish about breaking
the weird decorousness of the event at Colonial Williamsburg, which
was a supposed conversation with the retired third president, I
nonetheless asked if Jefferson had changed his opinion about the
newspapers of his day after they printed the ``scurrilous rumors''
about Sally Hemings, the slave with whom he is thought by many
modern historians, on the basis of DNA evidence, to have fathered a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that still continuing?'' replied the smiling Jefferson, the
actor Bill Barker, as the audience laughed. Playing to type and
historical accuracy, Jefferson then said, ``I never made answer on
it publicly, and I will not do so today.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, in a soft Virginia drawl, that he was happier since
giving up newspapers in his retirement _ during Jefferson's
presidency, the papers went big with the Hemings scandal _ but then
said, paraphrasing Jefferson's most famous defense of freedom of
the press, that he would rather have ``a nation with newspapers and
no government than a nation with government and no newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience broke into enthusiastic applause, as if a president
himself had spoken.
</P>
<P>
   For three days this spring, my husband and I and our two
children, ages 9 and 5, wandered around Colonial Williamsburg, the
Virginia ``living history'' museum built by John D. Rockefeller
Jr.. I had anticipated another Disneyland. Instead, I found it
genuinely historically interesting, if sometimes hokey, with a new
emphasis on the slaves who made up more than half the town's
population in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Like the study of American history itself, the 18th-century
capital of the Virginia colony has changed in its 65 years of
restoration from a sanitized celebration of the white planter elite
_ even in 1981 the historian Mike Wallace wrote that ``it embodies
a vision of total social order'' _ to a more real, and not always
politically correct, evocation of the nastier past. A 1994
re-enactment of a slave auction, for example, caused outrage among
some blacks.
</P>
<P>
   This year's theme at Williamsburg, ``Enslaving Virginia,''
offers the most extensive programming yet on the town residents
whose stories were largely unknown to tourists until the 1970s,
when a new generation of Williamsburg historians began insisting on
their inclusion. Since 1998, Williamsburg has organized its
programs around four rotating ``Days in History.'' If you are there
on the day that is supposed to be Nov. 17, 1775, when Lord Dunmore,
the colony's governor, offered freedom to any slave who sided with
the British crown, it is possible to spend almost all of your time,
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., in history walks, talks and re-enactments
focused on slavery.
</P>
<P>
   In between, you can stumble into conversations with some of
Williamsburg's 100 or so ``character interpreters,'' actors who
engaged us in interactive, impromptu and slightly embarrassing
theater often meant to teach the unsavory reality of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible news about town today, you have probably heard,'' one
actor playing a Colonial Williamsburg resident announced when we
approached him and a cluster of patriots on Duke of Gloucester
Street, the main street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negroes with arms _ can you believe it?'' another asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wise move, to free the servants and slaves of your enemy,''
the first said, referring to Lord Dunmore.
</P>
<P>
   I asked how people who spoke of freedom could own slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``God himself has put them here to be slaves,'' a third actor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, making sure we got the point, the first said, ``You cannot
free such valuable property.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier we had been to the Courthouse for the re-enactment
of several trials and an unpleasant moment when Williamsburg's
desire to be honest about its history with blacks collided with
1999 sensitivities. An audience of tourists filled the spectators'
benches as actors playing a bailiff, an obnoxious defendant and a
judge argued over a case.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the judge asked for three volunteers from the
courtroom to inspect some land in dispute. The tourists all
volunteered eagerly. The bailiff selected three, two of them young
black men. But the judge rejected the two, because they were black.
``Free Negroes can't serve!'' barked the defendant, underscoring
the point, as the two 20th-century blacks sat down, looking
embarrassed. When I asked Williamsburg about the incident after I
got back, Stephen Elliott, the vice president for education,
winced, saying that the scene had been cut from the trial last year
and that it shouldn't have happened.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in town, a seven-hour drive from New York City,
halfway through another of Williamsburg's ``days in history,'' May
15, 1776, when the colonists declared their independence. We were
unaware of this until we were efficiently educated by a
Williamsburg Inn concierge, who presented us with the Visitor's
Companion, a newspaper for tourists, which listed a daunting buffet
of events for the week. Looking at it was like trying to decide
what courses to take in college, but our concierge quickly circled
what she thought was best for us and the children.
</P>
<P>
   We weren't staying at the inn proper, the behemoth
white-columned institution of choice for visiting heads of state
(Williamsburg was the site of an economic summit conference for the
world's industrial powers in 1983) but at its lower-priced and
modern Providence Hall Wing, which is recommended for families.
There, the rooms are bigger and decorated with the usual wing
chairs, but they are not antiques. We had a balcony that looked
over a duck pond, and were just a short walk from the inn, where we
ate breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning we walked the five minutes to the historic
district for an orientation tour, led by a guide, Jerry Hedgepeth,
who pointed out attractions like the Wyeth House, where Jefferson
went to law school.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave a brief history lesson: In 1699 the Virginia
capital moved from Jamestown to Williamsburg, a planned city built
around a town common, Market Square, and anchored by the Capitol
building at one end and the College of William and Mary at the
other. Although Virginia's capital moved to Richmond in 1780,
Williamsburg was still intact in 1926, when Rockefeller began the
restoration that would eventually cost $68 million. Today there are
more than 500 restored or reconstructed buildings and 90 acres of
gardens and greens.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things I noticed was that Williamsburg, though
bucolic, was not pristine; paint was peeling off many of the white
clapboard houses, some of the grass was scruffy and sandy dirt
covered the main streets. Yet earlier criticism of the town by
historians focused on its absurd perfectness. When I got back home,
I called Cary Carson, Williamsburg's vice president for research,
who told me that Williamsburg has worked recently to make the town
less precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to paint all of the buildings at the same time,'' he
said. ``But nobody now and nobody then painted their property from
end to end.'' He added that sand is now brought in to cover up the
20th-century blacktop of Duke of Gloucester Street and that some of
the lawn-mowing is done by grazing sheep.
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, we went to some of the trades shops, popular
with the children, like that of the printer and the wig maker, who
told us that the hairpieces favored by 18th-century gentlemen were
``beastly uncomfortable, but they were fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon I went on ``Enslaving Virginia,'' a one-hour
history walk with a guide, Harvey Bakari, who ran through a quick
general history of slavery, then described how slaves did the
invisible work, lost to history, that made Williamsburg possible.
He concluded that ``the system of slavery would cause the colony to
live with a contradiction, the contradiction of liberty and
bondage.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that there were few remnants on the walk to
illustrate his points; the slaves lived in Williamsburg's
outbuildings behind the big houses and left behind no furniture and
almost no belongings. Although slaves may well have spent as much
time as anyone else laboring behind the scenes in the town's grand
buildings, their identities were invisible in the Governor's Palace
or the Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   We ate most of our meals in Williamsburg's not-cheap
restaurants, where the waitresses wore period garb and the
Colonial-style food was mediocre, although no doubt better than
what people really ate in the 18th century. The best was Christiana
Campbell's Tavern, a reconstruction, where George Washington dined.
</P>
<P>
   I had scallop and oyster pot pie and was startled when an
actress playing Mrs. Campbell materialized, asking how we liked our
dinner. The real Mrs. Campbell was described not very pleasantly by
an 18th-century traveler as ``a little old Woman, about four feet
high; &AMP; equally thick, a little turn up Pug nose, a mouth screw'd
up to one side.'' The actress was younger and taller, but her odd
little dinner performance proved how fluid, and alive, history is.
</P>
<P>
   Today the contradictions of Jefferson on slavery are as riveting
as they were in his time. Just as we imagined the real Christiana
Campbell in her tavern, we could imagine the real Jefferson arguing
in the House of Burgesses, a part of the reconstructed Capitol that
nonetheless was compelling to see. History by definition is an act
of the imagination, especially for children. Williamsburg helps it
take flight.

RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD (BUT EASY TO TALK ABOUT) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mafia boss, sex columnist and sports agent are not likely to
turn up on anyone's list of most admired professions. But these
careers have been very good to HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Even before ``The Sopranos,'' with its mobbed-up family values,
emerged as last season's best and most talked about show (weekly
repeats begin on Wednesday), HBO had built two first-rate series
around characters whose jobs are full of satiric possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The comedies ``Sex and the City'' and ``Arliss,'' beginning new
seasons on Sunday, would never appear on a broadcast network in
anything like the same form, and it's more than rough language that
sets them apart. Their unheroic heroes, sophisticated social
assumptions and high level of cynicism are essential to their wit
and success.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sex and the City,'' Sarah Jessica Parker plays Carrie
Bradshaw, a newspaper columnist who charts the sexual customs of
New York City with all the devotion of an anthropologist and far
more personal involvement. As the second season begins, she has
broken up with her rich, powerful, commitment-phobic lover, known
as Big (Chris Noth), and imagines she sees him everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But as always the plot is less crucial than the observations of
Carrie and her relationship-obsessed friends, who in Sunday's
episode muse about the rules of breakups, and in the next week's
about how much or how little people like to talk during sex.
</P>
<P>
   Though its Manhattan locations are conspicuous and believable,
in other ways ``Sex and the City'' is loosely tethered to reality.
Carrie's friends are all upscale and urbane; they offer the kind of
convenient mix of attitudes that only occurs in fiction, and they
have one-track minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like seventh grade with bank accounts,'' says Miranda
(Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer who rarely has a man in her life,
stomping out of a restaurant in exasperation because the other
women will talk only about men.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha (Kim Cattrall), a public relations executive, is a
sleep-around. Charlotte (Kristin Davis), an art dealer, is a
perfectionist and control freak. They have a lot to talk about,
often in blunt terms.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's episode, when the friends take Carrie to a Yankees
game to cheer her up, baseball offers too many opportunities for
dialogue built on bad puns and double-entendres.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its sometimes clotted dialogue, there are solid reasons
why this series is a hit. It is often slyly funny and astute.
Charlotte says, ``It takes half the time you went out with someone
to get over him''; no scientific study is likely to pin the time
frame down better.
</P>
<P>
   And the humor can unexpectedly give way to real emotion. When
Carrie spots Big in a bar, it doesn't matter that she is on a
glamorous date with a Yankee. Her face registers both her pain and
her attempt to hide it, with Ms. Parker bringing deftness and
sympathy to a role that doesn't conspicuously lend itself to those
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Under their cynical facades, these women are endless optimists
about ideal relationships, even as they settle for fleeting,
imperfect ones. That hopefulness may be the series' secret weapon. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ARLISS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HBO, Sunday night at 9:30 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no mushiness at the center of ``Arliss,'' which returns
for its fourth season as snappy and cynical as ever. Robert Wuhl,
who created the series and plays Arliss Michaels, a greedy sports
agent to the stars, makes the character likable because he so
blithely, openly enjoys making money.
</P>
<P>
   In this weekend's episode, Arliss has a health scare and
undergoes a colonoscopy. That leads to uncharacteristic flatulence
jokes that seem imported from ``South Park''; this series is too
sophisticated to need them.
</P>
<P>
   As Arliss waits for a call from the doctor, two of his
assistants, Rita (Sandra Oh) and Kirby (Jim Turner) squabble over
which of them will cheat a little old lady out of some valuable
baseball cards. A third, Stanley (Michael Boatman from ``Spin
City''), plans for a more lucrative life after Arliss.
</P>
<P>
   But while the series is cynical, it is never mean-spirited, and
it has a satisfying way of finding story endings that are humane
without being forced.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's show ends with a priceless scene in which Arliss sits
in front of a mausoleum. Wuhl's facial reaction demonstrates why
the series has maintained both its satiric edge and its appealing
humor. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX AND THE CITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HBO, Sunday night at 9 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Created by Darren Star. Star and Michael Patrick King, executive
producers; John Melfi and Jenny Bicks, supervising producers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie), Kim Cattrall (Samantha),
Kristin Davis (Charlotte), Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) and Chris Noth (
Big). &QL;

BROADWAY HOLDS ITS BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget the stock market. Never mind the Belmont. If
you have a farm, bet it.
</P>
<P>
   The surest wager in the world, say Broadway's pundits and
politicos, is that come 9:45 on Sunday night Dame Judi Dench will
rise to the stage of the Gershwin Theater and be presented with a
Tony award, her first, for her leading role in the drama ``Amy's
View.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Broadway is famously unpredictable, and its seers not
always reliable. But what is certain is that awards in 21
categories will be handed out on Sunday, when the best and
brightest of the theater world will gather to celebrate the end of
a season that many say wasn't exactly better or brighter than many
in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Though attendance and box office receipts are at an all-time
high, many theater professionals still grumble that the season has
been heavy on the blah.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the competition among musicals was dominated by ``The
Lion King'' and ``Ragtime,'' two audience pleasers that battled
till the end of Tony night, when ``Lion King'' won the Tony for
best musical. This year the musical field is weak, with three
bookless shows and ``Parade,'' already closed and considered a long
shot.
</P>
<P>
   But where musicals have faltered, plays have flourished, and it
is in the dramatic categories, many theater professionals say, that
the true drama of this year's Tonys will be found. For example, in
the race for best actor, Kevin Spacey, star of the revival of ``The
Iceman Cometh,'' will face off with Brian Dennehy, star of the
revival of ``Death of a Salesman,'' for the title of big man on
Broadway. Those two shows are also neck and neck for best revival.
And for best play the race may be even closer.
</P>
<P>
   With ballots due today, 11th-hour lobbying was in full stride
this week. Nominated actors made time for interviews and public
appearances, press representatives hounded tardy voters to see
shows, and producers worked the telephones to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, administered by the League of American Theaters and
Producers and the American Theater Wing, are voted on by 812
theater professionals, including representatives of those two
organizations, designated members of the theatrical unions and some
theater journalists.
</P>
<P>
   An informal poll of two dozen theater experts _ producers, press
agents, talent agents and other know-it-alls, most of them Tony
voters and all of whom spoke only on the condition of anonymity _
suggested that there will be more than a few fierce races. In at
least three categories _ best play, best actor in a play and best
revival of a play _ the contests seem too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an overwhelming blockbuster has added to the sense
that it's anybody's game to win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody concedes this is not a banner year,'' said one
agent. ``But on the other hand things are so wide open, everybody
thinks they're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some locks, to be sure, they say. (See Dame Judi.) The
three other women's acting categories _ best supporting actress in
a play and lead and supporting actress in a musical _ also have
clear front-runners. There is also a strong consensus about the
category of best musical and several smaller awards.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that the crystal ball gets murky, with many
categories having at least two strong contenders and sometimes
more. The Tony broadcast begins on PBS at 8, with awards for
design, direction, choreography and orchestration.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 the broadcast is handed off to CBS. Then the major acting
and production awards are delivered and, perhaps most important for
producers, the big production numbers will be shown in what amounts
to free advertising. The Tonys have become an important promotional
tool for Broadway, the one time each year that theater gets into
living rooms west of the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   A lively number by the cast of ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' in 1995 was
credited with boosting that show's sales; this week it became the
longest running musical revue in Broadway history.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Tony show will open with the traditional Big
Production Number, featuring all the star presenters in a splashy
rendition of ``There's No Business Like Show Business.'' Numbers
from the nominees for best musical (``The Civil War,'' ``Parade,''
``Fosse'' and ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'') will follow, as
well as songs from the nominees for best musical revival (``Annie
Get Your Gun,'' ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' ``Little Me''
and ``Peter Pan'').
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The job of making sure all this runs smoothly falls to Walter C.
Miller, executive producer of the awards, a man driven to
encapsulate the majesty, dignity and historical sweep of The
Theater, all in exactly one hour, 59 minutes and 54 seconds allowed
in the CBS broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Automatically we hate every winner,'' Miller said. ``You get
someone up there that starts thanking the doorman and their sister
Sadie, and you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having to counter the impression of a lackluster
season, Miller's task has been complicated by the announcement in
late January by Rosie O'Donnell, who had been the show's host for
the last two years, that she would not be able to preside this
year. Ms. O'Donnell, credited with increasing the Tony broadcast's
ratings, blamed scheduling difficulties. (She has, it should be
noted, found time to grace the show's opening number.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tonys were also forced to move from Radio City Music Hall,
its home during the O'Donnell administration, to the Gershwin
Theater because Radio City is being renovated. But the Gershwin has
roughly 4,000 fewer seats as well as a current musical, ``Peter
Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   This means that the swarm of behind-the-scenes technicians who
run the Tonys have had to rehearse and set up their equipment in
the limited time before and after performances.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of one host the show will have a dozen sets of
presenters, matched for reasons sentimental, theatrical and
otherwise. Jason Robards and Spacey, past and present Hickeys in
``Iceman,'' will appear together, as will Scott Wolf and Christian
Slater, who have both portrayed the narrator in ``Side Man'' and
have the added connection of being cute and under 30.
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of Calista Flockhart, Matthew Broderick and
Laurence Fishburne on hand, there is little question that the Tonys
will have a decent celebrity quotient. And with Arthur Miller, who
is to receive a lifetime achievement award, and a lineup of elegant
leading ladies like Angela Lansbury, Carol Burnett, Chita Rivera
and Julie Andrews, the show will definitely have appropriate
theatrical weight.
</P>
<P>
   Whether all that will translate to strong television ratings is
an open question.
</P>
<P>
   While the most interesting races are likely to unfold in the
second part of the evening, the first hour, on PBS, may offer a few
clues and ``ooohs.''
</P>
<P>
   The award for best director of a play is a terrific lineup of
talent: Robert Falls (``Salesman''), Howard Davies (``Iceman''),
Garry Hynes (``The Lonesome West'') and Trevor Nunn (``Not About
Nightingales'').
</P>
<P>
   Most of the voters who were asked seemed to like Nunn, who is
credited with resurrecting ``Nightingales,'' a lost play by a young
Tennessee Williams. But a few said that Falls might take the award,
and that if he did, it could be the beginning of a lovely evening
for ``Salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   The early portion should also offer some moral victories for
advocates of traditional musicals, as the theater professionals
predicted that the awards for best book and original score would
go, respectively, to Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Brown, both for
``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Another curiosity is the scenic design category: Bob Crowley was
nominated for both ``Twelfth Night'' and ``Iceman'' and will
compete against Richard Hoover (``Nightingales'') and Riccardo
Hernandez (``Parade''). Several Tony watchers said votes for
Crowley might be split between the two plays, allowing Hoover's
evocative, shadowy design for the Williams play to win.
</P>
<P>
   The real horse races come after CBS takes up the signal.
</P>
<P>
   The first award presented is for featured actor in a play. Here
the front-runner is Kevin Anderson of ``Salesman,'' who is up
against his cast mate Howard Witt as well as Finbar Lynch
(``Nightingales'') and Frank Wood (``Side Man''). But a few voters
felt that Anderson's youth and Witt's long service in the
theatrical trenches might conspire to lend Witt the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Another early award, featured actor in a musical, has
significantly less intrigue, with most voters believing Snoopy, as
portrayed by actor Roger Bart, will have his supper time, in part
because Scott Wise and Desmond Richardson, two nominees from
``Fosse,'' will split the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the award for best actor in a musical seems to be
a showdown between Tom Wopat (``Annie Get Your Gun'') and Martin
Short (``Little Me''). More is at stake for Wopat, who has never
been nominated and whose show is still open, so many
prognosticators said his producers, Fran and Barry Weissler, would
lobby hard enough for him to win.
</P>
<P>
   But Short's performance was loved by the press and the public,
and his name value may carry the day. Brent Carver of ``Parade''
was also mentioned by a few of those polled; his victory would be a
major upset.
</P>
<P>
   The actress categories are generally easier to call, the
professionals say. Zoe Wannamaker's performance in ``Electra,''
which earned her a nomination as best actress in a play, was widely
hailed as a revelatory portrait of Sophocles' tortured heroine.
</P>
<P>
   But the show closed in March, eons ago in Broadway time. The
other nominees are Stockard Channing, a past Tony winner, who
critics found to be about the only good thing in the revival of
``The Lion in Winter,'' and Marion Seldes, who won in 1967 and gave
a brief, admired turn in ``Ring Round the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But _ and it's a monstrous but, the voters insist _
(italics)nobody(end italics) is going to ignore Dame Judi, who won
the Academy Award in March for ``Shakespeare in Love'' and then
promptly took up residence on Broadway, lending the season a hefty
dose of glamour and class.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Franz, playing Linda Loman in ``Salesman,'' is highly
favored to win as best featured actress in a play, although several
voters noted cattily that Ms. Franz's producers should also get an
award for somehow inveigling the Tony committee to consider her as
a featured actress, not a leading lady, thereby eliminating a
possible collision with the Dench express.
</P>
<P>
   On the musical side Bernadette Peters is strongly favored to win
best actress, although a few voters saw Carolee Carmello
(``Parade'') as a dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   The category of featured actress in a musical has seemingly been
a foregone conclusion for months; an early consensus formed around
the star-in-the-making Kristin Chenoweth (``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown'') and has stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   The major musical awards, for new work and revival, both have
favorites and long shots. For best musical ``Fosse'' is still
considered the winner by most of those polled, but small camps
seemed to be forming around ``Parade,'' which won a majority of the
pre-Tony awards, and even ``The Civil War,'' which had poor
reviews. Still, when pressed, the vast majority said ``Fosse''
would win.
</P>
<P>
   In the musical revival category, ``Annie Get Your Gun'' is the
leading candidate, but several said that ``Charlie Brown'' had put
a scare in the sharpshooter by winning several earlier awards.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the big three races.
</P>
<P>
   Many say the easiest to call may be the best actor contest, in
which Spacey and Dennehy are joined by Corin Redgrave, who
portrayed a brutal prison warden in ``Not About Nightingales,'' and
the Irish actor Brian F. O'Byrne, a brawler in ``The Lonesome
West.''
</P>
<P>
   The category is clearly viewed as Dennehy vs. Spacey. Both
actors have tried to play down the competition, appearing at the
Outer Critics Circle Awards and Drama Desk Awards to hand out
awards to each other.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of those asked said Dennehy would win.
</P>
<P>
   The reason seems to be partly sentimental. Dennehy, playing the
loser Willy Loman, touched a deep nerve in many who had seen the
play before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a completely new Willy,'' one producer said. ``He made
it his own.''
</P>
<P>
   While Spacey had strong reviews, some say the memory of previous
Hickeys, particularly Robards' 1956 version, may stand in his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sizable group of older people who remember Jason's
performance and still love it,'' one producer said. He added that
Dennehy would not have the same problem. ``I doubt there's anybody
running around saying Lee J. Cobb was so much better,'' the
producer said, referring to the actor who originated the role of
Willy Loman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some noted that Spacey is also a Broadway veteran, having
won a Tony in 1991 for ``Lost in Yonkers.'' He has the added cachet
of being a Hollywood star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ultimately better for Broadway if Kevin wins,'' another
producer said. ``They'll reward him.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the best actor award may also reflect the voting
on best revival. Several Tony voters said they had split their
ballots between Dennehy for best actor and ``Iceman'' for best
revival. The logic, said one, was that the scope of the
four-and-a-half-hour ``Iceman'' was more impressive, while
productions of ``Death of a Salesman'' were more common. Also, the
voter said, it spread the Tony wealth around.
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which British imports ruled Broadway, the closest
race is the one with the most patriotic overtones. The competition
for best play seems to be an almost dead heat between ``Closer,''
Patrick Marber's dissection of modern British relationships, and
``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's bittersweet paean to jazz musicians.
Smaller camps support ``Nightingales'' and ``The Lonesome West.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that ``Side Man'' may have a small
edge because it was written by an American, and with slow sales, it
needs the award more than ``Closer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really help `Side Man,''' said one press agent not
connected to the play. ``Plus, it would be nice to have an American
play on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Another press agent summed up the race this way: ```Closer' is
contemporary, fresh and out there and doesn't pander to the
traditional Broadway audience. Those are also the negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   A sweep by any production, except perhaps ``Salesman,'' seems a
long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an uninspired year, there's not going to be any big
winners and losers,'' one veteran press agent said. ``But as far as
the industry is concerned, that's just fine. It will spread the joy
around.''

ART REVIEW: GUSTAVE MOREAU _ STRANGE IN HIS DAY AND NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps as part of some larger millennial celebration
conspiracy, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has mounted its second
summer retrospective of a neglected if not disdained fin de siecle
European painter. Last year it was Sir Edward Burne-Jones, the
English Pre-Raphaelite. Now comes Gustave Moreau, the French
painter who ignored the art of his own time and, firing his
imagination with story lines and stylistic tips from past cultures,
created an art for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Organized on the centennial of Moreau's death in 1898, this is
his first American retrospective in 35 years. In many ways it feels
right on schedule. His highly finished paintings, with their
opulent detail and hothouse emotionality, called ``a little
sickish'' in his own time, look as intensely strange and decadent
as ever. Their fin de siecle aroma has withstood the test of time.
Their strangeness is only partly modified by hindsight, which
includes Moreau's influence on the Symbolists, the Fauves and the
Surrealists and his nearly abstract watercolors, which were once
cited as precursors of Abstract Expressionism and now suggest
Anselm Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Moreau was a loner, not a joiner. Although a
frequent presence in salons, he was the odd man out in 19th-century
French painting. His disturbing style was not Romantic, Realist or
Neo-Classical and had little to do with Impressionism, which he
considered bland and unadventurous. His independence and ability to
create a complete, self-sustaining esthetic universe is
particularly pertinent today, when the dearth of clear-cut art
movements makes many artists feel like loners.
</P>
<P>
   Moreau's backward- and forward-looking art is frequently
described in terms of opposites, as both regressive and
revolutionary; withheld, even hermetic, yet psychologically
intense; overly refined and finicky yet physically bold.
</P>
<P>
   He had a literary bent and an infallible faith in the human
imagination, which was one of his great subjects. And he had all
the markings of a painter's painter. Like Albert Pinkham Ryder, for
example, he worked and reworked his paintings over long periods of
time, avoided selling them when possible, and gained a reputation
for being reclusive, at least until the last six years of his life,
when he started teaching at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and influenced
students like Matisse and Rouault.
</P>
<P>
   But Moreau was also serenely sure of of his achievement.
Well-to-do, he created an environment in which his paintings could
stay together in perpetuity: He added two stories to his house on
Rue de Rochefoucauld, where he lived and worked most of his life,
and bequeathed it to France along with its contents and 14,000
works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the works in this exhibition of 30 paintings and more
than 200 works on paper and oil sketches were lent by the Musee
Gustave Moreau, which remains the best place to experience Moreau's
art at full strength. But this exhibition does a more than adequate
job. It is consistently informative and intermittently affecting.
While it is hard to imagine loving everything Moreau put his
versatile hand to _ his art covers an immense range of style and
feeling _ it is equally hard to imagine loving none of it.
</P>
<P>
   The show contains several of the artist's greatest hits.
``Oedipus and the Sphinx,'' in the Met's collection, shows her
locked on his chest like a particularly elegant raptor, staring
into his face as if in shock from the realization that the jig is
finally up. Exhibited in the Salon of 1864, the painting earned
Moreau his first fame, was bought by Napoleon III and inspired
copies in the press, some of which are included here.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Salome (Salome Dancing Before Herod),'' the seductress,
ashimmer with silver, floats on the tips of her toes through the
burnished atmosphere of a palace that seems extrapolated from the
Hagia Sophia. And ``Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra'' shows an
exquisite youth confronting a veritable umbrella stand of swaying,
battle-ready snake heads dominated by a giant caped cobra in a
landscape strewn with victims. Both works were shown at the Salon
of 1876, again with much notice.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at these works, one can understand the case against
Moreau. It's all too much. John Rewald, the great chronicler of
Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, found his style overwrought,
flawed by ``a futile application to detail'' and categorized it as
``merely elaborate invention,'' greatly preferring Odilon Redon's
imaginary images for being partly inspired by nature. Gauguin, who
admired the artist, nonetheless complained that ``every human being
he makes is a piece of jewelry covered with jewelry'' and called
him ``an excellent chaser,'' referring no doubt to the ornamental
metalwork that is ubiquitous in the paintings. Other craft-oriented
epithets would have done just as well: engraver, gilder,
embroiderer, weaver, ceramicist, carver.
</P>
<P>
   Delicately roiling patterns and forms in every imaginable medium
cover nearly every surface in many of these paintings. We may be
lucky that Moreau never completed some of the obsessive detail in
some paintings; they may be the better for it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Apparition'' of 1874-76, which shows Salome dancing
once again but with a vision of St. John the Baptist's severed head
floating before her, the entire architectural setting was simply
scratched into expanses of still-wet areas of milk chocolate paint,
making the surrounding palace less tangible than the Baptist's
head. In ``The Unicorn'' they are simply drawn in equally fine
lines of black paint on nearly bare surfaces, implying luxurious
garments, headdresses, chalices and textiles covered with fine
filigree.
</P>
<P>
   Moreau was born in Paris in 1826 to parents who encouraged his
artistic talents from the start. He began copying in the Louvre at
18, studied with the Neo-Classical painter Francois Edouard Picot
and for three years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, beginning in 1846.
</P>
<P>
   The first galleries of the exhibition are dominated by works
from the 1850s, including copies from Sodoma and Raphael (an
assertive, sweet-faced putto) that he made during two years of
study in Rome, where he sometimes painted alongside Edgar Degas.
Here he wavers between Neo-Classicism and Romanticism and even
Realism. His gigantic ``Song of Solomon'' is dominated by contorted
figures reminiscent of Delacroix and Chasseriau. His drawings of
friends, including one of Degas at the Uffizi, have some of Degas'
careful observation and austerity. Take a good look: these sheets
are the last you'll see of 19th-century France until the
exhibition's final work, a small self-portrait in ink on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hereafter imagination, history and a wild esthetic eclecticism
hold sway. Moreau seemed to believe in magic, centaurs, griffins,
Christian saints and Greek gods. He looked at Renaissance, Gothic,
Byzantine, Indian and Japanese art and seems to have been adept at
blending their conventions. The background landscape of ``The
Unicorn,'' for example, is a gloss on Renaissance compositions so
loosely worked that it looks both modern and somewhat Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Moreau's interest in the past could have resulted in mere
academicism had he not pursued his passion for exoticism, stylistic
eclecticism and physical experimentation to the extent he did. His
paintings give ancient myths a psychological heat not unlike that
of Henry Fuseli and William Blake, but the temperature is increased
by his feeling for the material things depicted in his paintings
and for the materials of art.
</P>
<P>
   This passion is manifested in this show in a direct and riveting
manner, in the many drawings, studies and preparatory sketches,
especially those clustered about several of the most important
canvases. It is visible as well in the constant shifts and changes
in Moreau's painting methods, which become more numerous and
contradictory as he proceeds. Up close, the later paintings in
particular can seem almost cacophonous in their contrasting
techniques. Again ``The Unicorn'' is a telling example, full of
frequent shifts between precise rendering, loose scumblings that
are alternately thickly impastoed or watery thin and the sketchy
yet refined linear filigrees of pattern. And a second look at the
rocky dwelling of the Lernaean Hydra reveals it to be brushed in
lightly and loosely, like a bit of particularly heavy mist.
</P>
<P>
   The arduous working process revealed by the drawings and
watercolors often creates the sensation that one is looking over
the artist's shoulder. Executed in ink, graphite, watercolor and
chalk, these vary tremendously in size and degree of finish with
some of the best being small, rough ink studies. From the 18
drawings that contributed to the making of ``Oedipus and the
Sphinx,'' for example, we see how many different, far more
conventional poses Moreau considered before he fixed on the potent
arm's-length embrace of the final image. Among those surrounding
``Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra'' are several studies of
different snakes heads made from reproductions and possibly after
visits to a natural history museum, reflecting an attentiveness to
natural detail that argues against Rewald's charge of ``merely
elaborate invention.''
</P>
<P>
   At their best Moreau's paintings are like children's-book
illustrations for adults, full of peculiar intensities and sexual
innuendos and physical detail that give familiar tales an
unaccustomed vividness. But their enveloping vision is not really
literary; in his best images Moreau pares the story down to a
dramatic moment whose spell transcends a particular narrative. He
achieved this spell through a combination of poetic license and
artistic discipline that give this exhibition a special
fascination. That Moreau's liberated imagination seems to have
gradually loosened his hand adds to its resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gustave Moreau: Between Epic and Dream'' is at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)
879-5500, through Aug. 22.

 &HT;    A tough cut: Taking pruners to an old friend
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLATNA _ Some might call it unthinkable, lopping off the top of
a large Japanese maple, and I acknowledge that it was the hardest
cut I've made in a long time; it was my first-bought. But it had to
be done. It was for the good of the tree, not just for me. And for
the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The average red threadleaf represents the height of elegance as
it dips and swoops and weeps, showing off its red foliage each
spring, then again in the fall. But this tree didn't dip much, or
swoop, and it wept barely at all. Instead, it grew mostly
horizontally, after its trunk reached a mere 18 inches in height.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen inches tall and somewhere around 20 years old. That'd
be respectable for a bonsai, but this was a garden maple, and its
growing habit had grown unseemly: Two long limbs reached out in
opposite directions at the top of the trunk. Oh, they had a bit of
a curve in them, but that didn't prevent the tree from looking like
a very short, very wide alien in my garden.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way; when I bought the maple in suburban
Washington back in the mid-1980s, it was pretty, and I was proud.
My first maple. I grew it in a container on Capitol Hill and
marveled that it was putting on so much more width than height.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I'd look at it and recall the words to a B.B. King
blues song about a ``sweet li'l angel. I love the way-y-y she
spreads her wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Atlanta in 1989, I made her the centerpiece of a
section of my back garden. She continued to spread, growing wider
by the year. Then, alas, as too often happens, the unusual became
the unwanted. By the mid-'90s I was looking at the widespread maple
and wanting her to flap her wings, so she would put on some height.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't. She kept on spreading, with each wing eventually
reaching some 5 feet. Still the trunk was 18 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes context is everything. In a space containing nothing
else, this tree with the 10-foot wingspan might still be beautiful,
the effect of one wing hovering over the fishpond a serendipitous
stroke of fine design. But in my very crowded space, it was lost, a
misfit, its novel wings unnoticed, unappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   I could have taken out the weeping juniper to give the maple
more room for its left wing. Or removed the black bamboo, opening
up space for the right wing. Instead, I brought out the pruners.
</P>
<P>
   First I cut one wing, then the other. It hurt. So many years, so
many springs and autumns, gone. Just like that. What was left was
the trunk, with the two fat, curved wing stubs at the top. I didn't
want to leave those reminders of the old horizontal tree; I wanted
a fresh start. So I decided to cut off the top of the trunk,
bringing it down to just over a foot tall.
</P>
<P>
   It was somehow fitting that this would be a rough cut to make. I
had left my pruning saw in McCaysville, so I had to either wait for
another day or do what I did: attack the 3-inch-diameter trunk with
pruners and a butcher knife, squeezing and hacking until I was able
to break off the top with a final push.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp crack signaled that it was done. I gathered the severed
wings, the broken top and wondered if I had done the right thing,
knowing I could never undo it.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a way to preserve something of those garden-fresh days
when Japanese maples and I first met, I kept about 3 feet of one
wing, placing it on the fireplace mantel in the parlor. Vertical at
last, the wing looks good there, so much better than it did in the
garden. So much more prominent and, yes, elegant even. How much it
reminds me of a bronzed baby shoe that holds so many memories and
that never looked so stately on a child's stubby, unsteady foot.
</P>
<P>
   And what now of what is left in the garden? Will life be worth
living for a trunk without wings? If it does live (and Japanese
maples, as delicate as they appear, are some of the toughest little
trees I've ever grown), what form will it take?
</P>
<P>
   I want it to grow up, of course. And I want it to weep, to swoop
and dip.
</P>
<P>
   That'd take some time, I know. Still, each day, I look closely
for growth, for little branches that might do what the big branches
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not impatient, mind you. We two have a history. Fifteen
years I've raised this tree, lived with this tree. If she hasn't
given up on me, I won't give up on her. We can stay together, be
the way we were _ when I loved the way she spread her wings.

   Circus Parade Hid Another
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When conservators at the Phillips Collection in
Washington began cleaning and restoring Gifford Beal's ``Parade of
Elephants,'' they made an astonishing discovery: beneath the 1924
painting was another canvas on the same stretcher, where it had
been hidden for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Steele, the Phillips' chief conservator, and Gillian
Cook, an intern in the conservation department, had begun work on
``Parade of Elephants'' to prepare for ``Renoir to Rothko: The Eye
of Duncan Phillips,'' an exhibition that opens at the Phillips on
Sept. 25 and explores the collection of the museum's founder.
</P>
<P>
   It was when the conservators unframed ``Parade of Elephants''
and began studying it with a microscope and ultraviolet light that
they discovered two canvases, each with its own set of tacks. The
painting underneath, signed by the artist and dated 1918, depicts a
woman and her two children in front of a house looking down a steep
hillside toward a parade of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's director, curators and conservators have developed
theories about why the painting was covered up in the first place.
``It's fair to speculate that Beal had more canvases than
stretchers,'' said Jay Gates, director of the Phillips. Gates
suggested that Beal simply borrowed the stretcher for a newer work
and then forgot that a painting was underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you keep a painting covered up for 75 years, only six
years after it was painted, it's in pristine condition,'' Gates
added. ``All the colors are still vivid.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliza Rathbone, the chief curator, has given the new painting a
title: ``On the Hudson at Newburgh,'' where the Beal family owned a
home and where the artist frequently painted during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson River Valley landscape adds a new dimension to the
Beal holdings at the Phillips. Many of the works show scenes of the
circus, the theater or men at work. But the subject of this
painting represents Beal's earlier themes.
</P>
<P>
   While conservators working on Old Master paintings have
discovered concealed paintings beneath a canvas, finding a hidden
painting of an American artist is particularly unusual. Also
unusual is that the artist has a special relationship to the
Phillips. Beal was the uncle of Marjorie Phillips, the wife of
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The two paintings are on view in the newly renovated
second-floor gallery, through Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein Collection
</P>
<P>
   When Roy Lichtenstein died two years ago, he left one painting
each to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art
and the National Gallery of Art in Washington _ works he knew they
wanted. But that still left his estate with a substantial
collection of his drawings, prints, sculptures and paintings, which
the artist had kept for his own study.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, many of these works will become part of the Roy
Lichtenstein Foundation, a nonprofit institution established in
accordance with the artist's wishes. Its president is Dorothy
Lichtenstein, the artist's widow, and its director is Jack Cowart,
who is leaving his post as deputy director and chief curator at the
Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's offices will be in the artist's Greenwich
Village studio. ``We want to be a facilitator for anyone who is
studying Roy's work,'' Cowart said. ``This would mean building a
database of his work and being able to authenticate
Lichtensteins.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation hopes to initiate and direct the publication of a
series of catalogs raisonnes, establish and maintain a library and
archive of the artist's work, and lend works for exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like the Warhol Foundation, who went into
grant-giving mode relatively quickly,'' Cowart said. ``We are not
intending to be a large grant giver.'' Nor did Cowart say there
will be a reason to put a bulk of Lichtenstein's works on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Art in Summer Whites
</P>
<P>
   She's using only men and yes, they will have their clothes on.
That is what will distinguish Vanessa Beecroft's new performance
piece from her previous, more risque work.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at 4:30 p.m., when the 30-year-old Italian artist
stages ``Vanessa Beecroft U.S. Navy,'' at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in San Diego, 25 Navy Seals wearing their summer
whites will stand in ceremonial formation in the museum's Farris
Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The Seals, a special operations unit of the Navy with a base in
San Diego, conduct a variety of high-risk missions. Their role at
the museum, however, will be a lot tamer than their everyday work.
They are being presented as a portrait of the U.S. Navy's core
values _ honor, courage and commitment _ as well as of their sense
of mission and team spirit: they will stand in a formation that
will create a white square inside a museum gallery that is itself a
white square. The piece is supposed to represent military rules and
esthetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large Navy base here, but the military is a
constituency that museums have ignored, which is why I like the
idea of engaging them in a positive way,'' Hugh Davies, director of
the museum, said. ``It certainly is an unlikely alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Move to Sotheby's
</P>
<P>
   Laura Paulson, who for 10 years worked in the contemporary art
department at Christie's and more recently was part of Christie's
20th-century art department, resigned from the auction house this
week to become head of Sotheby's department of contemporary art in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura was my biggest competition,'' said Tobias Meyer, head of
Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide. Ms. Paulson said
she welcomed the opportunity to head a department and added that
the large space Sotheby's plans to devote to contemporary art after
its York Avenue headquarters is renovated was another incentive.

 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday June 6.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you want to know the truth about fashion models,
allow us to paraphrase Ms. Donna Summer: They work hard, hard,
harrrd for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Turn this way. Lean that way. Try this on. Wear that.
</P>
<P>
   Models live their professional lives taking orders and wearing
whatever they're paid to.
</P>
<P>
   But when the top models in metro Atlanta gathered recently in
Woodruff Park for a ``grudge'' volleyball tournament among
agencies, sponsored by Atlanta CityMag, all that mannequin jazz got
put aside. The models took advantage of the opportunity to show off
their own sense of style.
</P>
<P>
   Most rebelled against the notion of wearing carefully
coordinated outfits. Instead, they pieced together looks consisting
of favorite items from their wardrobes. Women wore skimpy
sportswear separates that gave their navel rings and tattoos full
exposure; guys flexed their musculature in sleeveless T-shirts and
cut-off shorts.
</P>
<P>
   To them, it seems, the main ingredient to looking good this
summer is a great pair of sunglasses. And, while most of them
served and volleyed barefoot, the sidelines were laced with their
wide-strapped sandals and stunning running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the floppy ``Gilligan'' caps that a number of them
wore, a ``skin is in'' philosophy held sway, and they laid
themselves as bare as possible to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   As a not so subtle reminder that their respite from the rigors
of the rag trade was only temporary, though, Brandon Lewis, who
co-owns the Click agency, sported a T-shirt bearing the slogan,
``Please don't feed the models.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino and Phil
Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers initials appear at end of review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile. (SM) 1 hour, 46
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Castle'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caton.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny little sleeper from Australia. A cheerfully dimwitted
working-class bloke named Darryl (Michael Caton) takes on the
system when the neighboring airport decides to expand and tries to
force him and his family out of their home. It's a genial and
just-goofy-enough David-and-Goliath (Darryl-and-Goliath?) comedy
that aims to do little more than put a smile on your face. Which it
does. Handily. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' R (strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elodie Boucher
</P>
<P>
   and Natacha Regnier.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful character study of two young women trying to make
sense of life in a working-class town. The film is shot with a
documentarian style that registers every nuance. Subtitles. (SM) 1
hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' R (profanity, sexuality and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a
</P>
<P>
   bittersweet ode to the everyday lies people tell themselves to
justify their actions. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Endurance'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Haile Gebrselassie.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiar but engaging blend of travelogue, docu-drama and
sports film. It's the tale of wind-swift runner Haile Gebrselassie,
who plays himself, and his journey from a life of poverty in
Ethiopia to gold medalist at the 1996 Olympics. (SM) 1 hour, 27
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' PG-13 (violence and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Connery
</P>
<P>
   and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A thriller with no thrills. A he/she sexual pas de deux with
little
</P>
<P>
   chemistry. Sean Connery plays Max, a dapper thief swiping
priceless works of art and computer chips. A shapely insurance
agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) slinks into the picture and
``Entrapment'' becomes a cat-and-mouse game with lots of twists and
turns. Sadly, it's almost always a bore. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 50
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding with free-spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My Best Friend's
Wedding,'' it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy formula and wise
'90s updates. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' R (intense violent behavior)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins
</P>
<P>
   and Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Resist your instinct to see it. Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins
plays an anthropologist locked up in a psychiatric prison
surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates. It seems that, after living for
months with gorillas in the African wilds, he went berserk and
killed two natives. Why? It's up to a psychiatry student (Oscar
winner Cuba Gooding Jr.) to pick his mind. It's twaddle. (SM) 2
hours, 4 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Masks'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Zhu Xu
</P>
<P>
   and Zhou Ren-Ying.
</P>
<P>
   A charming fable about the growing bond between a street
performer and his adopted child. It's also a good treatise on the
treatment of females in 1930s China. Though it suffers some lapses
of sentimentality and melodrama, it's held together by its
emotional core. In Mandarin with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 35
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' R (language, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years
in this sometimes hilarious and racially poignant prison comedy.
How they landed in a Mississippi correctional facility with life
sentences isn't nearly as important as the knack these talented
performers have for taking turns at
</P>
<P>
   generating laughs out of a throwaway script. (Bob Longino). 1
hour, 49 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock
</P>
<P>
   and Two Smoking Barrels'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng.
</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, conniving East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet
</P>
<P>
   Harry. Rookie writer/director Guy Ritchie piles on the
characters, plot twists and violence, but one thing is clear:
Everyone involved had a fine time making this movie. (ERG) 1 hour,
45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Capshaw,
</P>
<P>
   Tom Everett Scott
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   Not lovable, but generally likable. An anonymous love letter
circulates among the residents of a small New England town setting
off rendezvous, revelations and romantic misunderstandings. The
film has two problems: It flirts with a serious case of the cutes
and Kate Capshaw, sexually appealing and adorably flustered, never
quite takes over her own star vehicle. Still, it has enough charm
to keep you interested. (ERG) 1 hour, 29 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne
</P>
<P>
   and Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure starring Keanu Reeves that should please comic book
fanatics and mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with
stunning special effects and action, it's a movie that earns its
explosions, high kicks and cascades of spent bullets. (SM) 2 hours,
15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' PG-13 (pervasive adventure violence
</P>
<P>
   and partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Mummy, make it stop! Please! Just because a movie has desert
scenery, a hunky action hero (Brendan Fraser), hissable bad guys
and supernatural hoodoo doesn't make it an Indiana Jones flick.
You'll miss Steven Spielberg's masterful touch watching ``The
Mummy,'' a petrified mixture of retro adventure, clumsy slapstick
and minimal chills. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Never Been Kissed'' PG-13 (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore
</P>
<P>
   and David Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is Josie Geller, a newspaper copy editor in her
mid-20s and former high school dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they
called her) who goes back to teenville as an undercover reporter,
promptly relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way
to popularity. Everything about her career is implausible. The
movie's jokes are lame, its situations loopy. But Barrymore does
make a go of it. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use,
</P>
<P>
   some thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teenager Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I
</P>
<P>
   _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM) 2 hours, 11
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swindle'' Not rated, but there are
</P>
<P>
   flashes of violence
</P>
<P>
   Starring Isabelle Huppert
</P>
<P>
   and Michel Serrault.
</P>
<P>
   In Claude Chabrol's 50th film, Isabelle Huppert and Michel
Serrault play a pair of small-time scam artists who get in over
their heads when she gets ambitious and involves them in a scheme
to steal five million Swiss francs. A character study disguised as
a caper flick, ``The Swindle'' is a sweet-natured bit of flim-flam
fluff that expertly showcases the old-pro charms of its stars. In
French with subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright,
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
own autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven
but enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy,
entrusted to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thirteenth Floor'' R (profanity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Craig Bierko,
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Mol
</P>
<P>
   and Armin Mueller-Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   A ``what is reality?'' sci-fi thriller that doesn't measure up
to earlier and better films such as ``The Matrix'' and ``Dark
City.'' It's about a modern-day computer whiz team that creates,
then walks around in, a digitized version of 1937 Los Angeles. What
follows is murder, intrigue and too much flat acting. Your ultimate
warning: The movie's from some of the creative team that earlier
flubbed ``Godzilla.'' (Bob Longino) At metro theaters. 2 hours. C
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is My Father'' R (sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Aidan Quinn
</P>
<P>
   and Moya Farrelly.
</P>
<P>
   A burned-out teacher travels to Ireland to unravel the mystery
of his father. What unfolds is a tragedy, tinged with romance and
regret. In '30s rural Ireland, a headstrong young beauty (Moya
Farrelly) falls in love with a shy tenant farmer (Aidan Quinn)
nearly twice her age. But everything conspires against the lovers _
from curses and small-town snobbery to the kind of timing that
makes Romeo and Juliet look lucky. (ERG) 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Seasons'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harvey Keitel,
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Ngoc Hiep and Don Duong.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of three awards at Sundance and further distinguished as
the first U.S. film shot in Vietnam since the war, this tenderly
appealing
</P>
<P>
   pastiche interweaves several obliquely connected stories while
catching a country in transition between a conflicted past and an
uncertain future. Reminiscent of Italian neorealism, the movie may
be narratively facile, but it's visually and emotionally rich. With
subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Trekkies'' PG (sexual and drug references)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by Roger Nygard,
</P>
<P>
   with Denise Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Nygard's documentary looks at the TV franchise's ardent
</P>
<P>
   followers with a tone that fuses affection and deadpan satire.
Most of the time, Nygard and game narrator/interviewer Denise
Crosby let the fans speak for themselves, often with
unintentionally hilarious results. If you ever wondered what your
dog or cat would look like in a Star Fleet uniform, this is your
movie. (SM) 1 hour, 28 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Trippin''' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Deon Richmond
</P>
<P>
   and Donald Adeosun Faison.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps trippin' up on its own mixed message. Deon Richmond
plays Greg, a high school senior whose plans for college keep
getting waylaid by his fantasies of living the phat life,
surrounded by gorgeous women whose sole goal in life is to show him
their breasts. The movie has flashes of charm and heart, but
they're undermined by the filmmakers' pandering to the basic
instincts of its target teen audience. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Twilight of
</P>
<P>
   the Ice Nymphs'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pascale Bussieres
</P>
<P>
   and Alice Krige.
</P>
<P>
   Another cinematic whatsit from the fertile mind of Canadian
auteur Guy Maddin. His latest fractured fairy tale follows the
lovelorn adventures of hunky Peter, torn between a mysterious woman
named Juliana (Pascale Bussieres) and a married temptress named
Zephyr (Alice Krige). It's cuckoo but a truly unique screen vision.
(SM) Through Thursday at Cinefest (Georgia State University).
404-651-2463. 1 hour, 31 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``William Shakespeare's
</P>
<P>
   A Midsummer
</P>
<P>
   Night's Dream'' PG-13 (sensuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, magic doesn't happen. A sexy cast, a classic play,
the
</P>
<P>
   sensuous Tuscany countryside. How could ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' misfire? Blame it on director Michael Hoffman, whose
</P>
<P>
   picturesque but pedestrian approach dims the sparkle of William
Shakespeare's script. (SM) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nigel Hawthorne
</P>
<P>
   and Jeremy Northam.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet proves an unexpectedly good match for Terence
Rattigan's 1946 play loosely based on a true story of an Edwardian
patriarch's risky and costly fight to clear his 13-year-old son's
name when the boy is expelled from a prestigious school for
stealing pocket change. Mamet brings care, thoughtfulness and even
a theatrical spark to the material. Nigel Hawthorne and Jeremy
Northam lead an excellent cast. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Phil Kloer) 41 minutes. B-

DAMAGED, AND STRANDED, ON AN ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in ``Notting Hill'' may be the
year's most adorable screen couple. But in evoking a burgeoning,
thorny grown-up relationship laden with heavy baggage, Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio and David Strathairn run rings around them
in John Sayles' powerful, boldly discursive film ``Limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Donna De Angelo, a well-traveled folk-rock performer
eking out a living as a lounge singer in Juneau, Alaska, Ms.
Mastrantonio digs into the sharpest crags of the role: a talented
second-tier performer who grits her teeth while counting her losses
but refuses to quit a troubadour life that still provides moments
of artistic transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   The wised-up veteran of a fading musical culture, Donna has
enough perspective to be able to joke that despite her miserable
track record with men, she was never foolish enough to get involved
with a drummer. She may be damaged, but she is not broken down, at
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Donna's heaviest item of baggage is her resentful, frizzy-haired
teen-age daughter Noelle (Vanessa Martinez) from a former marriage,
who trails around after her. Noelle, who has inherited her mother's
tough facade, is an enormously promising writer who harbors a
bottled-up anger that comes out in impulsive acts of
self-mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   The film's early scenes find Donna abandoning her latest
disaster of a boyfriend and his band and hitching up with Joe
Gastineau (Strathairn), a lean, weatherbeaten former fisherman and
jack-of-all-trades. Strathairn's blend of intense, guarded
intelligence and compressed machismo are ideal for the role of a
veteran outdoorsman haunted by his responsibility for two drownings
in a freak sailing accident 25 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If this oddly structured film feels like two short stories stuck
together, there is enough solid glue joining them that they
resonate off one another deeply.
</P>
<P>
   The first story is a satirically edged portrait of contemporary
Alaska in the throes of what might called development hell, which
has begun to threaten the livelihood of the region's old guard
residents. The second is a spare, gripping survivalist drama that
demystifies any dreamy notions we might have of living an Outward
Bound-type experience in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens at a fund-raising event that introduces the
major characters as they mingle with beady-eyed developers spouting
grandiose plans to transform America's largest state into a
wilderness theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Disney-worthy illusions, we hear about islands
stripped of timber except for a fringe of trees maintained to keep
up an appearance of virgin forest for passing tourist boats. At the
same time we watch the closing of a fish- processing plant and hear
ominous accounts of the area's diminishing fish stock.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes of tourists herded around by guides reeling off
mechanical spiels about the rugged old days offer a depressing
preview of what's to come: a kind of virtual Alaskan frontier
experience with minimal physical risk and discomfort to boatloads
of affluent retired people.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's description of the freedom and exhilaration he has
experienced living close to the bone as a fisherman, and Donna's
talk about the joy of ``hooking into'' the essence of a song on a
good night, establish them as kindred spirits: brave, hard-bitten
romantics who are getting on in years but who remain unwilling to
settle for a more comfortable but ``inauthentic'' life.
</P>
<P>
   But how authentic do they, or any of us really want life to be?
That's the big question that ``Limbo'' explores in its second half
when it finds Donna, Joe and Noelle suddenly stranded on a deserted
island without provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how they came to this fix is a not altogether
believable tale of corrupt high adventure, drug dealing and murder
involving Joe's half-brother Bobby (Casey Siemaszko).
</P>
<P>
   Shivering in their wet clothes and fearful of being shot to
death, the castaways are faced with meeting their most basic needs:
food, water, shelter and warmth. And the movie does a fine job of
capturing their initial shock and desperation and their coming to
terms with the prospect that they may never be rescued. (It also
doesn't have the wilderness cliche scene of a menacing bear.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they set up house in a rickety abandoned cabin that
was once inhabited by a fox farmer and his family. Here, Noelle
discovers the abandoned diary of a girl about her age who
accompanied her parents to the island. Noelle's nightly readings
describe a pioneer idyll that quickly deteriorates into a hell of
boredom, drudgery, failure and a despair verging on madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo,'' like all of Sayles' films, is unabashedly schematic,
and its screenplay veers back and forth between moments that feel
wonderfully spontaneous and awkwardly expository.
</P>
<P>
   Once the main characters are castaways, the movie develops in a
strand of mystical fatalism (in the diary and Noelle's relationship
to it) that cuts glaringly against the naturalism. It's a risky,
literary choice that some will find irritating.
</P>
<P>
   But if the film's bones are too prominent and its abrupt ending
highly problematic, the questions it raises and its characters'
humanity make `Limbo'' a compelling experience. A stately Bruce
Springsteen song, ``Lift Me Up,'' that rises over the final credits
ends the movie on a note of tragic supplication. &QL;

 &HT;    What became of Einstein's brain, other `Life Stories'
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, June 6.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Booknotes: Life Stories. By Brian Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Times Books. $27.50. 471 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, nobody could say for sure where the brain was. This
most remarkable of brains, one that changed the world and changed
our understanding of the world, one that had to be wired
differently _ somebody borrows it and the damned thing gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   It was just what Albert Einstein was afraid would happen.
</P>
<P>
   When Denis Brian, one of Einstein's biographers, learned of this
macabre story, he set about writing a chapter entirely on the
brain. Three years ago, he was telling the story to C-SPAN's Brian
Lamb on ``Booknotes'' because it had come to him as ``such shocking
news.'' The great physicist had told family and friends he wanted
no memorials after he died, and he especially wanted no part of him
to remain. He wanted to be cremated, brain and all.
</P>
<P>
   But the dead are at a disadvantage, and no one knew it better
than the man doing the autopsy. Overcome with curiosity, the
pathologist evidently persuaded Einstein's son to leave this one
organ with him for research. Sons betray fathers in unaccountable
ways, and the only condition Hans Albert Einstein set was that
there be no publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Word was out, of course, almost immediately. In The New York
Times. Einstein's brain, available for dissection. But more of this
later.
</P>
<P>
   Questions no one else would ask
</P>
<P>
   Brian's anecdote is one of many in ``Booknotes: Life Stories,''
excerpts from 77 interviews Lamb has conducted with authors over
the show's 10-year history. It's a sequel, of sorts, to the
well-received ``Booknotes: America's Finest Authors on Reading,
Writing and the Power of Ideas,'' published in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among loyal viewers, the TV show's format has become an
essential part of the experience. For an hour on Sunday evening,
Lamb (who will sign copies of the new book at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday
at Borders Books &AMP; Music on Peachtree Road) sits across a plain
coffee table from his guest, asking questions no one else would
ask. If sometimes they are questions you wouldn't think needed
asking, Lamb can laugh at himself. ``Admittedly,'' he writes, ``my
question, `Who was Abraham Lincoln?' did elicit raised eyebrows
from a Lincoln historian.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's by asking such questions that Lamb gets authors to tell
stories a viewer wouldn't expect to hear. One of the most unlikely
was told by Ron Chernow, who wrote a biography of a man _ John D.
Rockefeller _ in whom he hadn't the slightest interest: ``I told my
editor at Random House, Ann Godoff, that I thought Rocke-
</P>
<P>
   feller was the worst subject imaginable _ that he just seemed to
me cold, wooden, mechanical, ruthless, a man without any interior
life that I could see.''
</P>
<P>
   But he took the old tycoon on, and what he found was the person
William James had called ``the most strongly bad, and strongly
good, human being he had ever met.'' And one of the strangest. ``He
became something of a New Age health fanatic,'' Chernow told Lamb.
``He had all sorts of theories (about) how he could prolong his
life. This was the bane of his luncheon companions, but he used to
chew food 10 times before swallowing. Guests who observed him
closely said that even when he had liquid in his mouth he would
swirl it 10 times before swallowing.''
</P>
<P>
   A smorgasbord of characters
</P>
<P>
   As the above might suggest, the charm of Lamb's book is what it
reveals about the oddity of human character. But there is something
odd about the book, too. It is organized by centuries, with birth
dates determining whether a subject is pigeonholed in the 1700s,
the 1800s or the 1900s. You're not surprised to find George
Washington in the 1700s, Lincoln in the 1800s or Bill Clinton _ no
comparisons implied here _ in the 1900s. But lives often straddle
two centuries, and we associate a name by something more
significant than date of birth. Thus, Franklin D. Roosevelt, the
president whose term spanned the Great Depression and most of World
War II, and Harry Truman, the president who made the decision to
drop the atomic bomb, seem misplaced in the company of Ralph Waldo
Emerson and Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a quibble. The more important feature of
``Booknotes: Life Stories'' is its smorgasbord appeal. You can pick
a subject at random, read half a dozen or so pages and come away
with a sense of who that person was, whatever his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two of these subjects happen to be American presidents, a
reflection of C-SPAN's focus and, as Lamb writes, ``our belief that
the lives of the 41 men who have held this office mirror the
broader landscape of American history and values.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. And yet it is the wholly unexpected story that is
always arresting. I said I'd tell you what happened to Einstein's
brain. It sat in a jar in the pathologist's basement and got left
behind when he and his wife divorced. The wife got tired of seeing
it around, and said, ``I wish they'd get this damn thing out of
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four years after Einstein's death, it's been sliced up
like sushi. A Japanese scientist has some of it, a doctor in
Philadelphia other parts. For a man of 76, it was in excellent
condition, but otherwise just a brain. Clues to genius have yet to
turn up.

`FINDING NORTH': AN STREETWISE, A LITTLE NAIVE, WILL TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you can accept the artifice of a movie that deftly compacts
several overlapping genres, ``Finding North,'' the newest film to
feature that comically mismatched couple du jour, a gay man and a
straight woman, has its small wacky charms.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens Friday in New York City, is a buddy
movie, a road movie and a screwball comedy rolled into one
calculating, sentimental little package. The pairing is so patly
conceived that you could easily imagine these two eventually
joining ``Will and Grace'' on the small screen. Its orderly
wisecracks suggest the story was originally conceived for the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely traveling companions who fly from New York to Texas
are Rhonda Portelli (Wendy Makkena), a loquacious bank teller from
Brooklyn who loses her job on her 30th birthday, and Travis Furlong
(John Benjamin Hickey), a suicidal yuppie who recently lost his
lover to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In this anti-Cinderella yarn, the roles are reversed when Rhonda
retrieves Prince Charming's missing shoe from the Brooklyn Bridge,
where she happened to be in a car near the ledge where he stood and
contemplated jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda is a wisecracking, salt-of-the-pavement type of gal who
still lives with her parents. And in the movie's most tiresome
conceit, no matter where she is or what she is doing, Rhonda is
besieged by telephone calls from her nagging mother (Angela
Pietropinto), who is always shown sitting on the same couch beside
her catatonic husband.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes demonstrate that the cell phone, having added to
the petty annoyances of daily life, is well on its way to becoming
an equally ubiquitous (and annoying) sitcom prop.
</P>
<P>
   For someone as streetwise as Rhonda, it takes a ridiculous
amount of time to discover that Travis (whom she fancies as exactly
her type) is gay. In fact, it isn't until she has dogged him all
the way to Texas that he tells her.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Texas is where Travis' late lover Bobby grew up. Just
as Travis is about to swallow some sleeping pills, a package
arrives containing a cassette in which Bobby (the voice of Jonathan
Walker) instructs Travis to visit his hometown and settle some
unfinished personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Rhonda and Travis find themselves embarking on a
kind of treasure hunt in which they visit the personal landmarks of
Bobby's youth and at each stop pick up a new cassette giving
further instructions. They also decide they like each other a
little.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Rhonda's romantic frustrations are mollified by
the motel owner's hunky son, an eye-batting Li'l Abner-type who
takes an instant shine to her. The Texan characters all tend to be
good-hearted drawling yokels.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about ``Finding North,'' directed by Tanya Wexler from a
screenplay by Kim Powers, is remotely credible. But as the movie
babbles along, it maintains a head-in-the-clouds effervescence.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Travis comes to the end of his odyssey in a cemetery
with a gun in his hand. At this point, the movie turns into the
cloyingly icky message film you knew it would become.
</P>
<P>
   In its own sitcom-y way, ``Finding North'' effuses the fizz of
an updated Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedy, but with a Valerie
Harper-Cyndi Lauper hybrid as the female lead. If Hickey doesn't
have much more to do but mope and crab (which he does convincingly
and with dignity), Ms. Makkena succeeds in making her abrasive
urban naif almost likable. &QL;

`WHO'S IRISH': FREE AND CONFUSED BY INFINITE POSSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gish Jen's characters, Chinese immigrants and their
American-born children, find themselves commuting between two
cultures, between familial expectations and their own yearnings for
self-definition, between remembered traditions and shiny, new
dreams. As perennial outsiders, they are acutely aware of the
strange, sometimes baffling workings of the world around them and
the odd, unforeseen ways in which race and prejudice and family
history can complicate their sense of who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Like her characters, Ms. Jen _ who grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y.,
the daughter of immigrant parents _ has a keen eye for the
incongruities of contemporary life, and in this beautifully
articulated new collection of stories, she gives us a gently
satiric look at the American Dream and its fallout on those who
pursue it. She captures the absurdities and self-indulgences of a
country where adjectives like creative are attached to everything
from guitar playing to the selection of clothes, but she also
captures the wonderful sense of freedom it can confer on
individuals who are new to its shores.
</P>
<P>
   In two novels, ``Typical American'' (1991) and ``Mona in the
Promised Land'' (1996), Ms. Jen chronicled the lives of two
generations of a Chinese-American family: Ralph and Helen Chang,
who move to the States and achieve the good life in the suburbs by
opening a pancake house, and their daughters, Mona and Callie, who
struggle to map out independent lives of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In this collection of stories, she gives us some further takes
on the immigrant experience. Two of the stories, ``The Water Faucet
Vision'' and ``In the American Society,'' appear to be studies for
those earlier novels and stand somewhat shakily on their own; the
remaining tales introduce us to new characters who prove to be as
appealing and as ambivalently Americanized as the Changs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these people seem to be tottering on the edge of that
very American phenomenon, the identity crisis. As newcomers to
America, they take this country's promise of infinite possibility
seriously, a prospect that brings both liberating freedom and
dizzying dislocation. Members of the second generation in
particular find themselves pulled between the urge to fit in _ what
one character calls the ``fear of the weird'' _ and the suspicion
that their parents' pursuit of bourgeois respectability is somehow
empty.
</P>
<P>
   Addie, who is expecting a baby, has abandoned her quest to
``achieve immortality as a sculptress,'' having given up art to try
hospice work and garden design (``Just Wait''). Art Woo, who works
in a dying sector of the computer business, finds himself reviewing
the collapse of his marriage and dreaming of a new start on the
West Coast (``Birthmates''). And Duncan Hsu, who has dropped out of
military school, law school and computer programming school, moves
to China, where he finds himself hailed as a ``foreign expert'' in
``Duncan in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, like so many of Ms. Jen's characters, has had to contend
with the pressure of parental expectations: his mother calls every
day ``lest he imagine he had become the sort of son about whom she
could boast.'' She is always comparing him with his successful
brother Arnie, who runs a lucrative import-export business, while
Duncan worries that he has become ``a free man who believed nothing
in particular, who did nothing in particular,'' a ``free man who
had not even embraced his freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Pammie, the heroine of ``House, House, Home,'' the longest and
most ambitious story in the volume, has grown up as the dutiful
fifth daughter of struggling immigrants, and she has had to learn
from her American husband, Sven, that life can be fun, or ``at
least that there was no point in not having fun. That as often as
not, one's actions had no consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a shock to discover for Pammie,'' Ms. Jen writes.
``She had grown up considering the optimum use of every dollar and
every hour. Every action brightened or dimmed the great drive-in
screen of the future.'' While Pammie conscientiously remembers the
birthdays of all her relatives and carefully plans what to get
them, Sven, her former art history professor, chides her for
spending her life ``trying to remember and please.'' She will never
be a successful artist, he asserts: ``There is no such thing as a
nice artist. And there is no one nicer than the daughter of an
immigrant.''
</P>
<P>
   As their marriage unravels, it becomes clear that race and the
sense of otherness that often accompanies race have heightened
tensions between them. When Pammie's relatives question him as a
representative member of that American genus, the white college
professor (``Do art professors eat lunch? Do art professors eat
breakfast?''), he objects that he is ``not a specimen.'' And when
Sven takes up the study of Chinese art and begins encouraging
Pammie to wear Chinese dresses, she wonders, as a friend later puts
it, whether this was proof that ``Sven had seen her as other, as
not-self, as object to his subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the stories _ most notably ``Chin,'' a
simplistic study in prejudice _ are weaker than others, they all
evince Ms. Jen's wonderful ear for the idiosyncrasies of American
speech (and Chinese-American pidgin) and her ability to portray her
characters' lives with both bemusement and genuine affection. She
limns the inner lives of her heroes and heroines with authority and
aplomb while introducing a vivid supporting cast, from a crotchety
Chinese professor who has ``a loop-de-loop manner of talking with
his hands'' to a first-grade girl ``best known for having dressed
up as Madeline four Halloweens in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   She shows with this sparkling volume that she is as at ease with
the short story form as she is with the long-distance form of the
novel.

A PAINTING PACKS A MILLION-DOLLAR SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston has paid $1.25 million for a
still life painting that for years covered a hole in the wall in an
Indiana home, its value unknown to the owner and its existence
unknown to art experts.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, ``Magnolias on Gold Velvet Cloth'' by the
19th-century American painter Martin Johnson Heade, was sold by a
man in his 30s who works at a tool-and-die company. He started to
realize the value of the work in January when he played
Masterpiece, a board game about art that includes an image of a
similar Heade.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, he turned to the Internet, found that Kennedy
Galleries in Manhattan handled Heade's work and sent an e-mail
asking if his painting might be by that artist. He then sent
digital images of it to Kennedy, which had the painting
authenticated and made the match with the Houston museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important rediscovery, and the painting is a
magnificent example of Heade's work at its best,'' said Theodore E.
Stebbins Jr., author of the 1975 catalog raisonne of Heade's works.
For the newly updated edition Stebbins, the American paintings
curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, quickly added the
Houston Heade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolias on Gold Velvet Cloth,'' painted around 1890, is the
third important Heade flower painting to turn up in recent years.
Last month at Christie's ``Two Magnolias on Blue Plush'' sold for
$882,500; the seller, a man from Wisconsin, had paid $29 for it at
a rummage sale a decade ago. And in 1996 Christie's sold ``Magnolia
Blossoms on Blue Velvet'' for $937,500; it had been bought along
with a smaller Heade of cherokee roses at an estate sale in Arizona
for $100.
</P>
<P>
   Heade, a meticulous painter born in 1819 in Pennsylvania, is
known for his luminous landscapes and nature works as well as his
floral still lifes, which he painted largely after settling in St.
Augustine, Fla., in 1883. It makes sense that these works are now
being rediscovered, said Paul Provost, the American paintings
expert at Christie's, because many people purchased them while on
vacation in Florida then took them to their homes around the
country. ``They were passed down in the family, whose members
didn't always know what they had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The seller of ``Magnolias on Gold Velvet Cloth,'' who wants to
remain anonymous, bought it along with some furniture years ago for
``next to nothing,'' said Martha J. Fleischman, the president of
Kennedy Galleries. ``He was ignorant of the value, but he loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heade's magnolia still lifes, which capture the blossoms at
close range and in various stages, number fewer than 20 and are
indeed popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are evocative, elegaic paintings, with soft, tender
light, unique in American still-life painting,'' Provost said. The
Boston museum, the National Gallery in Washington and the Art
Institute of Chicago are among the museums that own examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sets this apart from his other magnolia paintings,'' Ms.
Fleischman said, ``is that there's a little bit of leaf mold on one
of the leaves, like a beauty mark.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Ms. Fleischman saw ``Magnolias on Gold Velvet Cloth''
coming up on her computer screen, ``I got very excited,'' she said.
``I knew it was real, and I felt it was a museum-quality picture.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the people at the Houston museum, once they learned of
the discovery in March. In her excitement Ms. Fleischman had
confided to a decorative-arts curator there that she ``had made the
find of my life,'' but could not yet disclose what it was. Emily
Ballew Neff, the museum's curator of American art, was soon on the
phone to her, asking to know of the discovery as soon as Ms.
Fleischman could tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called her every week or every other week to let her know
we'd be interested,'' Ms. Neff said. ``The second she told me what
it was, I knew we had to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting was sent to Houston for inspection in late March.
It was, as Ms. Fleischman had already discovered, still in its
original frame and in near-perfect condition, protected from wear
by the original glass. ``I was 99 percent certain that this
painting would never leave Houston,'' Ms. Neff said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter C. Marzio, the museum's director, called an emergency
meeting of its trustees, who approved the purchase in less than an
hour and a half. One trustee, who chose to remain anonymous,
provided most of the cash, and two foundations provided the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolias on Gold Velvet Cloth,'' the museum's first work by
Heade, went on view in Houston on Wednesday.

   NEW YORK _ The audience, for the moment, is the mirror for the
exasperatingly pretty young woman who is standing in the center of
the stage. She gazes into the darkness where we sit, rearranging
her waist-length hair with fascinated preoccupation, intensely
focused, it would seem, on the vision of her own face and body. She
is a study in rapturous self-communion that somehow goes way beyond
vanity.
</P>
<P>
   For there is wondering detachment in that gaze, a sense that
what she is looking at is not just herself but herself as seen by
others. She speaks with quiet, blissful gravity of the idea of
being a disembodied image, and for that one uncanny instant those
of us watching this actress portraying an actress seem to share
exactly her vision; her eyes are ours. As conjured by the stunning
young Swedish theater star Elin Klinga, it's a giddy, slightly
discomforting feeling, both abstract and alarmingly intimate.
</P>
<P>
   You have probably experienced this sensation before if you are
familiar with the films of Ingmar Bergman, who throughout his
half-century as a director has consistently and unnervingly found
the spirit in the flesh of his actors, the metaphysical in the
physical.
</P>
<P>
   The great joy in watching the Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden's
production of ``The Image Makers,'' a play by Per Olov Enquist that
can be seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater
only through Sunday, is in observing how Bergman translates that
same sensibility through deceptively simple-looking stagecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Enquist's endlessly reflective drama, a tale of artists both
literary and cinematic in the early days of silent pictures, is by
no means on a level with Bergman's screenplays for films like
``Persona'' and ``Cries and Whispers.'' Though it considers such
quintessentially Bergmanesque themes as the relations between
autobiography and art, between guilt and redemption, ``The Image
Makers'' works overtime in explaining itself, in tying up its
conundrums into neat packages of metaphors and psychological
answers to the mysteries of artistic creation. Suffice it to say
that how oysters make pearls figures prominently in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But any play directed by 80-year-old Bergman is not be missed.
This one may not summon the illuminating shadows of his ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night'' or ``Madame de Sade,'' but it is filled
with precisely rendered gestures that have an awakening physical
immediacy, the surprise of a sudden slap on the face. Indeed,
non-Swedish speakers may find themselves wanting to discard their
headsets, through which simultaneous translation is provided, and
simply luxuriate in the body language of the work's four actors.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why Bergman would have been drawn to
``The Image Makers,'' a dramatic rumination on a real-life
encounter between Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlof and filmmaker
Victor Sjostrom. Sjostrom was a mentor of the young Bergman and
appeared as an actor, to heartbreaking effect, in Bergman's 1957
masterpiece, ``Wild Strawberries.'' What's more, ``The Image
Makers'' is centered on Sjostrom's film ``The Phantom Carriage,''
which was adapted from a novel by Lagerlof and, in its depiction of
death as an animate and industrious presence, anticipated Bergman's
own ``Seventh Seal.''
</P>
<P>
   Enquist has written that ``The Image Makers'' is an
extrapolation on what is historically known about the meeting of
Lagerlof and Sjostrom in 1920, when the director visited the
novelist to read aloud to her the script he had made from her
novel. There was a long silence when Sjostrom finished reading,
after which Lagerlof asked her visitor if he wanted a drink;
nothing more. ``The Image Makers,'' as Enquist writes in his
preface to the work, is his speculative answer to a question he
posed to himself about that enigmatic silence: ``What did it
contain?''
</P>
<P>
   Silence, of course, as Bergman himself has made piercingly clear
throughout his work, can sound depths that words cannot. And while
Enquist presents a coherent and consistent argument, notable for
its tautly woven patterns of symbols, his play is often exceedingly
talky and didactic, with no ambiguity left unverbalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Image Makers,'' which resets the meeting between two
ostensibly different artistic minds in Sjostrom's film lab in
Stockholm, painstakingly identifies the roots of creative
inspiration. It does so in ways that start to smack of latter-day
group encounter sessions in which one person keeps hammering away
at another with merciless questions, stripping away illusions that
conceal a hard, quantifiable kernel of truth.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that this question-and-answer process is
largely carried out by two astonishingly vivid performers, Anita
Bjork as Lagerlof and Ms. Klinga as Tora Teje, the brash, brilliant
actress with whom Sjostrom (portrayed with self-effacing restraint
by Lennart Hjulstrom) is having an affair. The play's quartet is
completed by Julius Jaenzon, Sjostrom's cinematographer, who, as
embodied by Carl-Magnus Dellow, is crippled by clownish lust for
the tantalizing Tora.
</P>
<P>
   It is Tora, not Sjostrom, who is the real catalyst in the play,
the product of a poor, unhappy family and scant education who feels
like an outsider and who wants, more than anything, to be let in on
the secrets of how art is made. But as is so often the case in the
world of Bergman, it is the men who are the real outsiders here, as
the women merge into a fierce, ambivalent complicity in which each
discovers herself in the other.
</P>
<P>
   As written, Tora is an irritating part, that of the harsh,
volatile truth seeker who speaks what no one else dares. Ms.
Klinga, however, wears both her beauty and her character's
self-dramatizing temperament with a touchingly defensive flair. She
has the long-limbed, graceful awkwardness of a newborn colt, and
this Tora can't help being elegant even at her most defiantly
vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bjork's Selma is Tora's physical opposite, gravity cast in
granite. Yet from the moment she makes her entrance, as if a
battleship sailing majestically into a harbor, you know that this
woman's poise is the hard-won product of a relentless will. As Tora
chips away at the woman's stoniness, needling and supplicating, Ms.
Bjork relents by beautifully calibrated degrees. Her facial
expressions appear fractional, yet they are so articulate you often
have the feeling you are watching her face in close-up.
</P>
<P>
   The resonant physicality of these two women winds up eclipsing
everything else in the production. That includes Goran Wassberg's
simple, eminently functional set, Mago's handsome period costumes
and even the projected clips from Sjostrom's dark fantasia of a
film (which is being shown in its entirety as part of a related
film festival at the Academy). These cinematic images have a grimly
ethereal quality that you can't quite connect, except in bald
thematic terms, to the very solid living figures on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, what Bergman and his actresses can do with the solid
human form. Watch for the scene in which Ms. Bjork, in a shocking
contradiction of her posture through the rest of the evening, falls
fluidly to the floor; it's a strangely quiet moment, but it
registers like a fist in the stomach. And there is the absolutely
delectable vision of what Ms. Klinga cunningly achieves with her
bare feet when Tora takes off her shoes in the second act. Under
Bergman's direction, even toes can speak louder than words.

FROM A LIGHTNING STRIKE, A $3.6 MILLION FOREST FIRE GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Colo., Okl., Fla., Ga.)  
(dw) 
 By KAREN VOYLES The Gainesville Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLUSTEE, Fla. _ The Friendly Fire near the Florida-Georgia
border could be renamed Expensive or Expansive. It has already cost
the federal government an estimated $3.6 million to fight, and by
Thursday flames had consumed 64,000 acres of wilderness and
swampland.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money not spent on helicopters and water-dropping
air tankers will make its way to small-town shops, motels and
restaurants. But ultimately, the fire may cost the area economy,
one business leader said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was named for the hunting camp in the Osceola National
Forest near where a lightning strike sparked it two weeks ago.
Within days, the fire had spread to the Okefenokee National
Wildlife Refuge in southern Georgia and onto private timber lands
on both side of the state line.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no serious injuries and no homes were threatened
by the blaze. Officials credit a quick decision by local U.S.
Division of Forestry workers who saw how fast the fire was
spreading and called for help.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 firefighters, 12 helicopters, three air tankers,
70 fire engines and 70 bulldozers are assigned to the area and paid
for by the federal government. Firefighting efforts continued in
shifts around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our estimated costs for this fire are $3,611,736, and about
half of that is for the aerial equipment,'' said Steve Parsons, a
forest service employee from western Virginia who is serving as
operations spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also is paying dozens of on-call,
temporary firefighters from around the country who are willing to
take assignments anywhere in the nation on almost no notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also give the firefighters a per diem of $6 for breakfast,
$16 for dinner and we pay their hotel rooms,'' said James Meredith,
a forest service employee from Mississippi now serving as finance
chief for the Friendly Fire. Firefighters carry lunches provided
for them to their work sites at the beginning of their shifts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to handling meal money, motel bills and payroll
paperwork, Meredith has been struggling with concerns such as
finding places for firefighters to rent the more than 100
four-wheel-drive trucks and sport-utility vehicles they needed as
soon as they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   His staff is also dealing with purchasing problems, like where
to buy bottled water by the pallet and how to get huge quantities
of fuel for helicopters to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said his agency tries to buy locally to avoid shipping
costs. That could be a boon to places like Lake City, which is near
the Osceola National Forest, but Jim Poole, executive director of
the Lake City-Columbia County Chamber of Commerce, said expansive
fires last year caused the area to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long range, the losses to timber sales were more than
the gains made during the fire,'' Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   Poole said fires in north Florida last year resulted in a glut
of fire-damaged timber being rushed to sawmills. The glut pushed
timber prices down from $1,500 and $2,000 an acre to $500 an acre,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Timber producers were also hurt because they were selling wood
from trees that they had intended to market a year or more later.
</P>
<P>
   Among those assigned to the Friendly Fire was Maria Hennessey of
the Pike Inter-Agency Hotshot Crew. She was flown to Florida from
Monument, Colo., to work on her first assignment with the 20-member
crew. She said little of what she was taught about firefighting in
the mountains applies to this fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tactics are really different here because out West we work
more on establishing a fire line and here those are already in
place,'' Hennessey said. ``Here, we are doing other things, like
looking for those hotspots, instead of working with the hand tools
and creating those firebreaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crew member, Erin Johnson, is in her fifth year as a
hotshot firefighter. But she saw something she would never run into
out West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my first alligator from about 5 feet away _ he was
probably 3 or 4 feet long. It wasn't really frightening, just
surprising,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   John Youngbull flew in from El Reno, Okla., to fight a Florida
wildfire for the second time in two years. He saw something he sees
regularly back home _ his brother, Randy. The Youngbulls work for
the U.S. Division of Forestry in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   While John Youngbull fights blazes from a fire engine, Randy
Youngbull is a part of a 20-member crew working on the ground with
hand tools. This is the first time they've worked together so far
from home. And they agree on two things _ the need for water and
the attitude of local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my crew that it is really hard to adjust to the
humidity here, so drink a lot of water or someone will stick a
needle in your arm and pump fluids into you,'' said Randy
Youngbull. He said he learned that lesson a year ago while fighting
the fires in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't say enough about how nice everyone, all these
local residents, have been,'' said John Youngbull. ``We go places
out West, like in Idaho, and you get a fire right up to a fence
line, and there are big signs saying `no trespassing' and `no
federal employees allowed to cross the fence.' Here, people are
happy to see you and really want you to feel welcome.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANALYZE THIS,' starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal.
Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and
teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down,
so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a
mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is hilarious simply by
playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His
mobster finds just the right comic foil in Crystal as the
psychiatrist who utters the immortal, ``When I got into family
therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more
where that came from in this breezy comedic treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BESIEGED,' starring Thandie Newton and David Thewlis. Directed
by Bernardo Bertolucci (R, 92 minutes). Like all Bertolucci films,
the love story of an expatriate African woman (Ms. Newton) fleeing
an oppressive military regime and the reclusive British pianist
(Thewlis) for whom she works as a housekeeper in Rome is a visual
jewel. Based on a short story by James Lasdun, ``Besieged'' is a
film of few words and powerful images. (Especially of a military
coup in a poor African country.) The love is sealed through an
extraordinary act of self-sacrifice and a deepening appreciation of
each other's tastes in music. If this elliptical movie leaves too
much unsaid, it has strong understated performances by its two
stars (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ELECTION,' starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.
Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically
funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic satire of the
American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading
candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a
mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and
Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who
thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And the
hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a
style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for
hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping
all the characters a few beats off what they actually mean
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ENTRAPMENT,' starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper
summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice
among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the great-looking
insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Connery's
glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast
and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the
outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma
to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action
sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's
largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And here's a
nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ETERNITY AND A DAY,' starring Bruno Ganz. Directed by Theo
Angelopoulos (not rated, 132 minutes). Winner of the Palme d'Or at
last year's Cannes International Film Festival, this dreamy,
lulling film is the haunting poetic valedictory of a man spending
his last day on earth. As his memory leads him across the landscape
of his life, Ganz's soulful Greek writer (in a role originally
meant for Marcello Mastroianni) drifts through his past as he seeks
his life's meaning. The film's visual style is less magnificently
grandiose than the director's ``Ulysses' Gaze,'' but it roams from
mood to mood with a fluid, liberating assurance. It's a style
that's both trance-inducing and filled with unutterable emotion
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE,' starring Julian Sands, Femi
Ogunbanjo and Hanne Klintoe. Written and directed by Mike Figgis,
(R, 101 minutes). Figgis' visually ravishing cinematic tone poem
retells the Adam and Eve story (Adam is black and Eve is white),
interspersing it with semiautobiographical reveries of the
director's early childhood in Kenya and his teen and adult years in
northern England. The strands are drawn together in a final scene
of violence and betrayal set at a film shoot in Tunisia and
reminiscent of Antonioni's film ``The Passenger.'' The film is
moody verging on melancholy, the storytelling elliptical, its view
of eroticism menacing rather than joyful. Though marred by
pretentious symbolism and an overall vagueness, this film has many
spellbinding moments (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE LOVE LETTER,' starring Kate Capshaw, Blythe Danner, Ellen
DeGeneres, Tom Everett Scott and Tom Selleck. Directed by Peter
No-sun Chan (R, 88 minutes). Cathleen Schine's whimsical romantic
novel about a summer affair between a divorced bookstore owner (Ms.
Capshaw) and a college student half her age (Scott) bleaches out
pungent ruminations on May-September love in favor of a bland
cuteness. The teeny-weeny story revolves around an unaddressed,
unsigned love letter that floats into people's lives and recharges
their romantic fantasies. The dialogue is flat, the level of the
acting grade-B sitcom (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MATRIX,' starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the
film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with
a big debt to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the
storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are
indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a
gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a
Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main
stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the
Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters
seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying
stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).

Flockhart, Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci and David
Strathairn. Directed by Michael Hoffman (PG-13, 115 minutes). This
is potluck Shakespeare, with a wildly uneven range of performances
and no clear style holding them together. Rather than wonder why
the actors are wrestling with bicycles in 19th-century Tuscany (a
setting used much less enchantingly than it might have been), it's
best to focus on the most comfortably Shakespearean performances
and not wonder what Ms. Flockhart is doing here. Kline makes a
perfect Bottom, Everett slinks seductively through Oberon's role
and Ms. Pfeiffer makes an appropriately gorgeous fairy queen. The
younger cast members are largely used as window dressing for the
Leo-Does-Romeo set (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MUMMY,' starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold
Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134
minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent
spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror
classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an
unwieldy hybrid of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Abbott and
Costello Meet the Mummy'' via ``Night of the Living Dead.'' The
intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that
carries a fearful curse are Fraser (playing a swashbuckling
American in the foreign legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed
English librarian) and John Hannah (as her twitty older brother).
It's all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming
scarabs who burrow under the skin and do awful ``Alien''-like
things (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `NOTTING HILL,' starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Directed
by Roger Michell (PG-13, 105 minutes). The most romantic notion
here may be that a Hollywood star as famous as Ms. Roberts might be
out, unassisted, browsing for a book. But it's enough to bring her
together with Grant's bashful bookseller and let two
extraordinarily charming actors play out an intelligent flirtation.
As written by Richard Curtis with frequent wit and welcome echoes
of his ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' this is a bright, winsome
romantic comedy that's as teasing as the characters themselves,
inviting the audience to ponder the movie star's burdens of being
world-famous and desperately attractive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' (the Oscar winner for best film, best
original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best
comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Dame Judi
Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a
fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TEA WITH MUSSOLINI,' starring Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan
Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco
Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Dame
Maggie) who give ``Tea With Mussolini'' a patina of class obviously
relish chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted
from a chapter of Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of
English expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War
II. Dame Maggie, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of
the pack, nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are
shattered when the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves
carted off to another city where they are held under house arrest.
Cher is her usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving
wealthy American heiress and art collector who befriends the group
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WINSLOW BOY,' starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and
Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110
minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial
that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its
essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with
unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works
as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a
cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of
that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully
lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets
the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge
(Maslin).

EARNHARDT-CHILDRESS DEAL FORTHCOMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt and Richard Childress appear to be close to
agreement on a new contract that would keep them together through
2003.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed Earnhardt would get around $1 million a year
before his race purses are factored in. Earnhardt, 48, is the
second-winningest active driver on the Winston Cup circuit and
sixth all-time with 72 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started talking about it and it looks real positive, but
nothing has been decided, yet. We're continuing to talk,''
Childress said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say there's a good chance it will happen, but we haven't
agreed on anything yet,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's current contract with Childress expires after 2000,
and many felt he might retire when it ran out.
</P>
<P>
   That assumption, though, was based on Earnhardt winning a record
eighth Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Also figuring into the equation is the fact there does not
appear to be a ready replacement for Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, both Childress and Joe Gibbs put out feelers to
Busch driver Matt Kenseth, but he is going with Ford and Jack
Roush.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Childress and Kenseth had hooked up, he would not have
taken Earnhardt's seat, at least not immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has struggled since Childress went to a two-car team
in 1997 with Mike Skinner as his second driver.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt is in his 16th consecutive season driving for
Childress and also drove part of another year for him in 1981. He
owns his own team which presently fields a Winston Cup car for
Steve Park, a Busch car for his son, Dale Jr., and a truck team
featuring driver Ron Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has announced that Hornaday will move to the Busch
circuit next year when Dale Jr. goes full time in Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those outside interests, Childress said Earnhardt
remains committed to driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proud of what his son is accomplishing, we all are, but
he still wants to be known as a driver, not a car owner, and he
still has an intense desire to win,'' Childress said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to separate the two and he gives us 110
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any reason he can't continue to win if
we give him good equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a mutual respect for each other and I think we'll be
able to work things out, but nothing's been done yet,'' Childress
stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Childress said he wasn't sure when an announcement would be
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time when these things usually get done. I would
expect something before the end of the year, but I don't know if
we'll have anything before the end of the season,'' Childress said.
</P>

   CRASH _ LITTLE ROCK _ The pilot of the American Airlines jet

weather in the minutes before the accident, a federal safety
official said today. NTSB investigators hoped to talk to the crew's
first officer, Michael Origel, today to see what he remembers about
the minutes before the crash. They were waiting for a doctor's
authorization. They're also looking at the runway's grooving and
drainage system, both of which could have preventing hydroplaning.

   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ The Serbian parliament on Thursday
voted overwhelmingly to accept a plan to end the conflict over
Kosovo, giving in on all of the conditions demanded by NATO. The
Serbs' capitulation does not mean an immediate end to NATO's
bombing. Under the plan, the attacks would stop only after Serb
troops withdraw from Kosovo. Serb withdrawal may start Sunday. NATO
generals expected to come to Belgrade within days. Bombing expected
to stop then if not earlier. The U.S. State Department said the
deal would require ``verifiable deeds, not seductive words.'' The
deal calls for an armed peacekeeping force with ``essential NATO
participation,'' a condition the Yugoslav government had vowed
never to accept. And it requires that 850,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees be allowed to return to return to their homes. But the
plan also says that Kosovo will remain part of Yugoslavia and that
the United Nations will play a role in enforcing the peace. It was
unclear what the deal would mean for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes and might be
subject to arrest. Opposition parties have begun demanding that he
resign. (Deans, Cox News Service)

Campos _ who was kept isolated during his two-week stay due to
severe symptoms of alchohol withdrawal _ but he called
``questionable'' the four hours that Campos was left lying on the

sure.'' So now it looks as though the next budget will include
money for at least 4 and maybe as many as 7 of the $60 million
planes. That's what can happen when a powerful Democrat decides his
local National Guard unit absolutely needs one and the Senate
Majority Leader discovers a crying need for two in (guess where?)
Mississippi. (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

MIDLAND, TEXAS, STUDENT FALTERS IN 5TH ROUND OF SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stacey Moore, 14, of Midland, Texas, was knocked
out of the National Spelling Bee in the fifth round Thursday after
failing to spell the word ``excursus,'' which is a digression from
the main topic of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day she had successfully spelled
``braunschweiger,'' a type of German sausage, to earn a place in
the competition's fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday she had clinched a spot in the final rounds of the
bee by spelling ``cricetid,'' which refers to a family of small
rodents; ``monetary,'' which has to do with a country's coinage or
currency, and ``interminable,'' which means endless.
</P>
<P>
   The 72nd National Spelling Bee began with 249 spellers, ranging
in age from 9 through 15. When the competition resumed Thursday 104
spellers, including Stacey, were still in the running.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the winner was Nupur Lala, a 14-year-old from Tampa,
Fla., who correctly spelled ``logorrhea,'' which means incoherent
talkativeness.
</P>
<P>
   Nupur, an eighth grader at Louis Benito Middle School in Tampa,
credited her success to studying for two hours a day and to
``divine intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   She will receive a $10,000 cash prize, plus encyclopedias, two
airline tickets and computer software. The contestants, most of
whom were sponsored by their local newspapers, all won regional
bees to qualify for the national bee.
</P>
<P>
   In round four Stacey found things getting harder. She said later
she never heard of ``braunschweiger.''
</P>
<P>
   But after she asked the so-called pronouncer, one of the contest
judges, to give her the word's meaning and origin, she was able to
spell it. She knew that some letter combinations in German are
different from those in English in words with the same sounds.
</P>
<P>
   So the first part of braunschweiger sounded something like
brown, and she knew that the letters a-u in German sound similar to
the letters o-w in English.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey was one of 47 students to survive the fourth round. But
in the fifth round she spelled ``excursus'' as ``excurssis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard it before in my life,'' she said after she
left the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other contestants, she did not appear upset after
she was eliminated. She grabbed a soft drink and met her family
outside of the ballroom where the competition was being held.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey, who completed the eighth grade last week at Alamo Junior
High School in Midland, plans to continue her spelling efforts next
year when, as a ninth grader, she will compete on the Robert E. Lee
High School varsity spelling team.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Midland Reporter-Telegram, Stacey will receive
$150 for her efforts and a commemorative watch. She and her family
will also spend the rest of the week touring the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey said she hopes to return to the National Spelling Bee
next year, but not as a contestant. she and her mother Pam and her
father Bruce hope to be rooting for Stacey's younger brother
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, 11, who will be in the sixth grade at Crockett
Elementary School in Midland, said he someday hopes to represent
Midland in the National Spelling Bee, which is run by Scripps
Howard newspapers.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A swarm of potent thunderstorms will erupt later Friday and
Friday night across the northern and central Plains as volatile
ingredients come together. Very humid air streaming northward from
Texas will act as fuel, while a compact jet stream disturbance from
the Rockies combines with an arriving cool front to act as a match
by lifting humid air rapidly skyward. A few of the explosive storms
will quickly become severe from western South Dakota to western
Nebraska, with large hail, damaging straight-line winds and
tornadoes possible. Storms will forge east at night. As with most
outbreaks of severe weather, only a small fraction of the area at
risk will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated severe thunderstorms will erupt over eastern New Mexico
and west Texas as a cold upper-level low-pressure system approaches
from the southern Rockies. Underneath the broad canopy of the cold
upper-level low, scattered showers and thunderstorms, some with
brief downpours and gusty winds, will develop from the southern
Sierra of California to the mountains and deserts of Arizona and
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, widely separated thunderstorms, some heavy, will
develop across the eastern Gulf states, where very warm and humid
air near the ground bubbles skyward in the afternoon. Isolated
heavy thunderstorms will form in Florida in concert with the
leading edge of the sea breeze just inland from the Gulf and
Atlantic coasts.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Thursday's cool front, soothing breezes from the
northwest will complement low humidity across New England. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Elusive Butterfly &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weather is sometimes like an elusive butterfly. Indeed,
small-scale systems can literally fall through the cracks,
occurring between weather observing sites that might detect them.
In many cases, distances between weather sites are on the order of
a few hundred miles. But Oklahoma, a state noted for small-scale
systems of thunderstorms, has built a dense net to catch elusive
butterflies. In each county, there is at least one automated
observing site. The 114 sites create what is called a ``mesonet.''
On Wednesday, the net caught a very small-scale wind gust of 69 mph
near the town of Freedom.

 &HT;    Spoleto: Southern spin on arts
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ On a recent Sunday morning, the Rev. P.S.
Winton encouraged the capacity congregation of Grace Episcopal
Church to reach out to strangers. ``We want to help them become
Spoleticized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the secret to the success of the Spoleto Festival
USA, which every year turns warm-weather Charleston into a hot arts
destination for 17 days, starting Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is the time of festivals across the United States and the
world. Some are urban: New York's Fringe Festival, Seattle's
Bumbershoot. Some, like Aspen, take over a mountain for a week, a
month, a season. Charleston and Spoleto strike a nice balance
between the city and the small-town.
</P>
<P>
   In big cities, an arts festival tends to melt into the scenery.
Before it moved downtown and collapsed, the Arts Festival of
Atlanta managed to avoid anonymity by locating in Piedmont Park;
but a standard tourist junket to New York won't include the Fringe
Festival unless you know how and where to look for it.
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, the city's Spoleto dreams flower in June and
reseed themselves for next year. You don't get the sense that the
stores and cafes set their Spoleto posters in the window just for
two weeks. Last year's poster doesn't come down until the new one
arrives. Bookstores and treasure shops display the sequence of
Spoleto art over the years. There's a Southern sense of continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Though shopkeepers are eager, as in every festival town, to
relieve tourists of their money, they make an effort to be gracious
about it, and to offer service as well as goods. ``Now, everyone
gather round,'' says Diana Smith, who runs Cafe Cafe on Meeting
Street and will mix up the filling for a pecan pie right before
your eyes, so you know it wasn't smuggled in from Stuckey's.
</P>
<P>
   The group she gathers is her early-morning servers, struggling
to cope with an overflow breakfast crowd on the festival's first
Saturday. ``I know things are busy and you're overwhelmed,'' she
says. ``But slow down a little. Take your time. Things aren't
getting done that should get done.'' She's referring to a slice of
coffeecake ordered but not delivered and other errata of that
nature. ``Remember we have a reputation to maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the young woman from New York City who came down to
Charleston on the spur of the moment to join her parents from
Connecticut and her sister and brother-in-law from Charlotte, N.C.
Because they had arranged well in advance for tickets to
hard-to-get events, she couldn't be assured that she'd be able to
join them. But the festival staff ransacked the box office and
managed to find one more seat for ``Ricky Jay and His 52
Assistants,'' the master card trickster who's been packing 'em in
off-Broadway for years. Maybe she wasn't sitting with the rest of
her family, but she was right across the aisle and three rows up.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of can-do attitude that makes people like
Danielle Roshirt, an IBM executive from Detroit, return to Spoleto
on a trip arranged by her travel club. The club arranges tours to
Africa, the Far East, Europe _ but Roshirt wanted to come back to
Charleston, where she can listen to chamber music and jazz, buy a
few pieces of Charleston art, jog around the Battery in the
relative cool of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Spoleto moves on several tracks. For the tourists, it's a place
overflowing with chamber music and dance, opera and theater, jazz
and performance art, exhibits and lectures, all held against a
backdrop of elegant old houses on narrow shady streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charleston is a charming city _ worth visiting for itself,''
said Kathryn Costello, senior vice president for external affairs
at the University of Georgia, who has made four pilgrimages to
Spoleto. ``I think the attraction is the continuous availability of
performing and visual arts in such a beautiful place.''
</P>
<P>
   Costello's agenda is typical of festival-goers. She said of this
year's visit, which took place over the four-day Memorial Day
weekend: ``We filled them up. Of course, you have to have the
stamina for it!''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a place where art deals are struck, where presenters
and producers, agents and managers look after their current
proteges and check out exciting new acts to add to their stables.
</P>
<P>
   ``David often stops by,'' said Spoleto general director Nigel
Redden, asked whether David Gockney, his counterpart at Houston
Grand Opera, would be there to scope out Spoleto's operas. Like New
York, this is a place to hear singers and see how stage directors
work, but New York is full of hassles and distractions. Here you
can seal your bargain with a fabulous crabcake sandwich and a
bottomless pitcher of iced coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Spoleto takes place in Charleston's historic district beside the
waterfront. ``In a city like Atlanta, you have your choice of
performances, but they're scattered all over the place,'' said
Costello. ``This is a more compact city, where you have exposure to
so much in an area of a few blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   This and the weather guarantee a pleasant informality. After
performances, you may run into a cellist lugging her instrument
down the street. Listeners and musicians step across the invisible
line of demarcation, and the only topic of conversation _ for a few
minutes, anyway _ is music.
</P>
<P>
   In the warm humid climate, musicians don't bother with formal
concert attire; audiences wear anything from black tie to jeans,
tailored cocktail dresses to broomstick skirts, wing tips to
sandals. By evening, everyone wilts, and no one minds.
</P>
<P>
   Why step out of time and place for an arts festival when you can
see some of these same groups on the Atlanta concert circuit?
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to go away and concentrate on something,'' says
Costello. ``It's good to be removed from the clutter of what
occupies your day. Everyone's there with a common interest and
purpose.''

   ``Can God Be Trusted?''
</P>
<P>
   By John G. Stackhouse Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press, $25
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   You're almost afraid to ask, but ... almost five decades after
C.S. Lewis' ``Mere Christianity,'' has John G. Stackhouse Jr.
written this generation's successor to that classic work of
religious sensibility?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbing effects of ``a never-ending stream of
tragedy, disaster, selfishness, and absurdity,'' the Canadian
scholar writes in ``Can God Be Trusted?,'' ``every once in a while
a story grips us, we sit up straight, and the old questions return:
`How could this happen? What kind of a world is this?' And we might
ask one of the oldest questions of all, `How could a good and
almighty God possibly allow such evil to occur?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse does not have an unassailable answer to that
question, which is one of his central points. But after making some
valid suggestions, he goes on to argue that Christianity depicts a
God who can be trusted nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse's work is marked by the same kind of commonsensical
yet penetrating arguments that made Lewis such a beloved figure.
Readers of ``Can God Be Trusted?'' may find that they have
discovered something wonderful.

LAWYER SAYS MAN LINKED TO MISSING ATHEIST IS INNOCENT OF MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A federal agent says Gary Karr played a role in
the apparent abduction and killing of famed atheist Madalyn Murray
O'Hair and her two adult children. But a lawyer who is prepared to
represent the ex-convict says Karr had no part in the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``He absolutely denies he had anything to do with the murders,''
said Thomas Mills, a Dallas lawyer who met with Karr earlier this
week in a Michigan jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he talked to the law enforcement people in good faith
and maybe they've turned on him, and he doesn't know why,'' Mills
said.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit of an Internal Revenue Service investigator
implicates O'Hair's former office manager, David R. Waters, 52, of
Austin; Karr, 50; and a heavy-drinking man from Florida named Danny
Fry, who was killed shortly after the O'Hairs vanished from San
Antonio, of kidnapping and murdering the family in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he traveled to Michigan Tuesday to talk with Karr,
who is being held near Detroit on a federal weapons charge. A
federal public defender is representing Karr in the weapons case,
which goes to trial July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he would defend Karr in Texas if and when he requires
representation there, and has already approached a judge in Dallas
about being appointed to that role. So far, Karr is charged in
Texas only with transporting stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   But Karr's admitted role in the O'Hair affair, that of a
helpful, uninformed bystander, contrasts sharply with the role
given him by the government in the affidavit filed in federal court
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   While the document paints Waters as the mastermind, it puts Karr
in the middle of the action, renting vans and a San Antonio motel
room allegedly used in the kidnappings and killing of O'Hair, Jon
Garth Murray and Robin Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   The March 23 affidavit also says Waters and Karr later killed
Fry and dumped his headless, handless body by a river in Dallas
County.
</P>
<P>
   And according to an FBI agent who testified in federal court in
Detroit after Karr was arrested on March 25, Karr admitted
involvement in both crimes during 13 hours of interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   But Mills said the FBI exaggerated Karr's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some belief that Mr. Waters was involved but no direct
evidence of it. He is willing to tell the truth about the whole
thing,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said Karr played only a marginal role in connection with
the O'Hairs, who abruptly left Austin in late August 1995, spent a
month in San Antonio and then vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Madalyn Murray O'Hair gained prominence in the 1960s for her
successful court battles to eliminate organized prayer in public
schools. She went on to lead a national atheist organization.
</P>
<P>
   She and her children are presumed dead even though their bodies
have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said Karr also denies any involvement in the Fry murder.
</P>
<P>
   Karr does admit knowing something about where the O'Hairs might
have been buried and has tried to steer federal agents to the site
near Camp Wood, a town northwest of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where he thinks Waters thinks they are buried but he
says he was not there when the bodies were buried,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Two FBI searches of the site have failed to turn up any remains.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he decided to get involved in the case after
discussing it with Richard Helfrick, the public defender
representing Karr on the weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about the case grabs me. It looks like a case where
I can do some good for a person, and it looks like they have very
marginal evidence,'' Mills said of federal authorities. ``They are
trying to solve a mystery disappearance of well-known people by
making leaps of logic. It is all very fascinating.''

THIS `INSTINCT' IS WAY OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Instinct,'' it's as if Cuba Gooding Jr. had taken one of
the songs by his father's group, the Main Ingredient, a little too
seriously. Unfortunately, that song would be ``Everybody Plays the
Fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooding is a bright-eyed, ambitious teaching psychiatrist who is
handed the career opportunity of a lifetime by his mentor (Donald
Sutherland). The young shrink is asked to look into the case of an
eminent researcher, played by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins has been
transported to the Gothic and gloomy mental-institution wing of a
Gothic and gloomy prison.
</P>
<P>
   It's whispered that Hopkins went crazy while in Africa and
became a murderer. Hopkins hasn't spoken since, and in this movie
that's all over the place, you wonder at first if it's because he's
rebelling against the nonsensical plot. Or perhaps he's beginning
to honor his vow to quit acting _ which he took and recanted a few
months ago _ before your very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There is some small enjoyment to be had from ``Instinct,'' which
comes from the chemistry of Hopkins and Gooding. As an actor, one
of Gooding's strengths is that he's steeped in energy and common
sense. (He's smart enough that he should be a step ahead of the
tired old plot, since the audience will be.)
</P>
<P>
   Gooding is intelligent enough to stay away from ``Hey, I'm
playing a smart guy'' cliches, like toying with a pair of glasses
so we know he's graduated from college. And Hopkins' wariness,
which he can play for either a joke or teary empathy, promises
something in the early scenes, after Gooding breaks through
Hopkins' silence. (He'd have to, or there would be no picture; not
that there's much of one anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   This prodding relationship, and the chasm between their acting
styles, is entertaining. What we come out of the picture wanting is
for Gooding and Hopkins to exploit their intensity in a much better
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins summons a dry-as-parchment authority once he starts to
speak. I know you, Hopkins teases in Gooding's face, because I was
you. It turns out that while researching a tribe of apes, Hopkins
had a breakthrough. He got closer to them, physically and
spiritually, than anyone ever had. And he reverted to instinctive
behavior, freed from the cold, insensitive grasp of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the civilization that this movie asks him to return
to, who would blame him? Especially when it comes to the
representation of the African poachers who charge through the
jungle, ruthlessly dispatching the apes. (Hopkins is filled with
guilt because he inadvertently led the men to the apes. They
tracked him by his discarded equipment, as Hopkins shed the
civilized tools that keep him insulated from the natural world.)
</P>
<P>
   It was in the jungle that Hopkins killed. ``Yes, and I'd kill
again,'' he threatens, having gained the superhuman strength that
all men seem to get from being in the jungle too long. The cast,
including Maura Tierney as Hopkins' flinty daughter who wants her
dad back, must've been warned by their instincts to get out of this
movie. They should've listened to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' is rated R for violence and adult language.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The journey to the stage starts with a plie, one arm
resting on a ballet studio barre. Month by month, year by year,
ballet classes get harder and the stakes higher. At last come a
first few experiences in a theater as a tiny, nervous cog in the
huge machinery of a ballet production.
</P>
<P>
   Many students begin by dancing children's roles in ``The
Nutcracker.'' At the New York City Ballet there are coveted roles
in other works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Peter
Martins that give students a chance to perform among grown-up
dancers and even with a few stars.
</P>
<P>
   For young dancers at the School of American Ballet, affiliated
with City Ballet, there is another goal: the yearly workshop
performances at which the outside world takes its first measure of
a dancer's worth. Begun in 1965 under the aegis of Alexandra
Danilova, who had just joined the faculty, the workshop was
inspired by the annual graduation performances of the Imperial
Ballet Academy in St. Petersburg, Russia, where she and Balanchine
trained.
</P>
<P>
   Today the workshop draws not only family and friends but also
ballet company directors, choreographers and writers intent on
spotting the next generation's most promising dancers. This year'
performances, which begin Sunday, will include Balanchine's
``Tombeau de Couperin'' and ``Valse Fantaisie,'' Robbins'
``Fanfare'' and Christopher Wheeldon's new ``Scenes de Ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   Two surrogate fathers are also likely to be in the audience
appraising their charges. Peter Boal and Jock Soto, both City
Ballet principals, teach a variety of classes at the School of
American Ballet, specializing in training the male dancers. Ballet
lives on in the handing down of its physical and cultural
traditions. Leading dancers in companies around the world return to
teach the young. It was not so long ago that Boal and Soto were
among the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have attended the workshops over the decades cherish
the memory of their first sight of Boal, a small, frail,
well-combed blond child of notably serious demeanor, gliding onto
the stage in Jean-Pierre Bonnefous' ``Quadrille'' in 1978. He had
so inherent a sense of classical elegance that the audience gasped.
Three years later a fledgling star named Jock Soto emerged in
Martins' ``Magic Flute,'' well schooled by Martins in the art of
ballet mime and already showing signs of his gifts as a partner and
performer.
</P>
<P>
   Soto and Boal will be performing with City Ballet this weekend
across Lincoln Center at the New York State Theater. At the school
they have taught boys to jump high with feet pointed stylishly.
Girls learn to hold their upper torsos at just the right angle for
the boys to slip firm but delicate hands around their waists as
they dance together. The boys learn how to curve their arms
precisely above their heads to suggest, at least subliminally, a
crown's conferring royalty on ordinary mortals. All are trained to
absorb and remember long combinations of steps, working them out
with dancing hands as they watch their teachers. That is a
necessary skill for succeeding in the companies with which these
young dancers will soon be performing and from which they will one
day venture themselves, perhaps to teach.
</P>
<P>
   This year's workshop performances by students at the School of
American Ballet are Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. (tickets are $25) and
Monday at 7 p.m. ($45) at the Juilliard Theater at Lincoln Center.
There is also a benefit supper on Monday, with tickets from $500 to
$1,000, including the performance. Reservations: (212) 769-6600.

   BELGRADE _ ``So why couldn't he have signed this 71 days ago?''
Jelena asked. ``Why did we have to have 1,500 of our people killed
by NATO and our country destroyed before our president agreed to
this peace?''
</P>
<P>
   As we sat outside the Knez restaurant in the muggy early summer
afternoon, there was a crack of sound as a NATO jet broke the sound
barrier high over Belgrade, as if Jelena needed to be reminded of
her own humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   For if Kosovo's future is now being decided in Washington,
London, Brussels and Moscow, what of the rest of Serbia with its
shattered factories and epic postwar unemployment, its broken roads
and pulverized bridges and bombed-out power stations and refineries
and railways?
</P>
<P>
   And what of those cemeteries of civilian dead and the constant
reminder to Yugoslavia's people _ those official graves with their
red, white and blue banners _ of the price their soldiers paid for
opposing NATO? What did they die for?
</P>
<P>
   There will be those here who will ask this question many times
in the coming weeks and months. They will want the answer from
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers and fathers of the thousands of Serb wounded will
want an answer to the same question. And not just the parents. The
soldiers too will have their questions, just as the nationalists
did in the Serb parliament Thursday morning, shouting their
defiance at the ``capitulation'' _ the word used by a Vojvodina MP
_ to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   They voted in favor of peace by 168 to 82 but almost came to
blows in the closed parliamentary chamber out of which stormed that
most ferocious of nationalists, Vojeslav Seselj.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Serbs held out under weeks of bombing by the most
powerful force on earth. And their defiance will become the stuff
of Serb mythology in the centuries to come, along with the
14th-century battle of Kosovo Polje, another epic defeat for the
Serb nation.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the immediate future of Kosovo? Turned into a
wasteland by two-and-a-half months of pillage and bombs, its
electricity and water supply destroyed, its communications torn up,
its villages and towns burned, its fields contaminated with the
dust of depleted uranium shells, what possible home can the
refugees return to?
</P>
<P>
   And what possible protection can the Serbs of Kosovo expect in
that critical moment between the departure of the Yugoslav forces
and the arrival of NATO and Russian armies?
</P>
<P>
   Already they fear the coming days. Retribution is the word that
springs to mind. For the Kosovo Liberation Army is going to emerge
from the hills and forests of Kosovo in the next few days with an
agenda quite different from that of NATO, let alone Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nothing is ever as it seems in Yugoslavia. And even
Jelena's cynicism at the Knez restaurant Thursday was slightly
misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   According to the text of the Kosovo peace agreement available in
Belgrade, Slobodan Milosevic has succeeded in erasing a key element
of the Paris peace agreement: a referendum on the future of the
province in three years' time that might have allowed Kosovo
Albanians to demand independence.
</P>
<P>
   And one of Milosevic's ministers was quick to seize on another
apparent departure from the March accord: the disappearance of an
annex to the Paris agreement which would have allowed NATO troops
free access to all of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, it appears, will have to move in and out of Kosovo only
through the narrow roads of Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   And a close scrutiny of the text suggests that if Serbia has
been humiliated _ its army and police in Kosovo reduced to a mere
skeleton, the province controlled by an army of foreigners _
Belgrade's guerrilla enemies in the KLA will face emasculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demilitarized'' by NATO, the KLA's declared intention of
achieving independence will be opposed by its western protectors.
And if Serbia's MPs are to be believed, Yugoslavia's frontiers are
now regarded as ``inviolable'' by the NATO powers.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Kosovo's independence. Will the KLA accept this _ or
will they turn against NATO?
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, it all seems academic. The papers here have been
advising readers how to keep warm this coming winter in a Serbia
which will have no infrastructure and few functioning power
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Burn trees from the forests and old floorboards, they are told,
store water in a land whose water pumping stations have stopped
working.
</P>
<P>
   They've even asked the tram and trolley-bus crews to reduce
their schedules to save electricity.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the dead. I saw many of them; Milena
Malobabic and her family, killed in NATO's bombing of the Surdulica
hospital. The Milic family _ mother and daughter and son-in-law and
granddaughters _ killed in NATO's bombing of a home in the same
town. And Father Milevoj Ceric, beheaded by a NATO bomb in his
churchyard at Varvadin. And all the Albanians slaughtered by NATO
along the road to Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   And all those Albanians slaughtered by the Serbs who lie in
unknown graves in Kosovo. There will be a reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   But war invisibly wounds the living, too. Take the lady who
cleans my hotel room each morning. Both her sons are at the front
in Kosovo and she has been weeping every day in fear for their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Now she need weep no more. But last weekend, one of them came
home on two days' leave. ``He had changed,'' she said. ``I don't
know what had happened to him. But he was no longer like my son. I
cry now because he is a different boy.'' &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ European leaders have one reason to be profoundly
grateful to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing that he accepts the terms of a peace deal on the
first day of the Cologne summit, he provided a distraction at an
event that would otherwise have been remembered as marking a nadir
of he EU's standing.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's ruble-like slide against the dollar not only reflects
the under-performance of the main economies inside the
single-currency zone.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a fitting symbol of institutional Europe's tendency
to talk a good currency/ a good war/ good reforms/ good cooperation
while proving unable to persuade the markets that the euro is
sound, or to prevent a barbarous conflict _ let alone the smaller
tasks of reforming its finances and preventing one of its members
from exporting contaminated food.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is fitting that the end to Kosovo's nightmare should be
heralded at an EU summit. It reminds us that this was a European
problem, albeit one that Europe proved unable to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most depressing spectacles of the last 10 weeks has
been that of European leaders, so solid in their support for
military action before the going got tough, so adept later at
ruling themselves out of ground troops and criticizing NATO for its
choice of targets.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to abrogating responsibility for what happens on
its own doorstep, Europe is the unrivalled world leader.
</P>
<P>
   European forces combined with American air support could have
liberated Kosovo. But there was never any chance that they would do
so.
</P>
<P>

care for fellow Europeans and the strength to uphold the basic

nothing.

<P>
   The future of Kosovo looks brighter than it did before Milosevic
accepted the deal. But we do not yet know whether it will achieve
the minimum objective of NATO's campaign _ to make the province a
safe enough place for the Albanian population to return, confident
that their future will not resemble the repression of the past.

<P>
   We must welcome the fact that NATO and Russia are using the same
language. But do they mean the same thing?

   Tony Blair was emphatic Thursday that an outcome that results in
partition is not acceptable. But it remains unclear how Russia
interprets her role in the protection force.

   Until last week, Russian diplomats were talking of
``sectorization,'' on the lines of postwar Germany. That flies in
the face of NATO's insistence on a unified command structure.

responsibilities and answerable to whom, few Albanians are going to
venture back.
</P>
<P>
   Neither have we heard what plans there are for the non-military
Serb minority in Kosovo. It is impossible after what has happened
that they should live side by side with the Albanians. ``Ethnic
cleansing'' begets ``ethnic cleansing.'' &QL;

   Does President Milosevic accept that the majority of them will

<P>
   That would be practically indistinguishable from partitioning,
and sow the seeds of future discord.

   The main drawback of the peace deal is that Slobodan Milosevic,
the malign survivor of the mayhem he launched on the Balkans,
remains entirely in Belgrade.

   The comparison with Hitler was never an accurate parallel.
Milosevic is a territorial expansionist, but he lacks Hitler's

   Had NATO fought a ground war the outcome might have been

   The distrust of small nations remains, and with it exaggerated

</P>
<P>
   The West will have to undertake a massive reconstruction program

</P>
<P>
   Having impoverished his people, turned the economy into a war
machine and sought to destroy the Kosovan independence movement by
brittle means, Milosevic gets to stay in charge and his enemies pay
to rebuild his country. Not a bad result as far as he's concerned.
</P>
<P>
   And what of us? Neither America nor Europe has very much to be

   NATO bombed its way to a deal, but at some cost to its own
probity and reputation, and with the worrying by-product of
worsening relations with the vast and sensitive power of China.
</P>
<P>
   I support the aims of the bombardment and accept that bombing is
the best way to degrade an enemy's capability in advance of a
ground war. But directing force against Serbia solely from the air
rather than being prepared to fight for Kosovo on the ground was a
major weakness.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot simply affect a Nelsonian blind eye and trust that the
random destruction and civilian casualties caused by dropping bombs
from 15,000 feet do not matter. They do.

   The lesson of Kosovo is surely that the less ready the West is
to deploy ground forces to secure its objectives in a conflict, the
more suffering is caused to the innocent on the way to peace.

   Now we have the chance to build a secure future for a region
whose needs have too long been ignored by the safe and prosperous

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ European leaders have one reason to be profoundly
grateful to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing that he accepts the terms of a peace deal on the
first day of the Cologne summit, he provided a distraction at an
event that would otherwise have been remembered as marking a nadir
of the EU's standing.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's ruble-like slide against the dollar not only reflects
the under-performance of the main economies inside the
single-currency zone.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a fitting symbol of institutional Europe's tendency
to talk a good currency/ a good war/ good reforms/ good cooperation
while proving unable to persuade the markets that the euro is
sound, or to prevent a barbarous conflict _ let alone the smaller
tasks of reforming its finances and preventing one of its members
from exporting contaminated food.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is fitting that the end to Kosovo's nightmare should be
heralded at an EU summit. It reminds us that this was a European
problem, albeit one that Europe proved unable to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most depressing spectacles of the last 10 weeks has
been that of European leaders, so solid in their support for
military action before the going got tough, so adept later at
ruling themselves out of ground troops and criticizing NATO for its
choice of targets.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to abrogating responsibility for what happens on
its own doorstep, Europe is the unrivalled world leader.
</P>
<P>
   European forces combined with American air support could have
liberated Kosovo. But there was never any chance that they would do
so.
</P>
<P>
   While the villages burned and the refugees were herded across
borders like cattle, the EU was busy, according to its chirpy
pre-summit press release, ``ensuring that the Western European
Union is ready to join the European Union's second pillar by the
end of 2000.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Like many doctors, Dr. Byron Thomashow, a pulmonary specialist,
is fed up with managed care. He's tired of justifying the need for
clinical procedures to ill-informed HMO personnel. He's weary of
fighting endless battles in order to treat his patients. And he's
frustrated by loss of the autonomy he once enjoyed to make his own
medical decisions.
 &HT;    But unlike many of his colleagues, he's fighting back. In fact,
he's given up on managed care altogether, electing to withdraw from
the web of HMOs and health insurers that have come to dominate our
healthcare system.
 &HT;    ``I just couldn't stand it,'' he explains. ``The thought of
being put on hold by people who don't know a quarter of what you
are doing to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom''
was simply too much to take.
 &HT;    Dr. Barney Softness, a New York pediatrician, is another rebel.
When his HMO suggested that he fire his registered nurses to reduce
costs, he did something few doctors have dared to do: he fired his
HMO instead. He says he just wants ``to give the kind of care that
I think people deserve.''
 &HT;    The two mutinous physicians are not alone. Across America, state
insurance commissioners are reporting a veritable revolt by doctors
against their HMOs, and medical society officials say that more and
more practitioners are severing their ties with managed care
altogether. A recent headline in The New York Times heralded this
trend, citing a growing rebellion by doctors like Thomashow and
Softness.
 &HT;    Of course, much of the dispute revolves around the reduced fees
that insurers are paying physicians for their services.
Nonetheless, despite a glut of physicians in many specialties,
doctors' incomes have continued to rise, unencumbered by the laws
of supply and demand. For this reason, some critics have described
the controversy as much ado about money. But it is also about
something much more fundamental -- the sudden encroachment of
``outsiders'' into the practice of medicine.
 &HT;    For the first time in history, insurers are telling physicians
how to practice their profession, and the medical community is up
in arms. As an early participant in managed care, I am no stranger
to this phenomenon, and I've seen what it is like to lose your
autonomy as a doctor. It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    As a salaried physician at an HMO, I experienced firsthand the
sense of helplessness and outrage that can result when a third
party comes between you and your patients, preventing you from
caring for them the way you were trained. Indeed, after years of
advanced training and education, I felt something I'd never felt
before in my life as a doctor: the inability to have my medical
decisions carried out.
 &HT;    As any doctor can tell you, this is a dreadful feeling. It goes
to the very heart of medical practice. Moreover, it challenges some
of the basic assumptions about what it means to be a physician.
From the outset of their training, doctors are taught that they
alone bear ultimate responsibility for the fate of their patients,
and therefore they alone must have the final say -- in conjunction
with their patients -- regarding clinical decisions. They may
consult with other health professionals before reaching a
conclusion, but in the end, they must make the final call.
 &HT;    This may seem a bit autocratic to some, but because lives are at
stake, it's a necessarily authoritarian regime. When dealing with
life-and-death decisions, you can't have a committee bickering over
strategy.
 &HT;    On the other hand, medicine cannot afford to operate in a
vacuum. When dealing with one-seventh of the U.S. economy, you just
can't leave the decision to physicians alone. This is how we
arrived at the current economic crisis in the first place. The
medical community, unconstrained by managed care, continued to
inflate medical spending until it consumed a whopping 14 percent of
the nation's economic output.
 &HT;    This voracious appetite for dollars obviously couldn't be
sustained, and the need to control runaway costs eventually set the
stage for managed care. The result was the current revolution in
health care, in which the laws of economics finally held sway over
the canons of medicine. Economic pressures steadily chipped away at
the hegemony of the medical profession, and managed care ultimately
did what no other force had ever done: it turned doctors into
``employees'' on a massive scale.
 &HT;    Now, the revolution has led to another first: physicians are
clamoring to join unions as never before. Courted by everyone from
the American Federation of Teachers to the International
Association of Machinists, doctors are beginning to unionize across
the country. And they are being welcomed with open arms.
 &HT;    The Service Employees International Union, the nation's
fastest-growing labor coalition, pledged in March to spend $1
million this year to organize the nation's 600,000 doctors. Even
the United Food and Commercial Workers union has gotten into the
act, seeking to expand its base by enrolling doctors disaffected
with managed care. This could lead to some intriguing alliances, in
which doctors could find themselves walking the picket lines
alongside supermarket workers.
 &HT;    Though there is already some precedent for the concept of a
physicians' guild, unionization still raises some troubling ethical
questions for the healing profession. Perhaps the most important
issue involves organized labor's right to strike. Could doctors
actually go on strike, denying care to their patients? If so, who
would treat their patients while they walked the picket line? And
how would they reconcile withholding care with the obligations of
the Hippocratic oath?
 &HT;    These are difficult questions, but they'll have to be addressed
as we move into the next phase of the managed care revolution. In
the meantime, one thing is certain: the revolution will continue.
As insurers press on with their onslaught, doctors will persist in
the struggle, fighting a rear-guard action in the hope of regaining
some control over their fate in the new healthcare economy.

stage for managed care. The result was the current revolution in
health care, in which the laws of economics finally held sway over
the canons of medicine. Economic pressures steadily chipped away at
the hegemony of the medical profession, and managed care ultimately
did what no other force had ever done: it turned doctors into
``employees'' on a massive scale.
 &HT;    Now, the revolution has led to another first: physicians are
clamoring to join unions as never before. Courted by everyone from
the American Federation of Teachers to the International
Association of Machinists, doctors are beginning to unionize across
the country. And they are being welcomed with open arms.
 &HT;    The Service Employees International Union, the nation's
fastest-growing labor coalition, pledged in March to spend $1
million this year to organize the nation's 600,000 doctors. Even
the United Food and Commercial Workers union has gotten into the
act, seeking to expand its base by enrolling doctors disaffected
with managed care. This could lead to some intriguing alliances, in
which doctors could find themselves walking the picket lines
alongside supermarket workers.
 &HT;    Though there is already some precedent for the concept of a
physicians' guild, unionization still raises some troubling ethical
questions for the healing profession. Perhaps the most important
issue involves organized labor's right to strike. Could doctors
actually go on strike, denying care to their patients? If so, who
would treat their patients while they walked the picket line? And
how would they reconcile withholding care with the obligations of
the Hippocratic oath?
 &HT;    These are difficult questions, but they'll have to be addressed
as we move into the next phase of the managed care revolution. In
the meantime, one thing is certain: the revolution will continue.
As insurers press on with their onslaught, doctors will persist in
the struggle, fighting a rear-guard action in the hope of regaining
some control over their fate in the new healthcare economy.

OPPOSITE OF GLOOM: TIME TO BE GAILY GAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If asked to describe the mood of the 11th Annual New
York Lesbian and Gay Film Festival based only on its opening and
closing features, this year's events might be characterized as
Giddy Gay Lite.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rose Troche's ``Bedrooms and Hallways,'' which opened the
festival Thursday night, and Jim Fall's ``Trick,'' which closes the
series on June 13, partake of the same heady spirit that has
characterized recent semimainstream films like ``The Opposite of
Sex'' and ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss.'' In the world of Giddy
Gay Lite, gay liberation is almost a fait accompli, the AIDS
epidemic barely exists and rampant homophobia is somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Troche's film is a frothy post-Noel Coward romantic comedy,
a millennial, pansexual ``Design for Living'' set in contemporary
London. A single gay man in an otherwise heterosexual New Age men's
group confesses his attraction to another member who has recently
separated from his girlfriend of eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The two embark on an affair, and the gay man ends up sleeping
with the ex-girlfriend. Is anybody jealous or upset? Not really. No
dangerous emotions are allowed to undermine the cheery,
sophisticated banter.
</P>
<P>
   Fall's film, which will open commercially in the summer, is a
comic ``After Hours'' flavored survey of gay male life in
Manhattan. An aspiring musical-comedy composer with a straight male
roommate picks up a buffed-up go-go boy on the subway and brings
him home, but one interruption after another keeps preventing them
from having sex. They then roam the city in search of a rendezvous.
Tori Spelling gives a teeth-gnashing performance as a best friend
from hell.
</P>
<P>
   But between these bookends the festival has its share of serious
and cerebral work. One of the most original features, Scott King's
``Treasure Island,'' is a mock 1940s spy drama in which two
American code breakers construct a false identity and devise
military misinformation to be planted on a dead soldier's body. The
stylish black-and-white film turns into an eerie ghost story
exploring oppressive racial and sexual stereotypes in wartime
America with deadpan humor.
</P>
<P>
   In a totally different vein is Joseph Lovett's personal
documentary ``The Accident,'' in which the filmmaker re-enacts the
freak accident that killed his mother and interviews his siblings
to try to construct a psychological history of his troubled family.
Lovett's own homosexuality is only one of the many threads woven
together to create a subtle, ultimately enigmatic family portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian director Anne Wheeler's serious comedy ``Better Than
Chocolate'' is a cheery broadside for sexual diversity that follows
the evolving relationships of several couples including a feminist
lesbian and a woman who was once a man. Late in the film this
utopian fantasy takes a sudden, dark turn.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Winer's upbeat documentary ``Golden Threads'' profiles
Christine Burton, a 93-year-old woman who at the age of 80 founded
an international network for lesbians over 50.
</P>
<P>
   And from Germany, Kutlug Ataman's melodrama ``Lola and
Bildikid'' focuses on the identity crisis of a young gay Turk in
Germany and his violent, aggressively straight older brother. While
exploring Berlin's demimonde, the boy is befriended by Lola, a drag
queen whose macho lover wants her to have a sex-change operation.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the stronger features _ Lin Cheng-Sheng's ``Murmur of
Youth,'' from Japan, and Sebastien Lifshitz's ``Open Bodies'' and
Francois Ozon's ``Sitcom,'' both from France _ have previously been
shown in the New Directors/New Films Series. ``Murmur of Youth''
explores the painful romantic attachment of two teen-age girls.
``Open Bodies'' follows the gay and straight adventures of a
sexually curious French high school boy with a possessive older
male lover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitcom,'' which will open at the Quad Cinemas on June 18,
satirizes Gallic family values and the limitations of psychotherapy
in an erotic free-for-all whose many frantic couplings include
mother-son incest.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is also reviving two influential underground films,
James Bidgood's ``Pink Narcissus,'' a 1970 fantasia of gaudily
costumed gay male erotica, and Gregory Markopoulos' ``Twice a
Man,'' a 1963 retelling of the Greek drama of Phaedra and
Hippolytus set in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 200 films being shown in the festival include a
tribute to British independent filmmaker Pratibha Parmar, whose
newest work, ``Righteous Babes,'' is a documentary exploring the
convergence of feminism and rock in the music of women like Sinead
O'Connor, Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco.

SNAIL DARTER REDUX? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ To sacrifice the Monarch butterfly or to save it, that
is the question these days in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   This exaggerated dilemma reflects the latest pseudo-scientific
scare over the potential consequences of growing and eating
genetically altered food _ a rapidly spreading phenomenon driven by
new technological advances and the needs of commercial agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles and a band of other nervous nellies are demanding
a moratorium on such crops under the banner of protecting
butterflies and maybe humans too. Their concern for the environment
and our health is indeed a noble cause, but they are operating on
emotion rather than any reliable evidence of pending doom.
</P>
<P>
   The British have a history of this sort of thing where little
creatures are concerned. Not long ago conservationists demanded,
and got, an expensive tunnel dug under a major highway to save
small toads from being regularly squashed by cars.
</P>
<P>
   A similar crusade to protect the fox against all those cruel
hunters fond of riding to the hounds, however, failed. The fox
didn't have enough friends in high places. Prince Charles and his
aristocratic buddies were on those horses.
</P>
<P>
   The genetically modified (GM) food issue is a much more
hysterical topic in Great Britain than it is in America, where we
tend to trust the experts who assure us that plant biotechnology is
not only helpful but here to stay. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture is studying whether such crops should be labeled to
alert consumers concerned about food origins, but it is doing
nothing so radical as discouraging further research.
</P>
<P>
   If consumer panic spreads through Europe, however, it could have
devastating international consequences not only for commercial
agriculture but the fight against hunger in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Both American and British scientists insist that GM soybeans,
tomatoes, corn and other foodstuffs are perfectly safe to eat. Yet
unreliable early studies have linked ``Frankenstein foods'' to
possible disease. One discredited alarmist report in England about
the danger of GM tomatoes so drove down sales of a perfectly good
GM tomato paste that the product has been taken off the market.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact, however, comes from a recent Cornell
University laboratory study that indicates Monarch caterpillars
confronted with the wind-borne pollen of GM corn either died or
produced smaller butterflies than usual. This was a bombshell in
Great Britain, where the British Butterfly Conservation Society is
a political force and tourist icons such as the restored Sudley
Castle eagerly plant wildflower fields to win the honor of being
designated a ``butterfly base''.
</P>
<P>
   The public fuss was fueled by Prince Charles' Internet website,
in which he crusades against GM foods and warns that ``mixing
genetic material from species that cannot breed naturally takes us
into areas that should be left to God.'' Perhaps waiting too long
to become king has impaired his ability to envision the scientific
future.
</P>
<P>
   The actual impact of GM corn on the survival of the Monarch
butterfly species is not clear. No one yet knows how many are being
killed or how to compare that with the damage to all insects from
the spraying of insecticides, which is unnecessary with some GM
crops.
</P>
<P>
   In America, we admire pretty butterflies and like to have them
around. But they are not yet our next snail darter, that miniature
fish whose rare habitat held up the construction of Tennessee's
massive Tellico Dam in the late 1970s and became a major
environmental issue.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court declared the darter was protected under
the Endangered Species Act; eventually a furious Congress invented
a legislative loophole that let the dam proceed anyway. Ironically,
biologists later discovered that the snail darter was alive and
well in other waters all along. The controversy had been for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the butterfly bit will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits to mankind of GM foods seem obvious, producing
larger and more disease-resistant crops, reducing the amount of
chemicals currently used in intensive farming and expanding the
variety and location of plants. As the global population expands,
so must its reliable food supply.
</P>
<P>
   We do not have evidence that there will be a disastrous downside
from this. But as Ronald Reagan said in another context, it is wise
to trust but verify. We should continue to explore and develop the
technology, but carefully monitor and research it every step of the
way. It's a brave new world.

CALIFORNIA MOVES TO REGULATE AMUSEMENT PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Amusement parks in California would be
subject to government inspection and tougher fines under a measure
overwhelmingly approved by the state Assembly, two years to the day
after a student plunged to her death on a water slide.
</P>
<P>
   California, with its many amusement parks, has one of the worst
safety records in the nation. Fourteen people have died since 1973
at amusement parks here, compared with one person in Florida during
the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state regulates ski lifts, traveling carnivals and
elevators, California is one of only four states that does not
regulate permanent amusement parks. Led by Disneyland, California
theme parks have spent 30 years fighting repeated attempts at state
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long overdue improvement,'' said Assemblyman Tom
Torlakson, a Democrat from Martinez and the author of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved 58 to 13 on Wednesday, would require that
parks provide safety training for employees, increase their
insurance and report major accidents. The state would, for the
first time, hire trained amusement park inspectors and could fine
parks up to $70,000 for negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was prompted by the June 2, 1997, death of Quimby
Ghilotti, 18, an honor student at Napa High School. She died at
WaterWorld USA in Concord when several dozen students tried to ride
the Banzai Pipeline water slide all at once. The ride collapsed,
and Ghilotti and the others plunged 37 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do wonder, if this bill had been in effect two years ago
today, if my daughter wouldn't be in college now,'' said Ghilotti's
mother, Victoria Nelson, who watched the Assembly vote. ``It's very
hard for me to understand why it hasn't always been this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghilotti's death was followed last Christmas Eve by the death of
a tourist who was hit in the face by a metal cleat on the deck at
Disneyland's Columbia Sailing Ship. Another Disneyland patron, 5-
year-old David Fackler of La Jolla, in San Diego County, lost half
of his foot after dangling it outside the park's Big Thunder
Mountain Railroad ride.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland, the state's most popular park, has kept a low
profile on Torlakson's measure. Park representatives have preferred
instead to work behind the scenes with Torlakson and other powerful
Democrats and have not officially opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The amusement parks did secure an amendment to the bill
requiring that patrons comply with all warnings and instructions of
the park. Torlakson said he wants the parks to install better signs
and safer entrance areas.
</P>
<P>
   Riders would be forbidden from attempting to disable a seat belt
or overhead bar, sticking their feet out of a ride, throwing
objects from a ride, or attempting to leave before a ride stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it actually does is make theme-park patrons responsible
for their own behavior,'' said Ray Gomez, a spokesman for
Disneyland in Anaheim. ``If they break the rules, they are assuming
the risk of breaking the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the parks say riders are responsible for the
vast majority of accidents, many of them alcohol-related. To
appease trial lawyers and children's rights advocates, however,
Torlakson did not relieve the parks from legal liability, even if
someone violates the rules.

   KOSOVO-PROBLEMS (Washington) _ While the agreement reportedly
reached with Slobodan Milosevic raised hopes that an end to the
bombardment might be near, it also made clear the enormity of the
tasks and questions that lay ahead. Looming largest were the
refugees - a million people without homes or crops, facing a

   KOSOVO-REFUGEE-REAX (Stenkovec I Camp, Macedonia) _ When the

announcement of a potential peace agreement for Kosovo, Ahmet
Sharifi burst out laughing: ``Milosevic is lying again.'' The
reaction was the same on the sidelines of the men's round robin
volleyball game and in the long line of women filling their plastic

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first clue was an obscure reference in a
corporate financial statement to a sizable tax benefit, a possible
tipoff to a new form of tax shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that tidbit came to the attention of Treasury
Department officials early last year, Jonathan Talisman, a deputy
assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, got a phone call from
a tax professional describing a new and increasingly popular tax
avoidance strategy that matched what was hinted at in the corporate
document.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at Treasury and the IRS spent the next few months
figuring out the new shelter _ a complicated set of transactions
known as a ``liquidating REIT'' _ and determined that it was
becoming so popular among corporations that it would cost the
government billions of dollars in foregone revenues.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the year, Treasury officials had convinced
Congress that the transactions abused the tax code and should be
shut down. A provision to do that was included in the tax bill
signed into law by President Clinton in October.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the episode was a case study in how the federal
government can root out attempts to game the tax system. But in its
dependence on a few lucky breaks, it also showed the haphazard
nature of efforts to control the proliferation of sophisticated
corporate tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about keeping ahead of the blizzard of tax-avoidance
strategies being developed and marketed by accountants and lawyers
to corporate clients, the Clinton administration has asked Congress
for broad new powers to discourage use of tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, the administration's proposals would fundamentally
change the government's strategy for dealing with corporate tax
shelters. Instead of trying to find, understand and stop the
transactions after they have occurred, either through informal
intelligence gathering or audits or corporate returns, the
administration wants to make using a questionable shelter
sufficiently risky and costly that companies will choose not to use
them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposals are designed to impose a regime that will cause
corporations not to engage in shelter transactions,'' Talisman
said, ``rather than having us chase them after the fact.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Congress has acted a number of times in recent years to
curb specific types of tax shelters, and has some sympathy for the
goals behind the administration's current proposals, the Republican
majority has shown no indication that it will move to pass sweeping
legislation to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in pursuing its tax-shelter plan, the administration has
set off a sharp debate in Congress and among accountants and tax
lawyers over how big a problem there is and the degree to which
giving the IRS more power is the solution.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's approach, said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, ``may be overly broad and
may possibly subject legitimate business transactions to tax
shelter penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weinberger, a principal in the lobbying firm of Washington
Counsel who is representing a number of large corporations, called
the administration's proposals ``unnecessary and certainly
premature, exceedingly vague and far reaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the House Ways and Means Committee, which last
year voted to rein in the powers of the IRS, Weinberger said the
administration's proposals ``appear to create an unprecedented
transfer of power to the executive branch and specifically IRS
revenue agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers have been looking for shelters for as long as there
have been taxes, and shelters have been used aggressively by
wealthy individuals as well as corporations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue here are not the tax breaks written into the law
deliberately by legislators to help constituents, interest groups
and campaign contributors, but those that arise from unforeseen
inconsistencies and unintended wrinkles in a tax code that takes on
new layers of complexity each year.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials say shelter abuse has become an increasing
problem as the tax code has grown more complex and as accounting
and law firms have become more aggressive in marketing
tax-minimizing strategies to their corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate tax executives routinely receive proposals from
accountants and lawyers on how they can shave their tax bills by
engaging in transactions that have no business purpose other than
to create tax breaks. Some law firms do a brisk business providing
legal opinions on the deals. Accounting firms sometimes take a cut
of the tax savings from the deals as their fee. The very names
attached to the transactions _ like stepped down preferred, or
lease-in lease-out _ hint at the complexity of the financial and
legal engineering behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Almost by definition, there are no reliable figures on the use
of these kinds of tax shelters. Developed in secrecy, and usually
buried cryptically deep in corporate tax filings and financial
statements, they often go undetected. Corporations and their tax
advisers certainly have no motivation to disclose them.
Administration officials cite estimates of revenue losses of more
than $10 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tax lobbyists on the other side of the issue scoff at those
numbers, and point out that corporate tax revenues continue to grow
robustly, contributing to a big federal budget surplus. And they
say the Treasury Department and the IRS do not even use all the
powers currently available to them to fight tax avoidance,
including a 1997 law that expands requirements for companies to
register their use of shelters with the government.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to win over skeptics in Congress, the Treasury
Department plans to issue a refined proposal in the next month or
so, taking into account criticism that its approach is so
ill-defined that it would sweep many perfectly legitimate business
transactions into its net.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is not expected to alter the basic thrust
of its approach, which it laid out earlier this year. Its plan
would allow the IRS to deny tax benefits generated by transactions
that it judges to be driven primarily by tax-avoidance
considerations. It would double, to 40 percent, the penalty imposed
on corporations found to have understated their tax bill by using
an improper tax shelter, and make it harder for companies to claim
they thought the shelter was allowable.
</P>
<P>
   It would deny deductions for the cost of tax advice that led to
use of a tax shelter. It would impose excise taxes on any fees
earned by accountants and lawyers in developing shelters for
corporate clients, and on the purchaser of a corporate tax shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, it would give the government
considerable leeway in determining what separates a creative but
permissible tax strategy from one that steps over the line _ a
divide that current tax law leaves maddeningly vague.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Treasury Department has lost all the battles. The
government has had some success cracking down on the use of
shelters in the last few years. In March, the Supreme Court let
stand a lower court decision invalidating a maneuver used by
Colgate-Palmolive Co. that would have created tax benefits for the
company through a deal with a Dutch bank in Bermuda. The lower
court had found the technique to be built on ``sham transactions''
with no purpose other than generating tax savings. The shelter had
been devised for Colgate and other clients by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   It has also caught wind of other types of deals relatively
early, including the liquidating REIT transactions shut down by
Congress last year. (In those deals banks and other companies
transferred mortgages into real estate investment trusts, which
were then liquidated in a way that created a tax break.) The
Treasury Department has also moved aggressively to limit use of
certain types of leasing deals that generate tax breaks by
transferring assets back and forth between American and foreign
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's concern is shared by some tax lawyers,
accountants and corporate executives who feel pressured by the
competition to stretch the law in their efforts to keep tax bills
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constant promotion of these frequently artificial
transactions breeds significant disrespect for the tax system,
encouraging responsible corporate taxpayers to expect this type of
activity to be the norm and to follow the lead of other taxpayers
who have engaged in tax-advantaged transactions,'' Harold Handler,
a lawyer at Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett who is chairman of the New
York State Bar Association's tax section, told the Senate Finance
Committee recently.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is to succeed in turning its proposals into law, the
administration will not only have to overcome the skepticism among
Republicans about handing more power to the IRS, but the concerted
opposition of some of the most influential lobbyists in Washington.
Among them is Kenneth Kies, a managing partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   A former staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation,
which provides technical advice to Congress on tax issues, Kies
knows as much about the tax code as anyone in Washington. While
more closely aligned with the Republican majority, he is
sufficiently respected by Democrats to have acted as a go-between
in back-channel discussions earlier this year between Congress and
the White House over Social Security. And he is no shrinking
violet.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's tax shelter proposals, he said, are the
result of a ``good faith but misguided belief'' among senior
Treasury officials like Donald Lubick, the assistant Treasury
secretary for tax policy, and his deputy, Talisman, ``that the
system is in danger of collapsing in a heap.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing full well that Congress remains deeply suspicious of the
IRS, Kies said that the tax shelter problem is not big enough to
justify handing the tax service a whole new set of weapons,
especially since the service does not use all the powers it already
has to limit use of tax dodges.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the margin, there will always be people who are more
aggressive with the tax code than they should be,'' Kies said.
``The question is, what is the appropriate action to take relative
to that problem? Treasury has to meet a high burden to justify a
dramatic expansion of authority, and I don't think they're meeting
that burden.''

HERE THEY ARE, THE TOP TEN OF TERROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next Tuesday, Thomas Harris will unleash Hannibal Lecter on the
world for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hannibal,'' published by Dell, is the eagerly anticipated
sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' the bestseller that sent
chills through a nation of readers. Known for coolly devouring his
victims while enjoying a glass of fine wine, Hannibal the Cannibal
clearly ranks among the most evil characters in all of literature _
but he has plenty of company. Here is a list of the 10 scariest
literary monsters of all time. It is not for the squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Dracula, in ``Dracula'' by Bram Stoker. Dracula is the king,
the epitome of the marrow-chilling villain. He wants your blood,
your body, your soul. Jonathan Harker found out the hard way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised the (coffin) lid ... and then I saw something which
filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count, but looking
as if his youth had been half-renewed, for the white hair and
moustache were changed to dark iron-gray; the cheeks were fuller,
and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder
than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which
trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and
neck ... it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply
gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his
repletion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where,
perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming
millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and
ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Richard III, in ``Henry VI Part III'' and ``Richard III'' by
William Shakespeare. In both plays, Richard wanders the stage
proclaiming his basic rottenness and his scheme to kill anyone
standing between him and the English throne. Late in ``Henry VI''
(Part III, Act III, Scene II, to be exact) he makes his most
frightening admission:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, I can smile, and murder while I smile ... and wet my
cheeks with artificial tears/and frame my face to all
occasions./I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall. ... Can
I do this, and cannot get a crown?''
</P>
<P>
   3. Blue Duck in ``Lonesome Dove'' by Larry McMurtry. This amoral
Comanchero kidnaps Lorena, Gus' prostitute friend, and takes her
off into the wilderness for the sexual pleasure of his bloodthirsty
band of followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Duck hobbled the horses, then came and looked down at
her.
</P>
<P>
   ```I got a treatment for women that try to run away,' he said
casually. `I cut a little hole in their stomachs and pull out a gut
and wrap it around a limb. Then I drag them 30 or 40 feet and tie
them down. That way they can watch the coyotes come and eat their
guts.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lorena doesnt try to run away. Soon afterward, she notices that
Blue Duck wears a necklace made of severed human fingers.
</P>
<P>
   4. Hannibal Lecter in ``Red Dragon'' and ``The Silence of the
Lambs'' by Thomas Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The frighteningly graphic descriptions of Lecter's attacks
almost pale in comparison with his shockingly casual comments. In
``The Silence of the Lambs,'' Hannibal explains to FBI agent
Clarice Starling why he served dinner guests grilled body parts of
someone he'd recently murdered:
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you ever had people coming over and no time to shop?
You have to make do with what's in the fridge, Clarice.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Napoleon the Pig in ``Animal Farm'' by George Orwell. Besides
its justified acclaim as political commentary, ``Animal Farm'' is a
masterpiece of caricature. It is Napoleon the Pig who emerges as a
despicable dictator every bit as bad as the deposed Farmer Jones.
We hear about Napoleon much more often than we meet him directly.
He is described early on as ``a large, rather fierce-looking
Berkshire boar ... with a reputation for getting his own way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book's final, horrifying chapter, Napoleon appears
equipped with the same implement that symbolized human cruelty. In
perhaps the most frightening, simply presented one-sentence
paragraph in modern literature, Orwell writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``He carried a whip in his trotter.''
</P>
<P>
   6. In ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' Charles Dickens presents us with
Madame Defarge, wife of a wine-shop owner and the bloody-minded
leader of the downtrodden Parisian masses. It would be easy to
sympathize with Madame D.'s cause, except for her delight in death
and her insatiable appetite for more victims. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the
sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing
to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an
orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her
natural enemies and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her
was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   7. Eva Galli in ``Ghost Story'' by Peter Straub. The book
features a murderous shape-shifter who is the ghost of Eva Galli, a
young woman who died under shady circumstances involving a group of
young men who, as they aged, became respected members of their New
England community. Perhaps no passage is more chilling than the
moment a young writer discovers his new lover isn't quite, well,
``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been dozing more than sleeping for most of the night,
and I reached over lightly to touch Alma's bare rounded arm; I did
not want to wake her. But it was as if her arm gave my fingers a
shock: Not an electrical shock, but a shock of concentrated
feeling, a shock of revulsion _ as though I had touched a slug. I
snatched back my hand.... Sometime later I dreamed of her. I merely
saw her face; but it was not the face I knew, and the strangeness
of it made me moan with anxiety; and for the second time I came
wholly awake, not sure where I was or by whose side I lay.''
</P>
<P>
   8. The White Witch in ``The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''
by C.S. Lewis. Now here is a glorious villain of childhood
bookshelves, ready to slaughter children or lions at whim. Hannibal
Lecter is, in a sense, her direct literary descendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last she drew near. She stood by Aslan's head. Her face was
working and twitching with passion. ... Then, just before she gave
the (knife) blow, she stooped down and said in a quivering voice,
`And now, who has won? Fool, did you think that by all this you
would save the human traitor? ... But when you are dead what will
prevent me from killing him as well? And who will take him out of
my hand then? Understand that you have given me Narnia forever, you
have lost your own life and you have not saved his. In that
knowledge, despair and die.'''
</P>
<P>
   9. Nurse Ratched (Big Nurse) in Ken Kesey's ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most horrifying characters in fiction kill with
regulations, not knives or teeth or claws. Enter, Nurse Ratched:
</P>
<P>
   ``What she dreams of ... is a world of precision, efficiency and
tidiness like a pocket watch with a glass back, a place where the
schedule is unbreakable and all the patients who aren't Outside,
obedient under her beam, are wheelchair Chronics with catheter
tubes run direct from every pantleg to the sewer under the floor
... she fixes these doctors (who disagree with her way of running
things) with dry-ice eyes day in, day out, until they retreat with
unnatural chills. `I tell you I don't know what it is,' they tell
the guy in charge of personnel. `Since I started on the ward with
that woman I feel like my veins are running ammonia. I shiver all
the time....'''
</P>
<P>
   10. The great white shark in ``Jaws'' by Peter Benchley.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after the fact, too many people remember the
movie but have forgotten the book. Benchley's informed descriptions
of shark teeth, gills and digestive systems made his fictional
killer a literary nightmare with fins, especially when, in the
first few pages, the shark claims its initial victim.
</P>
<P>
   The shark ``smelled her now, and the vibrations _ erratic and
sharp _ signalled distress ... its dorsal fin broke water and its
tail, thrashing back and forth, cut the glassy surface with a hiss.
A series of tremors shook its body. The fish was about 40 feet from
the woman, off to the side, when it turned suddenly to the left,
dropped entirely below the surface, and, with two quick thrusts of
its tail, was upon her.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the woman thought she had snagged her leg on a rock
or a piece of floating wood. There was no initial pain, only one
violent tug on her right leg. She reached down to touch her foot,
treading water with her left leg to keep her head up, feeling in
the blackness with her left hand. She could not find her foot ...''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TRAITS OF GREAT LITERARY VILLAINS
</P>
<P>
   The best fictional monsters are amoral, with no thought of right
or wrong. They do awful things because it is their nature _ and
they enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   They don't appear in the story too often. Psychologically, we
fear most what we don't quite see completely. Our imaginations fill
in some of the frightening details. What the monsters might do next
frightens us even more than whatever it is they've just done.
Hannibal, Dracula, the great white shark in ``Jaws'' _ they creep
around a lot but are out of the action more than they are in it.
Harris' challenge in the upcoming ``Hannibal'' is that Lecter
finally becomes the main character.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to live to fight/bite another day. So far,
Hannibal Lecter has. Nurse Ratched did. Dracula didn't; neither did
Shakespeare's Richard III or Larry McMurtry's Blue Duck. But when
the best literary monsters die, they do it in character _
unrepentant and murderous to the last.

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: NEGATIVE SIGNS BUILDING FOR MICROSOFT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In resuming this week after a three-month break,
the focus of the Microsoft antitrust trial has subtly shifted from
the question whether Microsoft broke the law to what limits should
be placed on the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   In their private comments outside the courtroom, government
lawyers brim with confidence that they have already won the case,
voicing contempt for the defense. While Microsoft lawyers aren't
conceding defeat, the company in recent months has positioned
itself to live with an adverse verdict.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling is still months away, and it almost certainly will be
appealed. But in his comments from the bench, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the case without a
jury, has repeatedly signaled that he accepts the government's
designation of Microsoft as a powerful monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, Jackson has sought updated figures on the
browser wars, which are at the heart of the current defense
strategy. Microsoft contends that the $10 billion purchase of
browser maker Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online Inc.,
the nation's largest Internet provider, has breathed fresh life
into industry competition, at Microsoft's expense.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has branded internal pre-merger documents gleaned by
the defense that purportedly show a fresh cabal being brewed
against Microsoft ``either ambiguous or cryptic.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that Jackson is ready to impose heavy
sanctions against the company or to insist that its Windows
operating system be spun off as a separate business.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft looks like a loser in the courtroom, its prospects
in the business world appear to be largely unaffected. Signals
coming from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates suggest that the future
remains bright no matter what happens here.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in recent months Microsoft has cut a $5 billion deal with
AT&AMP;T to get a major foothold in the cable modem business. It is
also planning to roll out a new version of its Web TV venture that
will upgrade the set-top boxes into powerful home automation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers argue in court that the company faces stiff
competition from new technology devices, Gates contends in a
current Newsweek article that personal computers, which depend
almost exclusively on his company's Windows operating system, will
remain the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Microsoft faces stiff competition from a new
generation of technology devices is intended to persuade the judge
that the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust despite
complaints about Microsoft's purported illegal conduct toward its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Franklin Fisher
spent the week seeking to demolish that argument.
</P>
<P>
   In three full days on the witness stand, Fisher, the chief
economic witness for the government, made three key points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Within the foreseeable future, computer hardware makers do not
believe they have any viable commercial alternatives to loading
Windows on the machines they are shipping to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since any substantial increase in the price of Windows will
not prompt Microsoft's customers to switch to another operating
system, Microsoft is not constrained in any real way by the cost or
availability of other systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft's market share for personal computer operating
systems has been both very high and quite stable for several years.
There's every reason to believe that it will stay that way for some
time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers sought to stem the impact of Fisher's testimony
by suggesting in court that Microsoft, which enjoys a market
capitalization of some $650 billion, was on the ropes and likely to
falter under pressure from Linux, an upstart operating system, or
the rapid spread of ``smart'' pagers and other hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, to trying to make their case, they offered a
``confidential'' E-mail message between two top Microsoft
executives, Jim Allchin and David Cole that suggested ``Linux is
beating Windows'' in the retail market place. Although the judge
openly suggested the memo, dated May 25, was cooked up to make an
impact in court, he reluctantly allowed it to become a trial
exhibit.

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: NEGATIVE SIGNS BUILDING FOR MICROSOFT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In resuming this week after a three-month break,
the focus of the Microsoft antitrust trial has subtly shifted from
the question whether Microsoft broke the law to what limits should
be placed on the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   In their private comments outside the courtroom, government
lawyers brim with confidence that they have already won the case,
voicing contempt for the defense. While Microsoft lawyers aren't
conceding defeat, the company in recent months has positioned
itself to live with an adverse verdict.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling is still months away, and it almost certainly will be
appealed. But in his comments from the bench, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the case without a
jury, has repeatedly signaled that he accepts the government's
designation of Microsoft as a powerful monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, Jackson has sought updated figures on the
browser wars, which are at the heart of the current defense
strategy. Microsoft contends that the $10 billion purchase of
browser maker Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online Inc.,
the nation's largest Internet provider, has breathed fresh life
into industry competition, at Microsoft's expense.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has branded internal pre-merger documents gleaned by
the defense that purportedly show a fresh cabal being brewed
against Microsoft ``either ambiguous or cryptic.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that Jackson is ready to impose heavy
sanctions against the company or to insist that its Windows
operating system be spun off as a separate business.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft looks like a loser in the courtroom, its prospects
in the business world appear to be largely unaffected. Signals
coming from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates suggest that the future
remains bright no matter what happens here.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in recent months Microsoft has cut a $5 billion deal with
AT&AMP;T to get a major foothold in the cable modem business. It is
also planning to roll out a new version of its Web TV venture that
will upgrade the set-top boxes into powerful home automation
devices.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers argue in court that the company faces stiff
competition from new technology devices, Gates contends in a
current Newsweek article that personal computers, which depend
almost exclusively on his company's Windows operating system, will
remain the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Microsoft faces stiff competition from a new
generation of technology devices is intended to persuade the judge
that the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust despite
complaints about Microsoft's purported illegal conduct toward its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Franklin Fisher
spent the week seeking to demolish that argument.
</P>
<P>
   In three full days on the witness stand, Fisher, the chief
economic witness for the government, made three key points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Within the foreseeable future, computer hardware makers do not
believe they have any viable commercial alternatives to loading
Windows on the machines they are shipping to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since any substantial increase in the price of Windows will
not prompt Microsoft's customers to switch to another operating
system, Microsoft is not constrained in any real way by the cost or
availability of other systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft's market share for personal computer operating
systems has been both very high and quite stable for several years.
There's every reason to believe that it will stay that way for some
time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers sought to stem the impact of Fisher's testimony

capitalization of some $650 billion, was on the ropes and likely to

 &HT;    Gardeners embrace tropics to supply bold color, texture
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Graceful palm branches sway and giant elephant's-ears
bob in the breeze as orange canna lilies stretch their stalks
daringly toward an unforgiving sun. Broad-leafed banana trees
provide a shady respite from the sultry afternoon, allowing red
impatiens to form a small meadow as thick as carpet.
</P>
<P>
   An exotic resort in San Juan? Lush retreat in Palm Springs?
Romantic terrace in South Beach?
</P>
<P>
   Hold on to your papayas _ it's an intown back yard right here in
Hotlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make it look like a tropical oasis that could be
anywhere,'' Glenn Powell said of the garden he and Mark White
developed two years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   They're not alone. Gardeners throughout metro Atlanta are
discovering what's become a hot trend as far north as Canada:
Tropical plants give gardens the kind of splashy color, giant form
and bold texture that make them as inviting as a Caribbean travel
brochure.
</P>
<P>
   They just don't like being left out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   But even tropicals not hardy enough to withstand Atlanta winters
can be used as summer annuals _ planted in the spring and disposed
of in the fall. Or they can be moved inside and treated as
houseplants, which is how most tropicals traditionally are used.
</P>
<P>
   Because demand has grown so much in recent years, prices, which
are across the board, have come down. That makes the idea of
temporary plants affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers are cheaper right now than wholesalers, which are
selling out of them,'' said Dottie Myers, an Atlanta landscape
architect. ``Yet the average homeowner is still a little skeptical.
It's hard for them to think of throwing away a tropical as you
would impatiens at the end of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners successfully ``overwinter'' the plants by taking
them inside until the following spring. But area horticulturists
say those plants typically get off to a slow start the next year
when most gardeners are anxious to set out established plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes so much for them to come out of dormancy that by the
time they're able to produce flowers in large fashion, it's the end
of the season,'' said Tyne Worley, manager of Planters, a Atlanta
garden center.
</P>
<P>
   What's so hot about them?
</P>
<P>
   So how come such tough plants, with their gigantic leaves and
billowing blossoms, are such wimps when it comes to a little cold?
</P>
<P>
   Tropicals are trees, shrubs, vines, perennials and annuals that
flourish in the belt between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn,
which includes cool upland environments as well as hot, steamy
lowlands, according to Richard Iversen ``We've been growing them
for 500 years since Columbus' trip to the Caribbean,'' Iversen
said.
</P>
<P>
   During Victorian times, homeowners in Europe and America became
drawn to the exotic plants and brought palms, banana trees and
other tropicals indoors and used them as lawn accents. But not
until recent years have consumers accepted the notion that it's OK
to move their houseplants outdoors in summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so common in the interior plant industry. You see
them in airports, in restaurants,'' said Iversen, a professor who
oversees the Tropical Garden at the State University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interior environment, tropical plants are restrained
and stunted, like tigers caged in a zoo, and they aren't always
pretty. Free tropical plants from the constriction of the indoor
environment by planting them outdoors for the summer months, and
they are transformed like Cinderella,'' he writes. ``Common
houseplants become avant-garde garden plants, tall, strong and good
looking. Rains wash away last winter's dust, and light levels close
to those of their native tropic environment stimulate growth.
Plants grow fast, and in a single season these exotics are at their
peak of perfection, as if they were on some Caribbean island.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradise found
</P>
<P>
   Powell and White, who own Agnes &AMP; Muriel's restaurant, were
seeking a certain atmosphere when they designed their tropical
garden two years ago. Powell wanted something less fussy than a
perennial garden, and White, who once lived in Florida, knew
tropicals well.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my old house in Grant Park, I had the traditional English
cottage garden with all the roses I was diligent about caring
for,'' Powell said. ``When we moved here, I wanted something
totally different and relaxed. Here, it's like you're not even in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Their courtyard garden is an extension of the Spanish style
house they bought six years ago. Surrounding its Mexican-tiled
patio and pathway are windmill palms, banana trees, fatsia,
bromeliads, ferns and ``Bengal Tiger'' canna lilies, with their
variegated leaves and orange blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   One reason tropicals have become popular is their colors,
texture and forms are easy to combine for an attractive design.
Tropicals offer so many contrasts _ tall, broad ginger leaves
paired with low frilly ferns, hot pink mandevilla against light
salmon caladiums, spiky dracena rising from ruffled coleus _ the
design process becomes fun.
</P>
<P>
   Another selling point is their heat tolerance. In late summer
and early fall, when most annuals and perennials gasp their final
breaths, tropicals are in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   As the first frost approaches, some area gardeners dig up
non-hardy tropicals, including some varieties of bananas,
elephant's ears, alocasia and begonias, and store them in a
basement or garage to shield them from frigid temperatures. But
other plants, such as cannas and gingers, can be treated as
perennials, left in the ground and covered with mulch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make yourself ill worrying about them when cold comes,''
Myers said. ``Enjoy them while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   TIPS FOR TROPICALS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Go for contrasts in form and texture when combining them in
the garden. Pair the broad coarse leaves of bananas and elephant's
ears with the fine, soft foliage of coleus, for example.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mix tropicals with traditional garden plants. Loose foliage
plants such as daylilies and ornamental grasses make attractive
companions for big-leafed exotic plants.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tropicals like loamy soil rich in organic matter. Add compost
before planting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most houseplants are tropicals and can be planted in the
garden or outdoor containers in spring. First acclimate them to the
increased exposure by placing them on a porch or partial shade for
several days.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For planting ideas, see the new tropical border at the
entrance to the Atlanta Botanical Garden. There, the staff is
experimenting with perennials hardy to Atlanta's zone 7 climate,
including agapanthus (Lily-of-the-Nile), hedychium (ginger lily),
hibiscus, erythrina (coral bean) and zephyranthes (rain lily).
They're combined with new cultivars of annuals, such as coleus,
salvia, plumbago, colocasia and alocasia (elephant's ears) and Musa
(red pygmy banana).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One negative about tropicals is they don't begin to grow until
temperatures get hot. To prevent gaps in beds and borders, plant
spring-blooming perennials in front of tropicals, said Mildred
Pinnell, horticulturist at the Atlanta Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tall tropicals such as bananas or stiff ones such as agave or
yucca can be used to create focal points in a garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tropicals are heavy drinkers and feeders. Give them a liquid
fertilizer every week or so in summer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Treat tropicals not hardy to this area as annuals. But if you
want to try your hand at ``overwintering,'' Cheri Fox,
horticulturist at the Atlanta Botanical Garden, suggested digging
up the plant in fall, cutting back its foliage to a minimum and
placing the roots in a black plastic container with a potting mix
that drains well. Water it lightly and store in a garage, basement
or storage building. Water about once a month or so throughout
winter before replanting in spring.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most banana trees survive winters 22 degrees and higher, Fox
said. For one of the hardiest types, try the Musa basjoo, a native
to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   TROPICALS WORTH A TRY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Black elephant's-ear (Colocasia `Jet Black Wonder'): Large,
deep charcoal gray leaves. Combine with chartreuse foliage, such as
coleus, cannas or Margarita sweet potato vine. Considered hardy for
Zone 7 (Atlanta). (The Atlanta Botanical Garden overwinters its as
water plants.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Canna `Bengal Tiger': Green and yellow zebra-striped leaves
with deep orange flowers. Combine with purple or maroon coleus.
Hardy to Zone 7.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Canna `Tropicana': Intense purple leaves with green, yellow,
pink and red stripes with orange flowers. Combine with yellow
lantana. Hardy to Zone 7.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bloodleaf banana (Musa zebrina): Deep green leaves splashed
with burgundy splotches. Smaller than most bananas, it grows 6 to 8
feet. Not hardy in Zone 7, but many Atlantans are successful at
overwintering indoors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ginger lily (Hedychium): Bold, straplike foliage with
orchidlike, fragrant blossoms in a range of colors, from raspberry
to white. At 6 feet tall, they make a dense background screen.
Hardy to Zone 7.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Angel's trumpet (Brugmansia): Bold, textured leaves with
large, fragrant trumpet-shaped flowers. Great container plant. Not
hardy in Zone 7.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Strobilanthes `Persian Shield': Shimmering lilac, blue and
maroon leaves. Combine with yellow petunias or Margarita sweet
potato vine. Not hardy in Zone 7.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mandevilla: A vine with dark green foliage and pink blooms in
a range of shades. Great mailbox climber. Not hardy in Zone 7.

 &HT;    An impoverished boyhood and lots of `Endurance' bring runner to
Atlanta, a gold medal and a movie
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some, watching ``Endurance'' will be an endurance test.
Others may be mesmerized by this unusual docudrama, which stars
small, wind-swift Olympic gold medalist Haile Gebrselassie as
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Leslie Woodhead introduces us to the athlete as
he preps for the 10,000-meter run at the 1996 Olympics (the
straightforward Atlanta race footage was shot by longtime Games
documentarian Bud Greenspan). Then the movie shifts to the life of
young Haile (played by Yonas Zergaw), struggling to survive within
his large family in rural Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   His athletic career started by necessity: He had to run six
miles each way to school, and every day he trekked three hours to
fetch fresh water for the family. The movie also drifts through a
mass baptism ceremony in a Coptic church and a daylong picnic by
villagers in the shade of an ancient tree. Given its dreamy,
wordless sequences and tracking shots of the Ethiopian countryside,
it makes sense that one of the film's three producers is the
visually driven director Terrence Malick.
</P>
<P>
   The movie can verge at times on poverty-chic, exploiting the
family's Third World ``otherness'' as the camera explores the
texture of their mud-walled home. But it maintains a respectful
distance. Woodhead's decision to cast non-actors in the film often
results in self-conscious stiffness, but it also lends a sense of
legitimacy to the story.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Endurance'' comes full circle to the Atlanta
Olympics, it's impossible not to be inspired by the power and grace
of Gebrselassie and his fellow runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endurance''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Haile Gebrselassie. Rated G. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A peculiar but engaging blend of travelogue,
docudrama and sports film.

 &HT;    Not fit for man or beasts
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Halfway through ``Instinct,'' it happens: the Triumphant Robin
Williams Moment.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I call the hackneyed scene in a movie when the
eccentric hero inspires his students/patients/soldiers to revolt
against an oppressive authority figure. At the height of this
rebellion, the camera hones in on the principal/doctor/
</P>
<P>
   commander who's trying to keep Williams down. The outfoxed guy
shakes his head with begrudging admiration and gasps, ``Son of a
(beep).''
</P>
<P>
   This was effective when Jack Nicholson faced down Louise
Fletcher in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Then Williams
started repeating the same trick over and over. Now it's a prime
Hollywood cliche used to stir up fake feeling.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Instinct,'' the Williams stand-in is Anthony Hopkins,
slumming. He plays Dr. Ethan Powell, an anthropologist locked up in
a psychiatric prison surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates (a la
``Cuckoo's Nest''). It seems that, after living for months in the
company of gorillas in the African wilds (a la ``Gorillas in the
Mist''), he went berserk and killed two natives. Why? It's up to
psychiatry student Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to pick his mind
(a la Hopkins' own ``The Silence of the Lambs'').
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers' instinct behind ``Instinct'' seems to be this:
If you cobble together elements from other successful movies, maybe
the resulting mess will make money. There's even a tearful
monologue by Gooding; it's well played by the Oscar winner, but
seems designed to tug in the male-weepy, ``Good Will Hunting''
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based very loosely on Daniel Quinn's ``Ishmael,''
about a talking ape who maunders on about man's ecological
responsibilities. For better or worse, this isn't that story,
though Gerald Di Pego's screenplay includes simplistic jabber about
``civilized'' vs. ``primitive'' societies, which the book might
have inspired.
</P>
<P>
   It also has howl-provoking ``deep'' exchanges. ``You're free to
go,'' Gooding tells Hopkins at the end of one interview. The
prisoner sagely replies, ``Am I? You? Are you free?''
</P>
<P>
   It's all shameful, shameless, and not even a guilty pleasure.
It's just a guess, but gut instincts say ``Instinct'' is the movie
that made Hopkins announce his retirement from acting. I hope he
changes his mind. But after sitting through this twaddle, I don't
blame him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. Rated R for
intense violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Resist your instinct to see it.

 &HT;    Love, respect are uncovered in `Masks'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bian Lian Wang (Zhu Xu) has a problem. He's a street performer
whose specialty is a quick-change routine involving elaborate cloth
masks. How he does it is a secret, one that tradition mandates he
pass on only to a male heir.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, he has no heirs of either sex. When Master Liang
(Zhao Zhigang), a famous female impersonator at the local opera
troupe, warns Wang, ``Don't let your magic die,'' the old man takes
it to heart. He goes to a sad clearinghouse for orphans and buys a
7-year-old lad named Doggie (Zhou Ren-Ying).
</P>
<P>
   Now stop reading here if you're afraid of spoilers, because
there's no way to write about ``The King of Masks'' without giving
away one plot twist.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Doggie is actually a girl in disguise. In the China of
1930, being a female is hardly more respectable than being, well, a
doggy. The child's own father is willing to sell her to a stranger
because, in his eyes, a girl is little more than a mouth to feed
and a dowry to raise. From his personal experience as a man
disguised as a woman, the drag diva Liang explains, ``No one values
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Wang discovers Doggie's deception, the movie becomes a
study of the respect and grudging love that grow between the two.
Wu Tianming's drama has the shape of an old folk tale, infused with
contemporary criticism of the society's dismissal of women. Though
it suffers some lapses of sentimentality and melodrama, it's held
together by its emotional core. The movie's secret weapon is Zhou,
who despite her young age is a mesmerizing, fearless little
actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Masks''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Zhu Xu and Zhou Ren-Ying. Unrated. In Mandarin with
English subtitles. At Toco Hills. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A charming fable about the growing bond between a
street performer and his adopted child.

 &HT;    Tangled `Twilight' dusky with oddities
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the lavishly demented mind of Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin
(``Tales From the Gimli Hospital,'' ``Careful'') comes another
plush cinematic whatsit called ``Twilight of the Ice Nymphs.''
</P>
<P>
   A purveyor of cheerful artifice, Maddin (working with a
screenplay by George Toles) shoots his latest fractured fairy tale
on woodland sets made misty by a constant shower of ostrich
feathers. Unfolding in the world of Mandragora, the movie follows
the lovelorn adventures of hunky Peter, torn between a mysterious
woman named Juliana (Pascale Bussieres) and a married temptress
named Zephyr (Alice Krige), who has prayed to an ancient statue of
Venus for Peter's love. (For the record, Peter is played by a
British actor who chose to have his name removed from the
production; his voice was redubbed by cast mate Ross McMillan.)
</P>
<P>
   The film also includes Shelley Duvall as Peter's sister, Frank
Gorshin as her disgruntled handyman and R.H. Thomson as the doctor
she loves, a sinister one-legged fellow who holds Juliana in his
thrall. Maddin presents his melodrama with a warped glee, sending
his characters spinning through a world of wonderland oddities. The
sun never sets here (the scenes glow with filtered orange light),
and Peter wakes up to the boom of his own rifle, realizing, ``I've
been sleep-hunting again!'' A seductress dresses her targeted hunk
in her own purple negligee and they make love, oblivious to the
rising tide that enters the room and floods their bed. A human
skull bites the hand that picks it up.
</P>
<P>
   A little of Maddin's cuckoo approach goes a long way. But if
you're looking for a unique screen vision, ``Twilight'' is a good
place to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twilight
</P>
<P>
   of the Ice Nymphs''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pascale Bussieres and Alice Krige. Unrated. Through
Thursday at Cinefest (Georgia State University). 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   31 minutes. 404-651-2463.

 &HT;    `Swindle' charms, keeps us guessing
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claude Chabrol's 50th feature, ``The Swindle,'' is a
sweet-natured bit of flimflam fluff showcasing the old-pro charms
of Isabelle Huppert and Michel Serrault. The two play Betty and
Victor, small-time grifters whose usual prey are easily seduced
conventioneers. Kindhearted con artists, they typically leave their
marks a little cash and a nice kiss-off note.
</P>
<P>
   The key to their continued success is a combination of caution
and trust; they never get too greedy, and they depend on each other
unquestionably. But Betty gets ambitious and embarks on a scheme
involving a larcenous businessman (Francois Cluzet), his dangerous
bosses and an attache case full of Swiss francs. Her solo swing is
both a challenge and a threat to the older, more seasoned Victor,
who, against his better judgment, goes along with her.
</P>
<P>
   By the time fingers are being broken and necks nicked, the
swindle itself has run out of steam. Plus, Chabrol could've moved
things along a bit faster; we really don't need all those
shots/plugs for Air France as the action moves from Switzerland to
Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's strength is as a smartly acted two-hander in
which we're never quite sure who's conning whom. Further, we're
never absolutely sure who Betty and Victor are. That is, are they,
in the grand movie tradition, May-December lovers? Or father and
daughter? Or vastly enchanted-with-each-other partners in crime?
Their rapport has a slight Nick-and-Nora quality from the
celebrated 1930s ``The Thin Man'' comedy-mystery film series, but
Huppert and Serrault are so unique that it's difficult to call them
derivative of anyone. Huppert, who has starred for Chabrol in such
masterful films as ``Violette'' and ``La Ceremonie,'' radiates her
customary catlike amorality (``I'm frivolous, not perverse,'' she
purrs), while Serrault is both achingly vulnerable and eminently
untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swindle'' spins a rigged roulette wheel of smart talk,
gorgeous settings and possible betrayals. It's all more style than
substance. But in the end, if you're going to let yourself be
taken, why not be taken by the best?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swindle''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Isabelle Huppert and Michel Serrault. Directed by
Claude Chabrol. Not rated, but contains flashes of violence. In
French with subtitles. Lefont Plaza. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A character study disguised as a caper film.

 &HT;    20 questions for Seal
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Born Sealhenri Samuels, the British pop star known as
Seal has used his commanding voice and formidable physique (6 feet
</P>
<P>
   4 inches with a shaved head) to cut an impressive figure
throughout the 1990s. In 1994, his single ``Kiss From a Rose''
became the title song for the movie ``Batman Forever.'' In 1996,
Seal won Grammy Awards for best record, song and male pop vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the London-born son of Nigerian immigrants
started his current tour in Las Vegas, we asked the 36-year-old
vocalist to play ``20 Questions,'' with one caveat: simple
responses, please.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What don't you say often enough?
</P>
<P>
   A:``I love you.'' I don't think you can say that enough.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What is your greatest regret?
</P>
<P>
   A:I don't really have one.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Even about your current record? (``Human Being,'' which has
fallen from Billboard magazine's Top 200 chart after peaking at No.
22.)
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm pleased with the record, in terms of my integrity as an
artist being maintained. Obviously, a little more commercial
success would be lovely. But I'm happy with what I did and the way
that I was able to say it. And the opportunity that I had to say
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   A:That we will never overcome as humans our differences that
make us go to war.
</P>
<P>
   Q:OK, let's try something a little lighter. What would the Seal
special be in a restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   A:Bresaola.
</P>
<P>
   Q:And that is ...
</P>
<P>
   A:A thinly sliced beef Italian dish. It's usually served with
arugula, lemon and olive oil. It's what I tend to eat when I go to
a restaurant. I'm an O blood type, and we are serious meat eaters!
</P>
<P>
   Q:What do you have to have in your refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   A:Water. Well, no, I like to have that at room temperature. So
I'll say turkey sausages.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Which talent would you most like to have?
</P>
<P>
   A:I would like to be a great public speaker. I enjoy
communication. That's the one area I enjoy most: communication and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What is the trait you most deplore in others?
</P>
<P>
   A:A fear, I think.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A:A fear, definitely.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Which living person do you most admire?
</P>
<P>
   A:Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Q:In a movie about your life, who stars?
</P>
<P>
   A:Cuba Gooding Jr. He's great!
</P>
<P>
   Q:Who's your favorite hero of movies?
</P>
<P>
   A:That's hard. I don't really have one. My favorite hero,
period, is Martin Luther King Jr. I loved what he stood for. He was
a peaceful warrior. Something I aspire to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What is the quality you most like in a woman?
</P>
<P>
   A:I like her to be strong-willed. But I think the quality I find
most attractive about a woman, before strong-willed even, is when
she has ownership of her strength as a woman.
</P>
<P>

together about a year and a half.
</P>
<P>

   Q:But didn't you start that rumor?
</P>
<P>
   A:There was a point early in my career when whatever people
wanted to believe, they got. So, yes, I confess, I allowed people
to believe that nonsense.

THE MERCHANT OF MENACE: RACIAL STEREOTYPES IN `STAR WARS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)

<P>
   (Bruce Gottlieb is a Slate senior staff writer.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't think there's anything wrong with ethnic jokes per se.
Some of my best jokes are ethnic. Like the one about the Jewish
mother on a beach who screams ``My son! My son the neurologist! Is
drowning!'' Or the two Scotsmen who tuck $10 bills into their
friend's casket and the third who swaps the bills for a $30 check.
</P>
<P>
   But what about a sober drama featuring evil mercantilists whose
technologically advanced robots enslave a peace-loving nation and
all at the bidding of a man known as ``Emperor''? Oh, right, the
mercantilists also have slanty eyes, wear long robes, and talk just
like Charlie Chan. They attempt to hide their crafty schemes from
the outside world by forcing the conquered nation to sign a faux
treaty. They are ruthless and cruel in their occupation.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Crichton wrote a Japan-bashing film (and novel)
back in 1993 called ``Rising Sun,'' critics roasted him for
exploiting racial fears. But the racial stereotyping in George
Lucas' latest Star Wars epic, ``The Phantom Menace,'' is far worse,
and nobody seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   Crafty Japanese trade villains aren't the only heavy-handed
ethnic stereotype in ``Phantom Menace.'' As the story continues,
the heroes slip past the evil Japanese to a nearby planet. There,
they attempt to repair their broken spaceship but are stymied by
the hook-nosed owner of the local parts shop -- Watto -- who also
happens to have a thick Yiddish accent!
</P>
<P>
   Psychological manipulations that work on almost everyone fail
with Watto -- ``Mind tricks don'ta work on me ... only money! No
money, no parts, no deal!,'' he cries -- and the heroes get what
they want only through the bravery of a gifted slave boy (Anakin
Skywalker). At the end of the desert planet sequence, Anakin is
emancipated but separated from his mother, who still belongs to
Watto. Even in a galaxy far away, the Jews are apparently behind
the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Jar Jar Binks, the childlike sidekick with the
unmistakably West Indian accent and enormous buttocks. Jar Jar is
likable, easygoing, and dumb as dirt -- always being scolded or
saved from death by the Jedi knights. His stupidity and cowardice
are running jokes throughout the film. And his people, the Gungan,
are a brave but primitive tribe who throw spears and rocks at the
oncoming army in the climactic battle sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hispanics escape Lucas' caricature, which is actually
something of a mixed blessing since Hispanics often rightly
complain that they are ignored in the national race debate.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to George Lucas, he gives Japanese traits to at
least one heroine (Queen Amidala), and there is a black man (Samuel
Jackson) on the august Jedi Council. And true evil in this movie --
the so-called Phantom Menace -- resides in a handsome white man
(Sen. Palpatine) and a towheaded tot (Anakin Skywalker/Darth
Vader).
</P>
<P>
   Until this last episode, the Star Wars series has shown a happy,
multicultural universe, in which thousands of sentient species
coexist, more or less peacefully. This hardly gives Lucas license
to revive racist stereotypes. But it makes the latest characters
seem like a lapse in taste rather than morals.
</P>
<P>
   What's especially puzzling, though, is that film reviewers have
by and large given Lucas a free pass. A smattering of reviewers
griped about Jar Jar Binks, and the Village Voice was offended by
the ``blatant ethnic stereotype'' behind Watto, ``the hook-nosed
merchant insect.'' But far more typical was the Time reviewer,
Richard Corliss, who gushed: ``the junk dealer Watto is a little
masterpiece of design: cinnamon stubble on his corrugated face,
chipped rocks for teeth, the raspy voice of Brando's Godfather
speaking Turkish.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish? Even without the visual clue of the hooked nose,
Watto's accent is clearly Yiddish, not Turkish.

MEXICO DENOUNCES CORRUPTION REPORTS ON EVE OF SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Stung by reports that two prominent figures here
are involved with drug traffickers, Mexico's government hoped the
allegations would not hurt a scheduled meeting Friday with senior
U.S. officials on money laundering, immigration and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the arrival of Attorney General Janet Reno, White
House drug policy adviser Barry McCaffrey and other ranking
officials, Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Rosario Green said
she was ``profoundly irritated'' by the timing of the reports,
published this week in the New York Times, the El Financiero of
Mexico City and the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a U.S. government report, the Post and El Financiero
charged that Carlos Hank Gonzalez and his sons posed a threat to
the United States because of their connection with major drug
organizations. Hank is one of Mexico's wealthiest men and a ranking
member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, meanwhile, on reported Wednesday on U.S.
doubts about the 1997 Mexican investigation into money laundering
allegations against President Ernesto Zedillo's private secretary,
Liebano Saenz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am bothered by (this) strange coincidence on the eve of an
important meeting where important agreements may be signed,'' Green
told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed the reports on ``anti-Mexican sectors in the United
States that don't want a better relationship with Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Green also challenged the U.S. government to present proof
against Hank and Saenz.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's office and Attorney General Jorge Madrazo strongly
denied the contents of the two reports.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and McCaffrey are scheduled to meet their Mexican
counterparts in what is an ongoing effort for better cooperation on
topics affecting both nations, primarily drug trafficking and
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright canceled her visit because
of developments in the peace efforts in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are also part of accords signed earlier this year
between President Clinton and Zedillo that aimed to strengthen
cooperation between neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Zedillo and President Clinton gave us important
instructions ... to be able to advance in this relationship,''
Green said. ``So we hope that in this binational meeting, the
results are a useful, amicable and important dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Saenz released a response to the New York Times
report. He said he launched the investigation to quell an anonymous
allegation about drug corruption and that nothing illegal was
found.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office, meanwhile, said it closed the
probe because ``there was no crime to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Times report ``reproachful,'' Zedillo's press office
said Saenz was ``an outstanding public official due to his respect
of the law, honesty and loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations against Hank, who has been a congressman, Mexico
City mayor and governor to the state of Mexico, are not new, but
they have never led to any charges and he has adamantly denied
them.

EUROPEAN UNION ANNOUNCES PLAN TO FORM A MILITARY FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ The leaders of 15 European countries decided
Thursday to make the European Union a military power for the first
time in its 42-year history, with command headquarters, staffs and
forces of its own for peacekeeping and peacemaking missions in
future crises like those in Kosovo or Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Long an economic giant, the European Union today has a common
currency, the euro, in 11 countries. But when it comes to foreign
and defense policy, Europe does not even have a telephone number,
as Henry Kissinger sarcastically observed 25 years ago when he was
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   All that will change by the end of next year, the 15 leaders
vowed.
</P>
<P>
   By late 2000, according to the plan announced at the European
Union summit meeting here, Europe could carry a big stick, a
60,000-strong, five-nation Eurocorps based in Strasbourg, France,
and have a soft-spoken foreign and security policy czar to speak
for it.
</P>
<P>
   That could be Javier Solana of Spain, now secretary general of
NATO, whose candidacy for the job was on the leaders' agenda here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed
up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them,
and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international
crises without prejudice to actions by NATO,'' the European leaders
declared.
</P>
<P>
   They echoed language first used by President Jacques Chirac of
France and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain six months ago
after two crises in the Balkans showed how far Europe still had to
go to be taken seriously as a military power, even on its own
continent. Neither in Bosnia nor in Kosovo were European countries,
whose total armed forces exceed those of the United States in size,
able to project military power convincingly enough to halt the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, all 15 leaders agreed to absorb the functions of
the 10-nation Western European Union, a long-dormant European
defense alliance founded a year before NATO in 1948, and put it at
the disposal of the new, more assertive Europe that is taking shape
under the European Union. ``In that event,'' they said, ``the WEU
as an organization would have completed its purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   All 10 members of the WEU _ Britain, Belgium, France, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Germany and Greece _
already belong to both NATO and the European Union. Denmark does,
too, but has only observer status in the smaller European defense
organization, as do four other European Union members, Austria,
Ireland, Finland and Sweden, which are neutral or nonaligned and do
not belong to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   These countries would be able to join future European Union
peacekeeping or peacemaking operations, but only if they wanted to,
the leaders agreed, saying they would also welcome participation by
other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   With Germany's unification in 1990 acting as a spur to its
neighbors to closer unity among themselves, the Treaty of European
Union, negotiated at the end of 1991, committed the Europeans to a
common currency and a common foreign and security policy and
defense policy, building on the common market they created in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   They reaffirmed those aspirations in another treaty signed in
1997, and succeeded in launching the euro at the start of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the common foreign and security policy sputtered along
through successive crises in the Balkans in which the Europeans
showed little unity or common purpose until the Americans sent in
armed forces to help them in Bosnia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany, Chirac, Blair and
the others are determined that Europe should be taken more
seriously on the world stage. Part of what is driving them, their
advisers say, is concern that the United States, with only 100,000
troops in Europe now compared with three times that many at the end
of the Cold War, will not indefinitely be willing to pull the fat
out of the fire for Europeans who have long since been rich enough
to provide for their own defenses.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats have welcomed Europe's newfound willingness
to do more for itself. But they remain skeptical about whether
Europeans will actually be willing to spend the billions of dollars
it would take to build the stronger European defense pillar that
American defense secretaries for decades have been saying they
wanted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's declaration by European Union leaders makes clear
that they still have a lot of work ahead of them to create the kind
of military decision making and planning ability that NATO has had
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac suggested that the Western European Union's general staff
and military committee, both based in a small headquarters in the
center of Brussels some distance from NATO's, should be transferred
to the European Union and presided over by its new foreign and
security policy coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   If that turns out to be Solana, one senior U.S. official said,
``We would be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Verheugen, a German government official who has also
been suggested for that job, said of the plan to strengthen
European defense, ``It is not a replacement for the Atlantic
partnership, but a significant and necessary complement to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders themselves also noted, ``The alliance remains the
foundation of the collective defense of its member states.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders agreed at their summit meeting in Washington in
April on detailed arrangements to lend military headquarters
organizations, multinational staffs, and tanks, helicopters and
other equipment to the Europeans if they decided to undertake
operations the United States prefers to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany said when he retired last
month as NATO's senior military officer, such arrangements exist
only on paper so far.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, when the NATO allies decided to use air power to try
to force the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, to accept a
settlement in Kosovo, only the United States had the ability to
throw hundreds of airplanes into the battle. And though the
European allies all support the air war, their total contribution
of 277 planes is dwarfed by the United States, which has committed
as many as 815 to the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States had the intelligence satellites and
precision-guided weapons the allies needed to mount a campaign with
minimum casualties to their own pilots, and only the United States
has invested in a fleet of large-capacity transport aircraft big
enough to fly in the 50,000 or more peacekeepers planned for
Kosovo.

GOODING MOVES PAST DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD TO A SPOT ON HOLLYWOOD'S
A-LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a Cuba Gooding Jr., so it follows that there's a Cuba
Gooding Sr. What you might not know is that both are in show biz.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know Cuba Gooding Jr. by name _ from his
breakthrough role in 1991's ``Boyz in the Hood,'' from his
ubiquitous four-word catch phrase (which we won't repeat here) from
``Jerry Maguire,'' from his ebullient Oscar-night acceptance speech
for his ``Maguire'' role. You may even know that he's co-starring
with Anthony Hopkins in ``Instinct,'' a new psychological drama
that's opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If you know Cuba Gooding Sr., you probably know him by voice _
and it helps to be a fan of early-'70s soul music. He was the lead
singer of the Main Ingredient, the sweet tenor behind such hits as
``Just Don't Want to Be Lonely'' and ``Everybody Plays the Fool.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like his son, he's an actor _ he was recently cast in two
movies. And that's caused some confusion, as Cuba Gooding Jr.
explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad calls me up, all upset,'' the younger Gooding says
during a Dallas visit. ``I go, `What's goin' on?' He goes, `I gotta
fax you over this form. You gotta sign it.' I said, `Yeah, yeah,
tell me, what's it for?' `Well, Screen Actors Guild says since I
got cast in these movies, I gotta have a credit release.' I said,
`What does that mean?' He says, `You gotta say I can use my own
name in this movie 'cause you're Cuba Gooding Jr. and I'm Cuba
Gooding, but it was my name first!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Cuba Gooding Jr. punctuates this story with a
loud, thigh-slapping laugh, one of several that he lets loose as he
and ``Instinct'' director Jon Turteltaub chat. At times during the
interview, Gooding seems subdued, even pensive, until he bursts out
laughing or slips into a rambunctious impersonation, including one
of Paul Newman that involves standing on a coffee table at The
Mansion on Turtle Creek.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Instinct,'' Gooding is much more restrained. He plays Theo
Caulder, a buttoned-down psychiatric resident who takes on the task
of tapping into the mind of primatologist Ethan Powell (Hopkins),
who apparently went mad and killed two people in Africa. Theo must
contend with Powell and the brutal snake-pit of a prison where
Powell is being held. Many scenes involve only Gooding and Hopkins,
in a game of psychological one-upmanship that at one point has
Hopkins' character slapping a piece of dirty duct tape over
Gooding's mouth and threatening to kill him. Gooding wore the duct
tape for most of the two days it took to film that scene.
</P>
<P>
   But that discomfort is minor compared with some of the
difficulties Gooding went through before becoming a star. In 1974,
the elder Gooding split from the family (Cuba Jr. was 6). The
family saw little of the money from the Main Ingredient hits, and
mother and children lived a nearly homeless existence, drifting
from motel to motel in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding's mother kept the family close, reading the Bible to her
children every night. According to some reports, Gooding became a
born-again Christian at age 13, but Gooding says that happened
earlier, around the time he was in the fourth grade. He's not as
devout now, but he says God still plays a big role in his life and
in the raising of his sons, 4-year-old Spencer and 2-year-old
Mason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an ideal Christian by any means, but my kids go to
Sunday school,'' Gooding says. ``And I pray with them; we pray at
dinnertime and we pray before we go to bed every night. I just try
to keep a base in it, but maybe not as big a presence as maybe a
devout Christian would.''
</P>
<P>
   The constant moving gave Gooding a sense of rootlessness,
however; he attended a different school every year from eighth to
11th grade. By the time he was a junior at Kennedy High School in
the Northridge/Granada Hills area north of Los Angeles, he was
adamant that he wouldn't move to another school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom got a job, so we moved to another hotel in north
Hollywood, and I refused to stop going to that school,'' Gooding
says. ``And then that summer, I still kept taking the bus to a job
in Northridge. It was insane, and I finally just gave in and said,
`I'll graduate from North Hollywood,' and thank God I did. That's
where I met my agent. It was God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooding had a small role in John Landis' 1988 comedy ``Coming to
America,'' but his breakthrough came in 1991's ``Boyz in the
Hood,'' in which he played a young man struggling to get out of his
troubled LA neighborhood. He then appeared in movies both
respectable (''A Few Good Men,'' ``Outbreak'') and
not-so-respectable (''Hitz,'' ``Gladiator''), but he hit the next
level when he played a brash but loyal pro football player in
``Jerry Maguire,'' for which he won the Best Supporting Actor
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Maguire,'' he has become an A-list actor, appearing with
Jack Nicholson (''As Good as It Gets''), Robin Williams (''What
Dreams May Come''), and now Hopkins, as if he had joined some sort
of club for movies starring two Oscar-winners.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding's Oscar win was not only the last to date for an
African-American actor, it was the last time a black actor was
nominated for an Academy Award. Oscar's snubbing of
African-American actors has caused some controversy during recent
years, but few of Gooding's roles have called specifically for
someone black. Although he agrees that the choices for black actors
are limited, he believes that many of the problems come after a
black actor is cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely an opinion among filmmakers that, if a
black man is onscreen, it brings up a point if he has to kiss a
white woman ... it takes away from the story,'' Gooding says. ``And
that's probably reflective on today's society. To have a black man
carry your film, that raises different questions. So I'm always
looking to push that envelope as far as possible until pretty soon
it's not as much of an issue, at least when it comes to casting me.
Because I am a black actor.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Turteltaub resisted developing a love story involving
Gooding and Maura Tierney (''NewsRadio''), who plays Hopkins'
estranged daughter. But Turteltaub says that was less about the
black-and-white issue than it was about letting any romance creep
into the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding was rumored to have been cast in a role that definitely
would have required a black actor: '60s soul singer Otis Redding,
in a Joe Eszterhas project called ``Blaze of Glory.'' But Gooding
says that the project never got out of the discussion stage. He
also says that budget problems derailed a Martin Luther King
project that he was working on with Oliver Stone.
</P>
<P>
   But although he's had professional disappointments, life
offscreen has become better for Gooding. His parents reconciled a
couple of years ago, and his father is singing again, doing well on
the nightclub and package-tour circuits. Even those years of living
in hotels resulted in some lasting connections for Gooding,
including his personal assistant, Shawn Shuttles, whom he met in
one of those hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said on the set of (the upcoming) `Chill Factor,' `Isn't it
funny, Shawn? All our life, we've been living in hotels, going,
`One day, we're gonna be rich and famous.' And here we are _ living
in hotels.'''

NATO AND MILOSEVIC BOTH COMPROMISE TO REACH PEACE PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 A News Analysis  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S.-led western alliance won the agreement of
defiant Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Thursday to halt the
ouster of ethnic Albanian Muslims from Kosovo, achieving the
central demand of NATO's 11-week bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a compromise European-sponsored peace plan
approved by Milosevic and the Serbian parliament in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia also agreed to withdraw Yugoslav troops from Kosovo and
allow an estimated 1.4 million displaced Kosovo refugees to return
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   To win those concessions from Milosevic, President Clinton and
the 19-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization gave in to
Yugoslav demands for the United Nations to supervise post-war
Kosovo, for the allies to reaffirm Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo
and for hundreds of Serbian troops to eventually return to Kosovo
at key border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The concessions were designed to obtain Russia's cooperation and
Milosevic's approval of a plan to end a grinding bombing campaign
that has tested allied unity, eroded public support and raised the
specter that the allies would launch a grueling ground war. The
next step will be a cease fire by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo,
followed by a halt to NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page peace plan _ consisting of 12 points _ was approved
by Milosevic and the Yugoslav parliament. It calls for Yugoslavia
to:
</P>
<P>
   _ End violence and repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Withdraw all military, police and paramilitary forces within
seven days of the agreement's implementation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accept deployment of an international security force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Permit the ``safe and free return of all refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-recalcitrant Yugloslav leader also accepted the demand
that he take part in a political process designed to provide
autonomy and self-government within Yugoslav territory to ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace deal leaves the Yugoslav dictator plenty of room
for face saving. The compromise:
</P>
<P>
   _ Responds to Milosevic's demand that the United Nations _ not
NATO _ take the lead in establishing peace in Kosovo, by calling
for deployment of an ``efficient international civilian and
security'' presence in Kosovo ``under U.N. auspices.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Fails to require Milosevic or his government to cooperate with
an international war crimes tribunal in the Hague, Netherlands,
that has indicted him for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Acknowledges Yugoslav territorial integrity and abandons a
proposal to have a referendum in Kosovo to fashion provincial
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Commits the allies to disarming both Albanian secessionists
and Serbian paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Permits hundreds of Serbian forces to return to Kosovo to
serve as liaisons with the international security force, identify
and potentially clear mine fields and maintain a presence ``at
places of Serb heritage'' and ``at key border crossings.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said that the European
plan reflected the key conditions laid down by the White House and
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan is ``something that NATO, the United States and
the (European Union) were comfortable with,'' Lockhart said. ``It's
something that was consistent with what NATO has articulated. It's
consistent with what our views are.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's charge d'affairs at the United
Nations, said the 12-point blueprint crafted by Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari and Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former prime minister
of Russia, was ``a compromise'' that responds to many of Belgrade's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an agreement which addresses many needs and
accommodates many people,'' Jovanovic said. The allies ``have
accepted the United Nations as the sole international body
authorized to deal with peace and security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the United Nations into the mix gives Yugoslavia
greater opportunity to influence the tedious diplomatic and
on-the-ground military maneuvering that will accompany day-to-day
implementation of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has close ties to both Russia and China _ nations
that have veto power on the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Russia shares Slavic and Orthodox Christian ties with Yugoslavia
dating back centuries, as well as wariness about unilateral
military action by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The European plan also confronts the United States and Russia
with ticklish negotiations over the command structure on the ground
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long stipulated that NATO troops serve
``at the core'' of the international security force, with a
``unified'' military command under NATO. That translates into
having Gen. Wesley Clark, the U.S. Army four-star general and NATO
military commander, ultimately commanding the operation.
</P>
<P>
   But the European plan only calls for ``an essential NATO
participation'' _ an ill-defined arrangement that sets the stage
for an independent role for Russian commanders and Russian troops
in Serbian-controlled sectors of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who worked with
European leaders to craft a European peace plan, said the United
States and Russia will continue efforts to agree on a command
structure for the Kosovo security force.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Milosevic's acceptance of the European peace plan
heralds the onset of a new phase of wrangling rather than the end
of disagreements that led to war.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Collins, a senior fellow in political-military studies at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
D.C., said there remains plenty of room for tedious
misunderstandings that will fall short of galvanizing the NATO
alliance to resume the largest air campaign since the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that ``significant details'' remain to be worked
out, including the composition of the peace enforcement force,
coordination of troop withdrawals and the relationship between NATO
and the United Nations on the supervision of the peacekeeping
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, a long-term peace enforcement operation will be a
mixed blessing for U.S. and NATO forces, which will have to face
land mines, hostile Serbs, aggrieved Kosovars, and a potentially
uncooperative Kosovo Liberation Army,'' Collins said.

THABO MBEKI, THE JOHN ADAMS OF SOUTH AFRICA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN _ As Winnie Madikizela-Mandela shouted recently to a
cheering crowd in a black township: ``I'm sick and tired of
white-controlled media who say they don't know Thabo Mbeki. Who
cares?''
</P>
<P>
   President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, whose speeches usually have
vaguely threatening undertones, was unsubtly pointing out that when
Mbeki takes over as president on June 16, he will govern with a
huge mandate whether whites or anyone else know him or not.
</P>
<P>
   Not that that means they need be afraid. Given the sorry history
of democracy in Africa, South Africans may someday count themselves
lucky that their second post-apartheid president is someone who has
no military background, is an able administrator and repeatedly
pledges himself to democracy and to fighting corruption even in his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   His government, Mbeki said in his victory speech Thursday, will
``approach the exercise of power without any arrogance, with
humility.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nelson Mandela is the George Washington of this new
democracy, the kind of giant among men who turns down offers to be
king, then Mbeki is its John Adams. Like Adams, he is small,
sharply intelligent, visionary, reflective, sometimes tart-tongued,
and an adept back-room fighter.
</P>
<P>
   He is also, on any occasion, the man most likely to turn up too
formally dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on their difference in raiment, the dapper Mbeki, 56,
has mused publicly on his resentment of people who constantly ask
whether he can fill Mandela's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I wear those big, ugly things?'' he said. ``Or,''
he added with a shudder, ``those shirts'' _ meaning the bold
``Madiba shirts'' that Mandela adopted after a trip to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki intends to fit his own smaller but more meticulously
polished footwear.
</P>
<P>
   Born on June 18, 1942, Thabo Mbeki grew up in poverty in
Mbewuleni village in the Idutywa area of the Transkei _ the
historic land of the Xhosa.
</P>
<P>
   Though he grew up on the side of the valley with the rural
peasantry who wore blankets and painted their faces with red clay,
Mbeki was the son of radical party intellectuals who ran a small
store and taught school to survive.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the liberation struggle virtually from the age of 10,
when he and a cousin sold Coke bottles to raise money to pay their
African National Congress membership fees. The struggle eventually
cost him a son, a brother and, two biographers say, any real
relationship with his father, who was one of its heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Govan Mbeki, spent much of his life in jail and sent
his children to relatives very young so they couldn't come to
depend on parents who expected to be arrested. The elder Mbeki,
whose wife still lives in Idutywa, now lives in a bungalow on the
grounds of his son's official mansion, but ``seems sad, lonely and
regretful,'' with ``little familial warmth either in the
relationship or even in Thabo's achievements,'' according to a new
biography, ``The Life and Times of Thabo Mbeki'' (Adrian Hadland &AMP;
Jovial Rantao, Zebra Press, April 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki dislikes revealing too much about himself. His
pre-campaign book ``Africa, the Time Has Come,'' is just a
collection of speeches, with a dry 22-page biographical sketch.
</P>
<P>
   But even the speeches reveal a great deal. His 1964 statement to
a U.N. committee in London, delivered when he was a 21-year-old
student asking it to prevent the Pretoria government from hanging
his father, is an ennobling portrait of the elder Mbeki, touching
in its combination of humility and righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   His 1978 speech ``The Historical Injustice'' shows a piercing
intellectualism as he subjects the history of South Africa to
Marxian analysis, skewering the British imperialists and the Boer
pioneers for corrupting even the capitalism and Calvinism they
preached, regressing into feudalism, a racist version of
Lutheranism and simple murder and theft because it was easier and
more profitable than adopting the liberalizing trends of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer poetic power, his ``I Am an African'' speech,
celebrating the new Constitution in 1996, surpasses even the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech, which it
somewhat resembles _ although King was a more riveting speaker.
</P>
<P>
   He is becoming better known because biographers are probing his
past; the fact that he fathered a child at 16 who disappeared 17
years later, probably at the hands of the police, has humanized him
a bit. So have photos of him as a young man leaning affectionately
against friends or smiling at his 1974 London wedding to Zanele
Dlamini, who was studying social work and now heads a bank for
rural women.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki is now seen as a politician, but he is really a lifelong
intellectual guerrilla, rather than an armed one. At Lovedale
Institution, a South African boarding school, he excelled at Latin,
mathematics and science, but was expelled in his senior year for
leading a student strike. A white teacher who spotted his erudition
arranged for a scholarship to the University of Sussex in England;
but he began school late because he had been arrested by the
Rhodesian government while trying to slip out to Britain without a
passport.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a degree in economics and backing causes from
nuclear disarmament to getting the United States out of Vietnam, he
was sent by Oliver Tambo, the London-based president of the African
National Congress, to set up offices in Zambia, Botswana, Swaziland
and Mozambique, making the white South African government feel
surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   He became one of the public faces of the dissident group,
meeting reporters and accompanying Tambo on diplomatic trips to
Moscow, Washington and other capitals. In the 1980s, when white
executives and prominent Afrikaners defied their government to meet
the African National Congress in exile, Mbeki was always there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after the ANC was legalized, he returned home for the
first time in 28 years. While the spotlight briefly lingered on
Cyril Ramaphosa, a union leader who negotiated the new
Constitution, Mbeki returned to his role as heir apparent with his
election as ANC chairman in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of him, particularly asserted among whites, is that he
prefers back-room victories to open debate and puts ``Africanism''
above equality. Those fears got new fuel this week when Business
Day, a financial paper, reported that he had intervened to stop
Judge Edwin Cameron, one of the country's best legal minds, from
being named to the highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting ``judges and lawyers close to the process,'' the paper
said he persuaded Mandela to choose an ``able and solid'' black
candidate because there are only three nonwhites on the 11-seat
Constitutional Court. Mbeki's legal adviser denied that he did more
than consult, but that was regarded with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview with the newspaper The Sowetan, Mbeki
made no bones about his ``Africanist'' perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are talking about poverty alleviation and eradication,
then necessarily you will focus on people who are poorest,'' he
said. ``If that is what is mean by Africanist, you cannot avoid
it.''

   (Nina and Tim Zagat are the creators and publishers of the Zagat
Surveys, which compile diners' impressions of restaurants in over
40 U.S. and foreign cities. The surveys are now accessible online
at http://Zagat.com.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By NINA AND TIM ZAGAT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're in Los Angeles today, at the Bel-Air Hotel, having
meetings to discuss our online strategy and to prepare for the
launch of our new L.A. Marketplace guide. There were torrential
rains last night; we finally understand what Lorenz Hart was
referring to when he wrote in ``The Lady Is a Tramp'' the words
``Hate California; it's cold and it's damp.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it clears by this evening, maybe we'll eat in the
courtyard outside our room. That way, we can recreate some of the
comforts of dining at home.
</P>
<P>
   Eating out is, understandably, a big part of our lives. Tim does
it seven or eight times a week, Nina slightly less. For many, it is
the stuff of fantasies: having the world's finest food foisted upon
on us day after day by restaurant owners who are only too delighted
to fawn over us even though it won't have the slightest effect on
their ratings. (Those are based entirely on ballots from thousands
of anonymous survey respondents.)
</P>
<P>
   But for all of its obvious joys, a constant diet of restaurant
meals produces its share of agita, with symptoms no antacid can
cure: awkwardness, misunderstandings, and a battle of the bulge far
more prolonged than any George Patton ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   What are some of the problems? One is that you've always got to
be nice to everyone. When we go into restaurants these days, we
invariably run into people we know. Even on those days when you
feel like disappearing into the woodwork, you can't. It is a bit
like the life of a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the hurt feelings. Chefs are forever sending
their latest, proudest creations to us, and if we don't like it or
aren't in the mood for it and it goes back half-eaten, spirits in
the kitchen can sink like the latest souffle. Invariably someone
sheepishly emerges from the back a few moments later with a battery
of questions: Is something wrong? Didn't you like it? Can we get
you something else? It makes us feel terrible.
</P>
<P>
   The worst, though, is when a restaurant tries to pick up the
check. We tell them we can't let them, that it would be
compromising, that it would not look good, blah, blah, blah. But it
is a point that many restaurateurs, particularly European ones,
don't seem to understand. They think such concerns petty and
parochial, the typically American tendency to exalt form over
substance and be obsessed with trivial things, like a leader's
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ingenious chefs skirt the problem by adding all sorts
of things that we didn't order, then forgetting to include them in
the check. We dread those ugly scenes where chefs adamantly refuse
to let us pay. We're even more adamant, and, at the threat of
creating a ruckus, we always prevail.
</P>
<P>
   All this generosity--along with our own occasional lapses in
self-restraint--have given us new sympathy for Oprah Winfrey, Ted
Kennedy, Al Roker, and all others who are forever battling their
weight. You can go to a restaurant with the best intentions,
determined to stick to a salad and consomme; but the chef may feel
he's not getting a chance to strut his stuff, and suddenly the
latest risotto and some new type of osso bucco and five different
kinds of desserts magically appear on the table. Who can resist
that?
</P>
<P>
   Tim, who often visits 25 or 30 restaurants a night on his
periodic inspection tours, is finally learning that he does not
have to eat something in all of them. But it's not easy: Once they
find out who he is, they besiege him: ``Oh, Mr. Zagat, you must try
this!'' ``Oh, Mr. Zagat, you must try that!'' And once he starts,
it's tough to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Tim is forever starting new diets and resolving to go to the
gym. As for Nina, she looks forward to weekends in northern
Dutchess County, far away from the New York City restaurant scene,
where she can burn off calories in the garden and can trade in the
rich sauces for fresh fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But even there, there are pitfalls--which prove, incidentally,
that we don't go for only haute cuisine. Before we leave town, Tim
can't seem to pass his favorite pizzeria, Vinnie's, without picking
up a couple of slices to go. Nina can forgo that, but both of us
have grilled hot dogs on toasted rolls (Nina with a touch of
mustard, Tim with heaps of sauerkraut and mustard) at the Red
Rooster, a booming roadside joint about halfway in our journey.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, Tim has a weakness for McDonald's fries, though he
prefers Double Whoppers with cheese to Big Macs. And sometimes, it
seems that the only thing that can get him to drive by a Kentucky
Fried Chicken is if there is a Popeye's not far away.

COMMENTARY: MEETING AT TIANANMEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anniversary statement time. For a few days, in America and
Europe, politicians will express sorrow at the murder of the young
Chinese shot down in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, because they
had gathered to cry out for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Statements will come from two kinds of people. For the sake of
the Chinese people, and our national soul, Americans should
remember the difference.
</P>
<P>
   One group will be those who for years have struggled with their
governments to use trade and political pressure against the
Communists _ to lessen persecution of Chinese and Tibetans who
fight for religious and political liberties. They struggled, lost,
keep struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The other set of people will say a shame, Tiananmen, but we must
not let that interfere with America's policy of ``engagement'' with
China.
</P>
<P>
   Bland word _ but it means American political deals with the
Chinese Politburo, which ordered the Tiananmen massacre, coziness
with Chinese officers who command Beijing's espionage apparatus and
U.S. business appeasement of Chinese trade ministries. Left outside
engagement are the Chinese and Tibetan people _ particularly those
jailed and tortured for expressing forbidden thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The sardonic promise from President Clinton that this engagement
would improve Chinese human rights and American security is a nasty
joke by now to everybody but the U.S.-China business lobbies and
their groupies in the U.S. government and press.
</P>
<P>
   The engagers besmirch the American nation. By using their money
and influence to strengthen Chinese Communist power, they brand the
U.S. unfaithful to the freedoms that sustain America itself.
</P>
<P>
   Western money, which so often propped up other dictatorships,
now helps the Politburo dispose of dissidents, condemn millions to
forced labor and give Christians the choice between worshiping in
government-controlled churches or going to jail for praying
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of Western help _ utter passivity _ allows the
Communists to continue the genocidal war against Tibet. Tony
Clifton, who knows Asia long and well, reports in the international
edition of Newsweek that only shards of the Tibetan civilization
are left in Lhasa _ and stables of imported Chinese prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1992 campaign, Clinton ran as a human rights advocate
favoring trade restrictions against China. Within two years he was
preaching that increased trade would mean increased human rights
for China and increased security for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The Politburo itself exposed that as a lie _ by crackdowns on
dissidents, more pressure against free religion and stepping up
anti-American espionage until it became a major industry. Clinton
apparently discovered the espionage about 20 minutes ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, true blue, he is fighting another battle for China _ to
maintain its most-favored-nation trade status. That would prevent
America from raising tariffs to get Beijing's attention and
respect. If Congress goes along with Clinton, both will be firmly
lying down at Beijing's feet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, some frequently clear-thinking Americans echo the morally
crippling Clintonian dogma _ engagement through mental
compartmentalization.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Grove, president of Intel Corp., believes in parallel
universes _ trade, political, geopolitical and technological. Tie
them together, he said to David Sanger of The New York Times, and
they will all ``stop making progress'' if one ``hits a brick
wall.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grove ignores two other universes. The historical universe shows
the wall is hit, hard, when no connection is drawn between trade or
technology universes and the moral universe, excuse the
expression. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, a Republican candidate for president, wants
troops used to achieve military victory against Serbia, but does
not seem interested in even partial political victory in China _ no
bombs, no troops needed, just democratic conviction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He says Chinese espionage should be judged ``on the basis of our
trade interests.'' The scandal, says he, is not about China's
spying but ``that we let them.'' Familiar? Blame the cops, give the
thieves a free pass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But instead, at this Tiananmen anniversary, perhaps we will
realize at last that three groups, or universes, were in the square
and still are: the Politburo killers, the murdered Chinese, and
ourselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ To the 6.5 million people who live in
Rio, Copacabana and Ipanema are not merely beaches, but also the
soul and main calling card of this city.
</P>
<P>
   But along miles of shoreline where multitudes normally frolic,
the vista has been dominated in recent weeks by big red thumbs-down
emblems and signs warning that the water is ``inappropriate for
swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, part of a sewer line serving some of Rio's most
fashionable neighborhoods collapsed, forcing the government to dump
tons of raw sewage close to shore while repairs were done out at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been foul smells wafting in the air, beaches
closed because of pollution, general indignation _ and a body blow
to Rio's self-image as ``the marvelous city.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its fame as an international playground, Rio faces most
of the same problems as any other global metropolis: crime, noise,
overcrowding, inadequate transport. But Cariocas, as residents of
Rio are known, have traditionally regarded the city's beaches as
both a sanctuary from those difficulties and an eminently public
gathering place, the local equivalent of what the Agora was to
ancient Athens or Central Park is to Manhattanites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, democracy begins on the beaches of Rio,'' said Joao
Fontes, president of the Leblon Residents' Association, a civic
group in the neighborhood adjoining Ipanema that has led protests
against the high levels of bacteria caused by the sewage dumping.
``The beach is the one place where a banker and a doorman can meet
on the same footing, where a maid may shine brighter than the rich
woman who employs her.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting culture of tolerance has been a magnet that
attracts not just foreign tourists, but also Brazilians of every
class from every corner of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the untreated waste being dumped close to shore, in
fact, was generated by a pair of large favelas, or hillside
squatter settlements, that overlook the chic Southern Zone
neighborhoods and have grown rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absurd situation,'' said Afonso Rodrigues, an engineer
who is a member of a group that, until the onset of the sewage
crisis, met every Sunday to play volleyball on Ipanema beach.
``You've got people paying $200 a square foot to live in apartments
on the seafront, and they can't even use the beach because of this
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Rio Mayor Luiz Paulo Conde pointed out in an interview that the
sewage system is a responsibility not of the city but of the state
of Rio de Janeiro, which is immersed in a severe budget crisis. But
he acknowledged that ``when the city has a problem, the citizens
don't want to know if it's the city or the state that is in charge,
they just want a quick solution.''
</P>
<P>
   State authorities say that after a series of delays and mishaps,
the flow of waste has finally been brought under control, with no
permanent damage to the environment. Fontes and scientists
affiliated with his group contend, however, that sand on the
beaches remains contaminated and that offshore fishing continues to
be affected.
</P>
<P>
   But to others here, the sewage crisis and the debate
accompanying it are a reflection of a more fundamental civic
malaise. Having in recent years been deprived of the national
dominance it enjoyed throughout most of Brazilian history, Rio
today is a city in search of an identity suitable to its diminished
status.
</P>
<P>
   Political power in this nation of 165 million people has clearly
shifted to Brasilia, which formally replaced Rio as the nation's
capital nearly 40 years ago, controls the government purse strings
and is less sympathetic to Rio's needs than in the days when
legislators all had apartments here.
</P>
<P>
   On the business side, Sao Paulo, this city's traditional rival,
is now Brazil's undisputed economic powerhouse, brimming with the
confidence that come with that clout.
</P>
<P>
   So while Rio was suffering the indignity of being unable to use
its most famous beaches, an investment group in Sao Paulo announced
plans to build the world's tallest building there.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to another difference that rankles, Frederico Lacerda,
an engineer who is also part of the Ipanema volleyball group, said,
``Construction of our subway system is stalled because of budgetary
and political problems, while it seems that every month a new
station or line opens over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Conde did not dispute the shift in the balance of power, saying
``our vision is not one of competition'' with Sao Paulo, but also
said it did not mean Rio had lost any of the luster that made it a
great city. As he sees it, his city is becoming to Brazil what New
York City is to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the capital but it is the capital,'' he said.
``Brazil was civilized from Rio de Janeiro, and Rio will continue
to be a one-of-a-kind place where customs, food and music are
created, open to the world and symbolizing Brazil and its culture
in a way that Sao Paulo cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in countless other ways large and small, Cariocas are
constantly being reminded that there may be something to the
traditional Paulista gibe that Rio is ``nothing more than a
decaying seaside resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's airlines, for instance, have made Sao Paulo, rather
than Rio, their hub for most regional and international flights,
which adds to travel time for people living here. Even television
programming has recently begun to take on a Sao Paulo flavor.
</P>
<P>
   In his column in Jornal do Brasil, Artur Xexeo complained in May
of what he called ``the fashion to kowtow to Sao Paulo.'' In the
past ``slang, style and everything else was exported from Rio by
television,'' he said, but national broadcasts now ``all of a
sudden have begun to use expressions that sound really peculiar to
the Carioca ear'' because they are typical of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've won the war,'' Xexeo concluded, because Sao Paulo ``is
where the money is.'' But he took consolation in noting that the
most popular television soap operas continue to be made here,
proving that while ``Rio may not have money and may provoke the
disdain of the advertising market, it is still the most photogenic
city in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, there was much celebration locally when Hebe
Camargo, the hostess of a popular television talk show and a
dyed-in-the wool Paulista, announced at the height of the sewage
crisis that she was moving here.
</P>
<P>
   Sao Paulo, she said, has become too violent, crowded and badly
governed for a civilized person to enjoy, and besides, she had
belatedly discovered that ``I love Rio and I love Cariocas and the
affectionate way they treat visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Civic boosters here take such developments as a sign of Rio's
inherent moral superiority, despite the sewage problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sao Paulo has a mercantilistic view of life, but life is not
just made of material progress,'' said Artur da Tavola, author of
the book ``Rio: A Look of Love'' and a federal Senator who
represents the state of Rio de Janeiro. ``It also consists of
spiritual and esthetic progress, and Rio has an abundance of those
characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a table a few yards from the shore of Ipanema beach,
drinking from chilled coconuts and bottles of beer, Lacerda and his
friends agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Paulistas may make all their money over in Sao Paulo,'' he
said. ``But they still come here to spend it.''

IN ROUND SIX, CALIFORNIA STUDENT HITS A BAD SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sean Conley of Newark, Calif., barreled his way
through five rounds of the 72nd National Spelling Bee here Thursday
before tripping up on the word ``coreopsis'' in round six.
</P>
<P>
   When the bee's pronouncer, who is one of the contest judges,
said the word, Sean, 11, who is home-schooled, stared straight
ahead and asked for the word's origin. The answer: Greek.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting a moment, he asked for all pronunciations of the word.
Then, still gazing into a mid-distance, he asked for the word's
definition. A coreopsis refers to any of a genus of flowering
herbs. Finally Sean repeated the word and spelled it
C-H-O-R-E-O-P-S-I-S.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``h'' was wrong, and a bell sounded, announcing the
error to the assemblage of contestants and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sean coolly walked off the stage to the so-called ``comfort
room,'' where some losing contestants struggle to regain their
composure. But he didn't seem to struggle at all, emerging quickly
and watching the few remaining contestants compete in a ballroom of
the Grand Hyatt Hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   Sean, who attends classes run by Tri-City Homeschoolers in
Newark, was quickly surrounded by his parents, Mike Conley, a
software engineer for Apple Computers Inc., and Bryanne Conley, a
teacher at Tri-City. His younger brothers, Devin, 9, and Alden, 4,
also greeted him.
</P>
<P>
   Sean said he never felt nervous on the ballroom stage. ``I
wasn't worried because I didn't think I was going to win,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did tie for ninth place in the competition. Sponsored by
the San Francisco Examiner, Sean and his family received a free
trip to Washington, and he will take home a prize of $200 and a
commemorative watch.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't know what to spend the money on, but he
insisted: ``It's not going to be on study aids for spelling.'' He
also plays the piano, studies karate and competes in math contests
and chess tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   After the competition, Sean and his family met with their
congressman, Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The national bee's winner was Nupur Lala, 14, of Tampa, Fla.
Nupur, an eighth grader at Louis Benito Middle School there, won
after 11 rounds by correctly spelled ``nocicepter,'' which is
something that causes harm, and then an extra word, ``logorrhea,''
which means incoherent talkativeness, Lupur, who was eliminated in
the third round of last year's bee, jumped in the air and screamed
when she learned of her victory this year. She will receive the
$10,000 first-place prize, plus encyclopedias, two airline tickets
and computer software.

`INSTINCT' FAILS IN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL
STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So few big-budget Hollywood movies even try to make an
environmental statement in the process of entertaining us that you
sort of hate to jump on one that does.
</P>
<P>
   But Disney's ``Instinct'' is basically a mess. It's well-acted
by a likable cast and is well-intended, but it misses: It doesn't
come off as the powerful socio-environmental statement it wants to
be.
</P>
<P>
   It is about a yuppie Miami psychiatrist (Cuba Gooding Jr.)
involved in the strange case of a renegade anthropologist (Sir
Anthony Hopkins) who went out of his mind in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While in the midst of a long-term project studying the mountain
gorillas of Rwanda, it seems the good doctor suddenly and
inexplicably went berserk and killed several park rangers.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what happened, and the man can't or won't
speak, but he's been convicted of murder and sent back to the
States to be incarcerated in the criminally insane ward of a
Florida state prison.
</P>
<P>
   The script follows the ambitious young shrink _ who thinks he
can get a best seller out of the case _ as he breaks down the
patient's resistance, gains his confidence and, in stages, learns
what happened (which we see in flashbacks).
</P>
<P>
   It's an ambitious movie that's part ``Spellbound'' psychiatric
detective story, part ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' snake-pit
drama, and part ``Gorillas in the Mist'' environmental parable _
but ultimately it fails to click as any of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins and Gooding give their usual earnest, strong
performances and develop a workable chemistry. But the script, and
Jon Turteltaub's unfocused direction, never allow their
performances to make a devastating emotional point.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the audience is way ahead of the hero in figuring out why
the gorilla-loving doctor killed those park rangers. So we wait the
entire movie for an inevitable environmental atrocity that we just
don't want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Instinct. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. Screenplay by Gerald
DiPego. Cast: Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Donald Sutherland,
Maura Tierney. Touchstone. 120 minutes. Rated R for violence.

JOHN SAYLES AN INDEPENDENT FILMMAKER IN EVERY SENSE OF THE TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Steven Spielberg may be more financially successful
and Martin Scorsese may be more critically acclaimed, but no
director of the generation that has dominated American filmmaking
for the past 20 years is more universally admired than John Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   The even-dozen films he's made since 1980 have made his name
virtually synonymous with filmmaking integrity and independence,
and so many hundreds of young filmmakers have been inspired by his
example that he's truly the Godfather of the American Independent
Film Movement.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, his 12th film, ``Limbo,'' begins its national
theatrical run following its U.S. premiere in the 25th Seattle
International Film Festival, where his career was also honored with
a special in-person tribute, ``An Evening With John Sayles.''
</P>
<P>
   As I sat down to lunch with him earlier that day, I asked him if
it felt a little strange, receiving what amounts to a career
achievement award when he was still more than a year shy of his
50th birthday. Isn't it a bit like attending your own funeral?
</P>
<P>
   A tall, lanky man who _ except for some gray around his temples
_ looks almost exactly as he did the first time he came to Seattle
in 1980 hawking a little film called ``Return of the Secaucus
Seven,'' Sayles conceded there is something slightly ``unsettling''
about the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always that quality about a tribute, isn't there? It
assumes your best is behind you. I guess if I let myself think
about it very hard, or took it seriously, it might be intimidating.
But I just take it as a compliment, and let it go at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's been quite a career. In the '80s, he followed up
``Secaucus'' with a lesbian love story (``Lianna''), a college
romance (``Baby, It's You''), a sci-fi meditation on race relations
(``Brother From Another Planet''), an epic about the American labor
movement (``Matewan'') and a drama about the Black Sox baseball
scandal (``Eight Men Out'').
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, he made an inner-city political drama (``City of
Hope''), a woman's buddy movie (``Passion Fish''), an Irish fairy
tale (``The Secret of Roan Inish''), a murder mystery set on the
Texas border (``Lone Star''), a Spanish-language political drama
(``Men With Guns'') and a Conradian survival story set in Alaska
(``Limbo'').
</P>
<P>
   Each has been a highly personal film with weighty themes done in
a different style with name actors and Hollywood-class production
values; each has been produced outside the studio system (even if
some were financed by studios); each has been, in some way, better
than the last. How has he managed such a feat?
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick to having a movie career is in not losing money. You
can almost always make another film if your last one made a little
money. So I make low-budget movies. `Limbo' was studio-financed
(Sony) but the budget was only $8 million. The studio probably
can't even remember the last time it released a movie that cost
them so little.''
</P>
<P>
   He also credits his creative longevity with the fact that _
unlike the normal, super-stressful, heart-attack-inducing Hollywood
filmmaking ordeal _ making a film is, for him, ``almost always a
good experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I not only work with people I respect, but with people that I
like. That seems to make a big difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles has, in fact, achieved a filmmaking stability that has
few precedents in the modern era. He displays none of the symbols
of movie success. He still lives in Hoboken, N.J., and on his farm
in Upstate New York. He works with the same actors and technicians
again and again. Both ``Secaucus'' (1980) and ``Limbo'' (1999) have
the same producer (longtime companion Maggie Renzi) and star (David
Strathairn).
</P>
<P>
   Another big factor in the Sayles success story _ and one about
which he is less forthcoming _ is that he has made himself the real
``star'' of his pictures. A bit of a ham, he frequently appears in
his own and in other directors' films, and a publicist who handled
one of the earlier films in the '90s told me, ``John never turns
down an interview _ no matter how small the publication.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him about this, he admitted that he did ``somewhere
between 200 and 300 interviews'' for every film he makes, ``and
often deal with a movie I made several years ago, which might just
be opening in Japan or somewhere.'' But he smarted at my suggestion
that he might do it out of some personal vanity. ``I really don't
have any choice,'' he said. ``It's something I have to do. My films
don't get national TV advertising. So I fight for every bit of
attention I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be necessary for his survival, but this amazing
visibility has also helped make him almost as instantly
recognizable a figure to his movie-going generation as Hitchcock
was to an earlier one. And it's helped him create what is
undeniably his greatest asset as an independent filmmaker: his
covenant with his audience. ``John is a great salesman for his
films,'' actress Alfre Woodard once said. ``The honesty of his
films is also evident in his personality. People instinctively
trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   But if this makes Sayles sound like some shrewd movie huckster,
the truth is that he genuinely likes people, and enjoys the
exposure of interviews, festival appearances and public readings as
a relief from the hours, days and months he spends each year cut
off from people. ``I spend an awfully lot of my time just sitting
in front of my word-processor,'' he said. ``The collaborative part
is much more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is any one factor that distinguishes Sayles
from his filmmaking contemporaries, and has made his career unique
in his generation, it is the fact that he is, by nature, much more
of a literary than a film person. The author of numerous articles,
novels (including the National Book Award-nominated ``Union Dues'')
and short story collections, he approaches the filmmaking process,
he once said, ``as Dickens approaches the writing of a novel.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not an amateur film historian, he's never been a film nerd
in the sense of Spielberg or Scorsese, and he freely admits he
``doesn't see that many movies _ though I do tend to catch up at
the end of the year, when they send all those tapes to Academy
members for (Oscar) consideration.'' During a lull in our lunch
conversation, he looked at his watch and rather eagerly asked the
publicist, ``Say, where's a good bookstore in Seattle?''
</P>
<P>
   While his contemporaries are thinking in terms of daring camera
angles or showy sequences that wink at ``The Battleship Potemkin,''
Sayles is invariably struggling with how to tell a particular story
that has captured him. ``Usually an idea just comes to me out of
nowhere, and shapes itself into a story and just won't let me go,
and I think, `What is the best way for me to get rid of this
thing?'
</P>
<P>
   `Limbo' is a good example. It started with the concept of a
fisherman who was the sole survivor of a ship that went down _
which was a true story that someone told me. The idea of this
character feeling responsibility for what happened, and needing
redemption _ naturally got me thinking of (Joseph) Conrad, who I
love. For a while I thought of doing a Conrad story, but decided
that it's impossible to translate him to a modern setting _ at
least I've never seen it done ... His rhythm is somehow too tied to
his own era.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the idea kept working on me, and developed along the lines
of `how people take risks in their lives,' so that I finally had
the characters and story but no (setting). Gradually, I thought of
Alaska, where I'd attended a conference about 10 years ago and
which had seemed to me a place where people go to make a fresh
start. It's also a place in some cultural transition. So it finally
dawned on me that it was a good place to tell this particular story
and give it added depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayles is also a writer who thinks of storytelling more in terms
of character than in plot and action. When I asked him about the
film's puzzling ending, his eyes glassed over and he seemed
disinterested. But when I asked him about the complex relationship
between the mother and daughter characters, he went into an excited
analysis _ clearly he had thought about it a great deal, and
enjoyed verbalizing it _ to the point that it took up a full 10
minutes on my tape.
</P>
<P>
   Critic Roger Ebert, a long-time Sayles fan, has said that, as
much as any filmmaker who has ever lived, Sayles has educated
himself about the ``business'' of film _ financing, production, the
media game _ and used it to customize a career that is a perfect
reflection of himself: his unique literary gifts, his maverick
temperament and a world-view that is, in its heart, both highly
practical and as idealistic as the '60s characters of his ``Return
of the Secaucus Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Still and all, you have to wonder. Why, as he edges the
half-century mark, does he keep doing it? After the success of
``Lone Star'' in 1996, he could have cut a deal with any studio in
Hollywood on his own terms. He could be collecting $10 million fees
making $100 million epics.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he still beating himself to death doing one-hour
interviews with the Ballard (Wash.) Journal and scrapping together
financing for films that will never play the multiplexes of South
Carolina? Isn't he tired of the sheer grind of this process he's
developed for himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very tired. But I do what I do to make the kind of films I
need to make. As (grueling) as it is, it allows me to be as
independent as any filmmaker can reasonably expect to be, and still
have his films seen by a reasonably large number of people. If you
know a better way to reach that end, I'd sure be happy to hear
about it.''

`LIMBO' A TERRIFIC LITTLE GENRE THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Sayles' most endearing quality as a filmmaker may be his
sheer unpredictability. You just never know if the guy's going to
come up with a lesbian romance, an Irish children's story, a slice
of contemporary Texas life, or a Spanish-language drama filmed in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His 12th and latest effort, ``Limbo,'' is yet another huge
geographic and thematic change-of-pace: a moody adventure story set
in Alaska that resonates with environmental undertones and is
filled with delicate character studies, but ends up being a
terrific little genre thriller.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening that establishes an ensemble of small-town
characters and the state of the State, Sayles gradually focuses on
the emerging love story between Donna (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio), a touring saloon singer, and Joe (David Strathairn),
a native Alaskan handyman/ex-fisherman with a past.
</P>
<P>
   When the pair go out on a yacht with Donna's teenage daughter,
Noelle (Vanessa Martinez) and Joe's bad-boy half-brother (Casey
Siemaszko), they're attacked by pirates, and Joe, Donna and Noelle
swim through the icy waters to the safety of a deserted island.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie is a survival story as the makeshift
family is stranded (in limbo, hence the title), with little hope of
rescue, menaced by murderous drug runners, and living in a
dilapidated, abandoned homestead that seems to be haunted by the
spirits of its former occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Some moviegoers will find this film a little too structurally
jagged and open-ended for complete dramatic satisfaction, and
Sayles' legion of fans will probably find it not quite up to the
Olympian standard of ``Lone Star'' (the 1996 film that seems
destined to be regarded as Sayles' masterpiece).
</P>
<P>
   But it's still one of the director's more successful films: an
expert piece of movie craftsmanship that allows us to completely
identify with its characters, and works as a gripping psychological
drama, an eye-filling outdoor adventure and a nail-biting suspense
piece.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Sayles also makes the most of his cast: Mastrantonio
gives her career-best performance as the existential-minded
vocalist; Strathairn has never been more appealing or believable as
a Gary Cooper-ish man of the outdoors; and Martinez is the
embodiment of raging hormones and teenage neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   Working once again with legionary cameraman Haskell Wexler,
Sayles has also captured what may be the movies' eeriest evocation
of Alaska _ a land of economic opportunity, crass exploitation and
a natural environment that's as malevolent and threatening as
anything in a Joseph Conrad novel.
</P>
<P>
   Limbo. Directed, written and edited by John Sayles. Cast: Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio, David Strathairn, Vanessa Martinez, Kris
Kristofferson, Casey Siemaszko. Sony Pictures. 126 minutes. Rated R
for violence.

`I WANT YOU' AS UNSETTLING, BLEAK AS OTHER WORKS BY MICHAEL
WINTERBOTTOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Winterbottom is one of Britain's best young moviemakers.
He ventures into the heart's darkest places and finds compassion
and grace in human frailty and errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butterfly Kiss'' was a slap-in-the-face film full of extremes
that came to a touching conclusion with its violent means to an
end. ``Jude,'' based upon Thomas Hardy's depressing novel,
followed. And Winterbottom found a wider audience with ``Welcome to
Sarajevo.''
</P>
<P>
   We've not seen all of Winterbottom's films in America _ ``Go
Now'' did just that and he has a new film, ``Wonderland,'' that
received praise at the recent Cannes Film Festival. ``I Want You''
was made somewhere in between and has won a regular run here after
playing in the Emerging Masters series of this year's Seattle
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   It has much in common with Winterbottom's other films _ it's as
unsettling and bleak as the rest of his resume and contains some
breathtaking imagery and Super 35 shots that are innovative and
daring experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars the stunning Rachel Weisz as Helen, a hairdresser
in the crumbling seaside town of Farhaven. When the story opens, a
body is dumped in the water. Cut to nine years later. A young man,
Martin (Alessandro Nivola), returns after nearly a decade in prison
for the murder. Helen has become an obsession for not only Martin,
with whom she shares a past _ and a secret _ but also for the local
DJ and a young boy named Honda, who won't speak since finding his
mother's dead body. The quartet tries desperately to connect, but
their differences, past ties and needs are insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Winterbottom integrates the changing demographics of England _
Honda and his sister Smokey are immigrants living on the desolate
shore _ with the failing economy of a country that has long ceased
to be a formidable world power. The pall of better days spreads
over the director's grim view. As the stories merge and Helen's
past is revealed, we see that these are characters who are alone
and isolated in their desires and wants.
</P>
<P>
   As is true with all of Winterbottom's films, he has secured some
of the best acting talent around. He cast Saskia Reeves in
``Butterfly Kiss'' and Kate Winslet, Christopher Eccleston and
Rachel Griffiths in ``Jude.'' In ``I Want You,'' he's given Weisz a
terrific, complex and deceptive role.
</P>
<P>
   While Winterbottom isn't an easy director, his films are so
disturbing, true, imaginative and indelible that we willingly
invest time and suspend disbelief because his characters are never
far from our own lives.
</P>
<P>
   I Want You. Directed by Michael Winterbottom. Written by Eoin
McNamee. Cast: Rachel Weisz, Alessandro Nivola, Luka Petrosic, Ben
Daniels. Gramercy Pictures. 87 minutes. Rated R for nudity,
violence.

TEXAS PROBES DRUG-LINKED MONEY TRANSACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Texas Attorney General's Office is conducting
two dozen investigations into drug money allegedly being laundered
through banks at the rate of almost $7 million a month, a chief
investigator said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The probes were triggered by Texas bankers who alerted federal
officials about financial transactions by some of their customers,
Don Clemmer, chief of the financial crimes section of the office,
said in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmer was in San Antonio to attend the 18th U.S.-Mexico Border
Attorneys General Conference at which money laundering,
cross-border fugitives and dead-beat parents were among the topics
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is part of a pilot program in which U.S. Treasury
Department reports filed by bankers are made available to state
investigators. The reports are filed by bankers who believe
customers may be attempting to skirt federal reporting laws or hide
illegal income.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmer would not say which banks were involved in the state
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides banks, investigators are looking at currency exchanges,
known as casas de cambio, and wire-transfer services often used by
immigrants to send money home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug cartels have developed extensive money-laundering
operations within Texas,'' Clemmer told the attorneys general.
``Texas is like a funnel _ the drugs go out and the money comes
in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While the federal government deals with the international
aspects of money laundering, we deal with the local issues,'' he
said. ``We cannot do anything about money moving through Swiss bank
accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick is for cartels to avoid suspicion as they turn
street-corner profits into seemingly legitimate investments that
can be spent without being scrutinized by law-enforcement
officials, Clemmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important aspect of shutting down a cartel is proving
that the profits are gained illegally, Clemmer said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as the United States and Mexico again clashed
over allegations of drug money being laundered by some of Mexico's
elite.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. intelligence report released this week describes Mexican
billionaire Carlos Hank Gonzalez and his sons as ``a significant
criminal threat to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, the Mexican attorney general, challenged
the United States to share proof the family is involved in any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have any evidence, let us see it,'' Madrazo said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the $7 million in allegedly laundered money marks the
most extensive probe yet by the Texas attorney general's office,
but it is a small percentage of as much as $30 billion a year that
officials allege is laundered through Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cartels have constantly tried to stay a step ahead of the
authorities by finding ways to stash profits.
</P>
<P>
   A recent cartel favorite has been hiding cash in cars and trucks
headed for Mexico. In the past, money has been hidden by disguising
it with wire transfers or as profits form money-exchange houses
which dot the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Once the money is in Mexico, traffickers can place profits in
bank accounts or businesses, slipping it into legitimate financial
circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are crafty, like those mutant strains that develop as you
create medicines,'' said Shane Phelps, chief of the criminal
justice division for the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmer praised Mexico's efforts at fighting drug trafficking
and money laundering: ``The Mexican government has implemented a
comprehensive drug strategy that includes an anti-money-laundering
initiative as well as attempts to increase public awareness of the
drug problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not blame Mexico for cross-border drug trafficking,
telling the meeting of attorneys general: ``If it were not for our
seemingly insatiable appetite for illegal drugs, the cartels would
have a far more difficult time marketing their products.''

GAMBLER'S LUCK, THEN LIFE, RAN OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Retransmiting for clients)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For Dune Lop Moy, an inveterate gambler, 10,000 was an
unlucky number.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many dollars the 27-year-old restaurant worker from
Allston owed a bookie in Boston's Chinatown nicknamed ``Stinky
Mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Moy had gotten into his hole, and tried to dig out, by betting
on football games through local bookies, playing blackjack at
Foxwoods.
</P>
<P>
   But like other struggling workers in the Chinese community who
had become addicted to gambling, Moy was tapped out. Two months
ago, authorities found his beaten body folded and stuffed into a
large green suitcase that had been tossed in the weeds in Weymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the investigation continues, sources familar with the
Chinatown underworld believe that Moy was marked for murder by
Asian organized crime figures, or their mob associates, intent on
sending a chilling message to their customers: Pay your debts or
die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a classical mobster hit,'' said one law
enforcement source. ``Old school.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chinatown, some community leaders say Moy's fate coincides
with a surge in gambling excesses, one they link to ethnic
targeting from the Connecticut casinos on top of the traditional
action at neighborhood underground gaming parlors.
</P>
<P>
   For them, Moy's death is a cautionary tale about compulsive
gamblers: Some have lost their life savings, others have lost their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in the Chinese Progressive Association
newsletter warned: ``A growing number of people (mostly Asian) are
hooked on the Casino. Some even go there every week (if not every
day).''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel Chan of the Boston Chinese Evangelical Church
said he is counseling three married restaurant workers, chronic
players on the verge of losing their homes, who have busted their
family budgets at Foxwoods or Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Like dominoes, Chan said, a compulsive gambler can strain the
finances of 10 other relatives or friends, borrowing money from one
to cover the debt of another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them to stop for the sake of the family,'' said Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Chan and others say the casinos are capitalizing on the affinity
of many Chinese for gambling, which is a part of a number of ethnic
festivities and celebrations. It ranges from youngsters playing
coin-toss games during Chinese New Year to women avidly playing
mah-jongg and men betting in bean-counting contests.
</P>
<P>
   Within a mystical culture that reveres nature, some gamblers may
try to please the spirits by playing certain numbers. Eight, for
example, sounds like the Chinese word for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are targeting Asian clients because they know they are
willing to play the game,'' said Chan.
</P>
<P>
   One casino, Mohegan Sun, has an Asian marketing division.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Lowe, codirector of the progressive association, said
working people such as Dune Moy, who was a regular at the blackjack
tables, are particularly susceptible to come-ons from casinos.
Foxwoods ads beckon at Harrison Avenue and Beach Street. Casino
shuttle buses arrive each day at Kneeland Street. And Mohegan Sun
features Hong Kong entertainers and noodle bars that stay open into
the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   Lonely from laboring long hours in restaurants with little free
time, some men seek companionship with Chinese-speaking friends on
trips to the casinos, where the universal language is winning and
losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make quick money to pay the bills,'' said Chan.
``When they lose, they lose deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Etess, senior vice president of marketing at Mohegan
Sun, said that while ``the Asian domestic market historically has
been a very fertile one for casinos,'' he denied that his business
was exploiting Asian gamblers. Foxwoods marketing officials could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Etess said gamblers who feel they have gone too far are reminded
by casino signs and brochures to call a counseling number. He said
that these messages soon will be translated into Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of our clientele, both of Asian descent and
otherwise, consume our product responsibly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Dune Moy, the odds were against him almost from the start.
</P>
<P>
   He had come to the United States from China and fell into a
dangerous life. Small and bespectacled, Moy drove fast cars and
lingered on the fringes of the underworld with a fast crowd that
included a heroin-sniffing tattooed gaming parlor enforcer, an
extortionist, and a crack dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Moy seemed to be a magnet for trouble, but time and again he
managed to extricate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Caught speeding, he lost his license, but eventually got it
back. When he was arrested for heroin possession in 1994, police
dropped the charges for insufficient evidence. When he was arrested
in a car with crack dealers that same year, prosecutors later let
him go when police could not find the five plastic bags of rock
they'd spotted beside him in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Moy had a major gambling habit. He owed money all over
Chinatown, including thousands to one bookie, said a source. When
he disappeared in late November, Moy's family hoped for the best.
</P>
<P>
   This time, with $10,000 hanging over his head, Dune Moy's luck
had run out.

   WASHINGTON _ First responses in Washington to Belgrade's
reported capitulation were cautious in the extreme. President Bill
Clinton said what the alliance wanted was proof of Serbian
withdrawal before the bombing stops.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. has grown too weary of President Slobodan Milosevic's
promises to take his word at face value. But if initial reports are
borne out, and the Yugoslav parliament's vote suggests for the
first time in three months that they could be, nowhere will the
satisfaction be greater than at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's war, dismissed as a ``coward's war'' and
ridiculed as ``immaculate coercion,'' will have been vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months of the NATO operation in Kosovo Clinton's
was a lone voice. His insistence that the conflict be conducted
from the air and only from the air, and that an air war was
winnable, was denounced, ever more openly, as the irresponsible
reverie of a non-military man.
</P>
<P>
   No one, it was said, had ever won a war from the air alone and
no one would do so now. The consensus against Clinton was broad.
</P>
<P>
   The hopelessness of an air war was advanced periodically by the
Pentagon, even as the military operation was in progress. It was
embraced by a solid body of opposition politicians, chief among
them Senator John McCain, whose credentials as a Vietnam veteran,
former prisoner-of-war and survivor of torture, gave him moral and
military authority.
</P>
<P>
   And it was argued at key junctures in political forums, from
Britain, by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   All argued that air bombardment alone would not force Yugoslav
troops from Kosovo, at which point NATO would have to choose
between mounting what would be, in effect, an invasion of Kosovo or
conceding defeat.
</P>
<P>
   With defeat not an option, either for Washington or for NATO's
credibility, an invasion looked inevitable. The only question _ as
represented with increasing urgency by British ministers in recent
weeks _ was when?
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, the barely disguised view of U.S. generals was
that there had either to be total war, or no war at all.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wanted to prevent Yugoslav leaders from evicting
Kosovar Albanians _ and having failed in that objective, to ensure
their return _ he would have to commit ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The expression ``ground troops'' was always a code for ``ground
troops in a combat capacity.'' It was never the armed peacekeeping
or peacemaking force that Clinton and a majority of NATO countries
favored.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two weeks ago, a U.S. magazine revealed the
existence of a letter to Clinton from the chiefs of staff arguing
for ground troops. The letter had been written before the start of
the military operation, but the timing of the leak appeared to be a
calculated attempt to force Clinton's hand.
</P>
<P>
   General Colin Powell, the hugely respected chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff during the Gulf War, expressed misgivings about the
halfhearted nature of the war, as did former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter. These were supremely influential voices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ignored _ or, as was in fact the case, actually rejected
_ their advice at his peril.
</P>
<P>
   Two considerations underlying Clinton's position, however, were
neglected by his critics. His real options were distinctly limited
and, while his military experience is zero, his political instincts
are second to none.
</P>
<P>
   The choice for Clinton was never between an air war and total
war; it was between an air war and no war at all.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a tiny window in the first week of the
military operation, when the refugee exodus was at its height and
three American servicemen were in Serbian captivity, there was no
public support for a ground war. Congressional support was even
less.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Congress voted Clinton twice as much money for the
NATO operation than he had requested _ except that half of it was
earmarked to make up for what the Republicans regarded as
unwarranted cuts in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also voted not to restrict the U.S. contribution to the
NATO operation. Congress would not, however, give Clinton the
mandate he needed to send U.S. troops into combat. And with public
support for ground troops declining, the deployment of troops in
combat represented a big risk. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the military criticism of Clinton's pursuit of an air
war alone derived from the U.S. experience of the Gulf War. If the
deployment of troops in combat is avoided, this will bear out yet
again the adage that generals are always fighting the last war.
</P>
<P>
   General Powell and others advocated all-powerful air assaults at
the outset, followed up with ground troops. Not stated, but
implied, was also a free rein for the military in determining how
to achieve the desired objective.
</P>
<P>
   Once the expulsion of refugees had begun, as it did within hours
of the first NATO bombardment, the first objective _ to prevent
oppression of Kosovar Albanians was void. The revised objective _
to ``degrade and destroy'' Milosevic's military capacity _ was more
nebulous.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily the operation was also far more complex than in the
Gulf War: the terrain, the weather, the mingling of military and
civilian populations, all dictated different tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The imperative was to retain public support and preserve a
united front within NATO and keep civilian casualties and damage to
the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson from the Gulf War for America was not that ground
troops are required to win a war, but that missiles can now be
finely targeted and civilian casualties largely avoided, along with
casualties among Allied troops. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If NATO ground troops now enter Kosovo not as a force of
invasion, but as enforcers of peace, Clinton will not have
completely rewritten the rules of war _ there could still be
skirmishes and casualties in Kosovo _ but he will have gone a long
way towards defining a new type of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a ``coward's war,'' but it is perhaps the only sort of
war that a squeamish public will support. What is more, it has
worked. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The deal struck Thursday between the two peace envoys and
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic deals a huge blow to Serbia,
but as the analysis of the text shows, it also provides room for
maneuver and parts of it will allow the Yugoslav president to
proclaim a victory of sorts to his people.
</P>
<P>
   1. AN IMMEDIATE AND VERIFIABLE END OF VIOLENCE AND REPRESSION IN
KOSOVO.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Milosevic's generals may yet ignore orders from
Belgrade to stop attacking the Albanians at the very point at which
they have driven most of them out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will be watching keenly for signs of a revolt and will
doubtless fire many of them in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   2. THE VERIFIABLE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL MILITARY, POLICE AND
PARAMILITARY FORCES FROM KOSOVO ACCORDING TO A SPEEDY TIME
SCHEDULE.
</P>
<P>
   This is a disaster for Belgrade. In a province where 90 percent
of the 1.8 million population is hostile, Serbia can only keep a
grip through a massive security presence.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia will try to haggle over the meaning of ``speedy'' and
will try to convert some of its security forces overnight into
members of the local civilian administration. After all, they will
still control the local councils until a new U.N. government for
Kosovo is appointed.
</P>
<P>
   3. THE STATIONING IN KOSOVO, UNDER A U.N. MANDATE, OF EFFECTIVE
INTERNATIONAL, CIVILIAN AND MILITARY PRESENCES THAT COULD ACT IN
LINE WITH A POSSIBLE DECISION ACCORDING TO CHAPTER 7 OF THE U.N.
CHARTER.
</P>
<P>
   Another heavy blow to Belgrade, though Milosevic will try to
conceal it by saying it is better to have a U.N. mandate over
Kosovo _ Yugoslavia is a founder member _ than NATO on its own. The
U.N. involvement will also bring the Russians on board and possibly
some other friendly states.
</P>
<P>
   4. AN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY PRESENCE, WITH FUNDAMENTAL
PARTICIPATION BY NATO, MUST BE PLACED UNDER UNIFIED COMMAND AND
CONTROL AND AUTHORIZED TO MAINTAIN SAFE SURROUNDINGS FOR THE
POPULATION IN KOSOVO AND TO FACILITATE THE SAFE RETURN OF DISPLACED
INDIVIDUALS AND REFUGEES TO THEIR HOMES.
</P>
<P>
   This was the key point for NATO in its talks with Russia which
argued for a separate Russian military presence. The presence in
Kosovo of NATO troops, which Belgrade vowed never to accept, is
especially humiliating for Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo may end up with Russian-controlled zones. But NATO
appears to have eliminated the threat of the ``soft-partition'' of
Kosovo into ``eastern'' and ``western'' blocs.
</P>
<P>
   5. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROVISIONAL ADMINISTRATION FOR KOSOVO
AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL CIVILIAN PRESENCE THAT WOULD BE
DECIDED UPON BY THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL UNDER WHICH THE PEOPLE OF
KOSOVO WOULD ENJOY MEANINGFUL AUTONOMY WITHIN THE FRY (FEDERAL
REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic came to power in 1987 on a pledge to scrap Kosovo's
autonomy, which he then did in 1989. Now he has to stand back and
watch Kosovo receive much greater powers of home rule than it ever
dreamed of enjoying in the old Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will pass over this point, however, and stress the
fact that autonomy is better than independence and that Yugoslavia
and Serbia's internationally recognized frontiers are not going to
be altered.
</P>
<P>
   6. AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL, AN AGREED NUMBER OF YUGOSLAV AND
SERBIAN PERSONNEL WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN IN ORDER TO FULFILL
THE FOLLOWING DUTIES: CONTACT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CIVILIAN
MISSION AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY PRESENCE; MARK MINE FIELDS AND
PARTICIPATE IN CLEARANCE; MAINTAIN PRESENCE AT PLACES OF SERB
NATIONAL HERITAGE; MAINTAIN PRESENCE AT KEY BORDER CROSSING POINTS.
</P>
<P>
   This is the carrot for Serbia and the worst part of the deal for
the Kosovo Albanian refugees. The last thing they want to see is
Serbian officials when they go home.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is doubtless scanning the map of Kosovo marking out as
many places as possible as sites of Serbian heritage, where his
personnel can be stationed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the ``agreed number'' of Serbian officials will be
one of the areas where all Serbia's formidable diplomatic skills
will doubtless be displayed. The West will want the number kept
down to a few hundred; Russia will want more and Belgrade will
strenuously demand thousands.
</P>
<P>
   7. THE SAFE AND FREE RETURN OF ALL REFUGEES AND DISPLACED
PERSONS UNDER THE SURVEILLANCE OF THE UNHCR AND FREE ACCESS FOR
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO KOSOVO.
</P>
<P>
   The ``all'' is what the 800,000 refugees from Kosovo have been
waiting desperately to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials destroyed tens of thousands of Albanians'
documents as they were expelled from the country, to ensure they
did not return. That was apparently a complete waste of time as the
new U.N. administration will issue provisional documents of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia will be hoping its remaining permitted quota of border
officials will have the authority to screen out returning KLA
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   8. A POLITICAL PROCESS GEARED AT ESTABLISHING A PROVISIONAL,
POLITICAL, GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT GUARANTEES MEANINGFUL SELF-RULE
FOR KOSOVO WITH FULL CONSIDERATION OF THE RAMBOUILLET AGREEMENT AND
PRINCIPLES OF SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF THE FRY AND
OTHER STATES IN THE REGION, AS WELL AS DEMILITARIZATION OF THE KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides can claim something in this convoluted formula. The
Rambouillet agreement of March, which the KLA backed and which held
out the prospect of an independence referendum, will only be
``considered.'' That means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA will also bridle at talk of Yugoslavia's territorial
sovereignty and at their disarmament, just as NATO's bombing
campaign has enabled their numbers to climb from 5,000 in March to
about 15,000 today. The KLA will doubtless try to become Kosovo's
new police force.
</P>
<P>
   Meaningful self rule suggests, but does not spell out, free
elections. These ballots will obviously be won by ethnic Albanians,
but which kind? Men loyal to the KLA under Hasim Thaqi, or the old
moderates loyal to Ibrahim Rugova?
</P>
<P>
   9. A GENERAL APPROACH TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND STABILIZATION
OF THE CRISIS REGION. THAT WOULD ENTAIL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
PACT ON STABILITY FOR SOUTHEAST EUROPE WITH BROAD INTERNATIONAL
PARTICIPATION TO ENABLE FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF DEMOCRACY, ECONOMIC
PROSPERITY, STABILITY AND REGIONAL COOPERATION.
</P>
<P>
   A sop to Serbia's disgruntled neighbors, several of whom have
offered their air space to NATO and who have suffered economically
from NATO's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   10. THE END OF MILITARY ACTIVITIES WOULD ENTAIL THE ACCEPTANCE
OF THESE PRINCIPLES AS WELL AS AGREEMENT TO OTHER PREVIOUSLY
IDENTIFIED AND DEMANDED ELEMENTS.
</P>
<P>
   The West is shy of verbal agreements with a master tactician
like Milosevic, so no end to NATO's campaign until the Serbian army
packs up in toto. Belgrade may be hoping pressure will build on
NATO to end the campaign before it has really pulled out of
Kosovo. &QL;

AS DRUG CHOICES GROW, HEALTH EXPERTS WORRY ABOUT LABEL
INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The computer printout that Pat and Ben Christen
picked up along with their son's medicine contained a litany of
warnings: Dry mouth. Constipation. Blurred vision. Drowsiness.
Dizziness. These were just a few of the side effects of the drug
imipramine, which a psychiatrist had prescribed for their
7-year-old son, Cory, who suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Christen had been taking the drug for several months when
his second-grade teacher noticed that his hands were trembling. His
parents checked the warning sheet for guidance, but ``There was
nothing in it,'' Mrs. Christen said. Soon after, while he was
leaning over a school water fountain, Cory collapsed and died.
``His heart just gave out,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy concluded that Cory had overdosed; lawyers for the
Christens and the doctor, who settled a lawsuit with the parents
without acknowledging wrongdoing, disagree on who was responsible.
But experts say Cory's tremors may have been a sign he was getting
too much of the drug: cardiac arrhythmia, a heart-rhythm
disturbance, is a well-known side effect.
</P>
<P>
   Cory's death in his tiny hometown of Weimar, Texas, on Sept. 19,
1996, highlights what drug safety experts describe as a dangerous
flaw in the way consumers are informed of the risks of prescription
medicines. While officials at the Food and Drug Administration will
soon begin requiring standard, easy-to-read labels for all
over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements, the government does
not control the information that patients receive with prescription
medicines, which are typically much more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   That is not for lack of trying. Four years ago, the FDA
announced a plan to require drug manufacturers to publish ``med
guides,'' government-approved patient brochures for prescription
drugs fashioned after the popular ``nutrition facts'' labels on
food. But the plan drew intense opposition from the drug industry
and pharmacists, and Congress rejected it in 1997, deciding that
private companies could do the job better.
</P>
<P>
   As a flood of new prescription medications fills the nation's
pharmacy shelves, however, drug safety experts and FDA officials
are growing increasingly concerned about deaths and injuries from
the drugs that the agency approves. And so on Tuesday the FDA put
into effect a rule allowing it to require med guides for a handful
of especially risky prescription medications, no more than 10 each
year. The precise drugs will be announced later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress specifically said that we could not implement a
comprehensive program, but we felt that there was sufficient
support for us to ensure that people taking these special drugs
were warned,'' said Dr. Nancy Ostrove, the agency official in
charge of the med guides plan. She said the guides ``will become a
signal to consumers that this is a product that you really need to
be careful about.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts in prescription drug safety say the new rule does
not go nearly far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``On boxes of cereal we have a very standard label that tells
the content, and it is the same on every one of them,'' complained
Dr. Lucian L. Leape, a health policy analyst at the Harvard School
of Public Health. ``I don't know why cereal is more important than
medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimate that more than 100,000 hospital patients
each year die of reactions to their medication, and 2.2 million are
injured. At least some of those deaths, Leape and others say, could
be prevented if patients had clear, concise information about how
to use their medication.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of government-approved guides, consumers are left
to rely primarily on computer printouts of the sort the Christens
received. But few people realize that these printouts, called
``patient information leaflets,'' are manufactured by private
companies and are not required by any government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stores distribute the leaflets voluntarily, but not all do
so. And authorities on drug safety complain that the leaflets are
inconsistent; they say the pamphlets vary from pharmacy to pharmacy
and omit information or contain errors that contribute to deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary system is the result of more than two decades of
debate among regulators, the pharmaceutical industry and consumer
advocates about how to provide patients with accurate, complete
information about the risks of prescription drugs. At the crux of
the discussion is a delicate risk-versus-benefit analysis: experts
want consumers to be well-informed about the risks that drugs
carry, but they do not want to scare patients away from taking
medicine that might save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, the FDA tried to require drug companies to
provide written information for consumers, but the plan was quashed
by the Reagan administration. In 1995, Dr. David Kessler, then the
commissioner of Food and Drugs, resurrected the idea with the med
guides plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to pick up a prescription for my daughter the other
day,'' Kessler said in a recent interview. ``There were all these
little stickers on it and they were covering each other and I had
to peel them off. That's no way to provide information.''
</P>
<P>
   But pharmacists complained about the FDA's plan to restrict the
content of the guides to information about government-approved uses
of the drugs. Doctors can prescribe medications ``off-label'' for
any condition; the drug thalidomide, for instance, is commonly used
to treat AIDS but was initially approved only for leprosy. The
FDA's med guides, pharmacists argued, would leave many patients
ill-informed.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers also objected, fearing that they would be
sued if they provided patients with a condensed, simpler version of
the risk information they were already required to give doctors.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Marjorie Powell, a lawyer for a drug industry trade
group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the
manufacturers feared that if the FDA had to approve information
given patients, it would take longer to get new drugs approved.
``We didn't need to convert a commercial program into a
government-run program,'' she said. Congress was sympathetic and
rejected Kessler's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a compromise adopted by the Department of Health
and Human Services: by next year, 75 percent of all prescriptions
must be accompanied by leaflets that contain ``useful''
information; by 2006, the figure must rise to 95 percent. If those
standards have not been met the FDA will be free to propose the med
guides plan again.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The agency is now trying to determine how close the voluntary
system is to meeting the goal. Dr. Ostrove said the agency was
evaluating the leaflets in more than 350 pharmacies in about 10
states, and planned to conduct a larger study next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raymond Woosley, chairman of the pharmacology department at
the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, said a
study he conducted several years ago found that ``a third of the
time people get nothing, and what they do get is often inadequate
or misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Public Citizen published an analysis of the patient
information leaflets for 18 different pain relievers in the class
known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It found that only
one-fourth of the leaflets warned patients to stop the drug if they
experienced abdominal pain, a symptom that can signal serious, and
potentially life-threatening, internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet that Cory Christen's parents were given, for
example, contained no information on serious, lasting side effects
of imipramine.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Moore, a drug safety expert at the George Washington
University Medical Center, said that was not surprising; he said
the leaflets typically leave out information about the most dire
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, it has been left to doctors and pharmacists to
educate their patients about the dangers of prescription drugs. But
with the rise of managed health care, doctors have less time to
talk to their patients. In a 1997 survey of 1,000 patients, the FDA
found that only one-third had received information from their
doctors about the dangerous side effects of drugs they were taking.
Pharmacists, too, say they are often too busy filling prescriptions
to counsel patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, an advocacy organization based in Washington, says
this is all the more reason to have government-approved med guides
for all drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have some backup,'' he said. ``And the backup is a
mandatory patient information leaflet.''
</P>
<P>
   The printout that accompanied Cory Christen's prescription was
produced by Medi-Span Inc. of Indianapolis, one of a number of
commercial vendors that supply computer software to pharmacies.
Citing the lawsuit, the company declined to comment. But Jim Breen,
an official at Medi-Span's parent company, First Databank, said the
guides were ``merely a supplement for the pharmacist,'' and were
not intended to replace the advice of a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Susan Winckler, director of policy and legislation for
the American Pharmaceutical Association, which represents 52,000
pharmacists, acknowledged that her profession could do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to remind our members that we fought the mandate
but they have to do it voluntarily.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As to the quality of the leaflets, she said, ``A lot of them are
good.'' But she added, ``They all should be improving.''

   WASHINGTON _ Helen McLaughlin was 73 when she died from what her
relatives call a mixup in prescription drugs. In death, she joined
a group that is causing increasing anxiety among health care
experts and federal regulators: the tens of thousands of Americans
who are killed each year not by illness, but by medication intended
to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Mrs. McLaughlin, a widow who lived with her two
daughters in Elizabeth, N.J., walked into the pharmacy department
of the local ShopRite supermarket to fill a prescription for
chlorpromazine, an anti-psychotic medication. She walked out,
according to her son Charles and Michael S. Smith, a lawyer who is
suing ShopRite on behalf of her family, with a drug that has a
nearly identical name, chlorpropamide, which is used by diabetics
to lower their blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly serious mistake, the family said. Mrs.
McLaughlin suffered from diabetes, and was already taking
medication for it. She took the new drug in addition to her regular
pills for three weeks when she was admitted to Elizabeth General
Medical Center with dangerously low blood sugar. That, Smith said,
unleashed a cascade of health problems for his mother, including
stomach ulcers and a drug-resistant bacterial infection. She died
on May 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the lawsuit, officials at ShopRite, a subsidiary of
Wakefern Food Corp, declined comment. But Charles McLaughlin, who
works as an ultrasound technician at Montefiore Medical Center in
New York, said he finds it difficult to comprehend that his mother
died from a medication she didn't need, or ask for. ``I work in a
hospital,'' he said. ``I know that errors occur. But on the other
hand there has to be some sort of failsafe system to prevent things
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no failsafe system, a fact that is becoming
increasingly apparent to officials at the Food and Drug
Administration, as well as independent drug safety experts. They
say Helen McLaughlin's death highlights a pervasive and dangerous
problem: with more medications on pharmacy shelves than ever
before, and more prescriptions being written, the nation's health
care system is overwhelmed, creating a growing risk that patients
will be killed or hurt by adverse reactions or mistakes.
Regulators, even after approving a new drug, cannot always predict
all potential side effects, or toxic interactions. Many pharmacists
are overworked, and filling more prescriptions with less help. And
with as many as a dozen medications available for any one ailment,
doctors are having a hard time keeping abreast of FDA warnings
about possible risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many new drugs available. And keeping
current with the information that goes with each drug has become
almost impossible,'' said Dr. Kenneth Kizer, undersecretary for
health at the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Washington. ``The
system is just not designed to help the practitioner.''
</P>
<P>
   The true scope of the problem is unknown, in part because
hospitals and doctors are not required to report it.
</P>
<P>
   But recent studies lead scientists to think that prescription
drugs are killing and injuring far more people than previously
believed, and experts estimate two-thirds of the deaths and
injuries could be prevented. Last year, a study in the Journal of
the American Medical Association estimated that 106,000 hospital
patients die and 2.2 million are injured each year by adverse
reactions to prescription drugs, not including cases where errors
are involved. The estimate was the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, in 1995, Dr. Lucian Leape, a health policy
analyst at the Harvard School of Public Health, found that 6.5
percent of patients at two teaching hospitals in Boston had been
injured by their medicines, and one third of these cases involved
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials are convinced the danger is growing. In a recently
released 150-page report, they called for pharmacists, doctors,
hospitals and drug companies to work together to create ``a new
framework'' for cutting down on the risks from the drugs the agency
approves. On Tuesday, meanwhile, the FDA put a new rule into
effect: requiring the manufacturers of some especially risky drugs
to distribute explicit warning pamphlets to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being harmed and some of the harm is preventable,''
said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research. ``All of these things are raising alarm
bells in people's minds that there is a potential for even more
serious problems. And the problem is pretty serious right now.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESSURES So Many Drugs, So Little Time
</P>
<P>
   That medications pose a public health threat is, in a sense,
testimony as much to medicine's success as its failure. As Leape
put it, ``Adverse drug events are a disease of medical progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical manufacturers are discovering new ways to treat
more diseases and conditions, from impotence to diabetes. The FDA,
long criticized as moving too slowly on drug applications, is now
approving products at a record-setting pace. And patients are
living longer with illnesses that could not be treated before.
</P>
<P>
   More prescriptions are being written, not only because there are
more drugs but because the population is aging; the elderly take
more than one third of all drugs that are prescribed. In 1992,
according to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, 2.03
billion prescriptions were dispensed in retail pharmacies; by last
year, the figure was up to 2.78 billion. By the year 2005, the
association estimates, it will be 4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacies, pressed like other health care providers by the cost
controls of managed care, are struggling to fill the higher volume
of prescriptions in less time, and with less help. ``I worked
12-hour days, and if you get to the bathroom once a day, you're
fortunate,'' said Adle Joseph, a pharmacist at the Leesburg
Pharmacy in Leesburg, Va., who spent 35 years with the Rite Aid
chain before retiring last year to join a slower-paced, independent
store. ``The conditions are just not conducive to good safety.''

LABOR LEADERS QUIZ GORE ON TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEMBROKE, N.H. _ Trying to nail down one of the most important
Democratic constituencies, Vice President Al Gore met privately
Thursday with New Hampshire labor leaders, hoping to allay their
fears that international trade agreements would lead to US job
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been a forceful proponent of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which eliminated tariffs among the United States,
Mexico, and Canada, but critics said it exported US jobs to
low-wage Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 members of the New Hampshire AFL-CIO questioned Gore
for nearly an hour about trade and labor issues, including
privatization, school construction, and Social Security. The
questioning was polite and friendly, according to those inside the
room, unlike other union meetings at which Gore has encountered
outright hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the AFL-CIO is not expected to make a decision until
late summer or early fall about endorsing either Gore or Bill
Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, for the Democratic
presidential nomination. Organized labor is a critical component in
New Hampshire, where union members are numerous and often
participate in campaigns. But union endorsements aren't a guarantee
of votes by the rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   While some members of organized labor have expressed unhappiness
with Gore's advocacy of free trade, Bradley espouses similar views
and voted for NAFTA while in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA never really went away, and it's fresh in people's
minds,'' said Mark MacKenzie, president of the New Hampshire
AFL-CIO. ``We want to know where people stand on trade.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie said several hundred workers lost jobs in the state
shortly after the trade agreement went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   International trade is the most controversial issue among union
members when it comes to the two presidential candidates. ``Neither
Bradley or Gore, in terms of the steelworkers, are good on the
trade issue,'' said Bill Klinefelter, legislative director of the
United Steelworkers of America, based in Washington. ``We have
opposed NAFTA, they both supported NAFTA. We opposed granting
fast-track authority for negotiating trade agreements, Gore
supported that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Klain, Gore's chief of staff, said disagreement between the
vice president and organized labor is a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes pursuing fair-trade agreements creates jobs in
this country,'' Klain said. Gore argued that very point Thursday,
saying that trade helps US businesses and workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the AFL-CIO in Washington, Peggy Taylor, the director of
legislation, recently compared Gore's and Bradley's voting records
in the Senate _ an analysis that will probably be used by the
unions in the endorsement process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has a consistently better voting record,'' Taylor said.
``Bradley actually has a worse trade voting record than Gore. . . .
Most of Gore's wrong votes are in the trade area as well, but there
aren't as many as with Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also described organized labor's relationship with
Bradley as ``distant,'' and said there had been some frustration
with the present administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a serious trade tension between us and the
administration, and that's not to be minimized,'' Taylor said.
``But there's also been a huge amount of positive work from the
administration on behalf of working families.
</P>
<P>
   Another pressing trade matter concerns China, as Congress is
about to consider renewing normal trading relations with that
country. Gore said during an interview on WMUR-TV, ``We deal with
China with our eyes wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the United States has an interest in being involved
with China because it is the world's largest country ``and we don't
want to shoot ourselves in the foot in the process of expressing
anger about something else altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the United States will insist on human rights changes
in China and the respectful treatment of Tibet as normal trade
relations are reauthorized.

 WASHINGTON: good safety.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Washington state, for instance, an investigation turned up
numerous prescription errors and lax safety procedures at Rite Aid
stores last year; documents provided by the state Board of Pharmacy
show that pharmacists complained that ``long work hours and
inadequate staffing'' contributed to their mistakes. The company
said only a few of the errors posed any danger to patients; it
settled the administrative charges with a $50,000 payment and
promised to make sure its procedures follow state law.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, too, are overloaded. Two decades ago, physicians
familiarized themselves with a relatively small pharmacopeia and
prescribed the same drugs again and again. Today, the choice of
medicines rests not only with doctors, but also with managed care
companies, which buy drugs in bulk to reduce costs and list them on
formularies that can change each month.
</P>
<P>
   At the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Providence,
R.I., Dr. Jeannette Chirico-Post, the hospital's chief of staff,
says she is concerned about how complicated prescribing drugs has
become. ``We have more drugs at our fingertips,'' she said, ``and
the potential for drug-drug interaction is far greater than we saw
10 or 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And while computer technology is available to help physicians
avoid mistakes and screen for dangerous combinations of drugs, few
hospitals and even fewer private doctors have it. Those that do say
the systems can produce so many false alarms they are nearly
impossible to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using medications in ways that we never used them
before,'' said Michael Cohen, president of the Institute for Safe
Medication Practices, a nonprofit organization investigates
prescription drug errors. He said the mistake in Mrs. McLaughlin's
case could have been avoided with clearer labeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical companies aren't keeping up with the times and
labeling their products as safely as they need to,'' he said. ``We
haven't developed the technology to prevent patient harm or we are
not incorporating it, because we say it's too expensive. We are not
investing the resources that we need to protect patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Sanchez lost his life for lack of such safeguards. He was
born healthy on Oct. 15, 1996, in a community hospital in a Denver
suburb. His mother had a history of syphilis; a neonatologist
prescribed a long-acting form of penicillin to keep the baby from
becoming infected. But a series of mistakes, uncovered by Cohen's
institute, which examined the death at the hospital's request, took
the newborn's life.
</P>
<P>
   A pharmacist misread the doctor's handwriting and delivered 10
times the proper dose, leading the nurses to confuse the medicine
with a newer generation of drugs that are administered differently.
Miguel's medication, a milky white suspension, was supposed to be
injected in the thigh muscle; typically, only clear liquids are
given in the veins. But the baby's nurses worried that such a huge
injection into a muscle would hurt the tiny infant. To complicate
matters, some new opaque suspension drugs had been approved by the
government for intravenous use. The nurses checked two medical
texts to see if the drug could be given intravenously, and found no
warnings against it. So they injected Miguel's penicillin into a
vein in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   The baby had a heart attack and died an hour later. ``It was
devastating,'' said Pat McCadden, the risk manager at Centura St.
Anthony North Hospital in Westminster, Colo., where Miguel spent
his brief life. ``Everybody had a hard time believing this could
happen, because these were very knowledgeable, experienced
nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ERRORS: Medication Threat Often Lies in Use
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of ways that people can be killed or injured
by their medicine. Outright mistakes, as occurred with Miguel, are
one; some experts say these medication errors account for a third
to one half of all cases. Known side effects, including dangerous
interactions between drugs, are another. Unforeseen side effects,
which do not turn up in testing but become apparent after a drug
comes into widespread use, are a third.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, these are known as ``adverse drug events,'' and in
recent months, the Food and Drug Administration has been troubled
by a string of them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Posicor, a high blood pressure medicine, was withdrawn from
the market last year, but not because the drug was harmful on its
own. Rather, Posicor became lethal in combination with a long list
of other drugs, so many that the FDA felt that doctors and
consumers could not keep abreast of the risks. FDA officials said
that 24 people taking Posicor in the 11 months it was on the market
had died, and that two or three of those deaths were directly tied
to Posicor, although a spokeswoman for Roche Laboratories of
Nutley, N.J., the drug's maker, has said ``no causal link'' was
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   _ The diabetes drug Rezulin, approved two years ago, can cause
liver damage, which prompted the FDA to issue repeated warnings to
doctors to closely monitor patients taking it. But an agency
investigation found that doctors were not listening; only 2.7
percent of patients taking Rezulin for three months were being
monitored according to the agency's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in March, the FDA and Rezulin's manufacturer,
Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains,
N.J., agreed that 43 people had suffered acute liver failure that
was possibly due to the drug; of these, 28 died. A panel of
independent scientific experts has recommended that the drug be
prescribed only to patients who do not respond to other therapy.

 WASHINGTON: other therapy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ The best-selling arthritis drug Celebrex, which was approved
by the FDA in January and has already been prescribed to more than
2 million people, is repeatedly being confused by doctors and
pharmacists with two other drugs: Cerebyx, an anti-seizure
medication, and Celexa, an antidepressant. The FDA has already
received 41 reports of the wrong prescription being filled; in one,
an 81-year-old woman wound up taking two antidepressants for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any serious injuries, thank goodness,'' said
Dr. Jerry Phillips, the FDA official who keeps tabs on medication
errors, referring to Celebrex. He is trying to persuade Monsanto
Co., which manufactures the drug, to change Celebrex's name, a
difficult task given that the company has spent tens of millions of
dollars advertising and promoting the medication.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Phillips said, the FDA is planning to install
computer software that will analyze proposed drug names to avoid
such confusion in the future. But at least one expert, Leape of
Harvard, said the agency should have taken that step years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA has essentially focused on the safety of the product,
whereas the major threat has to do with safety of use and misuse,''
Leape said. ``Their point of view has been that it is safe and
effective when used as directed, and the directions are on the
label, so read it. We have come to them repeatedly and said, `That
is not enough.' People make mistakes, even when it is all there.'''
</P>
<P>
   THE DRUG STORES: Pharmacists Tell Tales of Overwork
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one in health care is as acutely aware of the
potential harm of prescription drugs than pharmacists. Yet
pharmacists say little attention is paid to the difficulties they
face in today's complex health care environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Leesburg Pharmacy is a case in point. On a warm and sunny
afternoon recently, half a dozen patients were lined up behind the
counter waiting for their prescriptions to be filled; others milled
about the store. A series of bins with prescription slips and
medications formed a queue along the green formica countertop. All
told, 49 prescriptions were in one stage or another of preparation.
``And this is a slow day,'' said chief pharmacist Greg Chase,
</P>
<P>
   Leesburg is an independent pharmacy and, like pharmacies around
the nation, its profits are being squeezed by lowered
reimbursements from managed care companies. So it makes up the
difference in volume. The store fills about 300 prescriptions per
day, a 50 percent increase from three years ago, according to its
owner, Bruce Roberts. He said that leaves little time for
pharmacists to talk to patients about how to take their medication,
something experts say is essential if drugs are to be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medications have become much more complex, and the
interactions among these complex drugs is greater than it was in
years gone by,'' Roberts said. ``With managed care and pharmacists
being stretched to the limit, there is just no way that you can
provide the service that we really need to be able to educate the
populace as to the dangers of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roberts is trying. He has set up a private consultation
counter for patients who have questions. He has purchased a robot,
at a cost of $175,000, that can dispense the 200 most commonly
prescribed medications, a system that not only frees up pharmacists
to do more counseling but can also cut down on mistakes. And he has
diversified, selling gifts and offering lactation consulting and
other services so that he can afford the salaries of his three
full-time pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   That is a relief to Chase; he came to Leesburg Pharmacy two
years ago from a chain drug store, CVS, where three pharmacists
filled 600 prescriptions per day and often worked 12 hours straight
to do it. ``You've gone four to five hours without even a chance to
go to the restroom,'' he said, echoing the complaints of his
colleague, Joseph, who previously worked at the Rite Aid chain.
``Your mind is fried.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at CVS Pharmacy, which owns 4,100 drug stores in the
United States, and Rite Aid Corp., which owns 3,800 stores, said
they have no evidence that more mistakes are being made. But they
are concerned about workplace pressures, and are taking a number of
steps, including greater use of robots, to ease the burden. As
members of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the
companies are also sponsoring research by a University of
Cincinnati psychology professor who is examining ways to reduce
pharmacy errors.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Tony Grasha, said in an interview that mistakes
occur when psychosocial factors, such as stress at home, combine
with a higher workload. He said his studies show errors are rare,
about 0.5 percent of all prescriptions filled, and that those that
pose a danger to patients are rarer still. But, he said, with the
number of prescriptions growing, mistakes are serious concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tiny fraction percentage-wise,'' he said, ``but when
you are filling 3 billion prescriptions a year and are anticipating
4 billion by the year 2005, then even a very small percentage is a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state pharmacy officials are also worried. In addition to
the action against Rite Aid in Washington state, officials in North
Carolina are trying to force drug stores to cut back on
pharmacists' hours and to require lunch and bathroom breaks in an
effort to improve safety.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Board of Pharmacy has also decided that when
a pharmacist who fills more than 150 prescriptions in a day makes
an error, both the pharmacist and the store will be held liable,
and face a possible license suspension or revocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our discipline actions are going up,'' said David Work, the
board's executive director, ``and errors are a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers are an important part of the pharmacy safety net, but
they have limitations. When Chase typed in the name of a
23-year-old patient who had been prescribed an anti-psychotic
medication, his computer issued a warning that the drug could be
dangerous in combination with another prescription in the patient's
file.

 WASHINGTON: patient's file.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the system presumes that a patient goes to the same pharmacy
every time. And the computers raise so many red flags, without
distinguishing the serious from the benign, that pharmacists grow
weary of them and start to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rite Aid case in Washington, one pharmacist dispensed a
drug with instructions for the patient to take triple the proper
dose, an order that, state officials said, would have resulted in a
computer alert. The message was apparently ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like crying wolf,'' said Susan Winckler, director of
policy and legislation for the American Pharmaceutical Association,
which represents 52,000 pharmacists. ``Some pharmacists call it
`the right hand syndrome.' You just hit the return key when you see
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, said most
pharmacy computer systems need serious improvement. In a recent
study, he asked 307 hospital pharmacies to fill 10 different drug
orders that had killed patients in 1998. Some contained an
overdose. Others called for two drugs that were deadly in
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were outrageous,''he said. Only four of the 307
pharmacies detected all 10 unsafe orders.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTIONS: Easing the Burden With Technology
</P>
<P>
   Deaths and injuries from drugs are vastly underreported, experts
say, in part because doctors fear civil lawsuits or, worse,
prosecution. When Miguel Sanchez died, Adams County, Colo.,
District Attorney Bob Grant brought charges of criminally negligent
homicide against three nurses who cared for the baby. Two pleaded
guilty in exchange for two years' probation; another was acquitted
at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They failed to perceive a substantial risk that the death of a
child would occur,'' Grant said. ``That's criminal negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen disagrees; in the wake of Miguel's death, he said, he
uncovered 54 procedural shortcomings that contributed to the
mistakes that killed the boy, from a hospital pharmacist who lacked
training in how to properly dose drugs for infants to unclear
labeling on the syringe to the textbooks that lacked crucial
warnings. Had any of the 54 been corrected prior to Miguel's birth,
he said, the baby might be alive today.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCadden, the hospital's risk manager, acknowledged the
flaws and said that, under Cohen's guidance, the hospital had taken
a variety of steps: ``Any medication going to the nursery is now
checked by two pharmacists. Two nurses in the nursery will also
double-check the medication.'' The hospital also hired a pediatric
pharmacist, ordered new textbooks and conducted educational
sessions for its staff. And Ms. McCadden, along with the three
nurses, have told their story to other hospitals and at
conferences, in an effort to educate other professionals. ``We've
done a lot of talking,'' Ms. McCadden said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the health care system can be designed to minimize
mistakes and drug dangers is one that has been promoted heavily by
Leape. He said, ``Errors are symptoms of a sick system, not a sick
person. Humans make mistakes. To the extent you can redesign around
that, you can get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, the FDA could require pharmaceutical
companies to standardize their drug labels for easy reading.
Medicines could come with bar codes, so that pharmacists could use
scanners to check for the correct name, the same way a grocery
store clerk scans a jar of pickles. Doctors could trade their
prescription pads in for computers.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas are beginning to catch on in some unlikely places.
Two years ago, Kizer of the VA launched a major patient safety
initiative designed, in part, to minimize prescription drug errors
at the nation's 172 veterans hospitals and clinics. Over the next
two years, the department intends to spend $40 million on
technology that will allow doctors to use computers to write their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Providence,
R.I., a stately brick building that, from the outside at least,
looks anything but high-tech, the results are already in evidence.
Here, doctors still walk around with prescription pads in their lab
coat pockets, but only out of habit. They haven't used them since
December, except to prescribe narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   A computer terminal is in every examining room. Wireless
portable units (the hospital has installed optic fiber cables in
the ceiling) are on rolling carts in the hospital corridors. When a
doctor enters a prescription into the computer, it is checked and
double-checked. The machine rejects spelling errors, or overdoses,
and scans the patient's medical record for potentially dangerous
interactions with drugs prescribed by other doctors. The computer
then sends the order electronically to the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis of a similar system at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, Leape found that medication errors were reduced
by 80 percent. But hospitals have been slow to get rid of
prescription pads; according to Cohen, 12 percent of the nation's
hospitals have the capability for computerized prescription
writing, but only 6 percent use it.
</P>
<P>
   That is in part because not all doctors are enthusiastic about
it. When Dr. Chirico-Post, the chief of staff at the Providence VA,
announced that her hospital would be among the first in the
Veterans Health Administration to switch to computers, some doctors
complained that they didn't know how to type. Others argued it
would take too much time. And even those who like the system say it
has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dawna Blake, chief of the hospital's primary-care practice,
said she welcomes the warnings the system issues when she is
writing a prescription. ``It gives you a lot of nice reminders,''
she said. But, she said, the machine does slow her down; she still
takes patient notes by hand, and then enters them into the computer
at the end of the day. ``I can't sit there and enter my notes when
the patient is in the room,'' she said. ``To me, that's a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments did not deter Dr. Chirico-Post. With a hospital
pharmacy filling more than 500,000 drug orders for inpatients each
year, and another 500,000 outpatient prescriptions, she said, the
potential for errors and dangerous interactions is too great to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of working in the operating room,'' she said,
''dispensing a drug, giving a drug to the patient, is one of the
most dangerous things we do.'' &QL;

MOTHER WON'T LET SON'S MEMORY DIE 
</HEADLINE>

 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ding Zilin still cannot talk about June 4, 1989,
without crying. Her teenage son was one of hundreds of people slain
10 years ago Friday when Chinese troops used tanks and guns to
eject protesters from Tiananmen Square. But unlike most Chinese,
pressed or lulled into silence about the quashing of the democracy
movement, Ding has devoted her life to restoring the memory of that
day.
</P>
<P>
   Ding's son, Zhang Jielian, a high school senior, volunteered to
stand sentry that night outside the square to protect the college
students, who were leading the protests, from advancing troops. His
mother now lives by the words hand-printed on his signboard when he
was shot: ``If you are killed, we are still here.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Ding has converted Zhang's room into a shrine, a
reminder of her loss and that of thousands of other families whose
relatives were killed or imprisoned during the extensive crackdown
on reform-minded students, and on the laborers, civil servants, and
others who crowded the streets to support and shield them.
</P>
<P>
   ``During these 10 years, more than 3,000 days, every day I am
missing my lost son. I think this torture will not stop till the
end of my life,'' Ding said, crying. ``He was only 17. He didn't
even live to get the right to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have tried to make sure that Friday's anniversary
will pass without disruption:They have rounded up at least 60
dissidents, boarded up Tiananmen Square for renovations, censored
news on the Internet and pager services, and blocked Cable News
Network and other foreign channels that are likely to air stories
commemorating the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   But Ding, 62, says repression cannot stop relatives of victims
from mourning and demanding that the Communist Party take
responsiblity for turning the People's Liberation Army against its
own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see that Li Peng,'' the former Communist Party premier
who ordered martial law in 1989, ``can go to Western countries and
shake hands with leaders as if this never happened, I feel
terrible. . . . He should be held responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ding has tracked down 160 families who lost relatives and 70
people who were injured that night, but was stopped by authorities
from finishing her search. Like many witnesses, analysts, and
doctors who treated victims, Ding believes that the true number is
several hundred, possibly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Ding and other victims' relatives filed suit against
the government, seeking reparations. Every year, she has marked the
anniversary with letters to authorities demanding an investigation
of the killings, a complete list of victims, compensation, and a
reversal of the official verdict on the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Her demands have gone unanswered. Instead, she was forced to
retire in 1995 as a professor of aesthetics at People's University
and has not been allowed to lecture or publish in China. She has
been under house arrest since March 3, presumably to keep her from
publicly commemorating the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Ding is an unlikely thorn in the side of
authorities. She joined the Communist Party in 1960 and was a loyal
follower, even after she became a victim of its ideology. During
the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, she was one of countless
intellectuals persecuted, yet even then, she said, ``I believed in
the propaganda. I never doubted the Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for Ding to see her only child turn against the
party in which she had such faith. It was harder still for her to
imagine that the party would crush people favoring reasonable
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was really worried when the military came to Beijing''
after martial law was declared May 20, 1989, ``but I told him that
high-ranking party officials said the military is not against the
civilians. I told him if they wanted to kill you, I wouldn't be a
member of the Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son was killed as soldiers swept down the Avenue of
Everlasting Peace on their way to clear Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she said, she has come to realize that the bloody
crackdown ``was not an accident, but a result of the system of the
Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, however, that party has managed to improve
most people's standard of living, and has persuaded a new
generation to replace dreams of democracy with blind nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jiang Qisheng, a June 4th student leader, believes the
hopes of 1989 remain in most people's hearts, even if the courage
to pursue them does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common people are cautious about speaking out or standing up
because of the nightmare of 10 years ago,'' said Jiang, who wrote a
petition urging a June 4th candlelight vigil before he was taken
away by police last month. ``But if they finally decide to stand
up, then big things will happen in China.''

 &HT;    Atlanta seeks new international image
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau wants to
boost the city's image as an international destination.
</P>
<P>
   The ACVB will team with its counterparts in Cincinnati and New
York, and with Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, to sponsor a trade
show targeting 120 of the largest European meeting and convention
planners.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year for the trade show, Gateway Showcase,
which will be held Sept. 17-19 at the Atlanta Merchandise Mart.
Cincinnati and New York will host the event in subsequent years.
Those cities and Atlanta are Delta's three major gateways from
Europe _ with more than 250 trans-Atlantic flights weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Howard, vice president of public relations and tourism,
said groups that have not traditionally held meetings in the United
States and international conglomerates with a significant Georgia
or U.S. presence are being tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of educating them to just how easy and
convenient Atlanta is as a meeting city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of international visitors has risen over the
years, Atlanta still pales by comparison to other major cities.
Howard estimates that 800,000 overseas visitors come to the metro
area annually. That compares to about 5 million in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says to us that we haven't scratched the surface,''
Howard said. ``Once you get past New York, San Francisco, Boston
and Washington, D.C., then market share really drops off
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Reis, executive vice president of New York-based Allied
Tours, said while Atlanta has its pluses, it remains ``a secondary
city'' for foreign business and leisure travelers.

MILITIA LINKED TO ISRAEL QUITS AN ENCLAVE IN LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR HOUNA, Lebanon _ Tanks and armored personnel carriers from
an Israeli-backed militia rumbled through this town in darkness
early Thursday to complete a retreat from the Jezzin enclave, a
mountainous, battle-scarred swath of southern Lebanon the militia
had held for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal from Jezzin was greeted with guarded relief by
many residents, who had found themselves caught in an increasingly
bloody crossfire as the militiamen of the South Lebanon army
battled Hezbollah guerrillas on Israel's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also signs of deep uneasiness among the
predominantly Christian population. Many regarded the Lebanese
militia as their protector from Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim force,
which showed its military strength overnight by attacking the
departing convoy with roadside bombs, mortars and machine-gun fire
as it wound along a narrow mountain road.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, the burned-out, overturned remains of at least
three militia tanks destroyed on that road in the last two days
served as evidence of what was clearly a perilous retreat. Among
the several hundred members of the Israel-backed force that fled
Jezzin, at least two militiamen were killed during the move
southward to the relative safety of an Israeli occupation zone that
begins just south of this village.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of Jezzin said Thursday that they wanted the
Lebanese army to be sent to the enclave to fill the void left by
the departing militiamen. But Lebanon's prime minister said he
would not take that step, because to insert Lebanese forces into
the area might crimp Hezbollah's efforts to oust Israeli forces
from the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to protect the Israeli occupiers from the
resistance action, and the army's presence might do so
unintentionally,'' the prime minister, Salim Hoss, said in an
interview in Beirut. Instead, he said, he would ``intensify'' the
presence in Jezzin of the Lebanese police.
</P>
<P>
   In another rebuff to residents of the enclave, Hoss said Lebanon
would not grant amnesty to some 200 militiamen who stayed behind
Thursday as their colleagues fled, and who have said they intend to
surrender to the government. All could be charged with treason.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the newly retired militiamen were waiting nervously in
Jezzin to see when and how they might be taken into custody, while
mothers like Odette Abu Zeid complained to reporters that their
sons did not deserve such a fate. In a town that was under South
Lebanon army control, Mrs. Abu Zeid said, her two sons, now 20 and
18, had had little choice but to accept an Israeli paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Jezzin, it was a matter of either the boys' carrying a gun
and putting food on the table or getting kicked out of town,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The militiamen who withdrew overnight from Jezzin, a 35-square
mile enclave that lies north of an Israeli occupation zone, had
positioned themselves Thursday morning on a hilltop just south of
Kfar Houna, within the relative safety of the heavily fortified
border strip.
</P>
<P>
   The militia commander, Gen. Antoine Lahd, had ordered the
pullout on grounds that the heavy toll imposed by Hezbollah attacks
had made the Jezzin enclave too dangerous. As his forces prepared
their pullout late Wednesday, they were assisted by Israeli
aircraft, which circled the skies above Jezzin.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal has been described by many as a possible test run
for a full-scale Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, which
Israel's prime minister-elect, Ehud Barak, has promised will take
place within a year. But the fact that Lebanon has not responded to
the militia's retreat by sending its army to Jezzin is likely to be
interpreted as a cautionary sign by Israeli politicians, who have
said a withdrawal from southern Lebanon would need to be
accompanied by security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, and Syria, its patron, have said any Israeli withdrawal
should be unilateral, without any such preconditions. Hoss refused
to say what steps Lebanon might take if Israeli forces did leave,
but he offered a staunch defense of Hezbollah's right to continue
its campaign to drive Israeli forces out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Israelis occupy Lebanese territory, they will be
exposed to resistance action,'' he said. Hoss said he regarded the
withdrawal of the South Lebanon army from Jezzin as ``very
positive,'' but he called the move ``an isolated case'' unlikely to
be followed by an Israeli withdrawal.

 &HT;    Crew was aware of storm, reports say
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Air traffic controllers warned the crew of
American Airlines Flight 1420 that a powerful thunderstorm was
spawning dangerous wind shears near the runway in the moments
before Tuesday's deadly crash, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the approach, there were two wind shear alarms that
were dispatched to the pilot,'' said National Transportation Safety
Board member George W. Black. ``About the time of the accident, the
most intense part of the storm was beginning to enter the
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather reports showed sustained winds near 50 mph as the jet
approached Little Rock National Airport, while a gust of 87 mph
roared through minutes after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations renewed questions about why a veteran airline
pilot would choose to land his jet in such weather. Federal safety
officials refused to speculate about whether the pilot erred in
making the landing, although they admitted they may eventually
conclude that pilot error was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a conclusion after our investigation is
complete, but the process may take a year,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80 aircraft, inbound from Dallas with 139 passengers and
six crew members on board, skidded off the runway, struck a light
tower, broke into pieces and burst into flames as it landed about
11:51 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people were killed and dozens were injured. More than 30
people were hospitalized, with five in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included pilot Richard Buschmann, a 20-year American
Airlines veteran who lived in Chicago, and seven people from
Arkansas, five of them returning from a European tour to their home
in Russellville.
</P>
<P>
   The final victim was from San Jose, Calif., according to a
Little Rock television station.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were relieved to confirm that 13 passengers who
initially were unaccounted for after the crash had been located
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Safety investigators have not yet interviewed the first officer,
Michael Origel, who suffered a broken leg. They hope to talk to him
today to get a more thorough understanding of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Weather is clearly the focus of the investigation, along with
the crew's decisions and their possible fatigue. Both pilots had
been on duty for more than 13 hours Tuesday, completing several
segments before their scheduled final run to Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   American's regulations require pilots to stop flying after 14
work hours in one day.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of thunderstorms and wind shears _ powerful bursts of
wind that can quickly change directions _ have long been known to
pilots, but took on new importance after a 1985 Delta crash in
Dallas that was blamed on the winds.
</P>
<P>
   Airports have installed sophisticated detectors that issue wind
shear alarms, and new, advanced Doppler radars enable ground
controllers to more precisely pinpoint the location and intensity
of storms.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock's airport has Doppler radar, but not the most
powerful new version that has been installed at busier airports,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the conditions, the final decision on landing is always
left to the pilot, Black said. Control tower personnel simply relay
ground weather readings to help pilots make their decisions, but
cannot order aircraft not to land, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear Buschmann knew the weather near the Little Rock
airport was deteriorating, and that an intense storm was
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   According to several news reports, Buschmann asked to change
runways as he approached, moving to the only runway at Little Rock
that is equipped for instrument-only landings.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot initially tried to bring the jet down visually, but
lost sight of the runway as he approached and asked to switch to an
instruments-only landing, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, investigators backtracked the jet's skid marks from
its final resting spot near the Arkansas River back up the runway.
They found the jet initially hit the tarmac about 2,000 feet from
the approach end of the 7,200-foot runway, which is considered
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are studying the runway's condition to determine
whether rain from the heavy downpour was draining too slowly. There
is a chance the jet hydroplaned on the wet surface, its wheels
unable to grip just like a car does on a wet road, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Once it touched the pavement, the jet veered to the right, then
veered to the left, then roared onto a grassy swale beside the
runway. It eventually ran off the runway's end, striking a lighting
tower that spun the craft around and broke it into three large
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dead appeared to have been seated on the left side
of the plane, as was pilot Buschmann. The first class cabin was
sheared away at the aisle, with passengers seated on the right side
surviving and those seated on the left simply disappearing out the
gaping hole created by the collision, survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a huge chunk of the plane taken away,'' said Jason
Klamm, who was sitting on the right in first class with his father
as they returned from a trip to Seattle to see his favorite
baseball player, Ken Griffey Jr. ``It seemed like it took the
passengers on the left side of the first class cabin with it.''
</P>
<P>
   While press reports cited Buschmann's sterling record as a
pilot, noting that he complied nearly 10,000 hours flying for
American, at least one safety official believes the evidence is
pointing toward pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is mounting evidence that the crew may have attempted to
beat the thunderstorm to the airport, which is a dangerous thing to
do,'' said Jim Burnett, former chairman of the NTSB. ``It's like
trying to beat a locomotive to a crossing.

CHINESE TIGHTEN CONTROL OF CURRENCY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ Chinese authorities announced Thursday that they were
tightening control over international transfers of the yuan, the
nation's currency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the news rekindled fear in international markets that a
long-discussed devaluation of the yuan was coming, the central
bank, the People's Bank of China, quickly denied such plans.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has repeatedly promised not to devalue
the yuan, also known as the renminbi, any time this year. Currency
traders around the world have been incorrectly predicting a
devaluation of the yuan for nearly two years, but economists who
closely follow China say they see no such likelihood in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a yuan devaluation are partly rooted in the role that
currency movements played in the Asian financial crisis. In July
1997 Thailand devalued its currency, the baht, which helped set off
a wave of instability that quickly spread to the economies of
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea, and later to Russia
and some of Latin America. From time to time amid all that, rumors
of an impending yuan devaluation were bandied about.
</P>
<P>
   A currency devaluation could theoretically help China's economy
by making its exports cheaper and more competitive. But a
devaluation could also could set off another wave of financial
instability in Asia, just as signs of recovery have started
appearing in some countries whose economies were devastated.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, effective next Thursday, suspend all yuan
remittances into China from outside. They also abolish all yuan
accounts in banks outside mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Central bank officials said the new restrictions were intended
to cut down on what they called illegal transactions, but they did
not elaborate on the nature or extent of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently intended to curb the transfer of foreign currency out
of the country, the move is expected to reduce demand for the yuan
in markets such as Hong Kong, where limited trading of the yuan has
been growing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   International bankers familiar with China's banking system
described the new rules as one of several steps Beijing has been
taking since last year to improve control over its currency flows.
Many Chinese companies had been finding ways to move
foreign-currency holdings outside China and beyond official
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, new measures make it harder for Chinese
companies to transfer cash in and out of the country. All
foreign-currency transactions larger than $10,000, for instance,
must now be approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The yuan is not yet a freely tradable currency. Although China
recently began allowing it to be exchanged for trade-related
purposes, outdated rules technically ban anyone from taking yuan
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, yuan can be exchanged in Hong Kong, Macao
and Thailand at banks and at international companies that do
business in China. It is unclear how the new rules will affect such
trading. But more than 3,000 financial institutions in Hong Kong
have participated in yuan transactions.
</P>
<P>
   It has become apparent in the last year that Chinese companies
eager to move foreign currency out of the country were finding ways
to buy yuan in Hong Kong and then remit them back into China in
exchange for American dollars and other currencies. Chinese bank
regulators estimate that companies have found ways to move more
than $100 billion in foreign currency in and out of China through
improper channels in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, issued by the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, were not fully made public.

   North and South Korea agreed to resume talks at the deputy

was broken off 14 months ago, will include such issues as how to
arrange correspondence and meetings among family members who have

   The far-right French leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was convicted in a

the National Front leader stem from a 1997 Munich news conference
at which he referred to the Holocaust as a ``detail in the history

Germany, with a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a heavy
fine.

executions, they remain legal, and parliament has been unwilling to

Carrillo, a member of Mexico's governing party who was forced to
take a leave in May 1998 after his attorney general was arrested in
a kidnapping scandal, will be tried by the state's supreme court on
charges that he failed to fulfill his constitutional duties. Until
recently, governors served at the pleasure of the president, and
Carrillo's impeachment is a first in modern Mexico.

ANC MAKES BROAD GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Voters in South Africa's peaceful second
democratic elections have redrawn the country's political landscape
and strengthened the African National Congress's lock on power.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 percent of the ballots counted, the ANC was on the
threshold of gaining its desired two-thirds majority in Parliament
and retained control of seven of nine provinces with resounding
majorities. The New National Party, a makeover of the one that
ruled the country for 48 years under apartheid and the official
opposition for the past five years, was badly trounced across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nats are hanging on by their fingernails,'' said Steven
Friedman, director of the Center for Policy Studies in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a victory celebration of thundering ANC stalwarts
Thursday in a ballroom near Johannesburg, Thabo Mbeki, the
president-in-waiting, vowed to continue outgoing President Nelson
Mandela's efforts to reconcile black and white South Africans. But
Mbeki said the ANC's top priority would be speeding up the pace of
social rebuilding for the impoverished masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have directed us to move forward faster with our
program of reconstruction and development so that the goal of a
better life for all is achieved sooner rather than later,'' he
said. ``The people have spoken. We have now arrived at the moment
where we go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a notable lack of violence during the election, even
in areas that had been identified as potential flashpoints.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot process was monitored by 10,000 international and
local monitors, who Thursday identified some minor problems at
polling sites but declared the vote free and fair. Stations around
the country stayed open well past the official closing time to
accommodate long lines of voters.
</P>
<P>
   The first South African election since apartheid installed
Mandela as the first black president in 1994. This second election
shattered the historical political alignment, creating the
likelihood of improbable partnerships, changing the hue of some
parties, and sounding the death knell for others.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC outdrew the New National Party in the Western Cape but
did not secure an outright majority. It now appears the stage is
set there for a governing coalition between the erstwhile
liberation movement and its apartheid nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation arose in KwaZulu-Natal, where the ANC nearly
caught the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. In this decade,
factional warfare between the two parties has killed more than
12,000 people. But budding rapprochement and strong ANC gains make
it likely that the two former foes will rule the province together.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Africanist Congress, once the ANC's primary rival during
the liberation struggle, garnered so few votes that it lost all its
seats in Parliament. The Democratic Party, once the party of white
liberalism and an ally of the ANC, cut into the conservative white
vote and was poised to become the official opposition to the ANC.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, opponents accused the ANC of seeking a
two-thirds majority in order to change the constitution. In fact,
the ANC was the only party whose election manifesto required no
changes to the nation's charter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the party emerges virtually unchallenged nationally,
increasing its control of Parliament from 62 percent to a likely 67
percent and gaining absolute or at least shared control in each
province.
</P>
<P>
   The party also has the freedom to form an all-ANC cabinet for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki tried to assuage concerns that the ANC would abuse its
rising strength. ``We are fully conscious of the fact that the
magnificent patience of our people was in part driven by their
knowledge that the ANC would approach the exercise of power without
any arrogance ... to build a South Africa which truly belongs to
all who live in it _ both black and white,'' he said.

RETAIL SALES CONTINUED TO GAIN STRONGLY IN MAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. retailers posted robust sales in May as consumers continued
to show great confidence in the economy by snatching up everything
from wardrobes in summer white to pool furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in retail stores open at least a year, a key industry
measurement, rose 5.6 percent in May compared with results in the
month a year earlier, according to the Goldman Sachs retail
composite index. The figure was not a perfect comparison, however,
because some merchants did not include sales from the Memorial Day
weekend, traditionally a big spending weekend, which came a week
later than last year.
</P>
<P>
   The strong increase adds to an already brisk year for merchants.
In the first four months of 1999, sales in stores open at least a
year rose 6.7 percent compared with figures in the period a year
earlier. That was one of the biggest jumps in years, according to
the Goldman Sachs survey.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see few signs that the consumption binge will abate.
``The depth and breadth of this economic expansion has been
unbelievable, and we continue to think the consumer is in good
shape,'' said Lehman Brothers managing director Jeff Feiner. ``The
really good news is that despite better-than-expected numbers,
retailers have budgeted very conservatively for the more important
second half of the year.'' Feiner has increased earnings estimates
for several large retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Discount chains continued to be at the center of the sales boom.
Wal-Mart Stores posted an increase of 7.7 percent, and Target, a
unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., was up 7.4 percent. Specialty apparel
stores _ buoyed by hot weather, which caused customers to snatch up
capri pants and brightly hued tank tops _ also sustained strong
increases. Ann Taylor was up 10.1 percent, and American Eagle
Outfitters was up 18.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even previously struggling brands showed solid gains. The
Limited Inc., which posted a 10 percent growth in sales, had star
performances from all its units, including Lane Bryant, which was
up 12 percent, and Express, up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A notable exception in speciality apparel came from the normally
invincible Gap Inc. Though sales were up a solid 8 percent, almost
all the growth came from the rocket-charged performances of the
Banana Republic division, which gained 17 percent, and Old Navy, 19
percent. The Gap Stores and Gap Kids posted declines of 1 percent
to 4 percent. Analysts had been predicting that the Gap stores
would rise 1 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to deliver a home run every time, especially
since we were up against very strong numbers from last year,'' said
Warren Hashagen, chief financial officer at Gap. Still, he added
that ``we have had a little bit of weakness in the merchandising
assortment, but we are getting new merchandise in this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Department stores, which have consistently lagged behind the
discounters in recent years, nevertheless had a strong showing.
Federated Department Stores, whose units include Bloomingdale's and
Macy's, had an increase of 4.1 percent, and Saks, the former
Profitt's, said sales increased 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even the moderate-price merchants, J.C. Penney Co. and Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co., which have struggled in recent years as they have
lost customers to hipper outlets like Target and Old Navy, posted
respectable gains. Sales were up 2.2 percent at Penney and 1.9
percent at Sears.

ACCORD LEAVES MANY QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The brief Balkan war, squeezed into the final
months of the 20th century by ethnic tensions that have lasted a
millennium, may be ending with as many unanswered questions as were
raised when it began _ perplexing questions that still stare
remorselessly at Yugoslavia, Europe, NATO, the United States,
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative accord reached Thursday eventually could bring at
least a temporary end to the NATO bombing, to the Serbian cultural
crusade and to the new divide between West and East. But the
agreement brings no guarantees that the beginning of the next
century will be any more tranquil than the beginning of the last
one.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it resolve critical questions about what role the
United States will play in a world without an overriding
ideological divide. Or where world opinion and global force might
be mobilized to resolve civil wars. Or how the Western allies might
win the trust and cooperation of the two giants of the old
Communist bloc, Russia and China, to prevent small disputes from
escalating into large ones.
</P>
<P>
   And, more important, the accord does not suggest how those
decisions should be made, and whether one doctrine will ever cover
all the complicated issues that prompt people to go to war.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed caution Thursday about the
agreement, and the success of the accord will depend on how swiftly
and fully President Slobodan Milosevic complies. If the agreement
holds, it would bring short-term relief to a weary world. But it
would not address the important questions of diplomacy, strategy
and morality that still could bring long-term grief to the new
world order.
</P>
<P>
   Wars are fought to resolve difficult international questions,
and almost always raise even more vexing ones. World War I, for
example, was fought in part to resolve big-power tensions between
England and Germany, but the predominant question at its end was
how to assure collective security in Europe. World War II was
fought in part to resolve the tension between Europe's democracies
and its dictatorships, but the pressing question at war's end was
how to resolve the tension between capitalism and communism.
</P>
<P>
   This war is no different. Indeed, the questions raised near the
end are in many ways far more pressing than the ones prompted at
its beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the return of hundreds of thousands of
refugees, but it will not erase the ethnic tensions that provided
the trigger for World War I, or that fueled what may turn out to be
the century's last bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provides a plausible rationale for NATO's months
of bombing. But it does not give the military alliance fashioned at
the end of World War II, and strengthened throughout the Cold War,
a discrete, defined role in a world where the Cold War has
disappeared and where World War II is increasingly a grandfather's
war.
</P>
<P>
   It buttresses the notion of European unity. But it does not
provide an example for how the continent, no longer the self-styled
seat of civilization, should arbitrate disputes and prevent civil
wars between the English Channel and the Urals from spiraling into
world conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It reinforces the moral high ground that the United States seeks
to occupy, in an era when this nation is the world's only
superpower. But it provides no blueprint for how, when, why and
where the preeminent global power should get involved in faraway
disputes, project its power or influence the outcome of world
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It salvages Russia's dignity at a time of political turmoil and
economic uncertainty. But it does not provide any hint of how a
continental power that spans 11 time zones should establish its
long-range stability, nor how a major power with strong local and
ethnic interests should prevent conflict before it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   It establishes China as a legitimate, prideful member of the
international community. But it does not guarantee that Beijing
will be a player in the next world conflict, nor does it provide
hints about what role China will play as its missile stocks and
influence grow.
</P>
<P>
   It redeems the prediction, dating to the days when Stanley
Baldwin was prime minister of Britain in the 1930s but never
realized until now, that wars could be won in the air. But it
offers few hints to help future decision-makers determine whether
relentless bombing will harden the resolve of opponents (as air
raids did in Britain in 1940 and North Vietnam in 1968) or weaken
their resistance (as an air assault apparently did in Yugoslavia in
1999).
</P>
<P>
   It establishes that the entire Western alliance, led by the
greatest power in civilization's history, can work its will on a
country with limited arms, almost no sense of national unity and
scant international support. But it does not provide Americans with
any assurance that its multibillion-dollar arsenal and its complex
set of alliances are suited to the challenges, military and
diplomatic, that will present themselves in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   It would bring an end to a conflict that made Clinton seem
alternately decisive (by entering the air battle so
enthusiastically) and ineffectual (by failing to bring the Serbian
force to its knees swiftly). But it underlines how little the
administration, in its seventh year, has thought through the
difficult questions of war, engagement, and peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   It raises the question, not fully answered by the Marshall Plan
at the end of World War II, whether a huge infusion of money like
the amounts expected to be directed at Yugoslavia in the next
several years, can salve wounds that have festered for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It alleviates the worry of Vice President Al Gore that a
protracted air war or, worse still, a long ground war, could
undermine his presidential campaign. But it also raises questions
about what the vice president's views and role in the war were, and
about how he would handle a similar situation.
</P>
<P>
   It wipes away a contentious issue from the Republican table. But
it does not help resolve an important conflict within the party
about internationalism and isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   All these questions, though unanswered by the accord announced
Thursday, suddenly seem more difficult, more vexing, than they did
a year ago or at the beginning of the war. They are more urgent
than ever, and yet the solutions to them are more elusive than
ever.

MILOSEVIC AGREES TO NATO DEMANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ On the 72nd day of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday accepted an
international peace plan to end the Kosovo conflict and allow
nearly 1 million ethnic Albanian refugees to return to what is left
of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   After forcing most of those refugees to flee from Kosovo and
enduring thousands of Serbian military and civilian deaths,
Milosevic and the Serbian parliament agreed rapidly to all key NATO
demands after emissaries from Russia and Europe bought what they
made clear was the best offer he was going to get from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In a swift retreat that may spell political trouble for him,
Milosevic agreed to withdraw all Yugoslav military and police
forces from Kosovo within seven days and allow 50,000 foreign
troops under a U.N. flag _ many of them from NATO and under NATO
command _ to police the province.
</P>
<P>
   That withdrawal could begin as early as Sunday, said Goran
Matic, a minister in the Yugoslav government, once military leaders
of both sides agreed on the details for the handover. What is
important for Belgrade is that the Kosovo Liberation Army not be
allowed to fill the vacuum and flood into Kosovo, he said, and that
NATO keep its commitment to ``demilitarize'' the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO has emphasized the need for a strong force to prevent
the Yugoslav president from reneging on his commitments, Yugoslav
officials and some Western diplomats here believe its real
difficulties will come from the KLA, which it has tried to use as a
proxy army and is unlikely to give up its ambitions for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public reactions in the West, which appeared to be taken
by surprise by the sudden fact of its victory, were cautious, and
it was not immediately clear when or even through what means the
conflict will be brought to a conclusion. Western spokesmen said
the Serbs must begin a ``credible and verifiable withdrawal'' from
Kosovo before the bombs would stop, but NATO's bombing campaign
slackened noticeably Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The peace proposals were negotiated between NATO and Russia,
acting for Belgrade. Once the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
finally agreed on the basics of the deal with the U.S. deputy
secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, Milosevic clearly felt he had
no choice but to accept them or endure further destruction his
forces could not prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposals, fewer than 1,000 Serbian personnel will be
allowed to re-enter Kosovo, to guard key border posts and Serbian
holy sites, as a symbol of Serbian and Yugoslav sovereignty over
the southern province. But there will be little substance left to
Belgrade's assertion of sovereignty. Kosovo will get ``substantial
autonomy'' within Yugoslavia, but for all intents and purposes,
will have little to do with the Serb or Yugoslav state.
</P>
<P>
   An interim international authority will supervise the running of
Kosovo and the establishment of new democratic institutions and
elections, the return of all refugees and the rebuilding of the
province. In the meantime, there will be new negotiations between
Serbian and ethnic Albanian leaders to work out a long-term
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in what Belgrade pointed to as a victory, the proposals
accepted Thursday do not include a new examination of Kosovo's
sovereignty after three years or any referendum on that topic, as
did the draft proposals accepted in March by the Albanian side only
in Rambouillet, France. It was the Serbian refusal to accept those
accords that led to the opening of the NATO air campaign on March
24, the sharp acceleration in the Serbian effort to push the
Albanians out of Kosovo and the tidal wave of refugees into
surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials also said that their resistance had forced
NATO to find a solution within the United Nations and with the
participation of the Russians. And they emphasized the firm
international guarantees of Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo,
unlike the temporary sovereignty proposed under Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But there was also important nationalist criticism of Milosevic
and this deal. The Radical Party and its leader, Deputy Prime
Minister Vojislav Seselj, voted against the proposals in
parliament, and Seselj vowed to quit the government the day NATO
troops enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The former president of Yugoslavia, the nationalist historian
Dobrica Cosic, called the vote ``an extorted decision,'' and the
proposals ``a post-modernist packaging for the occupation of
Kosovo.'' In an interview, Cosic, whose views on Kosovo carry much
weight here, called the parliament's acceptance ``a matter of
survival, and not a matter of freedom and rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no immediate political threat to Milosevic. The
weak democratic opposition parties supported the move toward peace,
and Vuk Draskovic, who was fired as Yugoslav deputy prime minister
during the war, praised the vote and said he would be willing to
rejoin the government, especially if Seselj quits.
</P>
<P>
   Some confusion remains over who will lead the international
force in Kosovo and its exact makeup. The Russians are still
insisting that their forces will not be under NATO command,
although the subject presumably can be fudged diplomatically, with,
for example, a NATO general heading the entire U.N. operation
wearing a U.N. hat along with his NATO one.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it immediately clear when a military-to-military text
would be negotiated, or when the agreement would be codified into a
U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the deal may finally bring some peace, if not
reconciliation, to Kosovo. A year ago, the province contained some
2.2 million people, about 90 percent of them ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kosovo is eerily depopulated, with nearly 1 million
Albanians now living abroad as refugees and with several hundred
thousand more displaced from their homes. As many as 5,000 ethnic
Albanians, NATO has alleged, have been murdered by the Serbs.
Thousands of Serb women and children have also fled the province,
and it is likely that many Serbs will not want to remain in Kosovo
once their army and police have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With many thousands of ethnic Albanians shops and homes burned
and looted, and basic services like transport, roads, bridges,
electricity and water supplies destroyed or heavily damaged by the
air war, the job of reconstructing Kosovo will also be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   And it is likely that foreign troops and aid workers will occupy
the province for many years, at a cost of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following talks Thursday morning between Milosevic and the
diplomatic team of Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, who represented the European Union but articulated
NATO's views, the state news agency Tanjug said simply:
``Yugoslavia accepts the document for peace brought by the highest
representatives of the European Union and Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued: ``The three sides unanimously agreed
that commitment to peace was of vital importance, not only for
Yugoslavia, but for the whole region and all of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday morning, the Serbian parliament had accepted
the proposals after party leaders had been briefed by Milosevic the
night before. The parliament voted 136 for and 74 against, with
three abstentions and one no vote. Presumably, the 74 against
included most of Seselj's 80 deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Seselj was blunt. ``For sure, we will not stay in the
Serbian government from the moment that troops from aggressor
countries, particularly the USA, enter Kosovo,'' he said. And he
warned that NATO troops ``will not feel safe in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic was ebullient, calling the vote ``a great day for
the Serbian nation and all the citizens of Yugoslavia.'' He said:
``The Serbian parliament today declared peace, and the beginning of
peace must be the beginning of a new policy of radical economic and
democratic reform.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Serbian state television did not mention Seselj's opposition or
quote him at all, but it did give Draskovic time to praise
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There was no statement from Milosevic himself. But the anchorman
recited a long statement from Milosevic's Socialist Party praising
the Serbian nation and the international guarantees of Yugoslavia's
``integrity and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision brings us the cessation of the criminal bombing,
of the killing of the people and it brings us peace,'' the
statement said. ``The role of the United Nations is being affirmed
in accordance with the U.N. charter. Through the unity of the
people and through the heroism of our army and our police, we have
defended the country from a vastly superior enemy who committed
aggression against our country with the goal of annulling our
integrity and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There was also a statement from the Yugoslav United Left Party
of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic. ``We are proud of the heroic
resistance of our people,'' the statement said, ``and in these
circumstances we feel we can accept conditions'' laid down by the
world. ``We are looking for the end of the bombing, and the great
renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many Serbs share that optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Jovan Djordjevic, a 42-year-old postman, spoke for many when he
said: ``If Milosevic wants to accept this plan, he should have done
it before the bombing. How can he explain the dead now? How many
dead are enough for him?''

DOUBTS ON WHETHER MILOSEVIC WILL FOLLOW THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ News of hope from Belgrade, in the form of a peace
accord, brought disdainful skepticism late Thursday in Hungary,
Yugoslavia's northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Milosevic at all,'' said one Hungarian, Zoltan
Karpati, a 33-year-old ticket-taker and trade union representative.
``I have spoken with a lot of Serbs, and they all agree that if
Milosevic makes a deal, he will be out of power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a delaying tactic,'' Karpati said. ``Milosevic is
like Saddam Hussein _ you can't trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungary, which had a friendly relationship with Yugoslavia
before the war, found itself an adversary after it became a NATO
member. The Western alliance began bombing less than two weeks
after Hungary joined.
</P>
<P>
   That adversarial relationship was aggravated by Hungary's
agreement to host 24 F-18 fighter planes at its southern air base
in Taszar. Bombing in northern Serbia was heard by southern
Hungarian residents nervous about Hungary's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of peace, it seems, would be welcomed by
Hungarians. But almost no one here seems to believe that Milosevic
is on the level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply don't believe it. Only when there are changes in the
personalities will there be real change,'' said Laszlo Szekely, a
77-year-old retiree. ``I would like to believe it, but I was a
soldier, and I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Many here also expressed concern that if Milosevic stays in
power, he may make trouble in the northern Serbian province of
Vojvodina, where about 350,000 ethnic Hungarians live.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians must see the connection,'' said Tibor Tajti, a
37-year-old graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Milosevic, he added: ``If the question is not
settled now, it's going to move onto Vojvodina. They have to remove
him somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Aniko Villany, a shop cashier, said: ``This NATO bombing is of
no use. NATO should grab him somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian government has been nervous about the Vojvodina
question as well. Rightists in the Hungarian parliament are
demanding that part of Vojvodina be annexed to Hungary as part of a
peace pact. The moderate government has rejected that idea as
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary has acquiesced on the issue of sending Hungarian troops
to Kosovo. Previously, Budapest had opposed the NATO use of its
troops in Yugoslavia, because of the possibility that Hungarians
fighting against ethnic brothers might complicate the war, and the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Hungary's foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, said
Hungary was ready to send at least 120 soldiers to participate in a
truce force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary ``is ready to make sacrifices and to take risks,''
Martonyi said.

DISPUTE OVER HORMONE-TREATED BEEF GOES TO ARBITRATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A trans-Atlantic fight over hormone-treated beef
intensified Thursday when officials of the United States and
Canadian asked the World Trade Organization to approve $253 million
in retaliatory trade sanctions and the European Union countered by
demanding arbitration that it hoped would lower the overall amount.
</P>
<P>
   Like a recent dispute over bananas, the quarrel over beef
reflects American anger over the failure of the 15-nation European
Union to abide by decisions of the trade organization, which makes
the rules of international commerce. The trade arbiter has said
that the European preference for bananas grown in former colonies
was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the European Union's refusal to revise its
banana-import policy, the Clinton administration imposed $191.4
million in tariffs on European products. It is seeking a further
$202 million in 100 percent tariffs on a new range of European
goods because the European Union has refused to lift its ban on
beef produced in the United States, as it was supposed to do by May
13 under a previous trade organization ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians asked for $51 million in sanctions because their
beef is also blocked from the enormous European market.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization first found the beef ban illegal in 1997
on the ground that food safety concerns cannot be used to restrict
trade without a specific finding of a health risk.
</P>
<P>
   As in the bananas case, European Union officials invoked the
right to a review by a trade organization arbitration panel and are
expected to argue that the U.S. beef trade is worth only half the
claimed yearly losses.
</P>
<P>
   The European Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said Thursday
that the trade bloc would seek a significant reduction, arguing
that the U.S. figure of $202 million was ``grossly excessive.'' He
said, ``They haven't suffered that amount of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   In declining to meet the May deadline, the European Union issued
preliminary findings from a new scientific study that said that one
growth-promoting hormone could cause cancer. Ian Wilkinson, deputy
head of the European Union's mission to the trade organization in
Geneva, said 17 studies were expected to be done by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the dispute goes to a three-member arbitration panel
that under the trade organization's rules must decide by July 12 on
the amount of trade sanctions. Only then will the trade
organization permit the United States and Canada to impose them.
</P>
<P>
   However, signaling a new area of dispute, the Europeans are
seeking a final list of products that will be penalized before the
sanctions are imposed, a request that Washington opposes.
</P>
<P>
   An initial list, which included pork, Roquefort cheese, truffles
and mineral water, was published on March 25 in the Federal
Register. But Rita Hayes, the U.S. envoy to the trade organization,
said Wednesday that ``the final list of sanctions would not be
drawn up until we have WTO authorization'' _ after arbitration is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   She said that although the U.S. cattle industry had reported
$500 million in lost business annually, Washington asked for a
lower amount because ``we felt this was a figure that would
represent the amount of damages we are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the two sides to arrive at a compromise failed when
officials of the European Union would not commit to lifting the ban
eventually. Then, after the May 3 release of preliminary findings
that supported the United States position, the consumer affairs
director for the European Commission declared that it would never
lift the beef barrier. ``There has never been a comparable
statement from anyone in the EU contradicting this statement,'' Ms.
Hayes said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has offered to label its beef exports as
produced in this country, but that suggestion has foundered in part
because the whole area of altered or adulterated foods is highly
sensitive. One consequence of the ``mad cow'' disease outbreak in
Britain three years ago was that beef consumption in Europe
plummeted. More recently, a scandal over Belgian poultry and other
meat that could be laced with cancer-causing dioxin has reinforced
fears about the food trade.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the beef dispute have agreed to have scientists
look at the evidence in the European Union study that was released
last month. But U.S. officials say they have produced no new data
or findings that the six hormones at issue can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no health risks from U.S. beef,'' Ms. Hayes said,
citing conclusions by World Health Organization experts last
February that three of the hormones, which occur naturally in
animals, do not pose health risks.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 63 percent of all cattle and 90 percent of
feed cattle are fitted with hormone implants, which are placed
under the skin behind the animals' ears, to hasten growth.

MCCAINBIO (Washington) - A limp figure slowly descends from the

await his landing. It appeared the folks piecing together Sen. John
McCain's presidential campaign video had uncovered spectacular
archival footage showing him falling to earth after his plane was
shot down on a bombing run over Hanoi during the Vietnam War. But
McCain's top aide said Thursday that the parachuting man depicted

VALDEZ-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Imagine you were an anthropologist
visiting from another planet. It wouldn't take you long to assess
the significance of female breasts in our culture: They are for
marketing and men. But despite the evidence in popular culture,
breasts are not primarily tools for profit or pleasure. They are

COSTELLO-MUSIC (Phoenix) Elvis Costello could be forgiven for

Cole or Johnny Mathis, is fluent in pop, R&AMP;B and jazz. He is

COMMENTARY: GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What should we think of Thursday's news of a potential deal in
Kosovo? We should think there is potential good news here and
potential bad news.
</P>
<P>
   What the Serbs acknowledged Thursday is that the air war has
really hurt them, that they are ready to sit down and negotiate,
and they are ready to do it according to the principles set out by
NATO and Russia. In other words, what happened Thursday is not the
end of negotiations, it is the beginning of them. NATO wanted to
avoid a ground war in Yugoslavia and it may have done that with the
air war. But the purpose of the air war was to determine who would
go where, with what arms and with what mandate on the ground, and
all that will now have to be negotiated by military men on both
sides _ and the air war can't stop until it is.
</P>
<P>
   If the details can be negotiated, and they really do allow a
strong NATO presence in Kosovo, the first piece of good news would
be that NATO's basic objective _ getting the refugees back home
under some form of credible international protection _ will be
possible, without splitting the alliance, without NATO having
suffered a single casualty and without a ground war. That ain't
beanbag.
</P>
<P>
   The thing to worry about is what NATO has won: the right to
manage relations between Kosovo Albanians and Serbs indefinitely,
just as NATO is now doing between Serbs, Croats and Muslims in
Bosnia. Why should one worry about that? Because Kosovo is not
Bosnia. The Bosnia peace accords began with a political agreement
between the leaders of each faction for a de facto partition of
Bosnia. The military arrangements were then built around that core
understanding. That is why it has been so stable.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is just the opposite. We are going to have a military
arrangement on the ground, with no political understanding between
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on what the political future of Kosovo
should be. The Kosovo Albanians still want full independence; the
Serbs still want NATO out and permanent sovereignty over Kosovo.
This means that NATO and Russia will not be sitting on basically
contented parties, but on still-aggrieved parties that could draw
the U.S. and Russia into their ongoing feud.
</P>
<P>
   If this deal is real, the second bit of good news is that
Milosevic will have been seen to lose in some very important ways.
He personally has been indicted as a war criminal; he would be
accepting foreign troops on his soil, something he had rejected;
and his army and his economy have both been mauled as punishment
for his actions. No one can say he is walking away a winner. He
will, though, be walking away a survivor, because NATO is not going
to go after him, so as not to upset any deal. As in Bosnia, there
will be a trade-off in Kosovo between justice and stability.
</P>
<P>
   If this deal is real, the third bit of good news is that the
Russians will have tacitly signed on to NATO's basic agenda in
Yugoslavia, and that's important. It could turn out to be a bridge
for re-establishing broader NATO-Russian cooperation. The thing to
worry about is that if Russian troops are to be in one zone in
Kosovo and NATO troops in another, friction and misunderstanding
will always be possible _ particularly if the Kosovo Liberation
Army seeks revenge on the Serbs in the Russian zone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, from the start the Kosovo problem has been about how we
should react when bad things happen in unimportant places. Some
argued that Kosovo was so unimportant that you just had to ignore
the bad things happening there. Some argued that what was happening
in Kosovo was so bad you had to overlook its strategic
insignificance for America and mount an all-out ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including myself, argued that once the refugee evictions
began, ignoring Kosovo would be wrong, mounting a ground invasion
would deepen the disaster, and therefore using a huge air war for a
limited objective was the only thing that made sense. If this deal
proves real, it will establish that an air war for limited
humanitarian goals can be effective, albeit costly.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, though, the Clintonites blundered into this
strategy, after completely underestimating Milosevic's intentions
and capabilities. The Kosovars have paid heavily for these
blunders. We will be lucky if the majority of them can now return
home. Which is why whatever this war proves about what air power
can do to achieve limited humanitarian goals, it is not something
anyone is going to want to try again real soon.

ACCORD LEAVES MANY QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The brief Balkan war, squeezed into the final
months of the 20th century by ethnic tensions that have lasted a
millennium, may be ending with as many unanswered questions as were
raised when it began _ perplexing questions that still stare
remorselessly at Yugoslavia, Europe, NATO, the United States,
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative accord reached Thursday eventually could bring at
least a temporary end to the NATO bombing, to the Serbian cultural
crusade and to the new divide between West and East. But the
agreement brings no guarantees that the beginning of the next
century will be any more tranquil than the beginning of the last
one.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it resolve critical questions about what role the
United States will play in a world without an overriding
ideological divide. Or where world opinion and global force might
be mobilized to resolve civil wars. Or how the Western allies might
win the trust and cooperation of the two giants of the old
Communist bloc, Russia and China, to prevent small disputes from
escalating into large ones.
</P>
<P>
   And, more important, the accord does not suggest how those
decisions should be made, and whether one doctrine will ever cover
all the complicated issues that prompt people to go to war.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed caution Thursday about the
agreement, and the success of the accord will depend on how swiftly
and fully President Slobodan Milosevic complies. If the agreement
holds, it would bring short-term relief to a weary world. But it
would not address the important questions of diplomacy, strategy
and morality that still could bring long-term grief to the new
world order.
</P>
<P>
   Wars are fought to resolve difficult international questions,
and almost always raise even more vexing ones. World War I, for
example, was fought in part to resolve big-power tensions between
England and Germany, but the predominant question at its end was
how to assure collective security in Europe. World War II was
fought in part to resolve the tension between Europe's democracies
and its dictatorships, but the pressing question at war's end was
how to resolve the tension between capitalism and communism.
</P>
<P>
   This war is no different. Indeed, the questions raised near the
end are in many ways far more pressing than the ones prompted at
its beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the return of hundreds of thousands of
refugees, but it will not erase the ethnic tensions that provided
the trigger for World War I, or that fueled what may turn out to be
the century's last bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provides a plausible rationale for NATO's months
of bombing. But it does not give the military alliance fashioned at
the end of World War II, and strengthened throughout the Cold War,
a discrete, defined role in a world where the Cold War has
disappeared and where World War II is increasingly a grandfather's
war.
</P>
<P>
   It buttresses the notion of European unity. But it does not
provide an example for how the continent, no longer the self-styled
seat of civilization, should arbitrate disputes and prevent civil
wars between the English Channel and the Urals from spiraling into
world conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It reinforces the moral high ground that the United States seeks
to occupy, in an era when this nation is the world's only
superpower. But it provides no blueprint for how, when, why and
where the preeminent global power should get involved in faraway
disputes, project its power or influence the outcome of world
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It salvages Russia's dignity at a time of political turmoil and
economic uncertainty. But it does not provide any hint of how a
continental power that spans 11 time zones should establish its
long-range stability, nor how a major power with strong local and
ethnic interests should prevent conflict before it occurs.
</P>
<P>
   It establishes China as a legitimate, prideful member of the
international community. But it does not guarantee that Beijing
will be a player in the next world conflict, nor does it provide
hints about what role China will play as its missile stocks and
influence grow.
</P>
<P>
   It redeems the prediction, dating to the days when Stanley
Baldwin was prime minister of Britain in the 1930s but never
realized until now, that wars could be won in the air. But it
offers few hints to help future decision-makers determine whether
relentless bombing will harden the resolve of opponents (as air
raids did in Britain in 1940 and North Vietnam in 1968) or weaken
their resistance (as an air assault apparently did in Yugoslavia in
1999).
</P>
<P>
   It establishes that the entire Western alliance, led by the
greatest power in civilization's history, can work its will on a
country with limited arms, almost no sense of national unity and
scant international support. But it does not provide Americans with
any assurance that its multibillion-dollar arsenal and its complex
set of alliances are suited to the challenges, military and
diplomatic, that will present themselves in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   It would bring an end to a conflict that made Clinton seem
alternately decisive (by entering the air battle so
enthusiastically) and ineffectual (by failing to bring the Serbian
force to its knees swiftly). But it underlines how little the
administration, in its seventh year, has thought through the
difficult questions of war, engagement, and peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   It raises the question, not fully answered by the Marshall Plan
at the end of World War II, whether a huge infusion of money like
the amounts expected to be directed at Yugoslavia in the next
several years, can salve wounds that have festered for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It alleviates the worry of Vice President Al Gore that a
protracted air war or, worse still, a long ground war, could
undermine his presidential campaign. But it also raises questions
about what the vice president's views and role in the war were, and
about how he would handle a similar situation.
</P>
<P>
   It wipes away a contentious issue from the Republican table. But
it does not help resolve an important conflict within the party
about internationalism and isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   All these questions, though unanswered by the accord announced
Thursday, suddenly seem more difficult, more vexing, than they did
a year ago or at the beginning of the war. They are more urgent
than ever, and yet the solutions to them are more elusive than
ever.

SAN ANTONIO STUDENT FALLS A LETTER SHORT IN SPELLING BEE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The word means a buzzing in the ear. The sound
Natalie DeMaioribus heard was the ringing of a bell, signalling
that she was no longer a contestant in Thursday's closing rounds of
the National Spelling Bee.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge read ``tinnitus,'' the 13-year-old hesitated for
the first time in the two-day competition.
</P>
<P>
   She asked the judge to repeat the word.
</P>
<P>
   Tinnitus.
</P>
<P>
   She asked what part of speech the word is.
</P>
<P>
   A noun.
</P>
<P>
   She asked for the judge to use the word in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman heard a tinnitus that sounded like a loud and
piercing voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Hesitantly, she repeated the word. T-I-N-I-T-U-S.
</P>
<P>
   Short one ``n,'' the bell sounded.
</P>
<P>
   With a surprised look on her face, DeMaioribus turned and walked
off the stage to the ``comfort room'' used by contestants in this
72nd gathering of top spellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel disappointed,'' said DeMaioribus, who recently
completed the seventh grade at Holy Spirit School in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Chris DeMaioribus, a vascular surgeon, later said
Natalie thought she had spelled the word correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was turning to go back to her seat when the bell rang,''
he said. ``I think she would have felt better missing a word she
didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeMaioribus added that while his daughter was upset, she
didn't take the competition too seriously. ``It's never been an
all-consuming thing for her or the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie DeMaioribus tied for 104th place in the contest, and she
won $125 and a commemorative watch. The contest opened Wednesday
with 249 spellers.
</P>
<P>
   DeMaioribus, who was sponsored by the San Antonio Express-News,
plays the piano and violin, and rides horses.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the bee was Nupur Lala, 14, of Tampa, Fla. She won
after 11 rounds, the last of which pitted her against David
Lewandowski, 14, of Schererville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Lewandowski was eliminated from the contest after misspelling
``opsimath,'' a person who begins to learn late in life. He spelled
it ``opsomath.''
</P>
<P>
   Lala then correctly spelled ``nocicepter,'' which refers to
something that causes harm or pain. She then sealed her victory by
spelling ``logorrhea,'' incoherent talkativeness.
</P>
<P>
   Lala, who was eliminated in the third round of last year's bee,
jumped in the air and screamed.
</P>
<P>
   She won a $10,000 cash prize, plus encyclopedias, two airline
tickets and computer software. The contestants, most sponsored by
their local newspapers, all won regional bees to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Scripps Howard, the newspaper group based in Cincinnati,
coordinates the national finals and produces the word lists and
study materials.

ON THE STREETS: RELIEF, YES. EUPHORIA, NO.
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BELGRADE _ For 72 days, the people of Serbia have endured air
raid sirens, gasoline rationing, crowded buses, bread shortages,
blackouts, water outages, cigarette lines, joblessness, black
market profiteers.
</P>
<P>
   And bombs, bombs, and more bombs.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as word filtered out that their leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, had accepted a peace plan aimed at ending the bombing,
many ordinary people greeted the news with the same sleep-deprived
resignation with which they had come to regard the war.
</P>
<P>
   Relief, yes. Euphoria, no.
</P>
<P>
   People talked about life perhaps returning to normal, or at
least as normal as possible in an impoverished country that is led
by an indicted war criminal and is still subject to a host of
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   People talked wistfully about not having to hoard cigarettes and
bread, about not going days without a shower or a shave, about
crossing the Sava River and not having to wonder whether this was
the night the bridge would be bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Most people interviewed on the streets of the Yugoslav capital
Thursday afternoon did not even know a deal had been struck, grim
testimony to the power of a state-controlled media that gives the
people only the news that the government deems they need.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a bench in a park in front of City Hall, 57-year-old
grandmother Ljerka Tatic seemed to capture the mood of most when
she said that she was ``glad for a deal,'' but dubious of what was
accomplished by subjecting people to more than two months of
bombing, hardship, and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have had that deal sooner,'' said Tatic. ``So
much destruction, for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Belgrade had initially responded to NATO's
airstrikes by mounting defiant, jovial midday rock concerts
downtown. The daily concerts soldiered on, but gradually the crowds
melted away, as each day brought news of ``collateral damage,'' the
euphemism used by NATO to describe the deaths of civilians killed
by what NATO says were accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Mirac, 21, a student, voiced the realism that had come to
replace the bellicose rhetoric of hard-liners. Mirac dismissed
suggestions that Milosevic had capitulated, seeing instead a
courageous gesture meant to avert greater suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better that the war finish now than the possibility that
100,000 people get killed and then we get a signature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vladan Krstic, 42, a dentist, agreed that ``any peace deal is
better than war.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign had engendered great bitterness among
ordinary people, even those who long for a more open, democratic
society. Many considered it the height of cowardice that NATO was
only willing to bomb from the relative safety of 15,000 feet and
refused to send its ground forces to fight Serb troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is the site of Orthodox Christian monasteries that are
important to Serbs, and also the place where Serbs trace the birth
of their nationhood. Because of this, some Serbs consider the
deployment in Kosovo of an international force that could include
up to 7,000 Americans a humiliating concession.
</P>
<P>
   Ljiljana Kazic, 38, said the deployment of Americans in Kosovo
would amount to ``a defeat for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Svetozar Jovanovic, 66, is old enough to remember the Nazi
occupation of Serbia during World War II, and, as he put it, ``I'd
rather see Germans in Belgrade again than Americans in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   As he shopped for shoes in a mall, wearing the battle fatigues
that are so common here as tens of thousands of men have been
conscripted into the army, a Yugoslav soldier who would give only
his first name of Svonka said, ``Americans will not feel
comfortable in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will hate them, even the Albanians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But just as many Serbs seem to accept that Americans and other
foreign troops in Kosovo is the price that has to be paid for an
end to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything against the Americans coming to Kosovo,
as long as they keep peace under the UN flag,'' said Krstic, the
dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade is very much a cafe society, with tables and chairs set
up on sidewalks and any place where space permits. But there was no
celebrating Thursday night as dusk fell, and the prospect of a
second consecutive night without bombing loomed. There was no
bombing in the capital Wednesday night because the Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin and the Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari were
in town presenting the peace deal to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is no euphoria here, there is an unmistakable
sense of relief, a sense captured by a waitress who said, ``I used
to have a life. I used to go out at night. Maybe now I can do that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many parents here, Alisa Dunic, 36, was not interested in
the political machinations behind Milosevic's acquiescence, or
whether history will regard this as one of the great capitulations
of all time. As someone who has hugged her children, trying to
comfort them over the deafening wail of air raid sirens and
reassure them after the bone-shaking explosions that have become a
fact of daily life here, she sought no political explanation for
what happened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy because it means peaceful dreams for my kids,'' she
said. ``I don't care if it's capitulation or not. The most
important thing is that people are not killed.''

FINNISH PRESIDENT AHTISAARI HAS LONG HISTORY OF DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Geography, history and some stubborn Nordic patience
gave Martti Ahtisaari, 61, the president of Finland, a reasoning
power with Slobodan Milosevic and his Russian advocates that no
other European leader could match.
</P>
<P>
   A European Union member whose very survival as a nation long
depended on its ability not to antagonize its mammoth Soviet
neighbor, neutral Finland has found itself in the pivotal position
of providing honest-broker services between Moscow, Belgrade and
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   And Ahtisaari, who helped persuade Milosevic to accept the peace
plan for Kosovo worked out by Russia, the United States and the
Europeans, is a man of proven staying power. He spent 13 years
heading up the U.N. effort leading to a peaceful resolution of the
struggle that resulted in the independence of Namibia in southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is Ahtisaari's purpose to help Finland, the one Nordic
country to adopt the euro as its future currency, overcome its
location on the northeastern fringe of the Continent and become a
central player in Brussels, Belgium, the seat of the European
Union, as well as a bridge between Russia and the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari was a vigorous supporter of his country's decision to
enter the European Union in 1995 and the European monetary union
this past year, and he has repeatedly argued that the European
Union's primary responsibility is to be patient with Russia and
help it achieve democratic stability. Finland holds the European
Union's rotating presidency starting in July.
</P>
<P>
   A career diplomat for 30 years and a politician only since his
election in 1994, Ahtisaari occupies an office that under the
Finnish Constitution has the responsibility for shaping foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Finland has become the most wired nation in the
world, symbolized by the international success of its Nokia
telecommunications products, and it has taken on the leadership of
a new Baltic area of influence opened up by the end of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   The new presidential residence that Ahtisaari lives in is a
fitting testament to the self-confidence of the nation and the
comfort it takes in its frost-bound maritime location. Granite
solid outside and minimalist and unadorned inside, it is a
modernistic building designed to symbolize ice, snow and light and
is set into an outcrop overlooking the sea near Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   As if to dramatize his country's prominence as a technological
innovator, Ahtisaari delights in entertaining the growing number of
foreign guests to the mansion by flicking on the single button that
floods the acoustically tuned spaces with classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Martti Ahtisaari was born on June 23, 1937, in the city of
Viipuri, which is now on the Russian side of the border in
territory ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II. His father,
a naturalized Finn born in Norway, was a noncommissioned army
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The son went to school in Oulu in the north of Finland,
graduating in 1959 from a teachers college and pondering life as an
educator. But eager to see the world, he worked on a school project
in Pakistan for the Swedish Agency for Industrial Development, and
his career as an internationalist was set.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1965 and went
abroad in 1973 as Finland's ambassador to four African countries:
Tanzania, Mozambique, Somalia and Zambia. The contacts he developed
throughout Africa served him in good stead in 1977 when Javier
Perez de Cuellar, the secretary-general of the United Nations, was
looking for someone to serve as commissioner and special
representative to Namibia, where a guerrilla war for independence
from South Africa was under way.
</P>
<P>
   He kept at it even after returning to Helsinki in 1984 as
Finland's under secretary of state for international cooperation
with developing countries. Three years later he became the U.N.
under secretary-general for administration and management and
retained his position as special representative for Namibia. The
new nation named him an honorary citizen in 1990, and many
Namibians have since named their own children Martti.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he became head of the Finnish Ministry for Foreign
Affairs and a year later was appointed chairman of the
Bosnia-Herzogovina Working Group of the International Conference on
the Former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the only political contest of his life, he became Finland's
first directly elected president. His first six-year term ends in
2000, and, though he is permitted to run for re-election, he
announced last weekend that he would step down as the Social
Democratic Party's candidate in favor of Tarja Halonen, currently
Finland's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari is married to the former Eeva Hyvarinen, a
secondary-school teacher. The couple have a son who studied
philosophy in the United States and now plays in a rock band in
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari is a lover of the country's frigid countryside and
such a devotee of the nation's most famous relaxation activity that
he has been known to take his counselors into his sauna and
continue discussions there.
</P>
<P>
   He has had a lifelong problem controlling his weight, which has
led to a degeneration of his knees and altered his walk. He has had
several operations to correct the problem, but still moves in a
labored fashion.
</P>
<P>
   When he was reported to have stumbled or fallen at receptions,
the local press suspected something other than his weak knees,
speculating that he instead had been living up to the Finns'
reputation for being hearty vodka drinkers. The president went on
television to complain that these reports were intrusions on his
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the nation can differentiate between events of a
private nature and official work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish press respected his wishes and reported no more
rumors. But one newspaper took note of a report that President
Boris Yeltsin of Russia had appeared unsteady on a visit to
Germany. Its headline read: ``Yeltsin Stumbles Too.''

TOP ACTIVIST FOR RIGHTS IN TURKEY IS IMPRISONED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey's best-known human rights advocate
entered prison Thursday to serve a nine-and-a-half-month sentence
for giving speeches judged subversive.
</P>
<P>
   The advocate, Akin Birdal, who is chairman of a group called the
Human Rights Association, has repeatedly urged the state to reach a
peaceful settlement with Kurdish rebels. Such statements are
illegal in Turkey because they are said to constitute support for
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The law under which Birdal was convicted bans statements
``inciting the people to enmity by dividing them along religious,
linguistic or racial lines.'' In recent weeks, the same law has
been used to convict two journalists, a university professor and an
aide to Birdal.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Turks, including the country's senior judge,
have called for the repeal of this and similar laws. The military
and its supporters say the laws are necessary if the state is to
defend itself against religious fundamentalism and the separatist
Kurdistan Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Birdal's case may prove embarrassing for Turkey because he is
well-known in human rights circles around the world. The
International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights accused the
government of harassing him and other critics. Amnesty
International is starting a campaign on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a jailed former commander of Kurdish rebels reportedly
told interrogators that Birdal was a rebel agent, though doubts
later emerged that the prisoner had ever made such a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, gunmen entered Birdal's office in Ankara and
shot him several times. Six men were arrested. Birdal spent several
weeks in a hospital, where he received thousands of letters and
visits from people including Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of
Britain. He carries a dozen metal pins in his body.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say Birdal needs up to two years of physical therapy,
but his plea to defer his prison sentence on medical grounds was
denied.

ANC WINS LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SAFRICA-MBEKI)  
(sw) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDRAND, South Africa _ The African National Congress won a
second term on Thursday in a landslide victory that will probably
give South Africa's next president, Thabo Mbeki, control of more
than two-thirds of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The party won even more votes than it did five years ago, when
it first swept to power in South Africa's historic apartheid-ending
election. In that election, the party won just under 63 percent of
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Late evening returns suggested the ANC may have won more than 65
percent this time, and analysts with the state-owned television
were predicting the final share would be 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, the party's only candidate to replace President Nelson
Mandela when he retires on June 16, claimed victory early in the
afternoon, promising to build a multiracial society and to speed
the pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their millions, and without equivocation, without
hesitation, the people of South Africa have renewed the mandate of
the ANC to run this country,'' Mbeki told hundreds of supporters
who danced and ululated in front of him at the party's headquarters
here.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to govern with humility and ``a deep sense of
responsibility'' and to insure that ``we act together to build a
South Africa which truly belongs to all who live in it, both black
and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, the 80-year-old Mandela tooka back seat
to the reserved Mbeki. Though Mbeki has none of Mandela's ease with
people, he has surprised many analysts by throwing himself into the
handshaking and baby-kissing, sometimes even shedding the suits he
favors for sports shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela went on vacation after casting his vote on Wednesday and
was not present when Mbeki made his speech on Thursday. In fact,
the victory rally seemed to confirm a new era, with the focus
completely on Mbeki. Supporters chanted his name and posters with
his picture filled the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki referred to his predecessor, who served 27 years in prison
for believing that all South Africans should have equal rights,
only at the end of his speech as he thanked him and other ANC
officials for their election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the end of South Africa's apartheid system in 1994, the
country remains deeply divided along racial lines, with most of the
country's wealth still in white hands.
</P>
<P>
   The elections only highlighted the divisions, as most of the
country's blacks _ about 77 percent of the population _ supported
the ANC while most of the country's white, mixed-race and Indian
citizens supported white-led parties.
</P>
<P>
   The African National Congress had set a two-thirds share of
Parliament as its goal, but the goal itself deepened fears in the
minority communities. With such a majority the party will have the
power to change some aspects of the Constitution, though in recent
weeks Mbeki has said repeatedly that he had no intention of doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, 56, has been a powerful behind-the-scenes force here. A
British-educated economist, he is considered an able administrator
and one of the architects of the country's conservative economic
policies. Mandela has said for several years now that Mbeki has
been effectively running the country on a day-to-day basis is his
role as deputy president.
</P>
<P>
   Many supporters of the ANC believe that he will be better able
to crack the whip than Mandela, who is sometimes seen here as too
soft. But his critics worry that he is too sensitive to criticism,
and they point out that his political rivals have found themselves
quickly sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   The country that Mbeki will inherit has already changed a great
deal in five years. It has adopted one of the world's most liberal
constitutions and passed more than 500 laws revamping the
apartheid-era legal system, which classified everyone by race and
prevented nonwhites from voting.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been done to improve living conditions as well. More
than 500,000 houses have been built, and millions of South African
now have electricity, telephones and running water, which they did
not have before.
</P>
<P>
   But the country is beset by crime and an unemployment rate that
approaches 40 percent. Many of those who have new houses, water and
electricity are unable to pay for their services. The education
system is in shambles and the country has one of the fastest
growing AIDS rates in the world. Corruption and incompetence,
particularly in provincial governments, are major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicated that support for the ANC had dipped in late 1998
by about 10 percentage points. But election results suggest that
the party was able to recapture disillusioned supporters by evoking
its history as a liberation movement and casting the next five
years as a continuation of that struggle. ``We lived with apartheid
for 40 years,'' said Themba Ndlovu, 27, a part-time construction
worker who lives in Soweto. ``The ANC needs more than five to make
things right.''

THE ACELA TRAIN IS A BIG DEPARTURE IN AMTRAK TRAVEL AND
ADVERTISING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's the midnight train to Georgia and the last
train to Clarksville, the A train and the soul train, not to
mention the Chattanooga Choo-Choo and the Atchison, Topeka &AMP; Santa
Fe. Now an unconventional campaign seeks to add another name to the
list of familiar rail monikers: Acela.
</P>
<P>
   Acela, pronounced ``a-CELL-a,'' is the brand to be introduced by
Amtrak later this year to designate service in the Northeast
corridor, its most heavily traveled route, replacing the Metroliner
and other trains. There is a lot riding on the fate of Acela,
because Amtrak is counting on the new service to help improve its
financial performance and end its dependence on federal operating
subsidies by 2002, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, with an annual budget of $16 million, is
emblematic of the ambitious efforts being undertaken to make new
brands stand out in an extraordinarily cluttered advertising
environment. Complicating those attempts is the stampede to
introduce ``dot-com'' Internet and E-commerce brands.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why the campaign for Acela, which began Friday is so
unusual, selling with a life-style image approach rather than
promoting service features or disparaging alternative methods of
travel like flying and driving. The pitch, by the longtime Amtrak
agency, DDB Worldwide Communications Group in New York, is as sleek
and slick as Amtrak hopes Acela service will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about just a train ride,'' Barbara Richardson, the
executive vice president at Amtrak in Washington responsible for
marketing, said in a telephone interview, because ``Acela is a big
departure for us, representing a really new change in direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is meant to signal to people who have not
considered us previously that we offer a service they perhaps had
not expected from us previously,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   There will be three classes of Acela service: express, fast new
trains that are to reach speeds of 150 miles an hour; regional,
regular long-distance service linking Boston, New York and
Washington, and commuter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first step in the elevation of the Amtrak product
nationwide,'' said Joseph DiVincenzo, senior marketing director for
the Northeast corridor at Amtrak in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is that there's a reason to travel on
Amtrak,'' he said, ``because Acela is a different product, a better
way to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   After conducting research among customers, the decision was made
to demonstrate that difference by proclaiming Acela to be a
significant improvement in one's quality of life _ a perk on rails,
as it were. ``Life on Acela'' is the campaign theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travelers for the most part said that travel by car or plane
interrupts their lives,'' said Abigail Kolodny, account planner at
DDB, a unit of Omnicom Group, who joined four agency colleagues
this week to provide a preview of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Acela lets you continue your life while traveling,'' she
added, ``working, eating, meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   So posters in the campaign, illustrated with surreal imagery,
carry such headlines as ``Transfer between left and right brain,''
``Find lost time,'' ``Arrive at a decision,'' ``Brainchild on
board'' and ``Return your mind to its upright position.'' One
poster even asserts in a Zen-like way: ``Be productive. Do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Shuldman, group creative director at DDB, said: ``What we
intentionally tried to do was to create an Acela `language,' visual
and verbal, to interpret this new mind-set of traveling. It's very
optimistic, reflecting the feeling of what the train means to
Amtrak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of the campaign is the human benefit of travel,''
he added. ``It's about not only arriving at the center of town, but
centered. You can walk into a meeting and say something intelligent
because the ride didn't dehumanize you.''
</P>
<P>
   The DDB team disputed a suggestion that the campaign may be too
ethereal or flaky to resonate with practical Northeast consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents such a bold departure,'' said Jose Banzon,
management supervisor at DDB, ``because Acela is such a different
experience from any train you've been on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amtrak officials said the campaign ``speaks to sophisticated
travelers and is meant to grab their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff Friday comes with commercials to run in movie
theaters showing ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' The
spots use quirky vignettes of urban travelers to call Acela ``a
place to recharge'' and ``a better place to unwind.'' They will
also run next month in theaters showing the Stanley Kubrick film
``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   The posters will appear as oversized wall hangings on busy sites
in Boston, Manhattan and Washington. There will be television
commercials in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media department and the creative department worked hand
in hand,'' said Jeroen Bours, group creative director at DDB.
``We'd see a wall on so-and-so street and ask, `Can you get us
there?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``They even got us into airports,'' Bours said of his media
counterparts. ``That was hard to do.''

SUPPORT SHRINKS FOR PRESIDENT'S VIEW ON CHINA'S TRADE STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton briefly acknowledged the 10th
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square killings Thursday and argued,
with logic that is meeting increasing skepticism on Capitol Hill,
that only by pushing ahead on expanding trade with Beijing can the
United States remain ``a force for social change in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Though members of Congress were not formally in Washington to
receive Clinton's annual notification that he was renewing ``normal
trade relations'' with China, they said they expected Clinton would
once again prevail. Though Congress has often threatened to revoke
China's trade status, it has never actually done so, even in the
months after Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, by the count of some legislators, the majority in
support of renewal is shrinking, on both the left and the right.
Since reports of Chinese of spying at national nuclear
laboratories, conservatives who once paid scant attention to human
rights issues in China have formed an alliance of convenience with
those who have long advocated linking China's trade status with its
behavior in other arenas.
</P>
<P>
   It is an alliance that clearly leaves some uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and a harsh critic of
Clinton's policy, argued anew that Congress should deny China the
trade benefits _ mostly lower taxes on Chinese goods shipped to the
United States _ because Clinton's ``engagement'' policy ``has not
succeeded in making trade fairer, people freer or the world
safer.'' But she also went after some of the newest critics of
engagement: Republicans who were seizing on the spy scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, with a highly charged partisan atmosphere,'' she
said, ``the Republican leadership now wants to have it both ways.
They want to exploit politically the failures of the Clinton China
policy, while appeasing the business community'' by renewing
China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many members of Congress appear of two minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic minority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, has
consistently voted against renewal of the trade rights, and in a
telephone interview Thursday said he would oppose it again this
year _ and expected ``somewhat more support.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also backs the administration's efforts to strike a deal
with China that would get it into the World Trade Organization.
Part of that bargain would require Congress to drop the annual
debate and grant China a permanent version of what was once called
``most favored nation'' status. (The pro-trade contingent in
Congress argued that the old phrase was misleading, since the
privileges are given to all but a few rogue states.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference,'' Gephardt said. ``If China's accession
to the WTO is done right, it can be a real force for change because
it would provide a real structure of rules and a way we could
enforce them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has been pressing the White House to include some
commitments from China on human rights, something missing from the
current talks on China's membership.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, several members of Congress say they want to
preserve the right to vote each year on China's trade status
because it gives them an opportunity to vent their emotions on one
of the most emotionally charged issues in American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they are under greater pressure from business
constituents, farmers and investors to take the deal that China has
offered, which calls for vast openings in China's market over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have a difficult situation this year,'' said Rep.
David Drier, R-Calif., who has often led the fight to renew trading
rights. ``There's a great temptation to mix this issue with the
findings of the Cox Commission on spying, with campaign
contribution issues and with anger at China's response to the
accidental bombing of their embassy in Belgrade. But to me it still
doesn't make sense to withdraw the one positive thing we have going
with the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration makes a similar case, arguing that even if
China has gone backward on human rights issues (by the State
Department's annual assessment) and security relations are tainted
by the spying report, Washington should not waver from its trade
policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House's argument in favor of engagement is running
into increasing opposition precisely because the predicted results
have hardly materialized.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton switched sides on this debate in 1994 and decided
to separate the annual trade accord from China's human rights
record, he argued that deeper economic engagement would inevitably
open up the country to a more progressive view of rights. He made
that case again Thursday in a written statement, saying trade would
spread ``the tools, the contacts and ideas that promote freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree that is clearly the case: e-mail has changed the
way Chinese communicate with the outside world, and American
companies in China have pressed for clearer laws and insisted on
enforcement of international copyright rules and other conventions.
But China still imprisons dissidents and suppresses challenges to
the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there is growing pressure on the White House to
include at least some vague commitments on human rights in any
agreement to get China into the World Trade Organization. ``Members
will need some cover to retreat from their past positions,'' said
Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Human Rights
Watch/Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But given its current mood, and the anti-American demonstrations
on the streets last month, China seems unlikely to let noneconomic
commitments into its WTO accord.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are badly split. Thursday the House Budget Committee
chairman, John Kasich, R-Ohio, said that at a time of espionage
charges, renewing China's trade status ``sends the wrong message at
the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was in sharp contrast to Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who
warned last week that this year's renewal ``could be in some
jeopardy'' if continued revelations about China ``poison the
environment.'' He has argued for a more tempered approach, one that
recognizes that `'we should not hold all of our other interests
hostage'' to China's behavior.

WITH MORE TRUCKS ON THE ROAD, SHOULD SAFETY RULES CHANGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rivers of cars may have the impression that there
are more big trucks competing with them for space on the highway,
and recent government statistics confirm that their perception is
correct. And although road fatalities are down over all, those
involving heavy trucks are fairly level, at more than 5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy combined with a shift to just-in-time
deliveries has meant a boom for the truck business. National
Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Hall pointed out in
recent testimony that the industry is producing about 220,000 heavy
trucks annually, up from 130,000 a decade ago. Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said the number of miles traveled by trucks
had increased 25 percent in the last four years, and the American
Trucking Associations said in May that mileage could rise 15
percent this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks are getting safer, but not fast enough to keep pace with
their increased use. Large trucks were involved in fatal crashes at
a rate of 2.5 for each 100 million miles traveled in 1997, the most
recent year for which full statistics are available. That is down
by more than half from 20 years earlier, when the rate was 5.4 for
each 100 million miles. (In comparison, the rate for cars in that
period fell to 1.9 from 3.5.)
</P>
<P>
   But truck miles traveled more than doubled in that period, to
191 billion miles from 95 billion miles, so the absolute number of
fatalities did not change much. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, part of the Transportation Department, said in late
May that fatalities totaled 5,398 in 1997, of whom nearly all were
in a car, van, pickup or other light vehicle, not in the heavy
truck. The preliminary number for 1998 is 5,302. (The figures do
not measure whether the accident was the truck's fault.)
</P>
<P>
   Slater, speaking a day before a congressional hearing that
included testimony critical of his department's oversight, was
announcing a goal of reducing truck fatalities by 50 percent over
10 years. He had good reason to try to beat Congress to the punch:
A variety of critics, including his own department's inspector
general, trace safety shortcomings to his department's inspectors,
who these critics say seemed better suited to watching the large,
staid, regulated trucking companies of the past than to to keeping
an eye on the highly competitive, fast-moving swarms of small
operators that dominate the roads now.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is in such flux that the regulators have trouble
keeping track of it. Nearly 500,000 trucking companies are
registered with the department, but regulators say they think that
up to 30 percent have merged or gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last week by former Rep. Norman Mineta, who was
chairman of the House Transportation Committee when he represented
a California district, said that companies less than three years
old had higher crash rates and more safety problems. Tens of
thousands of companies are less than three years old. The
Transportation Department had asked Mineta to do the study.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors spent many hours trying to educate companies on
safety procedures and Transportation Department regulations, said
Kenneth Mead, the inspector general. ``Partnership, collaboration
and education went too far,'' he said, with the department often
agreeing to forgo the collection of fines or other enforcement
measures in exchange for promises to do better. But he said a
significant minority of companies ``had no interest in being
educated.''
</P>
<P>
   One change announced by Slater is a limit on negotiated
settlements and ``wrist slaps,'' and an emphasis on bigger fines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that harsh penalties should replace
education and warnings. The American Trucking Associations,
reacting to a slight decline in deaths in 1998 from the year
before, said this showed the success of ``government partnership in
safety education and outreach programs.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government, though, is moving to get tougher. Slater said
another goal was to double the number of ``compliance reviews,'' or
in-depth examinations of trucking companies, done by each
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The department is also trying to streamline the legal framework
for ordering bad carriers to shut down. Federal law used to require
that the department show a company was an ``imminent hazard''
before it could bar the company, but Mead said the department never
had a working definition of imminent hazard. A law that took effect
this spring changes the standard to ``unfit,'' and the department
is trying to establish a regulation that defines the term.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook, a former administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration who is now president of Public
Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the problem was that the
Transportation Department lacked the research and data base to make
good decisions, as well as ``a capacity to plan or meet deadlines
for issuance of safety standards.'' Many safety advocates outside
the department want truck regulation moved to the traffic safety
administration from its current home in the Office of Motor
Carriers, which they say shares the perspective of the trucking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Slater has resisted the change and pointed to an improving level
of safety which, he said, can be made better yet. Safety experts
say that the biggest improvement in the last few years has been
requiring a commercial driver's license under a national system.
That prevents truckers from carrying licenses issued by several
states and accumulating violations on each.
</P>
<P>
   But Federal Highway Administrator Kenneth Wykle said regulators
had yet to use violations accrued on personal licenses, like
speeding or drunken driving, as a basis for revoking a commercial
license. Truckers involved in fatal accidents are often discovered
to have such violations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest unsolved question is hours-of-service regulations.
That, said Mead, is ``tied directly to fatigue.'' There are limits
on how many hours a trucker can drive and how many he can be on
duty, including loading time, but they are widely flouted, partly
because drivers are paid by the mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with firms that create an environment or a
culture where drivers are expected to drive to exhaustion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the problem varies by the size of the company.
Big companies with deep pockets may fear liability suits and follow
the rules more closely; small ones often don't. But the industry is
heavy with small companies. Mead said that 317,000 companies have
six or fewer tractors; only 2,800 have more than 100 tractors.

KIRSTEN RALOV, DANISH BALLERINA, DIES AT 77  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kirsten Ralov, one of Denmark's greatest ballerinas and an
authority on the unusually sparkling Danish style of classical
dancing, died Sunday at her home in Copenhagen, Denmark. She was
77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Ebbe Mork, a dance writer in
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ralov was celebrated for her performances in the ballets of
August Bournonville, the 19th-century Danish choreographer whose
works emphasize a charming stage presence and fleet and light
footwork. She entered the Royal Danish Ballet's school in 1922 and
spent her artistic life on the stage of the Royal Theater in
Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Her first major performances were in Bournonville ballets: she
made her theatrical debut in a children's role in
``Konservatoriet'' in 1933 and received her first solo part as an
adult dancer in ``La Ventana'' in 1941. She gave her farewell
performance as the Ballerina Doll in Michel Fokine's ``Petrouchka''
in 1962. She then served as a ballet mistress for the Royal Danish
Ballet and was its associate director from 1978 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ralov's repertory in Copenhagen ranged from Myrta, the evil
queen of the spirits in ``Giselle,'' to the sophisticated Street
Dancer in Leonide Massine's ``Beau Danube''; she also danced a solo
role in George Balanchine's abstract ``Symphony in C.'' But she was
essentially a Bournonville specialist, starring in ballets like
``Napoli,'' ``The Kermesse in Bruges'' and ``A Folk Tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ralov also did much to acquaint the world with Danish
ballet. She and her husband, Fredbjorn Bjornsson, who died in 1993,
were among the first Danish dancers to tour internationally,
appearing with a group of soloists at the Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival in 1955 and with the full Royal Danish Ballet at the
Metropolitan Opera House in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   After her retirement as a performer, Miss Ralov staged
Bournonville productions for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two sons.

ROBERT SOBEL, 68, BUSINESS HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professor Robert Sobel, a prolific historian of American
business life whose topics ranged from the economic philosophy of
President Calvin Coolidge to the influence of junk-bond financier
Michael Milken, died June 2 at his home in Long Beach, N.Y. He was
68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was brain cancer, said a spokeswoman for
Hofstra University, where Sobel taught for 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel's first book, ``The Origins of Intervention,'' was
published in 1961, when he was a 30-year-old history instructor at
Hofstra, in Hempstead, N.Y. His latest book, completed as he
underwent unsuccessful cancer treatments, is a study of business
blunders called ``When Giants Stumble,'' just released by
Prentice-Hall Press.
</P>
<P>
   Besides teaching, Sobel was the author, co-author or editor of
more than 50 books and hundreds of articles and corporate profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his books were written for a general audience, but he
never bristled when some scholarly writers dismissed him as a
``popularizer,'' said his colleague and friend George David Smith,
a professor of economic history at New York University. ``Quite the
contrary _ he saw that as his mission in life.''
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop Sobel from taking a gentle revenge on his
ivory-tower critics in 1973, with publication of ``For Want of a
Nail,'' his mock textbook recounting the history of North America
had Britain's Gen. John Burgoyne won the Revolutionary War battle
at Saratoga, N.Y., in 1777. Sobel's spoof included pompous
footnotes about petty disputes among imaginary scholars and a
wholly invented bibliography of ludicrously boring and arcane
references _ as well as an appendix featuring a list of the
``leaders of the United States of Mexico,'' starting with its first
president, Andrew Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But his dominant passion was Wall Street, a metaphysical
neighborhood that had fascinated him since childhood. ``It is as
though you are walking through a historical theme park, with this
engaging man at your side pointing out the sights,'' said Andrew
Tobias, the author and investment guide, in a review in The New
York Times of ``The Last Bull Market: Wall Street in the 1960s''
(W.W. Norton, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   Sobel wrote two studies of the New York Stock Exchange and two
books on the American Stock Exchange. Friends said he considered
``The Life and Times of Dillon Read'' (Dutton, 1991) to be his
finest book, but he produced other notable profiles of Wall Street
characters, including ``Dangerous Dreamers: The Financial
Innovators from Charles Merrill to Michael Milken'' (John Wiley &AMP;
Sons, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   To that he added a history of financial panics, a history of
speculative bubbles, and an account of the frenzied market of the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Richard Sylla, an economic historian at New York
University, acknowledged that Sobel's ``pot-boiler style''
sometimes drew criticism in academic circles. ``But specialized
scholars could learn a lot from him _ and you are talking to one
who did,'' Sylla added.
</P>
<P>
   While in graduate school, friends say, Sobel found that he loved
to write. ``He was a compulsive writer,'' said Smith. ``He was
miserable when he was not writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an academic realm where publishing is often
considered the grim alternative to perishing, Sobel's published
works were only one tributary of the broad river of words he
produced. Unlike most academic writers, he was happy to ghost-write
business books bearing other people's names. And he collaborated on
a host of biographical projects that never reached a public
audience, including the privately published memoirs of Joseph
Cullman, the legendary leader of Philip Morris, and an authorized
biography of Louis Wolfson, an early pioneer in corporate takeovers
who ran afoul of Federal securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel was clearly less enthralled by the corporate world, but
that only slightly affected his output. His corporate histories
included studies of RCA, ITT, the Penn Central Railroad, the
automotive industry, the tobacco industry, the Trammell Crow
construction empire and two books on IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out his bookcase were economic assessments of Herbert
Hoover and Calvin Coolidge and studies of the American Revolution,
the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sobel was born and raised in the Bronx, the son of a
commercial draftsman who drew promotional posters for the Loews
chain of movie theaters. He was educated at James Monroe High
School and the City College of New York, and earned his master's
degree in history at New York University in 1952 before enlisting
in the armed forces during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   He later told family members that he had hoped to be a military
intelligence officer but was turned down because of unfounded
suspicions that he was related to Morton Sobell, another City
College graduate who was a figure in the spy case involving Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg. Instead, he served as an administrative clerk
in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to New York University after his discharge in 1955.
He worked as a history instructor there and, starting in 1956, at
Hofstra while working on his doctorate at NYU. After his degree was
conferred in 1957, he joined the faculty at Hofstra, where he
remained for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he was awarded the university's Lawrence Stetson
Distinguished Professorship in business history, which he held
until his retirement in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For all the years he spent in the classroom, friends say that
teaching history did not satisfy him as much as writing history _
or, indeed, writing anything.
</P>
<P>
   Besides producing books, articles, book reviews, and scripts for
television and audiotapes, he was a weekly columnist for Newsday
from 1972 to 1988. At the time of his death he was a contributing
editor to Barron's magazine. He also worked as a consultant for the
Winthrop Group in Cambridge, Mass. His family says that two
completed book manuscripts are scheduled for publication
posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel is survived by his wife, Carole Ritter Sobel of Long
Beach; his mother, Blanche Sobel of Riverdale; a brother, Alan
Sobel of Brooklyn; two children, Barbara Sobel of Queens and David
Sobel of Alexandria, La., and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held for Sobel in September at the
Hofstra campus, where flags have been lowered to half-staff in his
honor.

TALK OF A RUN BY FIRST LADY HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It looks like she's really going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, it seems, is really going to run for the
US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The only other New York Democrat who has expressed interest in
the seat, Representative Nita Lowey of Long Island, called her
Thursday to say she has dropped her Senate plans and will run for
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Lowey had been saying for months that she would not mount a
campaign for the Senate seat if Clinton ran for it _ and Thursday,
the congresswoman said, it looked more and more clear that the
first lady is going to run.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Clinton offered no encouragement to Lowey, nor did she
dispel the premise of her decision. Rather, in a written statement
issued through her press office, she said, ``I thank Nita for her
support. I look forward to working with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chief political adviser, Harold Ickes, turned this
eyebrow-raising development into a tempest when he told the
Associated Press, later in the day, that the first lady ``has every
intention of setting up an exploratory committee'' for a Senate bid
``in early July.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's politics, that is practically the same thing as
tossing your hat in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this tantamount to declaring her candidacy for the
Senate?'' mused Hank Sheinkopf, a leading Democratic consultant
here. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes backpedaled Thursday evening and said in phone interview:
``If I said what I was quoted as saying, I overstated things. Mrs.
Clinton is going to continue to press forward, as she has in the
past. But no decision has been made about an exploratory
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a source close to Clinton said, on condition of
anonymity, ``Mrs. Lowey's no longer in, Mrs. Clinton has said she
very much wants a Democrat to keep that Senate seat, and there's no
other candidate standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby made a point that follows that logic to the
next step: ``What if she doesn't run now? She will have shafted New
York Democrats in a big way. They had no other candidate.'' Zogby's
conclusion: ``She's running.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, people close to New York City Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani _ who has already formed an exploratory committee _ have
said in recent days that he will ``definitely'' run for the Senate
if Clinton is his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's chomping at the bit for her,'' one associate said.
</P>
<P>
   So, the race that every politician, bookie, and newspaper
columnist in the state has been pining for seems about to come
true.
</P>
<P>
   Forming an explorary committee is particularly crucial for
Clinton because it will allow her to raise campaign funds and,
therefore, pay for trips to New York out of her own budget. In her
increasingly frequent trips here lately, she has scheduled enough
appearances that could be deemed ``official White House business''
to justify flying on a government plane. However, as these trips
have become more obviously political, she has been criticized for
campaigning at taxpayers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts of both parties agree that Clinton comes into this race
with a long list of pluses and minuses, many of them stemming from
the same set of qualities.
</P>
<P>
   When politicos started buzzing about a possible
Hillary-for-Senate campaign late last year _ at first, as a lark,
with no authorization or even apparent interest from the first lady
herself _ polls showed her beating Giuliani, in a hypothetical
race, by over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, every poll shows a very tight contest. Some show her
winning, some show her losing, but in every case, the margin of
victory or defeat is narrower than the poll's statistical margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   They all show Clinton winning big in New York City, where the
population is overwhelmingly Democratic. They also show her
winning, generally, among blacks, Hispanics, union workers, and _
though not by much _ women.
</P>
<P>
   However, the polls show her losing in the suburbs, upstate, and
among white men.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone expects it to be one of the closest, most bitterly
fought, and most amply funded Senate races next year.
</P>
<P>
   The polls suggest one major issue will be the charge that
Hillary Rodham Clinton is a ``carpetbagger,'' someone who has never
lived in New York, rarely walked down any of its sidewalks, and who
is using the state for her own national ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that more than 40 percent of voters are concerned
about Clinton's nonresident status _ even though she has said she
will move to New York after leaving the White House, no matter
what. The issue has also become a guaranteed laugh-and-applause
line in Republican speeches across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats dismiss the concern, pointing out that Robert F.
Kennedy was elected senator here in 1964, despite his obvious
Boston accent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sheinkopf, who hastened to note that he supports
Clinton, said the carpetbagger label could hurt her. ``People
forget RFK was the brother of the slain president,'' he said.
``They also forget Lyndon Johnson won New York state that year by
over 2 million votes. Al Gore isn't going to win New York state by
that much. Bobby also spent time in his youth in New York. And _
not least _ he was Irish Catholic. The Catholic vote determines
outcome in this state. And Catholics usually elect Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of recent Catholic officeholders in New York is
impressive: Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (who is retiring from
the Senate seat in contention), Governor George Pataki, former
governors Mario Cuomo and Hugh Carey _ and Giuliani.

 &HT;    2 reporters ordered jailed in Jewell suit
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two reporters for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
must go to jail until they reveal confidential sources for stories
about former Olympic bombing suspect Richard Jewell, the judge in
Jewell's defamation suit ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's attorneys immediately appealed to a higher
court, blocking enforcement of the contempt order by Fulton County
State Court Judge John Mather until the appeal is settled.
</P>
<P>
   That could take up to a year, said Lin Wood, Jewell's lead
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell, a security guard at Centennial Olympic Park when a bomb
exploded in July 1996, was initially lauded for spotting the
knapsack that held the explosive. An Albany woman died and 111
people were hurt in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution was first to report that he was a
subject of the criminal investigation. Federal authorities cleared
him of any wrongdoing in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell sued the newspaper in January 1997. His suit says
articles portrayed him as someone with a strange work history and
personality who probably was guilty. He is seeking tens of millions
of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages. He settled
lawsuits with CNN, NBC and a former employer, Piedmont College, for
undisclosed amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arose during pre-trial interviews when Jewell's
attorneys asked the reporters to identify law enforcement officials
who gave them information about Jewell. Mather ordered the
reporters to do so in April 1998. Georgia has a law that protects
reporters from naming sources in some instances, but Mather wrote
that the law does not apply when the reporters are parties to a
lawsuit or criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Mather twice again ordered the reporters, Kathy Scruggs and Ron
Martz, to comply, writing in March that a recent state Supreme
Court decision supports ``what is apparent'' in the law.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper again refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's indulgence has now expired,'' Mather wrote
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He found the reporters ``in civil contempt'' and ``in willful
and continued disobedience of this court's directives.'' He wrote
that they have until 2 p.m. Saturday to report to the Fulton County
Jail, but added that an appeal would prevent their jailing while
the Georgia Court of Appeals considers the case.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court also might be asked to decide the issue
after the Court of Appeals, but it could decline.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both sides said they expect to win on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has ruled correctly, and, really, this was the only
thing he could do,'' Wood said. ``The newspaper and these reporters
never gave him any options.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper attorney Peter Canfield said Mather's order was
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that the appellate courts will find this order
unnecessary and that this whole case should have been thrown out a
long time ago because the Journal-Constitution's reporting was
accurate,'' Canfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, 17 reporters have been held for contempt of
court since 1984, some for just a few hours, said Jane Kirtley of
the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Washington.
Only one case, in 1984, involved libel. Currently, three other
reporters in the United States are fighting judges' efforts to jail
them for refusing court orders, all in criminal cases.

 &HT;    N.C. gives Dole fund-raising boost in home state
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Four months after she announced her
presidential aspirations to shouts of ``Run, Liddy, run,''
Elizabeth Dole returned to North Carolina this week seeking a
down-home boost to her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In $1,000-a-person gatherings in Charlotte and Greensboro, the
former American Red Cross president who served in the Bush and
Reagan cabinets raised an estimated $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to speak at a Virginia high school graduation today
and resume campaigning Saturday in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless your heart,'' Dole told nearly 200 supporters who lined
up Thursday to meet the undeclared presidential candidate at the
Greensboro City Club, a private facility atop the city's tallest
building.
</P>
<P>
   But the Salisbury native hasn't been able to quiet doubts that
she remains a longshot to become the first woman to win the
presidency. Also uncertain is whether ``North Carolina's favorite
daughter'' _ as her supporters affectionately call her _ can defeat
Texas Gov. George W. Bush Jr., even in her home state. She trails
Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in national
fund-raising and in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the presidential primary will be held May 2,
two months after California, New York, Georgia and numerous other
states hold primaries that could give Bush a nearly insurmountable
lead, if his campaign doesn't falter.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina will send 62 delegates to the Republican National
Convention, a relatively small number that suggests Dole is
campaigning in the state more to raise money than to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   Dole needs to step up fund-raising dramatically the rest of the
year or risk being far behind Bush going into the big advertising
blitz preceding next May's primary, said Dan Gurley, political
director of the North Carolina Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Dole is in the midst of a two-month tour that has raised nearly
$1.2 million, on top of $686,000 she reported raising through
March. Bush, the son of former President George Bush, has raised
more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember that we've only been at this for four
months,'' Dole said, adding that recent overflow crowds at campaign
events suggest her campaign is gaining steam.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two of North Carolina's seven Republicans in the U.S.
House have endorsed Dole. Two have endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble (R-Greensboro), who endorsed Dole, said he is
puzzled by others' reluctance to do so. ``Not only is she
qualified, she is my neighbor down the road,'' Coble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of everyday Republican politicians apparently see Bush
as a more likely presidential nominee than Dole,'' said Ferrel
Guillory, director of the Program on Southern Politics, Media and
Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   After her speech, Dole's supporters gathered round her. Some who
haven't yet decided to vote for her said they respected her
straight talk on controversial topics, such as gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elizabeth Dole is a North Carolina girl,'' said former
Greensboro Mayor Jim Melvin. ''That is enough reason to support
her.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Elizabeth Dole is a great leader, and she will definitely make
a substantial mark,'' said Kathy Lubbers, daughter of former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. She owns Carolina Coffee in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   If Dole decides to seek the presidency, her official
announcement would likely come in September, said Ari Fleischer,
Dole's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Talk in Republican circles has swirled around prospects for a
Bush-Dole ticket, a combination that pundits say would appeal to
conservative Republicans as well as women of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dole nor her Greensboro supporters were inclined to talk
about that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not doing this to be vice president,'' said Dole, who
drew rousing applause when she said she looked forward to riding in
Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the crowd during a 40-minute speech, saying it
feels ''great to be back in my stomping grounds where I do not need
an interpreter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of her toughest talk centered on gun control, an issue she
said might cost her Republican support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you think of any reason a family needs an AK-47 or an Uzi
to protect their family or go hunting?'' asked Dole, who favors
child safety locks on guns and instant background checks on people
trying to buy guns.
</P>
<P>
   While Dole did not mention Bush or Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic presidential front-runner, she criticized the Clinton
administration's foreign policy, particularly in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country has no comprehensive foreign policy at this time
_ all of the stops and the starts and the threats that have not
been carried out,'' Dole said.

 &HT;    Columbine students' visit helps heal Georgia counterparts
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Heritage High School students have been offered
extensive counseling and support over the last two weeks, but a
concerned community couldn't really speak from experience about the
emotional aftermath of knowing that a classmate had chosen to open
fire on the student body.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, some of them met with five students from Littleton,
Colo., who had the misfortune to be uniquely qualified for the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a lot of people to tell us they understand what we
were going through, and they don't,'' said Heritage junior Zach
Moore, 16. Of his new friends from Colorado, he said, ``They
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Five students from the Littleton, Colo., school met with their
counterparts from Heritage at Smyrna Presbyterian Church's
campground in Conyers. They laughed, listened to music and talked
about grades, their plans for the summer and the future.
</P>
<P>
   They also talked about their painful past. Heritage sophomore
Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon opened fire on his classmates May 20,
exactly one month after the shooting at Columbine. Six students
were injured at Heritage, but none died. A teacher and 14 students,
including the two attackers, died at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're miles and miles apart, but we have so much in common
now,'' said Columbine student Michael Staver.
</P>
<P>
   That shared experience is what brought the Columbine students _
all rising seniors _ to Rockdale. While many people reached out to
help the Columbine students after the shootings took place,
conspicuously missing were representatives from schools where there
had been previous shootings, said Columbine student Barbara
Schnieder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have helped us an awful lot, if someone from one of
the other schools had come and talked to us,'' she said. ``It took
us a month to get over this. We are just hoping to speed things up
for the Heritage kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine students came up with the idea of visiting
Rockdale during an English class. They called the Rockdale school
system, which told them that an event for Heritage students was
being planned at Smyrna Presbyterian. The students then talked to
the Symrna organizers, who agreed to house them in the campground
cabins and to pay for meals. Delta Air Lines provided the
transportation. The students will fly home this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Two Columbine parents and a teacher from the school also
attended the gathering. They declined to speak to the media but met
with parents and faculty later in the evening. Security was tight
around the event, and reporters were kept away.
</P>
<P>
   While event organizers provided music and an opportunity for
Heritage students to sign each other's yearbooks, the Columbine
students became the focal point of much of the day, said Georgia
Conner, Christian Education Youth director for Conyers Presbyterian
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times there would be one or two Columbine students
surrounded by a large number of Heritage students,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helped the healing process for us,'' said Heritage
student Kent Harris, 16. ``It is good. It's been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine students also went bowling Wednesday and visited
Heritage to see what the school looked like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really surreal,'' Schnieder said. ``It was eerie
because it made me think that it really wasn't that different.

IN DEFENSE OF THE SINGLE AND CHILDLESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine working for a company that bases compensation on family
status. If you have a spouse and children, you are paid more, even
though single, childless employees seem to work longer hours.
Singles hardly ever reach the highest levels of management. And the
company does just about everything it can to discourage single
employees from mating.
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous, no? You'd expect activists to be screaming about
such blatant discrimination, and lawyers to be filling the courts
with briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, though, many American companies, hectored from almost
every side to make the workplace ``family friendly,'' are moving in
exactly that direction. Magazines heap laurels on the best
workplaces for working mothers, with their flexible hours, on-site
child care and so forth. But who extols companies that treat
everyone equally, regardless of family status?
</P>
<P>
   Many companies blithely discriminate against childless singles
by offering employee benefits that are worth most to people with
families: health and life insurance, subsidized child care,
pensions with survivors' benefits and so on. Those goodies add up
to a major workplace inequality that stands unchallenged despite
universal obeisance to the concept of equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace favoritism for ``family men'' over ``career girls''
has historically been a nemesis of equal-rights advocates. Remember
the episode of the ``Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in which Mary learned
that a man in her job was paid more? The reason should be obvious,
Lou Grant replied, as bosses have for decades: The guy's got a
family.
</P>
<P>
   If the equal-pay part of the equation is skewed, so is the idea
of equal work. Who stays behind, after all, when the mom-and-dad
exodus begins at 5:30 p.m.? Who shoulders the extra office burdens
when a co-worker stays home with a sick child?
</P>
<P>
   All of this buys singles no altitude on the corporate ladder.
Unmarried chief executives are a theoretical possibility, but
rarely found in nature.
</P>
<P>
   It's a miracle that most childless singles _ nearly one-third of
all workers _ don't stay that way. In recent years, frantic efforts
to desexualize the workplace may have had the unintended effect of
forestalling matrimony for singles who spend so much time on the
job they can't possibly meet people anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   For every harasser or adulterer deterred by the reintroduction
of taboos against office romance, dozens of potential healthy
relationships must be nipped in the bud. Talk about a hostile work
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Policies that hurt singles probably land hardest on gay people,
who cannot marry their partners, and, in most jobs, cannot even
obtain benefits for them. It's a rare company these days that will
acknowledge paying less or denying a promotion because an employee
is gay, even in states with no laws forbidding it. Yet companies
are proud of pro-family policies having the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   Workers almost never claim discrimination for being single and
childless. One reason is that they lack the protected status of
other groups. Another may be that single, childless people like the
environment at companies with family benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Levey, a management consultant with WFD Inc. in Boston,
cites a ``halo effect'' that makes everyone feel better about
companies that treat families well.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the work burden may not be as unequal as people
think. Mary B. Young of Boston University, who is writing a book
about work-life issues for singles, surveyed employees at two large
companies and found no difference in work time between childless
singles and others, though nearly all thought singles worked
longer.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that market forces are alleviating the problem.
Many companies, especially small ones, are shifting the costs of
employee benefits to workers or scrapping benefits entirely,
producing a kind of equity of misery.
</P>
<P>
   And for the growing legions of self-employed in the new
``free-agent economy,'' it's strictly fee for services regardless
of one's home life. So you may get the fairest shake when you work
on your own. &QL;

ALEXANDER REDUCES CAMPAIGN OPERATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with the difficulties of raising money in a
crowded Republican field, GOP presidential contender Lamar
Alexander scaled back his campaign operation, his aides said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The former Tennessee governor will be reducing staff and
concentrating limited resources on staging an upset victory in the
first caucuses in Iowa in February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign advisers acknowledge that Alexander has had a tough
time raising money because GOP front-runner George W. Bush has been
so successful in vacuuming up cash around the country. Bush aides
say the Texas governor is expected to have raised $15.2 million by
the end of this month, a record at this stage of a White House
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tough fund-raising environment right now,'' said Tom
Rath, a top Alexander adviser in New Hampshire. Rath said the
perception of Bush as the front-runner has ``impeded the cash flow
to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got Bush and you got the rest of us,'' said Alexander's
political director Brian Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is expected to raise about $2.5 million by the end of
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the staff will be reduced from 38 to 34, with the
communications director and legal and research staffers among those
to be let go.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy also said the campaign will be beefing up its
Iowa operation in the hopes of breaking through in that key primary
state.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any place that the Alexander operation has a chance
to shake up the conventional wisdom it is in Iowa, where the
candidate has built up an impressive grass-roots operation headed
by Republican former Gov. Terry Branstad.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign officials are hoping that if they can stage a
surprise upset, first in an Iowa straw poll in August, and later in
the Iowa caucuses next February they will improve their
fund-raising prospects and ability to compete in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign has always been about a strong showing in Iowa.
It is the ignition point,'' said Steve Schmidt, who will leave his
post as Alexander's communication director July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said he will continue as a consultant to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say that Alexander has had more difficulty
making headway this time than during his first unsuccessful bid for
the White House in 1996. A centrist Republican, not only is he
competing with Bush for the establishment GOP vote, but also with
former Red Cross chief Elizabeth Dole and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz
_ both of whom are better known among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has consistently trailed these candidates in national
and statewide polls.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said the Alexander campaign
is ``nowhere in the national polls and not where they should be in
the early primary polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said that Bush, McCain and Dole would benefit if
Alexander were to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   McCain added celebrity luster to his campaign Thursday with the
announcement that cosmetic queen Georgette Mosbacher has been named
his national co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Mosbacher's decision to join the McCain campaign could be seen
as a snub of Bush, particularly since she was once married to
prominent Houstonian Robert Mosbacher, an old friend of the Bush
family and President Bush's former Commerce Secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Mosbacher is a Republican National committeewoman from New York.

HARVARD AND YALE, PLUS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. _ History. Tradition. Blood, sweat, and tears.
These are the ingredients that make up the Harvard-Yale regatta,
which will be held for the 135th time Saturday afternoon on the
Thames River.
</P>
<P>
   This matchup, the oldest intercollegiate competition in the
nation dating back to 1852, on New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee,
is gut-wrenching. When the varsity shells square off for the 4-mile
downstream test every oarsman is ready to sacrifice his body for 22
minutes of nonstop rowing.
</P>
<P>
   The races start at 3:45 p.m. when Harvard's undefeated freshman
boat seeks to extend its record to 9-0 over a spunky 4-2 Yale boat.
The Harvard freshmen hope to remain undefeated for their trip to
the Henley Regatta in England later this month when they vie for
the Temple Cup, a trophy Yale's freshmen won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the second varsity race, Yale's boat (no seniors) is 4-1.
Harvard's boat has a 4-2 record and has two seniors aboard.
</P>
<P>
   This is Harvard coach Harry Parker's 37th H-Y regatta. He has a
31-5 mark against the Eli and he's as eager for this race as his
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate challenge for us,'' said Parker. ``This
is the only 4-miler and I love it. I do it for fun. I'm still
fascinated by this race. Every year you attempt to make your boat
go faster. If you get bored with a race like this then you have a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years the equipment has changed, but the athletes are
the same as 30 years ago. They work hard, they're dedicated, and
they work as a team. Really, very little has changed over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has won the varsity eights 13 of the last 14 years and
34 of the last 40. ``Forget the records,'' said Parker. ``You need
a solid performance every year from mostly different people. This
is a race you have to want badly and you go after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard captain Henry Nuzum has a 2-0 record against Yale's
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Nuzum of Chapel Hill, N.C., coxswain Jason Kastner of Naples,
Fla., and stroke Dan Dias of Ocala, Fla., are the only ones back
from last year's boat.
</P>
<P>
   While Harvard's varsity boats are the same as they were at the
Eastern Sprints, Yale coach Dave Vogel has made some changes. Alex
Reid moved from No. 6 to stroke; Mark McCusker from stroke to No.
7; James Donahue from No. 7 to No. 4; Robert Welhoelter from No. 5
to No. 3; captain James Needham from No. 4 to No. 6; sophomore
Scott Proper moved from second varsity stroke to No. 5, replacing
sophomore Robert Wesh, who joins the second varsity boat. Bowman
Lucas McLoughlin and No. 2 Hans von Trotha remain in their places.
</P>
<P>
   Needham rowed in all the varsity races a year ago and was moved
to the second varsity for the Harvard regatta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last chance and I want to take advantage of it,''
he said. ``I worked extra hard last summer and got down from 215
pounds to 195 and I'm rowing better. We've been down here for
practice for three weeks and we had some great workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to beat Harvard badly.''

<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. _ As a vibrant center for space and technology
research, this city in northern Alabama owes much of its character
to an immigrant, Wernher van Braun, the German rocket scientist who
helped create the Marshall Space Flight Center here after World War
II. Proud of its international heritage, the city Friday greets
visitors with flapping roadside banners that welcome newcomers in a
variety of languages.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, a number of Hispanic and Asian immigrants
have found that Huntsville's hospitality vanishes at the door of
the Madison County tax assessor, Wayland H. Cooley. Part of
Cooley's job is to grant legally authorized property tax breaks to
residents who own and occupy their houses. In several instances,
according to a lawsuit scheduled for an initial hearing next week,
Cooley has denied those breaks to homeowners who cannot speak
English.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs _ a Dominican-born husband and wife who are U.S.
citizens and a South Korean-born widow who is a permanent U.S.
resident _ charge that Cooley has denied them the tax reductions
because state law requires applicants to take a simple oath
swearing to the accuracy of information about their property.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley maintains, according to the plaintiffs, other witnesses
and his own testimony, that he cannot vouch for the accuracy of
such an oath if it is not taken in English, even if an interpreter
is present.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Cooley, an 83-year-old Democrat who has held his
elective office for nearly 22 years, has been only too happy to
explain his rationale, according to evidence gathered for the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he had to watch out for people who were trying to
come in from all over the world and skin us on taxes,'' said Mary
Catherine Graham, a financial analyst for the FBI who testified in
a deposition after accompanying a native of Mexico to Cooley's
office last September.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Turner, a real estate agent who offered to interpret for
the Mexican, said in an affidavit that Cooley told her, ``They're
coming over here and taking what's ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The South has seen a surge in immigration from Asian and
Hispanic countries in the 1990s. The growth has created adjustment
problems across the region, particularly in small- and medium-sized
cities that have little experience with foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Texas and Florida, which already had large numbers of
Hispanic residents, the nine other Southern states are expected to
see their Latino population grow by 112 percent from 1990 to 2000,
according to Census Bureau projections.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian population is projected to grow by 72 percent in those
states, while the region's population is expected to increase by 14
percent. By the end of the decade, 3.5 percent of the people in
those states will be of Latin American or Asian origin, compared
with 2 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In towns where large numbers of immigrants have been lured by
jobs in poultry plants and carpet mills, the need for interpreters
and English-language training has strained school systems, courts,
police departments and social service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on immigration say they have been pleasantly surprised
at the relative rarity of cases of blatant discrimination or
violence against immigrants in the South. But they have started to
detect anti-immigrant sentiment in the politics of some areas, and
they say they fear there will be more bias of the type alleged in
the Huntsville case.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date has been set in the lawsuit against Cooley, but a
circuit court judge will hear arguments next week on Cooley's
contention that the case should be thrown out on the grounds that
he did not violate the law and that he has immunity as a government
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs claim that the tax assessor violated the
Constitution's equity protections for non-English speakers, and ask
for both compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, Rhonda
Brownstein, of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.,
charges that Cooley's ``actual motive, his hatred of foreigners, is
nothing more than xenophobia and ethnic prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with the help of interpreters in interviews in their
homes Tuesday, the plaintiffs, Byong Rye Ahn and Julio and Carmen
de Paula Telleria, said they felt demeaned by Cooley's treatment,
which they described as spiteful and sarcastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt less than human when he attacked me,'' said Mrs. Ahn,
63, a hospital housekeeper who came to the United States in 1985
and bought a three-bedroom house the next year with her husband,
who died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. de Paula said Cooley at one point gestured at the ground
with his finger. ``He said, `This is Alabama,' '' she said. ``
`Here you need to know English.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brownstein has calculated that Mrs. Ahn should be paying
$278 in annual property taxes rather than the $677 she is paying.
The de Paulas, she said, should be paying $209 instead of $659
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cooley and his lawyer, Julian Butler, declined to comment
on the case. A brief filed by Butler states that Cooley's
English-only policy is designed ``to prevent potential fraud.'' It
also cites a 1990 state constitutional amendment declaring English
to be the state's official language.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cooley provides all taxpayers with equal services in
English, Butler writes, his practice ``does not classify persons
based on race, ethnicity or national origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Brownstein's office conducted a survey that found
that Madison County, where 3.8 percent of 272,000 residents are
Hispanic or Asian, is the only county in Alabama that does not
allow interpreters to assist applicants for tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state attorney general, Bill Pryor, issued an
opinion last year stating that the English-language provision of
the State Constitution does not restrict non-English speakers from
claiming tax exemptions on their property.
</P>
<P>
   The de Paulas retired to Huntsville in 1995 after immigrating to
New York City from the Dominican Republic in the 1960s. De Paula,
71, had worked as a solderer in a Ford assembly plant in New
Jersey. Mrs. de Paula, 59, had stitched brassieres in a factory in
Brooklyn, N.Y. Both gained citizenship in 1992 under a provision
that allows immigrants of a certain age and tenure in the country
to be exempt from an English-language exam and to take the civics
exam in the language of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the couple bought a modest brick house with three
bedrooms, a garage and an above-ground pool. They paid $54,000.
``It felt like tranquillity,'' de Paula said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, accompanied by their son, Ricardo, who is bilingual,
the de Paulas, went to the tax assessor's office to see that their
new house was registered on the tax rolls as a residence and to
apply for the homestead tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Residential property is appraised for tax purposes at half the
rate of commercial property, and the homestead exemption grants an
additional discount to those who own and occupy their houses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   According to affidavits from all three de Paulas, Cooley
informed them that they could not take the oath to qualify for the
exemptions because they did not know English. He also told them,
the de Paulas said, that an interpreter could not be used and that
exemptions could not be granted to noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo de Paula's affidavit says that he told Cooley that his
parents were citizens but that Cooley said it ``doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, a family friend, Rosa Almanza, called Cooley
to ask whether she could be their interpreter. Ms. Almanza said he
refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I know,'' she quoted Cooley as asking, ``that what you
are translating is the truth?''

GRAF HITS THE HIGH NOTES IN WIN OVER SELES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Did Richard Wagner, the old German tunesmith, have a
vision of Steffi Graf when he chose the legendary and indomitable
warrior Brunhilde as the bold heroine of one of his operas? Same
kind of ladies Brunhilde, the valkyrie, and Steffi, the valiant.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Brunhilde swung a battle ax _ but no more wickedly
than Steffi swung her tennis racket at Monica Seles Thursday to
bring down the house of 16,000 scrunched into Stade Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   Soap operas, horse operas, and Wagner's kind, lyric operas . . .
elements of all were on display as dust swirled and gusted across
the earthen battleground of the French Open, and Graf stormed
through the crimson haze, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-4, to yet another
height that had seemed beyond her in her supposedly declining days.
</P>
<P>
   Three years had passed and numerous disabling wounds incurred
since Graf last graced a major final, the US Open. Nevertheless,
here she is again, in the French title bout for a ninth time (tying
Chris Evert's record), yearning to beat up Saturday on a kiddie who
lifted her No. 1 rating and declared 29-year-old Steffi passe a
couple of years ago: Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, 18, arrived in the rarest of all French semis _ each of
the final four had held No. 1 _ feeling deprived. ``I'm the only
one who hasn't won here,'' she says, believing it's her turn now
after deposing Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the 1998 champ, in a 6-3,
6-2 breeze. Graf, Seles, and Sanchez Vicario have won 11 of the
last dozen championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have surprised even myself,'' Graf is saying, her
riveting blue eyes gleeful and flaxen hair let down and sweeping
across her face as she laughs. ``Monica beat me badly in Australia
and Serena (Williams) at The Lipton. My last tournament, Berlin, I
was a disaster (a loss to Julie Halard-Decugis). I just hoped to
get through a few matches here to get ready for Wimbledon, which I
thought was the only big one I could win anymore. But . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Those eyes were filled with red dirt at one point, and she had
to summon a trainer to wash them out. She might have been washed
out herself then, down a set. But she had resorted to a dainty,
seldom-used trick _ a drop shot _ to go ahead, 3-1, in the second
and life looked better, when she could see again.
</P>
<P>
   And those eyes dripped with tears as Steffi departed the court
where she has ruled France five times since winning her first of 21
majors 12 years ago. Quickly she mopped them aside before entering
a German TV studio to address her homeland. ``I don't like to be
seen crying. But there was a feeling of such joy. I couldn't help
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she thought about what she, Fraulein Forehand, and Monica
had done to each other once again to illumine the tournament. They
took us back to 1992 in the same arena _ their last collision in
Paris _ a final that was a tennis version of the horse operatic OK
Corral. Oh, how they'd plugged away at each other for 2 3/4 hours
before Seles was left standing, 6-2, 3-6, 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one defeat that stays with me,'' Steffi says. ``No, I
wasn't thinking about it today. There was no revenge thing. But it
felt so good to be in the same kind of match on the same court, and
hang in to win like she did back then. It was fun to be part of it,
to know I could still play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Since, they'd gone through so much genuine soap opera stuff:
Monica's stabbing and her father's death, Steffi's aberrant father
cheating on income tax and going to jail, as well as a slew of
injuries for both. Steffi had been hurt by the conventional wisdom
that she won five of her majors only because Monica was absent,
recovering. ``It bothered me for a while, but no more.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, OK Corral, the sequel, they used nearly 2 hours, and
used up each other _ ``my legs were heavy at the end, and I'm sure
Monica's were, too'' _ as the crowd urged them onward. When it
appeared Graf had broken ahead for good at 2-0 in the third, Seles
countered with a run of three games and would lead, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the end. ``I had to risk more, go for my shots,''
Steffi recalls. ``She got more aggressive, and won,'' says Monica.
Despite her gritty exertions and lusty double-barreled groundies,
Steffi was pouring on her own mammoth forehands. And she was
slicingly neutralizing Monica with a crosscourt backhand that
sizzled as low and dangerously as a rattlesnake in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   From 3-4, Steffi was an in-tune and merciless Brunhilde in a
mini and sneakers. She seemed to be wearing valkyrie armor, too,
because there was nothing Monica could do. She seized 12 of the
last 14 points, closing with a battle-axing 100 mile-per-hour
service winner.
</P>
<P>
   If Richard Wagner had been in the audience, he would have
declared, ``Steffi is my kind of Valkyrie. She had to zing for her
supper, and hit C above high C.''

IT'S OFFICIAL: BUSH SIGNS CONSUMER TAX CUTS INTO LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and LISA DAVIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As a crowd of shoppers and sales clerks watched from
the men's underwear and women's hats sections, Gov. George W. Bush
signed into law a set of consumer tax cuts Thursday at Foley's
downtown department store.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sat in the boy's clothing corner while signing the bill,
emphasizing that it eliminates the sales tax on clothing and shoes
bought Aug. 6-8, just before the start of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat who shepherded the
legislation and represents the downtown area, said he picked the
regional retail store for the occasion because it is a symbol of
the city's commerce and the rejuvenation of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The store's executives backed the tax-break bill during the
legislative session, which ended this week. The new law is expected
to trigger back-to-school price reductions and shopper swarms.
</P>
<P>
   The law also repeals sales taxes on over-the-counter medicines
year-round starting in spring 2000, reduces taxes on Internet
service starting in October, and provides tax breaks for small
businesses and for research and development. In Houston, state,
regional and local sales taxes total 8.25 percent on retail
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to touch a lot of lives,'' Bush said.
``Certainly that was the intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Flush with tax revenues in a booming economy, the Texas
Legislature produced a series of sales and property tax cuts that
tracked some _ but not all _ of Bush's campaign promises before his
re-election last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had called for elimination of the sales tax on diapers and
school supplies as well as clothing, but those items will not be
exempt. Nor will clothing and shoes manufactured for athletic use.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone outside of Texas looking to see how the results
reflect on his status as a front-runner for the Republican
nomination for president, Bush saw only positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are watching to determine whether I can set an
agenda, that I can work with people from both political parties and
achieve an agenda,'' he said. ``I think they are trying to
determine whether I am the kind of fellow who does (what) I say I
will do out on the campaign trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, were to attend a reception for
campaign contributors late Thursday at a Houston hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Housemaid Ann Joshua, invited to the ceremony because she cleans
Ellis' house, poured on the praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will mean a lot to hundreds of grandparents and
parents like myself in purchasing clothing for our school children
so that they can look good as well as learn well,'' she
said.``Because when children look well they learn better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At suburban shopping centers Thursday, the law got a generally
positive reaction from shoppers _ with a few reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kids need athletic shoes and most people have to buy them
every year because kids wear them out in gym class,'' said Kim
Penrod, who was shopping for her nephew at Montgomery Ward in a
Houston-area mall. ``If they really wanted to help the parents they
would have included the athletic apparel You can always get shirts
and shorts cheap, but good deals on shoes are harder to find.''
</P>
<P>
   As a mother of four, however, Nautasha Randall said she would
take the help any way it comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty much already giving you a break, so it doesn't
have to be on everything,'' Randall said.
</P>
<P>
   Because buying clothes for so many children is so expensive,
Randall said she had already started purchasing items to spread out
the costs, but would be willing to hold off on her purchases and
save until Aug. 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, these malls are going to be crazy,'' Randall said.
``It'll be like shopping after Thanksgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed that the savings would be worth postponing
shopping trips until August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get back-to-school shopping done ahead of time
because school starts in August, but I'll wait to do it in August
to save money,'' said Eulona Simon, who was shopping at Kid Spot.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Harter, the mother of a 13-year-old and self-described
member of the upper-middle class, said she felt that finding time
to shop was hard enough without trying to schedule it for a
specific weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a nice idea that would have the greatest impact
on low-income families,'' Harter said at another shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers appear unfamiliar with the new law and have not
yet planned any promotions of the tax exemption period in
conjunction with back-to-school advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an option to consider, but we don't have any plans
right now for that weekend,'' said Christina Kerford, a spokeswoman
for Macy's.

OLD GUARD AND YOUNG BLOOD TO MEET IN FRENCH OPEN WOMEN'S FINAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Anybody else would be in traction by now, or resting on
her grand collection of Grand Slam laurels. But Steffi Graf, with
her aching spine and 29-year-old legs banished to the background
while a 22nd career Grand Slam singles title comes ever closer, has
never been one to take a shortcut when there is a more treacherous
route available.
</P>
<P>
   And no Grand Slam tournament presents a greater test of nerve
and verve than Roland Garros, where every match has marathon
potential. Those who flinch when clay grit gets in their eyes and
under their skin, as happened to Graf on this windy day, should
battle elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, a five-time French Open champion who won this title in
1996 but didn't play here last year because of knee surgery,
stormed into the final with a 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-4 comeback against
Monica Seles, the player who defeated her for the 1992 title. The
25-year-old Seles couldn't quite match Graf's gumption on the
critical points of their 1-hour-56-minute semifinal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to take the risks I needed to, especially in the
end of the third set,'' said Graf, whose backhand slices slithered
over the net so low that Seles needed to kneel like a supplicant to
field them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After match point, it was extreme joy,'' the German said about
the instant when Seles buried a backhand return in the net, a
mistake that delivered Graf to her first Grand Slam final since she
collected the 1996 U.S. Open. ``It's great after a few years to be
in a final; it's something I really did not believe that I'd be
able to do when I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's final, Graf will wield a 6-2 record against
top-ranked Martina Hingis, a player who never doubted she would
reach the final here, the only Grand Slam to elude her grasp so
far. The 18-year-old Hingis lit herself a candle at Sacre Coeur
before this event began, and Thursday, after humbling its defending
champion, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, 6-3, 6-2, she said she would not
return to the cathedral again until this title belongs to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go after and say, `Thank God,' if I win,'' Hingis said
of her celebration plans. ``If I lose, no.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't lose often when Grand Slam titles are at stake. In
1997, when she was just 16, Hingis won all three other Grand Slams
but fell one victory short of a sweep when she fell to Iva Majoli
in the final here.
</P>
<P>
   She traced that blunder to the dent in her fitness that occurred
when she fell off a friend's horse and injured her knee during a
springtime ride. The tumble required arthroscopic surgery just
three weeks before the 1997 French Open, and Hingis ran out of
adrenaline and stamina in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hingis' bid for a French Open title was thwarted in
the semifinals by Seles, who turned in a monumental performance
three weeks after the death of her father/coach, Karolj.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Hingis did no riding before this tournament but just
practiced on the red clay after winning her warm-up event at the
German Open. Through six rounds here, she hasn't dropped a set, and
Thursday she needed just 63 minutes to reach her third consecutive
Grand Slam finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tough opponent because she plays really fast and takes
the ball really early,'' said Sanchez-Vicario, now 1-10 against
Hingis. Thursday, the Spaniard, a three-time Roland Garros
champion, found herself in a 5-0 hole before she had even had time
to get her backhand drives oiled. ``She controls the ball really
well. She plays my backhand, and she mixes it up really well. I
give my best, but she was better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, 19-1 on clay this season, was in complete agreement with
the loser's assessment. ``I think we have the same type of game,''
Hingis said, ``just me better in a way, that I have better shots,
better technique. I like playing her.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis ended things on triple match point with one of her better
shots, an inside out forehand that Sanchez-Vicario didn't even
bother to chase. Hingis claimed to like her chances against her
next veteran opponent, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi, with the absence of the last two years, if she would
make it to the finals, I hope she'll be a little nervous,'' said
Hingis, who also implied that Graf, with her five French Open
titles, ought to cede the spotlight to her. ``This is about time
for me, at least one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Graf, whose resolve to grab a 22nd Grand Slam title before
she adopts less physical challenges, wasn't buying into Hingis'
share-the-wealth philosophy. Nor did she expect to be nervous on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure I'll just go out there and play, not really
worry too much about anything,'' said Graf, mindful that that
tactic worked beautifully Thursday after she dropped a difficult
opening set to Seles in a 7-2 tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I lost the first set, I didn't have the feeling
that the match was over at all,'' Graf said. ``I think that showed
in the way I started the second set, I got an early break, and I
started again the third set extremely well with getting the
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf used a backhand drop shot to provoke the forehand error
that put her up by 3-1 in the second set and broke Seles at love in
the first game of the third. Again, it was a forehand mistake by
Seles, who continually felt the sting of Graf's backhand slice,
that gave Graf the break.
</P>
<P>
   Seles appeared to be hampered by her oversized racquet, which
seemed to catch the wind like a butterfly net, as well as by Graf's
attack of her forehand side. Graf, by keeping her slices low and
lethal, took away Seles' option of crackling off any down-the-line
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt my forehand was not really working today, not just
even attacking, but even my defensive forehand was nowhere,'' Seles
said. ``I struggled, maybe because of the wind. I think today was
such extreme wind.''
</P>
<P>
   And such extreme joy for Graf, whose ninth trip to a French Open
final ties her for the record with Chris Evert, a seven-time
champion. When this tournament began, Graf, whose back problems
flared in her tune-up at Berlin, thought her appearance here would
be short-lived and predicted her best chance of winning a Grand
Slam this year would come at Wimbledon. Now she has changed her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's Paris,'' she said.

CHINA TRADE REQUEST DRAWS MIXED REACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's request Thursday to renew trade
relations with China drew a mixed response in Congress, after
reports that China stole US nuclear secrets and the NATO bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposal also coincided with the 10th
anniversary of the military crackdown in Tiananmen Square. That
event, symbolic in many quarters of a flawed Chinese record on
rights, continues to haunt US-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is likely to turn the annual White House request to
extend privileges, formerly known as ``most favored nation status''
and now as ``normal trade relations,'' into a referendum on policy
toward China.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to renew the trade relations. But the vote
is expected to galvanize a potent anti-China bloc on upcoming
issues, including national security concerns and a vote on China's
membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress, Clinton argued that the United States
is best served by improving relations with Beijing. Increasing
trade is the only way to promote reform within China, he said. And
he renewed his pledge to press for closer economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``A policy of disengagement and confrontation would only
strengthen those in China who oppose greater openness and
freedom,'' he wrote. ``Trade ... remains a force for social change
in China, spreading the tools, contacts and ideas that promote
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has 90 days decide on Clinton's request. Since 1980,
every president and Congress has favored trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect the administration will have a fight on their hands
when it comes to renewing normal trade relations with China,'' said
Senator John F. Kerry, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``I personally support the renewal ... and believe our
policies cannot be dictated by knee-jerk reactions to recent
events.''
</P>
<P>
   But other members, especially in the House, are expected to vote
against normal trade relations for a variety of reasons, including
allegations that China stole US nuclear secrets and meddled in US
elections, as well as increased tensions between the countries
since the accidental US bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the president's timing is sad, so too is his policy,''
Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said in a
written statement. ``The administration's China policy has not
succeeded in making trade fairer, people freer, or the world
safer.''
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, said, ``Election fraud, Chinese espionage, and
technology transfers are not likely to help the president make his
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have threatened to make China an election issue, and
the Republican National Committee chairman, Jim Nicholson, issued a
harsh comment. ``Clinton and Gore have pursued a policy of
kowtowing appeasement,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican presidential contenders, Patrick J. Buchanan and
Gary Bauer, also seized on the announcement. They criticized what
both referred to as the ``Clinton-Gore'' China policy, and urged
Congress to vote no on the trade status and the World Trade
Organization membership for China.
</P>
<P>
   But Governor George W. Bush of Texas, and Elizabeth Dole, the
former Red Cross president, backed Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the United States must ``constructively work with
China'' and supports Clinton on seeking to expand trade with
Beijing, said a spokesman, David Beckwith. `
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a former Cabinet secretary, ``supports allowing China to
maintain normal trade relations not pulling the rug out from
American companies trading with China,'' said her spokesman, Ari
Fleischer.

GAUGES MIXED IN ANTICIPATION OF JOBS DATA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices meandered to a mixed finish Thursday as
traders and investors awaited Friday's release of the government's
monthly report on the job market, which will provide the first
broad look at the economy's performance in May.
</P>
<P>
   An overly robust reading, analysts think, will make it more
likely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates _ a
development already anticipated in the futures markets _ at its
two-day policy meeting later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were just trying to jockey for position before
tomorrow's big report,'' said Donald M. Selkin, chief market
strategist at Joseph Gunnar &AMP; Company. ``The key thing to watch is
the average hourly earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of a possible peace agreement in Yugoslavia made little
impression because weeks of bombing were regarded as having played
little role in the spring retreat from record highs. European
markets, however, were thought likely to benefit from an end to
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Nasdaq composite index made the widest swing, but
in contrast to its performance on Wednesday, it weakened in the
afternoon and finished with a loss of 29.09 points, or 1.2 percent,
to 2,403.32, just above its low of the day. Internet stocks were
among the chief casualties, with conditions so soft that at least
two initial public offerings were postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, on the other hand, surged in
the final 15 minutes of trading and ended with a gain of 85.80
points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 10,663.69. American
Express, the biggest contributor to the advance of the blue-chip
index, gained 3 3/16, to 121|.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, meanwhile, scarcely
budged, ending with a gain of 4.73 points, or four-tenths of a
percent, to 1,299.54, as 267 of its components rose and 212
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Strong reports of May sales lifted retail stocks, with Dollar
General up 3 1/16, to 30, Wal-Mart Stores up 1[, to 45{, and Best
Buy, whose president forecast better-than-expected first-quarter
earnings, up 7 7/16, to 55 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, which have been out of favor recently, posted good
gains despite a report that President Clinton is close to a
decision involving Medicare overhaul that would allow the elderly
to pay less for prescription drugs. Pfizer climbed 2\, to 108{,
while Merck, Eli Lilly and Warner-Lambert each gained more than a
point.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of oil-service companies were mostly higher, with
Schlumberger, which was added to the recommended list at Goldman,
Sachs, rising 7/16, to 60 7/16, after trading as high as 62 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks continued to reel from Merrill Lynch's decision
to offer low-cost online trading. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
slumped 2\, to 57[, and Knight/Trimark fell 2|, to 50|, but Paine
Webber, which replaced Bankers Trust in the S.&AMP; P. 500 after the
close, advanced 15/16, to 42}.
</P>
<P>
   Zany Brainy, a retailer of toys, games and books, made its
market debut with the sale of 6.1 million shares at 10. The stock
traded as high as 13[ before closing at 11 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks resumed their slide. Yahoo fell 7[, to 135]; At
Home slumped 9 3/16, to 105\; Star Media dropped 8 11/16, to 40\;
Ebay slid 7{, to 161 5/16; Priceline.com fell 8 25/32, to 84[, and
Amazon.com declined 7 1/16, to 105 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was a moderate 733.3 million shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, up from Wednesday's 730.5 million, with advancing issues
surpassing declining ones by 1,624 to 1,325. There were 48 new
highs over the last 12 months and 45 new lows.

REMAKE OF `CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON' MISSES THE MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In updating ``That Championship Season,'' director Paul Sorvino
and playwright Jason Miller have made a dramatic statement that, in
the parlance of basketball, looks good when it leaves the shooter's
hands but ends up clanging off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   At least it's not an air ball. But you must remember this: A
miss is a just a miss, unless it's a remake of a remake, in which
case you should hit nothing but net.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Championship Season'' is Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning
story about the reunion of a high school basketball team that won
the Pennsylvania state title. As a play, it made its debut in 1972
to wide acclaim. Ten years later, it became a film that was
whistled for several fouls, not the least of which was boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rousing individiual performances from a first-string
cast, the new version airing Sunday on Showtime premium cable
commits a similar violation. Over two long hours, the emotions of
five men are dragged over hot coals, stomped on, run through a meat
grinder and skewered. There's plenty of dramatics, but not much
drama, and the effect is enervating, not energizing.
</P>
<P>
   The blame has to rest with Sorvino, who obviously has a love
affair with Miller's story. In both the Broadway play and the
Miller-directed 1982 film, he played Phil Romano, one of the
ex-hoopsters celebrating the anniversary of the high school team's
state championship. This time, besides directing his first film and
moving the original story from the '70s to the '90s, Sorvino plays
Coach, at whose home four of the champions gather for a little
camaraderie, a little reminiscing and a lot of drinking. The fifth
member of the team _ the guy who made the winning basket _ stays
away, but we don't know why until almost the end of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it isn't long before Coach's dream world is shattered
when his four disciples turn out to be unhappy, tormented souls
with enough excess baggage to shut down an airport.
</P>
<P>
   Romano, the big man on the team, is now a wealthy, ruthless
businessman who has been a key backer of his old teammate, George
Sitkowski, the
</P>
<P>
   town's corrupt mayor. Sitkowksi's campaign manager and
all-purpose sycophant is James Daley, underachieving principal of
the junior high. The fourth member of the group is Daley's brother,
Tom, an alcoholic writer and drifter.
</P>
<P>
   When Romano hints that he might back the mayor's foe in the next
election, the happy times turn sour. The film plumbs the
you-can-never-go-home-again theme to its core, opening wounds so
huge that plasma
</P>
<P>
   should get top billing. Fortunately, the guys have laid in
plenty of alcohol. Medicinal purposes, you know.
</P>
<P>
   As 20 years of jealousy, suspicion, fear, loathing and
insecurity come to a head, the most sympathetic character is the
cynical lush, Tom, played by Gary Sinise, who may be incapable of
giving a bad performance. Sedated much of the time, Tom is the
moral compass of the group who, despite his inebriation, ultimately
provides a sense of direction.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Kinney (as James Daley), Tony Shalhoub (as Sitkowski),
Vincent D'Onofrio (as Romano) and Sorvino are also fine, but
Sorvino the director fails to tie a series of raw, dramatic scenes
together into a believable whole.
</P>
<P>
   That Championship Season. Two-hour cable movie about a group of
men who get together 20 years after they won the state high school
basketball championship. Starring Paul Sorvino, Gary Sinise, Tony
Shalhoub, Vincent D'Onofrio and Terry Kinney. Sunday on Showtime.
Repeats June 16 and June 19. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

LARGE MISSILE ORDER IS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. expects to receive about $1 billion in orders to
replenish stocks of cruise missiles and other weapons fired during
the air war against Serbia, the company's chief exectuive said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lexington-based Raytheon is also considering selling or closing
a Quincy electronics plant that employs about 500 people, said
chief executive Daniel Burnham, and should announce a decision
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham made the remarks to reporters after giving a breakfast
speech at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. The country's third-largest
defense contractor, Raytheon supplies weapons like the Navy's
Tomahawk cruise missile and glider bombs used by the Air Force.
Until Thursday it hadn't quantified how much revenue it anticipates
from the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Observers estimate NATO forces have used hundreds of Tomahawks
to blast targets in the Balkans. Another Raytheon system in use is
a missile decoy device known as the ALE-50, towed behind B-1
bombers and F-16 fighter jets. The pods send out electronic signals
to distract enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force does not discuss its use of the disposable decoy
or its cost, but Aviation Week recently reported that B-1s using
the decoys have avoided harm from 30 Serb missiles fired at them.
An Air Force spokesman declined to discuss the report.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, a Raytheon spokesman said, the company expects to
receive $1 billion in orders within the next year, and it expects
to fulfill those orders over the next three years. ``We are
beginning now to get approvals'' from the Pentagon, Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   The figure doesn't include new orders Raytheon might receive
from other NATO countries it supplies such as Britain and Spain,
Burnham said. In addition to new bombs and missiles, some of the
work will include the refurbishment of older Tomahawks with
satellite-guidance mechanisms to make them more accurate. So far
the US military has allocated $424 million to upgrade 626 older
Tomahawks.
</P>
<P>
   S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said the forecast was in
line with expectations for Raytheon and that the campaign against
Kosovo would likely boost overall US defense spending next year as
well. That should help rivals like Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin
Corp. as well.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also said the company is still reviewing options for its
microelectronics plant in Quincy, which produces components for the
Patriot defense missile and for ground-based radar systems. While
the company has no immediate plans to shut the plant, he said,
Raytheon is ``examining all options'' for its future, including a
possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk, sponsored by Northeastern University, and in
wide-ranging comments afterward, Burnham described his efforts
reshape Raytheon to take advantage of technological changes and to
emphasize customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Since being named Raytheon's chief executive last year, Burnham
has tried to decentralize the sprawling institution and to make it
more efficient through layoffs and reorganizations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those efforts should help Raytheon save about $1.2
billion in 2001, Burnham said, and help the company win more US and
foreign military orders. He also said Raytheon expected higher
profits from civilian projects such as dam-building, which together
generated about 25 percent of Raytheon's revenue of $19.5 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In other matters, Burnham said he was encouraged by a US Navy
decision to give Raytheon a $140 million contract to build a
prototype radar system, making it the likely supplier of the full
shipboard radar system as well.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham declined to discuss how much Raytheon might earn from
such contracts, which analysts estimate to be worth billions. He
also declined to discuss reports in British newspapers that
officials that have selected Raytheon to build a major system known
as the Airborne Stand-Off Radar, or ASTOR.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said the company has heard no decision from British
authorities and doesn't know when it might. Should Raytheon win,
Burnham said, the project work would serve as the basis for a new
surveillance business unit to be based in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Raytheon rose 1/2 to close at 70 1/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

ANALYSIS: MILOSEVIC SURVIVES WAR OF MISCALCULATION WITH HIS POWER
INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ From the start, this has been a war of
miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, led by the Clinton administration, assumed that a
relatively short period of bombing would be enough to cause
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to capitulate over
Kosovo. Drawing the wrong lessons from Bosnia, Western officials
underestimated the historical and cultural importance of Kosovo to
the Serbs. And NATO badly undervalued its political importance to
Milosevic, who rose to power on the promise to protect the Serbs of
Kosovo against the Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   But as he accepted on Thursday a deal not much better than he
was offered before the bombing began 10 weeks ago, Milosevic seemed
to have miscalculated as badly.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, for his part, expected the NATO alliance to split,
particularly as the number of civilian casualties grew. He is
unlikely to have thought Bill Clinton would ignore those casualties
and even intensify the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO's southern tier became frazzled as refugees ran into
Albania and Macedonia and then into Western Europe, the human tide
neither destroyed his impoverished southern neighbors nor sundered
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was right in his calculations that NATO did not want
to risk a ground invasion of Serbia, whose citizens, no matter how
some may revile Milosevic, were willing to die for their country.
</P>
<P>
   While only a ground invasion could sweep him from power, he
ultimately came to believe that NATO could continue its
comparatively costless bombing campaign for many more months,
striking civilian targets as well as military ones and utterly
devastating the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   With his own losses mounting _ at least 1,200 civilians have
died in NATO ``accidents'' and NATO estimated Thursday that at
least 5,000 Yugoslav soldiers and policemen have died _ Milosevic
clearly decided that now was the moment to end an unequal war and
preserve his own power.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is evidently calculating again. At least for now, he
is surviving NATO's war against his country with his power intact.
</P>
<P>
   In a weak political field, he still looks like a titan, and for
many in Serbia _ especially the working classes, the old and the
poor _ he is likely to retain his aura of mastery. His party is
already claiming to have inspired this little nation to a noble
resistance against the combined forces of 19 of the world's most
advanced nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little nation that resisted for two months against
the greatest might that has ever existed in history, and there was
no demoralization, no panic, no mass desertions,'' said Aleksa
Djilas, a historian, exaggerating only a little. ``This has shown
that Western public opinion has proved less humane than we
believed. It was willing to tolerate far higher casualties in the
country being attacked than we had assumed, and it was prepared to
tolerate far fewer casualities on its own side than we had
assumed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's weak democratic opposition parties, largely muzzled
during the war due to censorship, have been eager to say that
Milosevic's problems will really begin after peace is established,
once the patriotic fever has passed and people awake to the
economic ruins around them.
</P>
<P>
   There is some truth to that, even Milosevic insiders agree, as
the country faces a hot summer and a cold winter with demolished
electrical power stations and heating plants.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombs have done enormous damage to Yugoslavia's economy,
already battered by eight years of international sanctions.
Billions of dollars of factories and equipment have been smashed,
along with thousands of jobs, and nearly every important highway or
railway bridge has been holed or destroyed, along with the
country's only two refineries.
</P>
<P>
   And so long as Milosevic and his top aides remain in power, many
of them recently indicted for war crimes, it remains to be seen
whether Yugoslavia will get any serious reconstruction aid or
investment from Western countries or the European Union. The West
is likely to tighten economic sanctions on Yugoslavia, increasing
the sense of isolation of its relatively cosmopolitan citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Western aid itself _ or the promise of it _ is already being
used as a sort of incentive to Serbs to depose Milosevic, by
electoral means or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And it is possible that the Yugoslav army and police, having
withstood NATO's extensive bombing in Kosovo without cracking, will
find that Milosevic has made peace at too cheap a price, discarding
their own sacrifice and that of their dead comrades.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Already, the former general who leads a small democratic
opposition party, Vuk Obradovic, has called for Milosevic's
resignation and asked: ``What was the price of this war? And what
did it accomplish?'' Those questions have now been echoed by the
former mayor of Belgrade, Nebojsa Covic, who broke with Milosevic
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While military casualties have been a state secret in this war,
Yugoslav generals have said recently that they are relatively low,
estimating that 1,800 people have been killed or wounded badly
enough to leave their posts. But NATO officials Thursday, in
response, estimated that perhaps 5,000 Yugoslav military and police
have been killed and more than 10,000 wounded _ the first time they
have provided such figures.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   True or false, the report seems another effort by the West to
increase the political pressure on Milosevic from an angry
citizenry that might feel betrayed by the deal on Kosovo after so
many dead. The Serbs themselves like to speak of their small
families compared with large Albanian ones, and the loss of enough
conscript sons can set off spontaneous demonstrations, like the
ones recently repressed in Krusevac, Aleksandrovac and Cacak.
</P>
<P>
   While Yugoslav officials tried to minimize the importance of
those demonstrations, they also vowed to crush them, and this sort
of war weariness in the southern Serb heartland, where Milosevic
has always found his strength, is likely to have been another
important factor in his decision to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For all Milosevic's new vulnerabilities, he remains lucky in his
fractured, disputatious opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The ultranationalist leader of the Radical Party, Serbian Deputy
Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj, vowed Thursday to quit the
government once NATO troops enter Kosovo. He will no doubt try to
challenge Milosevic in elections, but most Serbs are not going to
find the prospect of even more tension with the world community a
politically attractive platform. Once out of power, Seselj will
also find the draconian press laws he favored put to use against
him.
</P>
<P>
   And the democrats are too busy either knifing each other or
competing for Milosevic's favors in coalition governments to do him
significant harm.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, the prominent leader of the Democratic Party,
has probably destroyed his political career in Serbia by fleeing to
its sister republic, Montenegro, while others remained in Belgrade
under the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement and a
former leader of the democratic opposition, still commands the
largest political following among them. He was prominent in pushing
for an early peace settlement, and he has his own television
station, since his party controls Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic is considered flighty, and as he praised the peace
Thursday, he also made it clear he would be more than willing to
rejoin Milosevic's government, especially if Seselj quits. If so,
he would be a useful interlocutor with the West for the indicted
Milosevic.

THE PERSISTENT TIANANMEN MYSTERY: HOW MANY DIED IN 1989? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ It remains a mystery to this day: How many
people were killed in the crackdown near Tiananmen Square on the
night of June 3-4, 1989?
</P>
<P>
   The massacre is widely considered China's most significant
political event in a generation, an event that people still discuss
10 years later. Yet there is a gaping hole in every conversation
that touches on the protests. Just how bad was it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The most honest answer is we don't really know,'' said Sophia
Woodman of Human Rights in China, who recently helped compile
eyewitness accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have never made public a full accounting of the
dead and injured, and they have stymied outside efforts to do so
with a campaign of silence. Nor is there a clear consensus among
Chinese and Western witnesses or human rights monitors, whose
estimates of the dead range from several hundred to more than
2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Without solid information, Western journalists who write about
the event routinely use the same phrase that ``hundreds, perhaps
thousands,'' were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ding Zilin, a retired professor in Beijing whose son was killed
that night and who has become a leading campaigner for government
accountability, said the 155 names of verifiable victims that she
had collected probably represented part of the fatalities. Yet she
does not hazard a firm estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The only public government document is vague on casualties.
Entitled ``Report on Checking the Turmoil and Quelling the
Counterrevolutionary Rebellion,'' it was released on July 6, 1989,
by Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong, who is currently in prison for
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 3,000 civilians were wounded and more than 200,
including 36 college students, died in the riot,'' Chen wrote.
``Among the nonmilitary casualties were rioters who deserved the
punishment, people accidentally injured, doctors and other people
who were carrying out various duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that report, no senior official has spoken out about the
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems remarkable that such a central fact remains hidden,
apparently known to a handful of Communist leaders, it is a potent
symbol of how closed politics here remain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodman argued that the question of fatalities distracted
attention from a more important issue, that the army followed
orders to carry out a massacre of unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fired at random,'' she said. ``No warnings were given.
They prevented evacuation. They fired at people who were running
away. This was not about crowd control. This was a massacre.''

DUO IS GAME FOR PATIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ An upset victory by Patience Game, the (begin
ital)other(end ital) California colt in the Belmont Stakes, would
mean a turnabout for jockey Kent Desormeaux and a breakthrough for
trainer Alex Hassinger.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux rode Real Quiet in the 1998 Belmont, and the jockey's
early surge into contention and effort to turn the colt's head so
he'd see Victory Gallop coming were widely blamed for losing the
Triple Crown. Desormeaux replaced Corey Nakatani aboard Patience
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger, the 36-year-old nephew of Breeders' Cup founder John
Gaines, was hired as private trainer for The Thoroughbred Corp.
after the ownership group headed by Saudi prince Ahmed Salman fired
Wally Dollase in March.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger had been ``exploring other things'' after the failure
of the public stable he opened after leaving a similar
private-training job with Allen Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger trained 1992 champion 2-year-old filly Eliza and
trains 38 Thoroughbred Corp. runners at Santa Anita. But to many he
will always be the guy who had Cigar before a move to Bill Mott's
barn and softer Eastern dirt tracks turned that undistinguished
colt into a two-time Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger said he doesn't mind being known for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart tells me I did the right thing by the horse,'' he
said. ``He was just a late-developing horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience Game, by Woodman, sire of 1991 Belmont winner Hansel,
is a late bloomer too. He didn't race at 2 _ Hassinger claimed he
doesn't know why because he didn't train him then _ and broke his
maiden on the third try at Santa Anita in March before winning the
Derby Trial at Churchill Downs less than a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a rough trip to fifth place in the Preakness,
Patience Game was shipped to Belmont so Hassinger could see if he
liked the sandy track. Sharp workouts said ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger said he sees no reason to think Charismatic isn't the
horse to beat in the Belmont. But Patience Game is ``improving step
by step,'' the trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   With the second-fewest starts (five) and second-lowest earnings
($117,776) in the 12-horse field, Patience Game is 20-1 on the
Belmont morning line.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action: Best of Luck, the Peter Pan Stakes winner
trained by ``Giant Killer'' Allen Jerkens, turned in the morning's
only full-tilt workout, going half a mile in 49 3/5 seconds and
galloping out 5 furlongs in 1:02.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have liked him to go a little faster, but he seems to be
doing OK,'' Jerkens said.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic jogged 1{ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Packing 'em in: Belmont Park officials are predicting a crowd of
80,000 Saturday, about the same as last year's, which was the
largest since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But the race, scheduled for 5:27 p.m. New York time, has to
compete for local sports fans' attention against a Mets-Yankees
game at Yankee Stadium (1:15 p.m.) and the Indiana Pacers-Knicks
NBA playoff game at Madison Square Garden (6:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   The track is advertising itself as the ``ideal'' place to watch
the baseball and basketball games on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Here's something the games don't offer: Belmont Park will have a
guaranteed $1 million pick-six pool Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fast track: Sun and temperatures in the low 80s are predicted
for Belmont day.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward: D. Wayne Lukas said that when he was training his
first Belmont horse _ Tap Shoes, sixth in 1981, behind Summing _ he
studied videotapes of past runnings of the race to look for
tactical secrets.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I determined from watching those tapes,'' Lukas
said. ``It's a real good idea to have Secretariat.''
</P>
<P>
   One-track mind: Bob Lewis, who, with his wife Beverly, owns
Charismatic, calls horse racing ``the only sport in the world that
has legalized parimutuel wagering.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than greyhound racing and jai-alai, he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Modern sports: Charismatic's licensing and merchandising rights
have been assigned to the National Thoroughbred Racing Association
by the Lewises.
</P>
<P>
   Expect T-shirts, caps and ``collectibles'' _ we'll be the judge
of that _ bearing Charismatic's likeness and the Lewises' green and
yellow.

YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., N.C., Fla., Kan.)   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, Joseph and Joyce Ensminger moved from their home
state of Kansas to Green Valley, Ariz., a retirement community
about 20 miles south of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   They went there because Ensminger, now 88, had been hospitalized
with pneumonia and they were seeking a warmer and drier climate.
</P>
<P>
   This month, they are moving back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Green Valley is a lovely place, but I miss my children and
family,'' Mrs. Ensminger, 73, said. ``After all, family is
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   She concedes that she wants to return more than her husband, and
that he is going along to please her. ``Joe recently had a serious
operation and he feels a little mortal,'' she said. ``He wants to
know that I am all settled before something happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ensmingers are not alone. Many retirees move to another part
of the country, then decide to return to where they had lived and
worked most of their lives. Usually, they long to be closer to
family members, often because of failing health or the death of a
spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they don't make new friends or otherwise decide that
they don't like their new environment as much as they thought.
Arizona or Florida can be wonderful in February; August is another
story.
</P>
<P>
   Such havens attract a surprisingly small percentage of all
retirees. Precise figures are difficult to come by, but Charles F.
Longino Jr., a gerontologist at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C., uses census data to estimate that only about 5
percent of retirees actually move to another state. Of that share,
about 1 in 10 eventually return, or reverse migrate. According to
the most recent available data, 104,000 people over 60 years old
moved from New York to Florida between 1985 and 1990, and 9,000
moved to New York from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 survey by AARP, 8 of 10 Americans 50 or over said they
wanted to stay in their own homes and never move.
</P>
<P>
   Some retirees, especially from the Northeast or West Coast, move
to cut their living costs. Others seek a better climate. But the
trade-off can be separation from familiar people and surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   For the Ensmingers and others like them, the trade-offs were not
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Ensminger is a retired sports referee and sales manager for a
safety-glass manufacturer; Mrs. Ensminger is a retired public
school administrative assistant. The two have been married only 11
years, and it's the second time around for both.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they have 6 children, 15 grandchildren and 3
great-grandchildren. They are selling their home in Arizona and
building a new one in Overland Park, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   For Ensminger, his wife's social and personal considerations
outweighed the virtues of a Sun Belt climate. ``It bothers Joyce
that she doesn't have any close friends,'' he said. ``Also, people
out here don't entertain like we're used to. We're accustomed to
bridge parties and dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in many ways it's ideal for me. I love to golf and swim
and go for walks. I love the atmosphere _ you wake up every morning
and the sun is shining. It's a great place to retire. My wife likes
a lot about it, but she wants to be near her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 1,200 miles from Kansas City. One family member has been
out once and another twice. To see our family we have to travel
there. Now we'll be back with people we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many retirees who are tempted to leave their new locales,
however, have decided to stay put. A second move can be stressful,
as well as expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Jean S. Beals, 77, moved to Naples, Fla., from
Mount Holly, N.J. A retired bank teller, she has been a widow since
1981. In April, while on a visit back to New Jersey, she seriously
considered returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got homesick,'' she said. ``I thought maybe I shouldn't have
moved. I missed my friends and my church.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Beals had something to draw her back to Florida that
many retirees there lack: a daughter in Naples and a son in
Sarasota. ``So I finally decided no,'' she said. ``I have a lovely
place in Florida, and I don't like cold weather anymore. Plus my
children are near me. It's too stressful for me to move now.''

LUKAS NEEDS THIS CROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ D. Wayne Lukas doesn't know it, or won't admit
it, but he needs Charismatic to win this Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   He needs it to rescue the trainer's legacy from the cold
quicksand of statistics and dollar figures and all-time firsts.
</P>
<P>
   He needs it so when people think of the dominant horseman of his
era, they'll also think of a (ital)horse(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Humble Charismatic, his rise the result of a late-winter change
in Lukas' conditioning tactics, will be that horse if he and jockey
Chris Antley win the Belmont Stakes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, Lukas will no longer be the winner of the most purse
money (nearly $200 million) and the most consecutive Triple Crown
races (six, 1994-96), the trainer of the most national champions
(19) and the most Breeders' Cup winners (13).
</P>
<P>
   He'll be ``D. Wayne Lukas, trainer of Charismatic,'' the first
Triple Crown winner in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about that,'' Lukas said Thursday morning
beside his Belmont Park barn. ``Do you think this is going to be
the last time I get the opportunity to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   And it's possible he (ital)hasn't(end ital) thought about how
he'll be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   To Lukas, being ``that man with Charismatic'' might sound like
second billing.
</P>
<P>
   But it's flattering compared to the image he has allowed to be
created.
</P>
<P>
   This is the trainer who, at the Churchill Downs press conference
announcing his Hall of Fame election in May, thanked horse owners
living and dead and thanked his talented employees and even thanked
reporters _ but failed to acknowledge the contribution of a single
horse to his success.
</P>
<P>
   This is the trainer whose barn walls commemorate major victories
in such a way as to make the winning horses seem like bit players.
</P>
<P>
   ``1995 Kentucky Derby Winner,'' reads one sign on his Belmont
Park barn. ``Trainer: D. Wayne Lukas. Owner: Michael Tabor. Horse:
Thunder Gulch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``1994 Belmont Stakes winner,'' reads another that leaves out
the name of Tabasco Cat entirely. ``Trainer: D. Wayne Lukas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was asked Thursday which horses would be mentioned on the
Hall of Fame plaque that will be unveiled in Saratoga, N.Y., in
August. He responded by discussing how the plaque-making was being
delayed until his earnings officially reached $200 million. And he
again passed up a perfect opportunity to name the horses he's most
proud of.
</P>
<P>
   To Lukas' critics, examples like those are evidence of his
disregard for the flesh and blood that goes in one end of his
stables and out the other like so much ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   To his supporters, examples like those are evidence of
accomplishments so broad and awesome that singling out individual
horses is pointless.
</P>
<P>
   But not impossible. His Horses of the Year: Lady's Secret (1986)
and Criminal Type (1990). His first Kentucky Derby winner: the
filly Winning Colors. His slump-busting Preakness winner: Tabasco
Cat. His most versatile star: Farma Way. His sensational filly of
the '90s: Serena's Song.
</P>
<P>
   If Charismatic wins the Triple Crown, they'll all move to No. 2
on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was asked Thursday if Charismatic would be an appropriate
horse with which to associate him. His answer would have puzzled
most listeners.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how he probably ``blew my corporate image'' by
riding with Charismatic on the plane from Louisville, Ky., on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that hay and dust flying up and getting all over my Armani
suit,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas had bristled at the implication that Charismatic's
turnaround demonstrates his skill at horsemanship better than his
hundreds of other winners.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe he does get it.
</P>
<P>
   At 63, married for the fourth time to trainer Laura Pinelli,
Lukas has displayed a softer side this spring. Some reporters heard
his admission that he ``misjudged'' Charismatic, entering the colt
in a Santa Anita claiming race in February, and his
self-deprecating statement that many of his early champions ``won
in spite of me,'' and wrote Derby-week stories about the tough
guy's ``mellowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. This week Lukas had gone back to war with ``the
cockroaches,'' as he refers to selected members of the press.
</P>
<P>
   When a Daily Racing Form writer asked a sympathetic question
about how reporters would have reacted if Lukas, not rival trainer
Bob Baffert, had entered the filly Silverbulletday in the Belmont,
he erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys would have had a field day,'' Lukas was quoted
saying. ``How about me running Excellent Meeting in the Preakness
(as Baffert did with the filly who was pulled up early in the
race)? I wouldn't have even been able to show up here for two
weeks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, `Well, he couldn't stand to be out of the
Preakness, and he ran the filly, and now he ruined her.' And I
would've been the butcher. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   That man with Charismatic can be touchy, huh?
</P>
<P>
   He needn't be. He can always point to two decades of winning
results. ``Tote board, baby!''
</P>
<P>
   But records alone don't make a horseman. Lukas needs to put a
face on his career, a face with big teeth and pointed ears and a
white stripe down the nose.
</P>
<P>
   He needs Charismatic to win the Triple Crown. &QL;

BOSTON LAWSUIT TARGETS GUN INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSON _ This city, known as a national leader for its
significant strides to reduce youth violence, filed suit against 31
gun manufacturers, distributors, and trade groups Thursday,
accusing the gun industry of creating a public nuisance with its
weapons and getting rich at taxpayers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed in Suffolk Superior Court, makes Boston the
20th city or county to sue gun makers in a campaign increasingly
mirroring the nation's fight against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The filing of the suit Thursday drew loud cries of hypocrisy
from the gun industry, which cited Boston's successful recent
efforts to reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the City of Boston knows what is needed to reduce gun
violence and I don't see how running to the civil courts trying to
sue the industry is going to save one life,'' said Robert Ricker,
executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, a trade
group that is a defendant in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Ricker pointed to Boston's coordinated law enforcement effort,
which many credit for curbing youth violence when teen crime was
exploding around the country. For two years, not a single child
under 17 was killed with a gun in Boston. The city's homicide rate
has dipped to 1960s levels, with just 35 homicides last year, 25 of
them with a firearm. The number of guns used in the commission of
other crimes also has dropped off. Violent firearms offenses fell
from 2,026 in 1994 to 1,004 last year, according to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Mayor (Thomas M.) Menino is more concerned with
jumping on the bandwagon politically than he is with really looking
at solving violence problems in Boston,'' Ricker said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Shultz, chief executive of Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., a handgun
manufacturer, said he was ``not at all surprised'' by the suit.
``It seems to be the thing you need to do if you want to be a
big-city mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino said the issue has nothing to do with politics, but with
making the city safer. ``The gun industry has the money to make a
gun safer, but they'd rather use their resources to make guns
lighter, smaller, and easier for criminals to buy and conceal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates assert that Boston's foray into gun
litigation signals the seriousness of the nation's continuing gun
problem, even in areas where political leadership has taken action
against it. It also shows frustration over the inability to
overcome the powerful gun lobby in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Henigan, legal director for the Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence in Washington, said Boston's progress through law
enforcement and creative strategies is ``consistently undercut by
the irresponsibility of the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a city that is basically sending a message that it is
not a choice between strong enforcement of the law and action to
hold the industry accountable _ that you need to do both,'' Henigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Boston's lawsuit, the Boston Public Health Commission
tracked all gun-related deaths and injuries between 1993 and 1998
to identify the manufacturer of each weapon, and then calculate the
public health costs for each company.
</P>
<P>
   The city is estimating damages from gun related deaths or
injuries at $100 million, including the loss of tax revenue from
neighborhoods where crime has quashed property values.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of four private law firms, led by Brown Rudnick
Freed &AMP; Gesmer, which shepherded the state's suit against tobacco
companies, the city is essentially aiming to place responsibility
for gun injuries, deaths, and public health costs in the hands of
gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit argues that gun companies act with ``willfull
blindness,'' manufacturing and distributing thousands of firearms
in a manner that enables them to be purchased by juveniles and
criminals, thereby exploiting and maintaining an illegitimate
secondary market for guns.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also says guns are defective in design and could be
made more safely to prevent accidental deaths and injuries,
particularly those involving children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that some of our franchises and coffee
suppliers care more about our health than gun manufacturers,''
Menino said Thursday, referring to the printed warnings on the
several cups of coffee he was carrying. where
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers in turn have charged that the municipal lawsuits are
unfairly blaming them for the illegal actions of middle-men or the
negligent actions of gun users.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know guns by their very nature are dangerous. A cup of
coffee, you don't expect it to be 185 degrees,'' Ricker said. He
said firearms are ``the only product out there that's designed to
kill. By its very nature, people should understand that when
handling a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit targets gunmakers, including Springfield's Smith &AMP;
Wesson and Glock Corp., as well as distributors and trade groups
such as the American Shooting Sports Council Inc. and the Sporting
Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities that have sued the gun industry include Chicago,
New Orleans, Miami and Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA controls Congress. The public controls the judiciary,
hopefully,'' said John Rosenthal, founder of Stop Handgun Violence,
based in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   But legislative efforts are already underway to thwart city
suits. On Thursday, Louisiana lawmakers passed a bill preventing
cities from suing gun makers in an effort to nullify the New
Orleans suit, which was the nation's first. A similar measure was
passed by Georgia's legislature in February.

 &HT;    Georgia Lighting to become Home Depot unit
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot Inc. has agreed to buy Atlanta-based
Georgia Lighting, signaling that the giant home improvement
retailer wants to expand its share of the lighting-fixture market.
</P>
<P>
   Closely held Georgia Lighting, a specialty retailer with six
showrooms in metro Atlanta, will retain its name and become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Atlanta-based Home Depot. The deal is
expected to close within 30 days. Terms weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Lighting President Harry Gilham started the company in
1960 with a showroom on Spring Street. That location moved to 14th
Street and became one of the country's largest lighting showrooms.
The company sells fixtures ranging from chandeliers to kitchen and
bath fixtures, lamps and outdoor systems. The stores' customers
include interior decorators and contractors, as well as consumers
in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Gilham, 69, said he's selling the company partly because there
are no family members interested in taking over the business.
``This presents an opportunity for me to secure the future of my
200 employees,'' he said. ``I've been in this business for 40
years, and I'm just happy I can spend the last part of my career
working for a company like Home Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is bringing the relatively small company on board
during a period when it is improving merchandising strategies in
several product categories. Gilham and Georgia Lighting General
Manager Ray Gardner are expected to enhance Home Depot's lighting
departments in its warehouse and Expo Design Center stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are regarded as preeminent experts in their field. The
primary benefit of this acquisition is in their expertise in
design, sourcing and distribution,'' said David Suliteanu, group
president of diversified businesses for Home Depot. Suliteanu
stressed that Home Depot is not planning to roll out a line of
specialty lighting stores, nor does it plan to close any Georgia
Lighting stores.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot did not disclose how much business it currently does
in lighting. Trade publication National Home Center News estimates
that lighting and electrical products represent 5 percent of Home
Depot's $30.2 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The entire $9 billion market for lighting fixtures is expected
to grow by 5 percent annually over the next five years, according
to the American Lighting Association.
</P>
<P>
   The retail lighting industry is a fractured market of 3,000
lighting showrooms, comprised mostly of local and regional
operators.

 &HT;    iXL gains nearly 50% in first day of trading
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of Atlanta-based iXL Enterprises, e-business
consultant for companies such as General Electric and Time-Warner,
rose nearly 50 percent in their first day of trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   iXL debuted in a much more temperate market than the one that
doubled the share price of Media Metrix, a web measurement company,
when it went public last month. Still, 13.8 million shares changed
hands, and the price rose to close at $17.87 1/2, a better than 48
percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   The offering had been priced at $12 Wednesday for big
institutional investors and company insiders. Individuals got their
shot Thursday when the stock opened at $15.12 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rose as high as $24.50 in intraday trading.
</P>
<P>
   Since Atlanta businessman Bert Ellis, 45, founded iXL in 1996,
the firm has acquired more than 34 Web, video and interactive media
companies. His stake was worth $52.5 million at Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   iXL helps other companies figure out how to build Web sites,
advertise, market and conduct e-commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   iXL also owns 77 percent of the locally based Consumer Financial
Network, which offers loans, life insurance and other benefits to
employees of major corporations via corporate intranets. GE Capital
owns the rest of CFN and has agreed to buy 2 million shares in iXL.
Affiliates of New York investment firm Kelso &AMP; Co. own about 25
percent of iXL; CB Capital Investors, nearly 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company raised $72 million from the offering of 6 million
shares at $12. iXL says it will use the money to pay off debt and
to fund growth.
</P>
<P>
   Web consulting firms such as iXL are in demand because many
companies are struggling to set up Web operations and need
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, Ellis gave Georgia Tech's DuPree School of
Management an initial endowment of $1 million to fund the iXL
Center for E-Commerce at Georgia Tech, aimed at becoming the
state-of-the-art e-commerce research facility.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the iXL offering to do well because of a
recent upward trend of all Internet-related stocks, even though
that market has cooled a bit. USWeb, iXL's closest competitor in
the interactive advertising marketplace, is currently trading at
about $25.25.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the company has yet to turn a profit. It lost $18.3
million for the quarter ended March 31 on revenue of $33 million,
compared with a loss of $5.9 million on revenue of $6.9 million the
year before.

 &HT;    As rumors end, Lockheed Martin layoffs hit home
 &HT;    By Henry Farber and Steve Visser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now the worrying begins.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp.'s announcement Thursday that its Marietta
aircraft plant will lose 2,000 jobs over the next year brought an
end to weeks of rumors.
</P>
<P>
   But for families, this was only the wobbling of the first
domino. The impact on mortgages, grocery bills and college tuition
will have to wait until the pink slips come.
</P>
<P>
   If there was good news, it's that the layoffs won't be the
hammer blow to Cobb County's economy they would have been 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get laid off, I gotta hit the road, find another job,''
said Aldora Grisson, 43, a $17-an-hour machinist who says she never
had children largely because of the volatility of the military
aircraft business. ``I've put off a lot of things because of the
way this industry is.'' But she did take a chance and make a down
payment on her Marietta home a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of the plant's 9,500 workers, about 4,300 are hourly employees _
most of them members of the Aeronautical Machinists Union. Years of
service will largely determine their fates. For the 5,200 salaried
workers, merit and the need for their position will determine their
future.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Miller was one of thousands of employees who came to work
Thursday and heard one of the speeches made by company President
Tom Burbage announcing the cutback.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had worked for Boeing in Seattle. Two months ago, he
moved to Marietta _ a decision he now regrets. An engineer on the
C-130J, Miller's salary supports his wife and 2-year-old. ``Just
like the aerospace industry. A couple of months ago they were
hiring, now they're getting rid of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed's economic impact, while proportionately smaller than
decades ago, is still sizable. Last year, Lockheed _ which has an
annual payroll of $532 million with 9,550 employees _ spent $137
million in goods and services with Georgia companies. It's still
the largest private employer in the county, and only the Cobb
school system now has more workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you had the layoffs in the 1970s, it really sent the
local economy into the tank,'' said Roger Tutterow, an economist
and co-director of the Econometric Center at Kennesaw State
University. ``These layoffs, while they are significant to the
families involved, they're really a bit minor for Cobb.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting
Center at Georgia State University, said while the county should
maintain its economic health, nobody should underestimate the
importance of the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to notice it in the growth rate of Atlanta? Sure
we are, because you're taking away 2,000 high-wage incomes,'' he
said. ``You're probably talking about a total job impact of 5,000.
That's because those paychecks aren't being spent.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact on small businesses serving Lockheed Martin
Aeronautical Systems probably will be felt in the coming months as
the company cuts back on new contracts and orders, said Carlotta
Roberts, director of the Small Business Development Center at KSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some small businesses won't get repeat work they're counting
on getting,'' she said. ``It's a lesson about not putting all your
eggs in one basket. You can't rely on one big customer to provide
all your income.

 &HT;    Lockheed: Attrition will be 40% of cuts
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The latest wave of job cuts at Lockheed Martin's
Marietta plant will come from across the company, with about 40
percent achieved through attrition, retirements and transfers,
plant executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Plant spokesman Sam Grizzle said that cuts could begin by the
end of this month, with workers notified as soon as the targeted
jobs are identified. The job cuts will be combined with a broad
structural reorganization, details of which are still being
formulated.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 2,000 of the current 9,500 jobs at the plant will be axed
over the next year, plant executives said in a series of meetings
with employees Thursday. That number includes about 350 contract
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The cutback comes as the company faces a looming production
slowdown on the C-130J transport program, caused by slack
short-term demand for the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is trying to persuade the Air Force to
accelerate long-term buying plans, in part by offering to cut the
price on each aircraft from about $58 million to $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is under pressure to meet congressional
spending caps on the F-22 fighter, still in the pre-production
phase. The program faces a major Pentagon review this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must continue to reduce our costs to make the C-130J more
affordable domestically and internationally and to meet the
commitment we've made to the Air Force to carry out F-22
development and production within the established budget,'' said
C.T. ``Tom'' Burbage, president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautical
Systems, the corporate division headquartered at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we need to streamline our operation and make our
organization more effective, so we're taking steps today to start
that process,'' Burbage said.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage, a former F-22 program chief promoted to his current
post in March, said long-term prospects for both the C-130J and
F-22 programs remain strong. He denied Lockheed Martin was
considering moving either program or shutting down the Marietta
plant. Burbage said he met Wednesday with Vance Coffman, chairman
of Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin, adding there is ``no
discussion at any level'' of such moves.
</P>
<P>
   While Lockheed Martin expects to sell hundreds of C-130Js and
F-22s over the next 10 to 20 years, both programs have been slow
starters.
</P>
<P>
   The C-130J debuted in 1995 _ two years behind schedule because
of development glitches that drove up the cost. The U.S. government
has ordered 35 of the planes, while foreign buyers have ordered 55.
Those orders will be filled by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force plans to order another 168 C-130Js to replace
older models, but doesn't want them until the middle of the next
decade. That's prompted concern that the Marietta plant might have
to be mothballed for two or three years, but Burbage insisted that
scenario is remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at any production breaks,'' he said. The
company believes it can persuade the Air Force and Congress to add
enough orders during the lean years to sustain production.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lockheed Martin has previously warned in
congressional briefings that a production rate of 12 C-130Js a year
would only justify employment of 6,000 people. The plant is capable
of producing 36 planes a year. It will build 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Huge job fluctuations are nothing new at the plant, but the
trend has been down in recent years. The last major job cut came in
1994, when the company cut 2,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Plant employment was as high as 33,000 in the late 1960s, when
the facility produced three transport planes, the C-5A, the C-141
and early models of the C-130. It fell as low as 8,000 in 1976,
then jumped to 20,000 in the 1980s with production of the C-5B.
</P>
<P>
   The job count dropped to 11,000 after C-5B production ended in
1989 and has slowly shrunk since then to about 9,500 now, including
contract workers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent congressional briefing materials, Lockheed Martin
cited 8,205 as the ``historical low'' for Marietta plant
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), whose suburban district includes
part of Cobb County, said he hopes displaced workers won't have
trouble finding new employment in Georgia's powerful economy. ``We
went through this once before when the (C-5B) contract ended, and
the market absorbed those jobs very easily, and that was a lot more
jobs,'' Isakson said.

 &HT;    Plan would aid Madison firm's investors
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investors in two companies with ties to a Madison
business might get some of their money back in a plan proposed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a federal judge froze $2.5 million in investor
money, saying it came from the sale of unregistered shares of
Citron and Electronic Transfer Associates through Glittergrove
Investments, an Irish firm. They were represented by Peter Lybrand,
a banned-for-life stockbroker who works out of a former
five-and-dime in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mixter of the SEC's enforcement division, said he expects
the court to issue a default judgment in its case against
Glittergrove this month. When and if the court issues a default
judgment, Mixter said the SEC will file a plan with the court to
return the money to shareholders.

   ATLANTA _ MindSpring took a first step Thursday toward turning
its home page into a shopping and information destination by
signing a deal with Barnes &AMP; Noble to offer MindSpring members
their own version of the popular online bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's Barnes &AMP; Noble site will be accessible to
subscribers and non-subscribers from the MindSpring home page at
www.mindspring.net. The affiliate marketing agreement will create a
book and music store, as well as an e-mail ``deals club'' for
MindSpring's 1.16 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will also give MindSpring users access to
discounts on barnesandnoble.com's selection of books and access to
the soon-to-be-opened barnesandnoble.com music store.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two things about this deal that are really
interesting,'' said Erika Jolly, MindSpring's vice president of
consumer products. ``It's a MindSpring-branded bookstore, really,
and it allows us to create our own bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, if we get reports from Barnes &AMP; Noble that
MindSpring customers like to buy books about France, we can
customize the content to coincide with what our subscribers are
most interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other aspects of the Barnes &AMP; Noble deal haven't been
integrated yet but are part of MindSpring's often-stated goal to
add more value to its home page.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnes &AMP; Noble deal will eventually complement additional
content the company hopes to add to the site, Jolly said.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring has built its reputation as an Internet service
provider with good customer service. Now, the company has turned
its attention to generating more revenue for itself and more value
for customers by adding branded content and commerce to its home
page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we are so much larger and we have such a good
relationship with our subscribers, we can build on that
relationship by adding some depth to our site,'' Jolly said.

   NEW YORK _ Saying she was convinced that Hillary Rodham Clinton
was running for senator from New York, Rep. Nita Lowey abandoned
her own bid for the position Thursday, announcing her decision in a
telephone call to Mrs. Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made no attempt to dissuade her, and the first
lady's aides later said she is likely to form an exploratory
committee in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear she is running,'' Lowey, D-N.Y., said in an
interview shortly after her five-minute conversation with the first
lady. ``It's time for me to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events _ starting with a 1:20 p.m. call by Lowey
to the White House that had been orchestrated by aides to the two
women the night before _ seemed to leave little doubt that the
first lady intends to seek the Democratic nomination to run in 2000
to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours after Lowey, who had presented herself as the
fallback Democratic candidate in the race, announced her decision,
Harold M. Ickes, Mrs. Clinton's senior political adviser, said that
the first lady was ``pressing forward'' with her candidacy. He said
she was likely to take the first formal step of creating an
exploratory committee when she returns from a trip to Europe and
the Mideast in July.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Mrs. Clinton issued a short statement that
praised Lowey's record as a member of Congress, and hinted at a
continued political alliance in the months ahead. ``I thank Nita
for her support, and I look forward to working with her,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   By design or not, the decision by Lowey effectively forced the
hand of the first lady, who has sought to put off giving any firm
sign of her intention until early summer. If Mrs. Clinton still had
serious doubts about making the race, several of her aides said
Thursday, she almost certainly would have have advised Lowey to
stay on the stage. Lowey said Mrs. Clinton said nothing of the
sort.
</P>
<P>
   In theory at least, Mrs. Clinton could still decide not to run,
and Lowey could reverse herself and get back in the race. But
associates of both women called the chances of that remote.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move by the first lady would be highly disruptive to the
state Democratic Party, leaving it in the lurch at a time when its
leaders are already concerned about of holding onto the seat if the
Republicans run mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lowey's withdrawal ended one of the odder political
entanglements of recent years. Just last week, Mrs. Clinton came to
New York to help Lowey raise $1 million, money that would have
financed a Lowey campaign for Senate if Mrs. Clinton herself did
not make the race.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats had begun to suggest that Lowey's willingness to
stand back quietly awaiting Mrs. Clinton's decision, applauded at
first as a sign of loyalty, could begin to seem weak and even
farcical, particularly as Mrs. Clinton's candidacy seemed
increasingly inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there were no indications that Lowey felt any
resentment over how she has fared in the public spotlight these
last few months.
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, she is today arguably in a much stronger
position than she was at the start of the year, by virtue of having
played even a secondary role in such a high profile contest. She
has gone from being a little-known representative from Westchester
to being a state-wide Democratic figure.
</P>
<P>
   She raised about $2 million during the last six months, her
spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said, probably more than she needs for a
re-election race. At the age of 61, she is unlikely to have an
opportunity to run again for Senate _ the next Senate race after
2000 is 2004, and that seat is already held by a Democrat, Charles
Schumer _ but she is certain to be viewed by Democrats as a
stronger contender for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Lowey had said she would run for the Senate only if Mrs. Clinton
did not. In an interview, she said that she decided to quit her
effort after a week in which Mrs. Clinton met with New York
political strategists in the White House, and flew to New York to
decry the state of the public school system in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past week or so, it was increasingly clear to me that
the first lady had decided to run,'' Lowey said. ``It didn't make
sense for me to stay in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law of diminishing returns had set in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson called Ickes Thursday night to inform him of the
decision and arrange the telephone call, which Lowey placed from
her district office in White Plains. Lowey's aides said they had no
idea how the first lady would respond to the decision, and there
was a real sense of suspense in Lowey's camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her that it was clear to me she was running, and
therefore I was going to continue working in the House for
re-election,'' Lowey said, recounting the conversation. ``She said,
`I look forward to working with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the timing of Lowey's announcement was less than
ideal for Mrs. Clinton. She has been enjoying the kind of benefits
that come from being a celebrity candidate who has not actually
announced for office, drawing tremendous and largely uncritical
coverage of her every move. That is likely to change the more she
is viewed as a real player on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers said that as a formal matter, Lowey's
announcement would not accelerate their own political schedule.
``She's just going to push ahead and take this one step at a
time,'' said Mandy Grunwald, the political consultant who was
Moynihan's consultant and is expected to play a key role in Mrs.
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Mackinac Island, Mich., where Giuliani was addressing a
business group Thursday the mayor reacted to the news of Mrs.
Clinton's consideration of an exploratory committee with his
standard refrain in recent days _ noting that she was running for
Senate from a state where she should never lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she should explore New York a little more,'' he said.
Then, referring to his own political agenda, the mayor said, ``I
formed an exploratory committee about six weeks ago.''

ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY DEAL IS A FIRST STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials warily embraced
news of the peace agreement with Yugoslavia Thursday, describing it
as merely a first step toward peace despite a far more enthusiastic
response from other NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials agreed to such key NATO demands as the withdrawal
of Yugoslav troops and the entry of an international peacekeeping
force. Such moves, if carried out, would create the conditions for
an international rebuilding effort in Kosovo that the White House
has estimated would cost up to $3.5 billion, most of which, it
says, would be paid by Europe. The total US cost, including
Washington's share of the 11-week military offensive, refugee
resettlement and future peacekeeping efforts, would be about $6
billion, according to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent Yugoslav capitulation, US officials were
reluctant to declare victory. While several officials seemed
pleased by the development _ and several congressional sources said
administraton officials were hoping a pact would be sealed within
days _ the tone of public remarks remained skeptical. President
Clinton, speaking in the Rose Garde, said any diplomatic move by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``is, of course, welcome. But
based on our past experience, we must also be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First,'' he added, ``we must have clarity that the Serbian
leadership has fully accepted these conditions and intends to fully
implement them. Until then, and until Serb forces begin a
verifiable withdrawal from Kosovo, we will continue to pursue
diplomacy, but we will also continue the military effort that has
brought us to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, NATO warplanes continued Thursday to pound
Yugoslavia, and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said they would
not stop until ``Yugoslavia convincingly demonstrates that the
fighting is over.'' Cohen declined to specify how Milosevic would
have to prove his sincerity _ such as how many troops he would need
to pull out of Kosovo to convince NATO that he was actually
conforming to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, US military and diplomatic officials have said they
would know a Yugoslav peace concession when they saw one, insisting
that intelligence sources _ satellite photographs of troop
withdrawals, for example _ would prove more reliable than any
signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some military and foreign relations analysts said they are are
skeptical of Milosevic's sudden willingness toward diplomacy,
saying they feared he was trying to divide the NATO alliance by
seeming conciliatory. In a worst-case scenario, the analysts said,
NATO would split over the issue that has threatened to divide them
before: whether to continue negotiations with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Interpretations differed among NATO leaders. After hearing
details of the negotiations from a European Union envoy, Martti
Ahtisaari, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder described Thursday's
events as ``a political breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace, in my opinion, is very close,'' said Schroeder, the
current president of the European Community. ``Politically, we have
to make sure it doesn't slip out of our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was much cooler in the United States, and Clinton
even called Schroeder to say ``that we are quite cautious here,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the developments sparked a frenzy of official activity
throughout Washington. Administration officials shuttled back and
forth across the city throughout the day for briefings on Kosovo,
and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright canceled a trip to
Mexico, where she was supposed to lead a two-day commission on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The message everywhere was caution. The Pentagon spokesman,
Kenneth H. Bacon, said, ``We have to see performance, not
promises.'' The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin,
described it as a ``very sober time ... a very cautious time,'' and
warned, ``this is not a time for popping champagne corks.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the Serbian parliament vote to accept the deal,
there was political parrying inside and outside Capitol Hill.
Democratic congressional aides said they were relieved by the
developments.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican
presidential contender, issued a statement expressing ``concerns
about the timetable'' and ``serious questions about the details of
the provision.''
</P>
<P>
   Another GOP candidate, Elizabeth Dole, said the vague terms of
the settlement had left her ``worried that we are on the verge of a
sellout. I'm particularly concerned because this administration has
a long history of compromising and appeasing Milosevic and other
despotic leaders.''

REFUGEES ARE ANXIOUS AND SKEPTICAL ABOUT PEACE AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER and DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STENKOVEC I CAMP, Macedonia _ When the loudspeakers at this
refugee camp broadcast the news on Thursday of a potential peace
agreement for Kosovo, Ahmet Sharifi burst out laughing. ``Milosevic
is lying again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't believe a word anyone says until we are actually on
the road to Kosovo, going back with the NATO troops,'' said
Sharifi, a 59-year-old refugee who has memorized all the broken
promises of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Such skepticism was echoed on the sidelines of the men's
round-robin volleyball game and in the long line of women filling
their plastic water jugs at an open spigot. No one here or in
Cegrane, the largest refugee camp holding some of the hundreds of
thousands of people displaced from Kosovo, put any faith on
Thursday in the agreement by Milosevic and the Serbian Parliament
to accept the NATO peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said she would ``faint with joy'' if it were true, but
she and other Kosovars said they refused to be taken in yet again
by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There have been too many brutal disappointments over the last 10
years, they said, culminating with last October's agreement, which
was routinely cited by refugees here as the reason why they remain
incredulous. That settlement, brokered at the last minute by
Richard C. Holbrooke, the American special envoy, was supposed to
have led to a substantial withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo
overseen by unarmed European monitors. Instead, Milosevic built up
his troops for the mass deportation that he unleashed in March as
NATO began its air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in the October agreement and all that happened was
four of my husband's cousins were murdered for renting their houses
to the European monitors,'' said Imrane Dema, a 37-year-old mother
of three children who has been living in this camp for five weeks.
``We've heard this so many times, and it makes me feel like I
couldn't live anymore if another settlement fails.''
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, as the word spread from tent to tent, refugees began
discussing the few details they knew about the agreement and
wondering if they could take the latest deal seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Would the involvement of Russia mean the division of Kosovo? Was
this another clever trick of Milosevic to stop the NATO bombing
until the alliance loses its stomach to resume it? How can Kosovo,
after so much strife, remain a part of Yugoslavia? Could they ever
live with their Serbian neighbors again, even with the
``substantial autonomy'' the agreement promises?
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively, they began imagining the only way they thought they
could return _ escorted by NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Fear, they predicted, would consume them when they journey home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to be frightened when we get back,'' said
Elmaze Hajdari, a 47-year-old mother whose grown daughter remained
behind in Kosovo. ``We're afraid they put mines in our houses and
mines in our fields.'' Refugees expressed fears of Serbian revenge
against those Albanians still in Kosovo. Halit Ferizi, 49, said
four of his brothers were now in a Serbian jail there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them will be beaten, and some of them will be killed,''
Ferizi predicted. ``I don't know what criteria they'll use to
decide who lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprehension also gripped those with missing relatives in
Kosovo, where grim or joyous answers about the fate of loved ones
awaited them.
</P>
<P>
   Still others talked of their own revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked me out of my house for two months,'' said Imer
Rexhepi, a 33-year-old barber who set up shop under a tarp here.
``I'd like to kick them out of theirs for 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the refugees said they could not imagine how they
would be able to live with the Serbs again. They predicted the
Serbian civilians who made up 10 percent of Kosovo's population
before the NATO bombing would flee. They all said Kosovo should be
given independence as part of a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we need to live with them if they tried to destroy
us?'' said Bexhet Myftari, a 22-year-old auto mechanic turned
refugee.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees also worried that the Kosovo they find may be
little more than a burnt shell. They said they would need help
rebuilding their homes, towns and cities. But beneath the
skepticism, worry and efforts to protect themselves by playing down
the importance of Thursday's events, hope and determination could
still be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the houses are burned,'' said Idriz Berisha, a
42-year-old technician, ``We would be happy to live in tents in our
back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of hope among the refugees was that the news on
Thursday apparently prompted some refugees to hold off on plans to
go abroad. U.N. officials said more than 100 refugees failed to
show up for their flights abroad on Thursday, a far higher number
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Rabije Megjuami, 39, said she did not trust the Serbian peace
offer, but acknowledged that she was willing to make any sacrifice
for the chance to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd even go back and live with my mother-in-law,'' she said.

OLYMPIC WAR OF WORDS ESCALATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol on Thursday escalated his war
of words with David D'Alessandro, president of the John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance Co., in an unusual clash between two of the
most powerful businessmen in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol charged that D'Alessandro's continuing calls for reform
of the International Olympic Committee are rooted in the Hancock
executive's disappointment over the return on the company's
marketing investment in the Olympics. Ebersol also reached back to
a lobbying scandal in the early 1990s to say that Hancock has
ethical problems of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, in more than three decades of this, I have never
criticized a sponsor before, especially publicly,'' Ebersol said.
``This was boiling up inside of me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the battle was largely one-sided Thursday. Officials at
Hancock said D'Alessandro would make no response.
</P>
<P>
   ``These continued personal attacks from Mr. Ebersol are
unbecoming of an exectuve from a major network,'' Hancock said in a
written statement. ``We are not going to trade personal insults
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers, meanwhile, expressed surprise that Ebersol had
mounted a second offensive against a major advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in advertising for 30 years and my father was at
CBS Sports, and I have to say during that entire time I don't
recall anything like this ever happening between a television
network and a major advertiser,'' said Walter Pile, president of
Pile and Co., a management consulting and marketing agency. ``And
it's not pretty to watch, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are closely identified with the projects they are
seeking to protect. Ebersol is the driving force behind NBC's $3.5
billion investment for Olympic television rights. The scandals,
involving allegations of bribery of IOC officials, threaten to
diminish the willingness of corporations to purchase advertising
time during the lengthy broadcast schedule.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro is credited with modernizing Hancock's corporate
image through its sponsorship of sports events like the Boston
Marathon, the Olympics, figure skating events, gymnastics teams and
a college bowl game. He has threatened to withdraw Hancock's
sponsorship of the Olympic games and its television advertising if
substantive reforms are not adopted by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Greyser, who teaches corporate communications and the
business of sport at the Harvard Business School, said both men are
trying to speak to larger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ebersol wants to speak to people who buy advertising at the
major companies who may consider whether to purchase time during
the Olympics,'' Greyser said. ``D'Alessandro's constituency is the
other companies who sponsor or who may sponsor the Olympics. He may
be perceived as the lightning rod for their discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   A marketing official with another major Olympic sponsor said
that both Ebersol and D'Alessandro are acting as surrogates in the
continuing debate over the pace and scope of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sponsors wish David would shut up and that someone would
come forward to defend the Olympics before they are really
damaged,'' the official said. ``Others wish the IOC would do
exactly what David has been advocating eloquently for months. Some
of the sponsors wish both things would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What also is playing out, observers said, is a struggle between
two powerful men used to getting their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both known for not being entirely agreeable
characters,'' Pile said. ``There is an abrasiveness about both of
them that is well-documented.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol first went public Tuesday, bitterly criticizing
D'Alessandro's for his high-profile advocacy for Olympic reforms.
Then Thursday, after assembling several reporters from major news
outlets around the country for a conference telephone call from
Paris, Ebersol said D'Alessandro has long been disillusioned about
Hancock's Olympic sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many people involved with the Olympics have known for
some time that he is a dissatisfied sponsor,'' Ebersol said.
``Maybe he just found it was too rich for his blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has paid $40 million for its current sponsorship of the
Olympic games, an amount that does not include television
advertising during the games. D'Alessandro has frequently said that
his criticism of the Olympic Games is motivated by dissatisfaction
with the terms of the company's sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol also said Hancock has its own ethical problems. He said
he was referring to a lawsuit, recently reinstated, based on
allegations that Hancock's lobbyists had improperly given gifts to
lawmakers in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not directly consulted with his superiors at
General Electric, which owns NBC, before making his criticisms
public. But he said he had made GE executives aware of his anger
and frustration.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia agreed Thursday to withdraw its troops
and police from Kosovo and permit international peacekeepers into
the embattled province, opening the door to a possible end to 10
weeks of punishing NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military commanders were preparing to meet with Yugoslav
generals as early as Friday to hammer out specific arrangements for
Serb forces to pull out of Kosovo and transfer control of the
province to a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton welcomed the diplomatic advance, which could
lead to a
</P>
<P>
   bombing halt as early as this weekend, but he also voiced
skepticism and urged caution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he does not trust Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
the president of Yugoslavia, and stressed that critical questions
remain concerning the composition of a Kosovo peacekeeping force
and the mechanics and pacing of a Serb retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed to press forward with NATO air strikes until Serb
forces begin a verifiable pullout from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some encouraging news on Kosovo, but we should be
cautious and we should see real results,'' Clinton told reporters
during brief remarks at the White House Rose Garden Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have clarity that the Serbian leadership has fully
accepted these conditions and intends to fully implement them,''
Clinton said. ``Until then, and until Serb forces begin a
verifiable withdrawal from Kosovo, we will continue to pursue
</P>
<P>
   diplomacy, but we will also continue the military effort that
has brought us to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied warplanes pounded Serb positions through the
night and were under orders to continue their strikes into Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point not a single Serb soldier has withdrawn from
Kosovo,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters at the
Pentagon, immediately following a White House meeting between
Clinton and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``The bombing campaign will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
Parliament accepted the peace plan early Thursday, after it was
presented by Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin and
the Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari, in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The decision followed 2 1/2 months of NATO air strikes, during
which U.S. and allied pilots flew more than 32,000 sorties against
Serb military targets and fielded forces, destroying dozens of
bridges, scores of buildings, refineries and factories and roughly
700 military vehicles and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimated that some 10,000 Serb soldiers have been killed
or wounded in the strikes, and Belgrade has placed civilian deaths
at 1,500. NATO has reported no allied fatalities, though two U.S.
warplanes were shot down and their pilots rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the brink of a major foreign policy triumph, Clinton
and his aides refrained from declaring victory against Milosevic, a
wily tactician whose past promises have often proven hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word of the day is 'cautious,''' said Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, a chief architect of Clinton's policy in
Kosovo. ``We'll have plenty of time to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Milosevic's record for reneging on pledges in Kosovo and
elsewhere across the Balkans, ``Verifiable deeds, not seductive
words, are the only currency that counts in this conflict,'' said
Albright's spokesman, James Rubin. ``This is the beginning of the
process; this is not the end of the diplomatic process.''
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference in Cologne, Germany, Ahtisaari said
Belgrade's decision marked a clear breakthrough but does not yet
guarantee peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear with me if I am not jumping here with enthusiasm, because
there is a lot of hard work that needs to be done,'' said
Ahtisaari, who was in Cologne to brief officials attending a summit
of European Union (EU) leaders. ``But I believe that, as I said,
that the first step in building peace has been made.''
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder voiced greater optimism,
however, and warned his NATO counterparts not to squander a genuine
chance for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political breakthrough,'' said Schroeder, the
current EU president. ``The peace, in my opinion, is very close.
And, politically, we have to make sure that it doesn't slip out of
our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord approved in Belgrade, the Serb government
appeared to agree to the five key demands NATO has made since it
began bombing Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Those are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  an end to violence and repression targeting majority ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the withdrawal of all Serb military, police and paramilitary
forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the deployment of an armed security force with NATO
``participation;''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  guarantees that an estimated 1.5 million ethnic Albanians
forced to flee their homes may return in safety;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and political autonomy for ethnic Albanians, who made up 90
percent of Kosovo's population before hostilities prompted them to
flee in Europe's largest forced exodus since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb government also agreed to place Kosovo under United
Nations administration for an interim period of unspecified
duration.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, Serb forces would have seven days to vacate
Kosovo, beginning on the day they commence withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling out all forces, Serbs would be allowed to place
``a small agreed number,'' of troops and police back into Kosovo to
perform such duties as land-mine clearing, the monitoring of border
posts and liaison activities with international security and
civilian operations.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such personnel would be ``hundreds, not
thousands,'' according to a copy of the text that was translated
from Serbian into English by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Critical questions remained, however, over the most contentious
point in the peace accord: the composition of a Kosovo peacekeeping
force, or KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   It is the position of the United States and its NATO allies that
such a force must be a heavily-armed contingent of some 50,000
troops led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There are 20,000 NATO troops pre-positioned near Kosovo's border
with Macedonia and Albania, and another 2,000 U.S. Marines afloat
near the Adriatic Sea. Cohen said additional forces could be
quickly mustered to form the vanguard of a peacekeeping force
capable of moving into Kosovo on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement endorsed by the Serb government, however, leaves
some room for interpretation. It describes a force to be deployed,
under the auspices of the United Nations, that would be
``effective,'' and contain ``essential NATO participation,'' as
well as ``unified control and command.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear whether that wording was part of a diplomatic
effort to finesse the issue of NATO control or whether in fact
Milosevic means to insist on a U.N.-led force with only token NATO
representation. Until Thursday, Milosevic had rejected a NATO-led
force.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, a key strategist
during the Kosovo crisis, told reporters at NATO headquarters in
Brussels that there was no ambiguity in his mind as to the intent
of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``effective,'' for instance, is diplomatic code for a
NATO force, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to qualify as 'effective,' the Kosovo implementation
force needs to have NATO at its core,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the state department spokesman, said the next step
forward in the peace process would be to clarify precisely what it
is that Milosevic has agreed to, then to codify the deal in some
legally-binding set of accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could come in the form of military-to-military
codification, it could come in the form of a Security Council
resolution,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Serb military commanders were working late Thursday to
schedule a meeting in a neutral city to nail down the mechanics and
logistics of a Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our end, it would only take a few hours' notice,'' to
arrange such a meeting, said Mike Hammer, a spokesman for Clinton's
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said it wasn't decided whether such a meeting would be
attended by the NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, or one
of his officers.
</P>
<P>
   If such a meeting produced agreement over the specifics of a
Serb troop withdrawal, Hammer said, it was conceivable that a
pullout could begin as early as this weekend, accompanied by a
suspension of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to move very quickly on this,'' Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Albright said she would travel to Europe in the
coming days to meet with her counterparts over how to proceed with
a U.N. Security Council resolution that would set forth a path for
the return of refugees and reconstruction efforts inside
war-devastated Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A year-and-a-half of Serb repression -- dramatically escalated
when NATO bombing began -- has driven an estimated 850,000 ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo. Another 650,000 are believed to have fled
their homes and taken refuge in the rural mountains of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the State Department's belief that more than 5,000
ethnic Albanians have been executed inside Kosovo and untold
numbers of others injured, raped or otherwise brutalized, and the
proportions of the tragedy served to further temper relief within
the Clinton administration over the apparent capitulation of the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sober time,'' Rubin said. ``This is not a time
for popping champagne corks. This is a time for getting the
refugees home and for getting the Serb forces out of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin stressed that Thursday's peace accord included no amnesty
for Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes by the U.N.
tribunal prosecuting such offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin instead called on Serbs to hand over Milosevic for trial
by the tribunal in the Hague, Netherlands, and said no U.N. member
state had the authority to immunize Milosevic against prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not support any step by anybody to do that,'' Rubin
said.

   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia agreed Thursday to withdraw its troops
and police from Kosovo and permit international peacekeepers into
the embattled province, opening the door to a possible end to 10
weeks of punishing NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military commanders were preparing to meet with Yugoslav
generals as early as Friday to hammer out specific arrangements for
Serb forces to pull out of Kosovo and transfer control of the
province to a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton welcomed the diplomatic advance, which could
lead to a

<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ As the USS Kearsarge sailed from the United
States for the Adriatic last month, one of the last things a sailor
told a reporter at the dock in Norfolk, Va., was: ``I don't trust
this guy.'' He was referring to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, and he had the Balkan bully exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   Every international leader who lines up at a microphone to hail
the Yugoslav government's acceptance Thursday of the
Western-dictated peace proposal should first have to write 1,000
times: ``I don't trust this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with that political penance accomplished, the great and
good who allowed the Kosovo crisis, like the Bosnian imbroglio
before it, to turn from canker into cancer should not be allowed to
wax euphoric about the deal. They should point out how difficult it
will be to carry out and how it is a temporizing proposal that does
not come close to being a final chapter in the sad, bloody
Serb-Kosovar epic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the document agreed to by Milosevic and his puppet
parliament in Belgrade appears straightforward, the emphasis should
be on the ``ifs,`` ``buts'' and ``howevers'' that will fill what
could be a treacherous period of implementation.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a new boy on the
international block but nonetheless in possession of the rotating
presidency of the European Union, verged on the triumphal as he
formally unveiled the deal at a summit of EU national leaders here
beside the Rhine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good day for Europe,'' Schroeder exulted. ``Peace
now is within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   But Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, a principal go-between
in the deal, refused to hurl himself into the victor's circle quite
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A first step,'' insisted Ahtisaari, who was seasoned
diplomatically by the decadelong wrangle over Namibia. The cautious
Finn said he reminded his EU colleagues:
</P>
<P>
   ``The English have a very good saying that the proof of the
pudding is in eating it. And the same goes for peace processes.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another fine saying in English: The devil is in the
details. And it applies amply in this case. Working out timing
issues, especially the withdrawal of Serb forces, will give new
meaning to the term ``fine tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which has been burned repeatedly by
Milosevic, took the minimally prudent step of insisting that the
NATO air strikes continue until the Serb regime has agreed to a
verifiable schedule for pulling Serb armed forces _ military,
paramilitary and police _ from the province.
</P>
<P>
   This insistence came as President Clinton finally sat down with
U.S. military leaders to discuss what an invasion of Yugoslavia
might look like, arguably a step that should have come before the
first NATO bomb fell 10 weeks ago. That initial lack of resolve
encouraged Milosevic to delay making the deal he eventually had to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   The world now knows that a post-Cold War NATO can remain
resolute for at least two months, if the commitment is primarily
U.S. pilots dropping bombs. It has not been a stellar display by
the world's pre-eminent military alliance as an uncertain globe
spins closer to the 21st century, but it's marginally better than
the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Politics being the art of the possible, perhaps Belgrade had to
be allowed the face-saving device of yielding to a peace plan
presented by representatives of the European Union (Ahtisaari) and
Russia (former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin) rather than by
NATO brass with gold braid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the NATO leaders, however, got what they were
looking for as a political exit strategy in the second paragraph of
an Associated Press news bulletin announcing Milosevic's acceptance
of the peace proposal: ``The move came right after Serb lawmakers
in Belgrade capitulated on all major Western demands ... .''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best signs of the day was the more-Serbian-than-thou
defiance of one of Milosevic's erstwhile partner parties. ``We
shall not sit in the government and await the arrival of NATO
troops in Kosovo,'' Serb Radical Party member Vojislav Seseljl
declared after voting against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   So much has been stage-managed in Belgrade (not to mention at
NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium) over the past few months
that it is tempting to write off these histrionics as more
theatrical decoration. But Milosevic was probably not in the mood
to have anyone appear more nationalistic than he on what cannot
have been one of his better days.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, the deal leaves Milosevic to fight again _ an
opportunity he almost certainly will take. The old Communist
bureaucrat has proven he does not know how to govern, only to
agitate.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari noted that dealing with whether Milosevic continues in
power was ``not part of my mandate.'' But the issue must be
addressed, and more than one leader in Washington and in Europe has
questioned how the troubled Balkans can move securely toward
democracy while Milosevic remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   As the EU heads of government met privately here by the Rhine
and began to discuss what will come next in southeastern Europe,
outgoing EU Parliament President Jose Maria Gil-Robles, a Spanish
centrist, expressed his deep concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem ... is Mr. Milosevic,'' Gil-Robles said of the
future southeastern Europe. ``I am not convinced Mr. Milosevic can
be changed. Nothing is impossible in this world , but it's not
probable.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer Milosevic stays, the longer U.S. troops will need to
remain as part of the international peacekeeping force. That much
is clear from the experience of the Dayton accords that brought
peace and U.S. troops to Bosnia and Herzegovina and has kept them
there four times as long as Clinton promised.
</P>
<P>
   To have continued meaning and effectiveness, the Bosnian accord
needs to be renegotiated with a view to a final peace settlement,
which will almost certainly be more difficult to reach than the
interim pact.
</P>
<P>
   And Bosnia, many analysts believe, was a less intractable issue
than Kosovo, which as every school child has learned over the last
two months, holds shrines that are at the core of Serb identity,
although Serbs have left the province over recent decades to ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   An ultimate resolution in Bosnia and Kosovo may lie in partition
along ethnic lines, a process that concedes defeat for the goal of
multiethnic societies and, equally disheartening, rarely guarantees
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   As the second anniversary of the Dayton deal approached in 1997,
Brookings Institution analyst Susan Woodward told the Dayton (Ohio)
Daily News: ``The compromises that each side agreed to were
compromises that they could not deliver. It simply delayed the day
of reckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deal agreed to Thursday, all sides can deliver if they
want to, but the final reckoning for Kosovo was not made any
clearer.

LARGE MISSILE ORDER IS EXPECTED

<P>
   Raytheon Co. expects to receive about $1 billion in orders to
replenish stocks of cruise missiles and other weapons fired during
the air war against Serbia, the company's chief exectuive said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., also is considering selling
or closing a Quincy, Mass., electronics plant that employs about
500 people, said chief executive Daniel Burnham, and should
announce a decision soon.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham made the remarks to reporters after giving a breakfast
speech at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Boston. The country's
third-largest defense contractor, Raytheon supplies weapons like
the Navy's Tomahawk cruise missile and glider bombs used by the Air
Force. Until Thursday it hadn't quantified how much revenue it
anticipates from the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Observers estimate NATO forces have used hundreds of Tomahawks
to blast targets in the Balkans. Another Raytheon system in use is
a missile decoy device known as the ALE-50, towed behind B-1
bombers and F-16 fighter jets. The pods send out electronic signals
to distract enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force does not discuss its use of the disposable decoy
or its cost, but Aviation Week recently reported that B-1s using
the decoys have avoided harm from 30 Serb missiles fired at them.
An Air Force spokesman declined to discuss the report.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, a Raytheon spokesman said, the company expects to
receive $1 billion in orders within the next year, and it expects
to fulfill those orders over the next three years. ``We are
beginning now to get approvals'' from the Pentagon, Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   The figure doesn't include new orders Raytheon might receive
from other NATO countries it supplies such as Britain and Spain,
Burnham said. In addition to new bombs and missiles, some of the
work will include the refurbishment of older Tomahawks with
satellite-guidance mechanisms to make them more accurate. So far
the US military has allocated $424 million to upgrade 626 older
Tomahawks.
</P>
<P>
   S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said the forecast was in
line with expectations for Raytheon and that the campaign against
Kosovo would likely boost overall US defense spending next year as
well. That should help rivals like Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin
Corp. as well.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also said the company is still reviewing options for its
microelectronics plant in Quincy, which produces components for the
Patriot defense missile and for ground-based radar systems. While
the company has no immediate plans to shut the plant, he said,
Raytheon is ``examining all options'' for its future, including a
possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk, sponsored by Northeastern University, and in
wide-ranging comments afterward, Burnham described his efforts
reshape Raytheon to take advantage of technological changes and to
emphasize customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Since being named Raytheon's chief executive last year, Burnham
has tried to decentralize the sprawling institution and to make it
more efficient through layoffs and reorganizations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those efforts should help Raytheon save about $1.2
billion in 2001, Burnham said, and help the company win more US and
foreign military orders. He also said Raytheon expected higher
profits from civilian projects such as dam-building, which together
generated about 25 percent of Raytheon's revenue of $19.5 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In other matters, Burnham said he was encouraged by a US Navy
decision to give Raytheon a $140 million contract to build a
prototype radar system, making it the likely supplier of the full
shipboard radar system as well.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham declined to discuss how much Raytheon might earn from
such contracts, which analysts estimate to be worth billions. He
also declined to discuss reports in British newspapers that
officials that have selected Raytheon to build a major system known
as the Airborne Stand-Off Radar, or ASTOR.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said the company has heard no decision from British
authorities and doesn't know when it might. Should Raytheon win,
Burnham said, the project work would serve as the basis for a new
surveillance business unit to be based in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Raytheon rose 1/2 to close at 70 1/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

WHITE HOUSE REACTS WITH CAUTIOUS RELIEF TO WORD OF PEACE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton cautiously welcomed word of
Yugoslavia's apparent acceptance of international peace terms for
Kosovo as some members of the administration privately expressed
relief that a difficult military and diplomatic episode may be
coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, if it holds up, would mark the beginning of the
end of a 10-week crisis that has brought devastation to the Balkans
and a bitter debate in Washington over Clinton's concept of a
limited, casualty-free war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movement by the Serbian leadership to accept these conditions,
established by NATO and the international community is, of course,
welcome,'' the president said in a brief Rose Garden appearance
Thursday afternoon. ``But based on our past experience, we must
also be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other senior administration officials still
expressed deep skepticism about Belgrade's intentions, saying that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has repeatedly broken
promises to abide by international accords. They insisted that the
bombing of Yugoslavia would continue until Milosevic has begun the
rapid withdrawal of his army and police forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, and until Serb forces begin a verifiable
withdrawal from Kosovo, we will continue to pursue diplomacy, but
we will also continue the military effort that has brought us to
this point,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met late in the afternoon with the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, to review the terms of the peace agreement and discuss the
steps leading to the deployment of a 50,000-troop peacekeeping
force in Kosovo. Military leaders told the president that they are
prepared to move allied soldiers into Kosovo swiftly, beginning as
soon as Yugoslavian forces start to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials at the White House, State Department and Pentagon
all hewed to the cautious line the president laid down. Behind the
administration's public reserve, however, was a deep sense of
relief, almost of vindication, after more than seven weeks of
relentless war-making in the Balkans and harsh criticism at home.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including members of Congress, charged that the
president engaged the nation in a distant war that did not threaten
U.S. interests. Others said Clinton pursued a military campaign of
half-measures that would never achieve its stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   But the calibrated war waged by the United States and its NATO
allies appeared to be on the brink of success in its limited aims _
the removal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo, the return of refugees
to the province and the entry of a NATO-led peacekeeping force to
police the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore particularly welcomed the news, aides
said, not only because it meant the likely end of the latest Balkan
conflict, but because U.S. troops would not be fighting a European
war during his campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was too early to declare victory, because
countless details need to be resolved and nearly a million refugees
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, one of the most ardent
advocates within the administration of the air war, expressed
guarded satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   She underlined the uncertainties about how Milosevic would
proceed in the coming days, a wariness brought on by the Yugoslav
leader's past failures to live up to accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to take this a step at a time,'' she told
reporters at the State Department Thursday afternoon. ``He has
accepted something but it has to be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Her chief spokesman, James Rubin, added: ``This is not a time
for popping champagne corks. This is a time for getting the
refugees home and for getting the Serb forces out of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official, speaking candidly only when
promised anonymity, said there would be plenty of time for
self-congratulation later if an end to the conflict on allied terms
has in fact been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to declare victory when victory in fact is at
hand,'' the official said. ``We will be relieved when he has
withdrawn his forces. But right now we're viewing this with more
than a dash of skepticism. It's a long way from this to seeing the
last Serb soldier cross the border and walk north.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this wariness, a top foreign policymaker said that the
allies are in a much stronger position today than they were 24
hours ago _ indeed, at any time since the bombardment of Yugoslavia
began on the night of March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either Milosevic complies, or his defiance vastly strengthens
our hand to do what we need to do,'' this aide said. ``It would
demonstrate his cynicism _when given the chance to choose peace he
chose war. It would alienate the Russians and make it easy to
resume the bombing until he complies.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Albright described Milosevic as accepting and understanding the
demands listed in a document delivered to him by the president of
Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, who was representing the European Union,
and the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The two-page document, obtained by The New York Times, outlined
the basic five demands of NATO, most importantly the withdrawal of
all of Milosevic's forces from Kosovo under a ``rapid'' timetable
and the deployment of an international force under NATO command and
control to take back and protect the ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement said that once all the Serbian and Yugoslav forces
had left, an ``agreed number of Yugoslav and Serbian personnel''
would be allowed to return. They would serve as liaison with the
international military and civic missions in Kosovo, clear
minefields, and maintain a presence at Serb religious sites and at
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   No specific number was mentioned in the document for the Serb
and Yugoslav officials who would be allowed to return, referring
only to ``hundreds, not thousands.'' Administration officials have
insisted in the last several weeks that these people would amount
to only a symbolic presence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was some confusion over whether the document given to
Milosevic _ and which was primarily drafted under the supervision
of the Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott _ was precisely
the same as that passed by the Serbian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference, according to the State Department
spokesman, Rubin, was a footnote which was on the document given to
Milosevic but excluded in the document passed by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote dealt with differences between NATO and Russia over
participation of Russia in the international security force.
Russia, according to the footnote, did not agree to its soldiers
participating in the international security force that was under
NATO command and control.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote states that the force would have a unified NATO
chain of command under the political direction of the NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   If Russian soldiers participated in the force, they would do so
under arrangements to be made in the future, the administration
said. The State Department said that Ahtisaari explained to
Milosevic the meaning of the footnote and told the Yugoslav leader
that the question of Russian participation was a matter between
NATO and Russia and had no bearing on Yugoslavia. Milosevic,
according to this account, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   For the State Department, the next few days promised to be
tense: a waiting game to see if Milosevic would agree to codify his
acceptance in a formal military-to-military agreement worked out
between NATO and the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The British general, Michael Jackson, who heads the NATO troops
already deployed in Macedonia as a vanguard for the international
security force, was expected to head a NATO military delegation
that would negotiate with the Yugoslav military, an administration
official said. The meeting likely would take place not in Belgrade,
but along one of Serbia's borders, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The terms under which the NATO bombing would be suspended were
the most critical steps in the coming days, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This was because once the bombing was suspended it would be
extremely difficult to resume the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   A number of alliance members would resist a resumption. Further,
an administration official said, once the bombing stopped, refugees
were likely to start returning home, making a resumption of bombing
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   While officials said the bombardment would continue until a
verifiable withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo begins, they
indicated that the pace and breadth of the bombing would diminish
over the next several days as the final diplomatic details are
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONALT TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes will not attack retreating Serb soldiers, one
official said. ``Everybody understands we would not do anything to
impede the withdrawal of their forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the agreement ran from relief to scathing
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., lambasted the agreement as a ``so-called peace
deal'' which had been negotiated by the Russians, the European
Union and an indicted war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only acceptable deal with Slobodan Milosevic is one that
offers him safety in exile in exchange for his agreement to step
down and hand power to Serbian Democrats,'' Helms said in a
statement. ``Milosevic must be driven from power, vertically or
horizontally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., has supported the air war but
has questioned whether air power alone would compel Milosevic to
capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he expressed satisfaction that Milosevic apparently
had given in to the core NATO conditions, relieving the United
States of the burden of planning and carrying out a ground
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that in fact we have achieved our objectives on the
ground from the air and achieved them at astonishingly low rate of
casualties. We did not lose a NATO soldier in combat,'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we have been victorious in turning back ethnic
aggression. It is very important for the stability and peace of
Europe, but also critically important for the credibility of NATO
and the United States as protectors of the rule of law.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ As the USS Kearsarge sailed from the United
States for the Adriatic last month, one of the last things a sailor
told a reporter at the dock in Norfolk, Va., was: ``I don't trust
this guy.'' He was referring to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, and he had the Balkan bully exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   Every international leader who lines up at a microphone to hail
the Yugoslav government's acceptance Thursday of the
Western-dictated peace proposal should first have to write 1,000
times: ``I don't trust this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with that political penance accomplished, the great and
good who allowed the Kosovo crisis, like the Bosnian imbroglio
before it, to turn from canker into cancer should not be allowed to
wax euphoric about the deal. They should point out how difficult it
will be to carry out and how it is a temporizing proposal that does
not come close to being a final chapter in the sad, bloody
Serb-Kosovar epic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the document agreed to by Milosevic and his puppet
parliament in Belgrade appears straightforward, the emphasis should
be on the ``ifs,`` ``buts'' and ``howevers'' that will fill what
could be a treacherous period of implementation.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a new boy on the
international block but nonetheless in possession of the rotating
presidency of the European Union, verged on the triumphal as he
formally unveiled the deal at a summit of EU national leaders here
beside the Rhine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good day for Europe,'' Schroeder exulted. ``Peace
now is within reach.''
</P>
<P>
   But Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, a principal go-between
in the deal, refused to hurl himself into the victor's circle quite
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A first step,'' insisted Ahtisaari, who was seasoned
diplomatically by the decadelong wrangle over Namibia. The cautious
Finn said he reminded his EU colleagues:
</P>
<P>
   ``The English have a very good saying that the proof of the
pudding is in eating it. And the same goes for peace processes.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another fine saying in English: The devil is in the
details. And it applies amply in this case. Working out timing
issues, especially the withdrawal of Serb forces, will give new
meaning to the term ``fine tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which has been burned repeatedly by
Milosevic, took the minimally prudent step of insisting that the
NATO air strikes continue until the Serb regime has agreed to a
verifiable schedule for pulling Serb armed forces _ military,
paramilitary and police _ from the province.
</P>
<P>
   This insistence came as President Clinton finally sat down with
U.S. military leaders to discuss what an invasion of Yugoslavia
might look like, arguably a step that should have come before the
first NATO bomb fell 10 weeks ago. That initial lack of resolve
encouraged Milosevic to delay making the deal he eventually had to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   The world now knows that a post-Cold War NATO can remain
resolute for at least two months, if the commitment is primarily
U.S. pilots dropping bombs. It has not been a stellar display by
the world's pre-eminent military alliance as an uncertain globe
spins closer to the 21st century, but it's marginally better than
the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Politics being the art of the possible, perhaps Belgrade had to
be allowed the face-saving device of yielding to a peace plan
presented by representatives of the European Union (Ahtisaari) and
Russia (former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin) rather than by
NATO brass with gold braid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the NATO leaders, however, got what they were
looking for as a political exit strategy in the second paragraph of
an Associated Press news bulletin announcing Milosevic's acceptance
of the peace proposal: ``The move came right after Serb lawmakers
in Belgrade capitulated on all major Western demands ... .''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best signs of the day was the more-Serbian-than-thou
defiance of one of Milosevic's erstwhile partner parties. ``We
shall not sit in the government and await the arrival of NATO
troops in Kosovo,'' Serb Radical Party member Vojislav Seseljl
declared after voting against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   So much has been stage-managed in Belgrade (not to mention at
NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium) over the past few months
that it is tempting to write off these histrionics as more
theatrical decoration. But Milosevic was probably not in the mood
to have anyone appear more nationalistic than he on what cannot
have been one of his better days.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, the deal leaves Milosevic to fight again _ an
opportunity he almost certainly will take. The old Communist
bureaucrat has proven he does not know how to govern, only to
agitate.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari noted that dealing with whether Milosevic continues in
power was ``not part of my mandate.'' But the issue must be
addressed, and more than one leader in Washington and in Europe has
questioned how the troubled Balkans can move securely toward
democracy while Milosevic remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   As the EU heads of government met privately here by the Rhine
and began to discuss what will come next in southeastern Europe,
outgoing EU Parliament President Jose Maria Gil-Robles, a Spanish
centrist, expressed his deep concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem ... is Mr. Milosevic,'' Gil-Robles said of the
future southeastern Europe. ``I am not convinced Mr. Milosevic can
be changed. Nothing is impossible in this world , but it's not
probable.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer Milosevic stays, the longer U.S. troops will need to
remain as part of the international peacekeeping force. That much
is clear from the experience of the Dayton accords that brought
peace and U.S. troops to Bosnia and Herzegovina and has kept them
there four times as long as Clinton promised.
</P>
<P>
   To have continued meaning and effectiveness, the Bosnian accord
needs to be renegotiated with a view to a final peace settlement,
which will almost certainly be more difficult to reach than the
interim pact.
</P>
<P>
   And Bosnia, many analysts believe, was a less intractable issue
than Kosovo, which as every school child has learned over the last
two months, holds shrines that are at the core of Serb identity,
although Serbs have left the province over recent decades to ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   An ultimate resolution in Bosnia and Kosovo may lie in partition
along ethnic lines, a process that concedes defeat for the goal of
multiethnic societies and, equally disheartening, rarely guarantees
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   As the second anniversary of the Dayton deal approached in 1997,
Brookings Institution analyst Susan Woodward told the Dayton (Ohio)
Daily News: ``The compromises that each side agreed to were
compromises that they could not deliver. It simply delayed the day
of reckoning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deal agreed to Thursday, all sides can deliver if they
want to, but the final reckoning for Kosovo was not made any
clearer.

OLYMPIC WAR OF WORDS ESCALATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol on Thursday escalated his war
of words with David D'Alessandro, president of the John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance Co., in an unusual clash between two of the
most powerful businessmen in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol charged that D'Alessandro's continuing calls for reform
of the International Olympic Committee are rooted in the Hancock
executive's disappointment over the return on the company's
marketing investment in the Olympics. Ebersol also reached back to
a lobbying scandal in the early 1990s to say that Hancock has
ethical problems of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, in more than three decades of this, I have never
criticized a sponsor before, especially publicly,'' Ebersol said.
``This was boiling up inside of me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the battle was largely one-sided Thursday. Officials at
Hancock said D'Alessandro would make no response.
</P>
<P>
   ``These continued personal attacks from Mr. Ebersol are
unbecoming of an exectuve from a major network,'' Hancock said in a
written statement. ``We are not going to trade personal insults
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers, meanwhile, expressed surprise that Ebersol had
mounted a second offensive against a major advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in advertising for 30 years and my father was at
CBS Sports, and I have to say during that entire time I don't
recall anything like this ever happening between a television
network and a major advertiser,'' said Walter Pile, president of
Pile and Co., a management consulting and marketing agency. ``And
it's not pretty to watch, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are closely identified with the projects they are
seeking to protect. Ebersol is the driving force behind NBC's $3.5
billion investment for Olympic television rights. The scandals,
involving allegations of bribery of IOC officials, threaten to
diminish the willingness of corporations to purchase advertising
time during the lengthy broadcast schedule.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro is credited with modernizing Hancock's corporate
image through its sponsorship of sports events like the Boston
Marathon, the Olympics, figure skating events, gymnastics teams and
a college bowl game. He has threatened to withdraw Hancock's
sponsorship of the Olympic games and its television advertising if
substantive reforms are not adopted by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Greyser, who teaches corporate communications and the
business of sport at the Harvard Business School, said both men are
trying to speak to larger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ebersol wants to speak to people who buy advertising at the
major companies who may consider whether to purchase time during
the Olympics,'' Greyser said. ``D'Alessandro's constituency is the
other companies who sponsor or who may sponsor the Olympics. He may
be perceived as the lightning rod for their discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   A marketing official with another major Olympic sponsor said
that both Ebersol and D'Alessandro are acting as surrogates in the
continuing debate over the pace and scope of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sponsors wish David would shut up and that someone would
come forward to defend the Olympics before they are really
damaged,'' the official said. ``Others wish the IOC would do
exactly what David has been advocating eloquently for months. Some
of the sponsors wish both things would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What also is playing out, observers said, is a struggle between
two powerful men used to getting their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both known for not being entirely agreeable
characters,'' Pile said. ``There is an abrasiveness about both of
them that is well-documented.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol first went public Tuesday, bitterly criticizing
D'Alessandro's for his high-profile advocacy for Olympic reforms.
Then Thursday, after assembling several reporters from major news
outlets around the country for a conference telephone call from
Paris, Ebersol said D'Alessandro has long been disillusioned about
Hancock's Olympic sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many people involved with the Olympics have known for
some time that he is a dissatisfied sponsor,'' Ebersol said.
``Maybe he just found it was too rich for his blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has paid $40 million for its current sponsorship of the
Olympic games, an amount that does not include television
advertising during the games. D'Alessandro has frequently said that
his criticism of the Olympic Games is motivated by dissatisfaction
with the terms of the company's sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol also said Hancock has its own ethical problems. He said
he was referring to a lawsuit, recently reinstated, based on
allegations that Hancock's lobbyists had improperly given gifts to
lawmakers in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not directly consulted with his superiors at
General Electric, which owns NBC, before making his criticisms
public. But he said he had made GE executives aware of his anger
and frustration.

IN BEIJING, REMINDERS OF '89 PROTEST ARE FEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Next to a busy intersection Thursday night, about
eight miles west of Tiananmen Square, hundreds of retirees were
practicing a traditional flag-waving dance to the pounding of
drums.
</P>
<P>
   Happily pursuing a popular hobby, the dancers seemed unaware
that exactly 10 years ago Thursday night, this same intersection on
Changan Avenue was the scene of the first major bloodshed as troops
moved to crush student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, the
giant plaza at the heart of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this intersection, called Wu Ke Song, that tanks and
troop-filled armored personnel carriers rolling in from the west
first encountered streets clogged with angry citizens who had
tipped buses and trolley cars to block the route to the square.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers opened fire with automatic weapons. In a three-hour
period that night, the nearby military hospital took in 83 gunshot
victims, 7 of whom died.
</P>
<P>
   Similar edgy crowds and barricades faced the army at many more
intersections along the way to the square, which troops finally
occupied early on June 4, at the cost of hundreds of lives. Street
confrontations and shootings continued in the city for days.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, there was little overt reminder in Beijing of the
intense emotions and violence of 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tiananmen Square itself is under construction and surrounded by
a blue metal fence, being newly resurfaced for a giant parade Oct.
1 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a surplus of police officers along Changan over the
last few days, the dense traffic and casual sidewalk life have
continued as normal. Thanks to heavy police pressure and strategic
detentions, any public demonstrations or memorials here have been
prevented.
</P>
<P>
   On the long stretch of Changan between the site of the first
deadly volleys and Tiananmen Square, there are many signs of how
things have changed over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The military hospital that had received so many wounded has been
rebuilt. It now sports a red neon sign saying ``People's Liberation
Army General Hospital'' that recreates the calligraphy of Jiang
Zemin, whose signature appears in neon just below. Jiang was thrust
into leadership of the Communist Party and the country during the
1989 crisis, and has worked to bury that legacy with economic
progress ever since.
</P>
<P>
   At another intersection nearer the city center, a wall pocked
with bullets from the morning of June 4 _ where several soldiers
were said to have been killed by outraged crowds _ has long since
been torn down, replaced by a shopping complex that includes a
McDonald's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country in the last few weeks, about 100 dissidents
have been picked up and warned not to engage in Tiananmen
memorials, and about 34 were being held Thursday, said a Hong Kong
human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern city of Hangzhou, a group wearing white flowers
of mourning tried to gather but were dispersed by police, with
three arrests, said the group, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
   At his regularly scheduled news conference, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao repeated the government's unwavering line:
``In the political turmoil of 1989, the government took timely and
resolute measures necessary for the stability and development of
China.''

CLINTON RENEWS CHINA TRADE STATUS AMID ROCKY RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday renewed normal trade
relations with China, setting off an annual congressional debate
complicated this year by allegations that China has stolen U.S.
nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers expect Congress to muster enough votes to overturn
Clinton's action, but the debate is expected to be heated. And
hopes are fading that Clinton can win congressional approval for
Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization before the next
round of international trade talks in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   As one indication of the trouble now facing U.S.-China
relations, Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., who has supported normal
trade relations with China throughout his four years in Congress,
said Thursday he is now ``undecided and gravely concerned.'' The
other 10 members of the state's congressional delegation, although
expressing a variety of concerns about China's behavior, continue
to support normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted Thursday that maintaining normal trade
relations with China is in U.S. interests because of a rapid
increase in U.S. exports to China. But in a statement issued just a
day before Friday's 10th anniversary of the Chinese massacre of
protesters at Tiananmen Square, Clinton acknowledged widespread
concerns about China's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursue engagement with our eyes wide open, without
illusions,'' he said. ``We continue to speak frankly about our
differences and to firmly protect our national interests. A policy
of disengagement and confrontation would only strengthen those in
China who oppose greater openness and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, U.S.-China relations seemed to be on an
upswing. China offered to lift a 27-year ban on the importation of
Northwest wheat as part of a broad package of trade concessions,
and the two countries appeared to be on track to negotiate China's
accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 7, NATO forces accidently bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, killing three people. That was followed by several
days of anti-Western demonstrations in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a House committee headed by Reps. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., and Norm Dicks, D-Wash., reported that China had
succeeded in stealing design information about all seven nuclear
warheads currently deployed on American missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had lousy counterintelligence at our national
labs is something we should be embarrassed about, but we should not
change our basic relationship with China,'' Dicks said. ``We're
cleaning up our mess, but I don't think we should create another
one by trying to go to a Cold War setting with China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly anybody would say that this is a very difficult time
to pass legislation giving normal trade relations to China,'' said
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. ``I think it will pass ... but what I'm
worried about is that there will be so much Red Scare-ing ... that
we will lose sight of the larger goal, which is to involve the
Chinese in the community of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's Republican members of Congress are more
inclined to blame Clinton than China for the spying episode, and,
with the exception of Metcalf, they do not believe the spying
debate should be tied to trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be surprised that there are people spying on
us,'' said Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash. ``Our surprise should be when
we discover that we don't act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   China is the fourth largest trading partner of the United
States, which last year exported $14.3 billion of goods to China
and imported $71.2 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington state, where two-way trade with China ranks third
largest among Asia-Pacific nations at nearly $10 billion in 1997,
there are a variety of economic issues at stake. Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., said he supports normal trade relations with
China because of the importance of winning better access to Chinese
markets for eastern Washington agricultural products. Rep. Jay
Inslee, D-Wash., said normal relations would allow a tougher
crackdown on software piracy in China that would help companies
like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the state's largest employer, will be leading the charge
in favor of normal relations through its chairman, Philip Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade with China is a cornerstone of a stable U.S.-China
relationship, and presents Americans with unprecedented
opportunities with the world's most populous country,'' Condit
said. ``Normal trade relations with China not only sustains
hundreds of thousands of export and import-related jobs, but it
also supports U.S. companies operating in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said that ``In the long run, when
individual members of Congress are looking at the 5,000 concessions
China has made, they're going to think of their own districts, and
when they see the benefits for the high-tech community, for the
beef producers, for the wheat farmers, then we will move away from
the current contentious atmosphere and look at reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., in the past a skeptical voice on
U.S.-China relations, this year said that he would support
permanent normal trade relations with China based on a series of
concessions agreed to this spring. Gorton is now worried that the
deal with China may have fallen apart, but if Clinton reconstructs
it, Gorton has pledged to help him win permanent normal relations
in the Senate, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The three other members of the state's congressional delegation,
Republican Jennifer Dunn and Democrats Brian Baird and Adam Smith,
support normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has normal trade relations with most
countries. The status, formerly known as most favored nation,
allows countries low tariffs when exporting to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The president must decide each year whether to renew normal
trade relations with countries like China that do not grant their
residents freedom of emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has 60 days to overturn a president's action on trade
relations, but has done so only once, in 1989, shortly after
Tiananmen Square. President Bush vetoed that action, and Congress
failed to override his veto.

   (italics)Ah, the age of the computer. Remember the dream? The

   ``Several years ago in my space agency office, we younger

<P>
   ``We named the simple plaque award after one of the older guys
in the office, a gentleman who never really got the hang of the
electronic age,'' she says. ``The plaque was passed from desk to
desk by a kind of informal laugh meter that measured the level of
hysterical snickers following a computer disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, while Ms. Bernstein was trying to delete a few documents
from her computer, she was in the wrong directory when she typed in
a command. The move, she says, ``killed my hard drive forever.''
The award moved to her desk.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague received the prize ``for making smoke come out of
her CPU,'' she says. ``We still don't know how that happened,'' she
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else in the office called the ``help'' desk because his
computer wouldn't stop beeping _ at least not until ``he took the
book off of his keyboard and released the pressure on the letter
`L.'''
</P>
<P>
   But her favorite award story, she says, was about a friend who
needed to print a sketch of some special space agency hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a plotter in our building.'' she writes. ``This is a
printer that uses a large roll of paper and can print graphic
images of any size.'' Her friend, she says, ``sent a print command
to the plotter to draw a picture of the International Space
Station. Full scale.''

MILOSEVIC ACCEPTS PEACE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Under pressure from unrelenting airstrikes, a
war-weary public, and even his few remaining allies, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic gave in Thursday and accepted a peace
plan that calls for the replacement of his troops in Kosovo with
international peacekeepers, including those from nations that have
bombed his country for 72 days.
</P>
<P>
   It was that very prospect _ foreign troops on Serbian soil _
that led a defiant Milosevic to pick a fight with NATO. But in a
stunning, sudden reversal greeted cautiously as a step toward peace
by Washington, Milosevic Thursday endorsed a settlement that gave
him less than he could have gotten 10 weeks ago, before much of his
nation's infrastructure was destroyed by NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's swift acceptance of the plan, without modifications
and less than 24 hours after it was handed to him by Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
surprised even Ahtisaari and underscored how anxious Milosevic was
to end the bombing that has left much of his already impoverished
country in ruins. Such bombing continued Thursday night, as NATO
and Washington awaited proof that the Yugoslav leader would make
good on his latest promise.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is notorious for nitpicking over details and making
visiting envoys cool their heels for hours or even days. But with
even the Russians, Serbia's biggest traditional allies, pushing for
a deal, Milosevic apparently decided to cut his losses.
</P>
<P>
   Charging that hundreds of Yugoslav civilians and an unknown
number of soldiers died for nothing, opposition politicians seized
on what they called Milosevic's ``capitulation,'' the opening salvo
in what may be an attempt to drive him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, an
international peackeeping with ``essential NATO participation,''
demilitarization of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army that has been
fighting Serb forces for independence, and autonomy for Kosovo, all
of it overseen by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The plan makes no reference to the international war crimes
tribunal at The Hague, which last week indicted Milosevic for
orchestrating the forced explusion of some 800,000 ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo. War crimes prosecutors said they would not consider
dropping the indictment for Milosevic's acceptance of NATO's
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari admitted he had mentally prepared for a long, drawn
out process and more trips to Belgrade, and was surprised that
Milosevic accepted the plan so readily. He said Milosevic had only
once suggested revising the text, but that the Serbian leader did
not argue when told it was ``the best offer the international
community was in a position to make.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton welcomed the news, but said that, given
Milosevic's history of broken pledges, the bombing would continue
until NATO could verify that Serb forces were withdrawing from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A military agreement for withdrawal of Serb forces would be
worked out in talks over the next several days between NATO and
Yugoslav military representatives, said Defense Secretary William
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a military-to-military relationship established,
at least for the purpose of going over the details and the
mechanics and logistics in the event that there is intent to fully
comply with this,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which was spelled out in less than three pages
of type, the Serbs have two days to pull their anti-aircraft
defense systems back from the Kosovo border, and seven days to pull
all of their estimated 40,000 troops from the war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   It puts the postwar administration of Kosovo under the auspices
of the United Nations, which will oversee the peacekeeping force of
troops made up from NATO countries, Russia and possibly other
nonaligned countries. Ahtisaari said the details of troops, and who
will lead them under a unified command, still had to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari said NATO military leaders and officers of the
Yugoslav Army were in contact to coordinate troop withdrawals so
convoys of Serb troops would not be bombed by NATO pilots.
</P>
<P>
   While Ahtisaari cautioned against ``jumping with enthusiasm,''
he predicted the bombing would end ``within days,'' and that
preparations for getting refugees to return to their homes in
Kosovo could begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic's acceptance of the peace plan brought
widespread relief here, it also led to immediate calls for his
resignation. His political enemies accused him of provoking a fight
with the world's most powerful military alliance and accepting a
settlement that was less advantageous to Yugoslavia than what was
on offer before NATO began bombing March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a capitulation,'' said Dragan Vselinov, a member of
the Serbian parliament. ``We asked for the resignation of this
government. This government... destroyed our country. Why was this
war needed if we sign a capitulation?''
</P>
<P>
   After a debate that lasted less than two hours, the Serbian
parliament endorsed the plan, 136 to 74, with only the extreme
nationalist Serbian Radical Party opposing it. In March, the same
parliament had rejected a similar plan, fashioned from peace talks
in France, that would have given Serb forces a bigger role in
Kosovo after an international peacekeeping force went in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never accept foreign, aggressor troops in Serbia,''
said Vojislav Seslj, whose Radical Party forms the coalition
government with Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. He warned
darkly that NATO troops in Kosovo would be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But others hailed the deal as an opportunity for Yugoslavia to
change its status as a pariah in the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, who was fired as deputy prime minister last month
when he called on Milosevic to accept a compromise similar to the
one accepted Thursday, called for reconciliation, going so far as
to suggest he would shake hands with American soldiers despite his
anger at the American-led NATO bombing campaign that killed
hundreds of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic criticized Seslj and others for ``creating conflict''
with the European Union and the United States. He also said, ``We
need all kinds of aid and support.''
</P>
<P>
   But speaking in Cologne, Germany, during a European Union
summit, European Parliament president Jose Maria Gil-Robles said
the EU would not help rebuild Yugoslavia as long as Milosevic is
its leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be able to negotiate with Serbia as long as Mr.
Milosevic is in power,'' Gil-Robles said. ``The difficulty is Mr.
Milosevic. The system in Serbia has to change to a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be Milosevic's allies that do him in before the
opposition gets a chance. Seslj vowed to pull out of the coalition
and bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement carried by the state-controlled media,
Milosevic's government stressed that it had accepted an agreement
that would be overseen by the UN and that guaranteed that Kosovo
would remain part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But the western allies do not want an independent Kosovo and
respect for Serbia's ``territorial integrity'' had been assured
under the Rambouillet agreement which Yugoslav officials rejected
in March, precipitating the showdown with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rambouillet agreement would have allowed for thousands
of Serb forces in Kosovo, the peace plan accepted Thursday will
allow only ``hundreds'' to guard border crossings, clear mines and
protect Serb heritage sites, a reference to the Orthodox
monasteries and battle sites in Kosovo that Serbs hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's main concession, meanwhile, was to agree to have its
troops serve under the United Nations.

 &HT;    A wild man's blues
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most compelling scenes in the maudlin
psycho-thriller ``Instinct'' are a queer blend of the sublime and
the outrightly ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   They occur deep in the swallowing green of the Rwandan jungle,
sanctuary of the endangered mountain gorillas. There a
primatologist, played by Anthony Hopkins, is entranced by the
animals' simple existence and decides to trade his civilized life
for that among the great apes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked them. I even needed them,'' he recalls, without
snickering.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins and the gentle, eggplant-headed primates exchange
soulful looks _ seeds of mutual understanding _ and eventually
shake hands. You almost expect them to share a cigar and play
poker. Under Jon Turteltaub's commonplace direction, the images
move with gentle empathy and PBS lyricism. It's monkey poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Hopkins' flashback fades, the gorillas are gone, and the
real monkey business begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' swiftly devolves into ingratiating New Age schlock,
with aspirations to the psycho-thrills of ``Silence of the Lambs''
and tough epiphanies of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' It's
not smart enough for either. Gerald DiPego's mawkish screenplay
(suggested by Austinite Daniel Quinn's philosophical novel
``Ishmael'') broadcasts this newsflash: ``We don't own the world.
We are not gods.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Ethan Powell's (Hopkins) message to civilization.
Scrambling but lost, modern humans are a species of ``takers,''
says Powell. We have lost the purity of existence enjoyed by men
10,000 years ago. Sure, but we've got cable.
</P>
<P>
   Powell has achieved Buddhalike enlightenment in the ungoverned
wilds. ``I had different teachers,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   In a brutal scene that will sting animal lovers, Powell kills
two Rwandan park rangers in a bid to protect the doomed gorillas.
He is locked up in an American prison for the criminally insane. He
won't speak and has a bad habit of flying into violent tantrums.
Hopkins, looking a tad ludicrous, snarls and wears his long, gray
hair in ``wild man'' mode, so that it sprays all over, crazylike.
He looks like one of the Allman Brothers during a real good jam.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), an ambitious young
psychiatrist desperate to make a name cracking what happened to
Powell, who was once a suburban family man employed at a zoo. The
men face-off, Caulder goading the ape-man prophet and Powell
sitting glazed with cryptic menace. It's Hannibal Lecter and
Clarice Starling all over again.
</P>
<P>
   What does Caulder learn? That man is a beast, and beast is a
saint.
</P>
<P>
   Instinct's'' pseudo-philosophizing is about as trite and
condescending as it comes. To make the point that the gorilla way
of life is superior, the filmmakers shamelessly anthropomorphize
the poor beasts, who I bet don't think there's anything very
special about eating branches, sitting in the rain and doing
without Gap khakis. And I'm sure they could live without Danny
Elfman's smothering angel choruses whenever we see the gorillas'
Edenic jungle home.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins and Gooding flex their considerable acting chops with
great seriousness. Gooding simmers with crisp intensity, but he
doesn't seem to be tapping anything very deep, and this dangerously
softens the portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is ... well, Hopkins. He spikes his stoic minimalism
with snaps of unlikely physical fury, but he's really not doing
anything we haven't seen before. He apes himself.

 &HT;    `Desert Blue': Where life drifts along like tumbleweed
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the boring dustbowl of fictional Baxter,
Calif., pop. 89, diversion for the local teens comes in the form of
tourists getting gas or stopping to ogle with willed wonder the
giant plaster ice cream cone rising from the dirt into the big blue
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Escapism is at a premium in this forgotten outpost, where pop
culture, like precious water, is piped in in trickles, if at all.
So when a hot teen TV actress named Skye (Kate Hudson, as a Tori
Spelling archetype) arrives with her addled father (John Heard),
the Baxter teens are furnished a conspicuous outsider to sniff and
circle, with curiosity and contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Skye, to her huffy consternation, finds herself stuck in Baxter
after a truck filled with soda pop crashes and spills nearby. The
FBI, fearing a toxic spill, has quarantined the town. No one is
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue,'' directed with quiet assurance by Morgan J.
Freeman (``Hurricane Streets''), traces the progressive minglings
of Skye and the local youths, a scruffy lot who conjure amusement
from the dust by setting off homemade bombs, riding motorbikes and
getting drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely little happens in this miniaturist portrait of
alienation, a teen condition given metaphorical urgency by the
remote setting. The story's core has Blue (a zonked Brendan Sexton
III) and Skye inching into a tentative teen romance. Freeman
clutters the remaining empty space with quirks that reek of
precious symbolism. (Take the couple's overtly literary names _
Blue, Skye _ please.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue'' is very much a young man's movie, a strained
attempt at real-time profundity that's finally undermined by its
own vacancy. The film is earnest, if quixotic, but doesn't say
anything larger than its navel-gazing self.

OUT WITH THE OLD AT CHANNEL 5
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Ed Arnold had done something completely and
insanely idiotic _ and in the realm of local sports TV, that could
be one of about 238,000 things _ maybe KTLA Channel 5 could justify
having him escorted from the building when his contract runs out at
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, Arnold doing something other than sound,
meaningful, thoughtful reporting would be news itself.
</P>
<P>
   So why has the sportscaster of L.A. television for the last 31
years started the humiliating process of packing his stuff, which
has understandably upset many at the station?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think age had to be a factor, but that's their
prerogative,'' said the 59-year-old Arnold, a KTLA anchor for 20
years, the last 11 of them in his current spot after a seven-year
run at KABC Channel 7. ``I know I'm not as young as I once was and
they'd like a younger look _ you can see by the (network) programs
that lead into the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``But none of that's important. I understand the nature of the
business. It's changed. I'd rather go too soon than too late.''
</P>
<P>
   While deciding on several options he's already been presented
with, Arnold's return to local TV sports would be a surprise. A
talented man who is deeply involved in community charity projects
has too much going on his life _ including two grandkids, a
2-year-old and a 3-week-old _ to worry about himself at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing about all this that really gets me is how local
stations seem to be throwing in the towel when it comes to
sports,'' said Arnold. ``It's a shame someone who works as hard as
Jim Hill (at KCBS Channel 2) gets a minute and 14 seconds of time
on the 11 p.m. news. A few guys in this town actually bust their
butt to do their job and don't get much time to show it. Every time
there's a major sports story, look where it goes _ high in the
newscast. With my schedule, I don't have time to watch a half-hour
of scores to see how the local teams have done. I do have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   They've killed Kenny: KCOP Channel 13 has also decided to dump
weekend hipster Kenny Sargent from its sports pen at the end of
this month. But the upside is KCOP will be bringing in someone
who'll become L.A.'s first female sportscaster in a long while.
Michelle Bonner, working at the Fox affiliate in Houston, should be
on board by the end of July to work with Newy Scruggs.
</P>
<P>
   Another age-old question: Fox Sports has already started running
a series of ads featuring a bumbling, !ital!really
</P>
<P>
   old-timer trying to make a comeback as a promotion for the start
of its national baseball coverage _ by the way, it's Saturday, with
the Angels-Dodgers at 1 p.m. as one of four interdivisional
regional broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   As a preemptive strike to discourage organized protests of the
ads before they begin en masse, let's point out one thing _ the
spots are drop-dead hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them have a Dodgers angle. In one, the old-timer tries
using the ``catcher-cam'' and ends up getting flattened by Raul
Mondesi scoring a run. Another shows the old guy taking a lead off
first, held on by Eric Karros. When he goes to steal second, he
hobbles down the line and drops into a slide that comes up a few
feet short of second so that Todd Hundley throws him out _ which by
that fact alone is hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world, it doesn't take much to get people
annoyed,'' said Fox Sports executive producer Ed Goren. ``We've
played them for various groups and the reaction was very positive.
It produced a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very cluttered environment of commercials, it's more and
more difficult to grab the attention of the viewer. It's even more
challenging when you're launching baseball coverage eight weeks
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Keith Olbermann, who'll start the festivities Saturday with
Steve Lyons on the pre-game studio show: ``Considering Luis Polonia
is pushing 70 and still playing the outfield, the spots may be
mistaken for a highlight.''
</P>
<P>
   The final slapshot: Snide remarks made recently by NHL chief
operating officer Steve Solomon that lame-duck Fox was reluctant to
cross-promote the sport's national package with ESPN were
unjustified for a TV partner finishing off a five-year, $155
million deal with Games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals on
Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox dumped more than $25 million in promoting the sport before
it eased off a bit this year after ABC charged in with a $600
million, five-year deal that starts with next season. And if Fox's
legacy to the sport will be the glowing puck, at least that drew
the highest-rated NHL telecast during the Fox reign: a 4.1 rating
for the '96 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ratings are good, TV takes too much credit and when
they're bad, TV takes too much blame,'' said Fox's Goren, who said
the overall NHL rating on the network started to become diluted
when, after two seasons, Fox expanded the regular-season package
from six games to 11 and had to compete with events like the NCAA
Final Four and The Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got a payoff in the postseason with hockey, for
whatever reason. It seems hockey fans, once their teams drop out,
stop watching. It doesn't help that hockey hasn't been able to take
its young stars like Paul Kariya and make him a national star.
They're still celebrating Wayne Gretzky.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES _C'mon Charismatic, give me your special song: Among
its 37 cameras for Saturday's coverage of the Belmont Stakes, ABC
breaks out the gyrocam again and promises this time to use it.
It'll be attached to a vehicle on a service road between the two
grass tracks that runs inside of the dirt track and provides what
should be exceptional low-angle shots, either live or on the
replay. ``We're calling it the `Ben Hur camera,' '' said ABC's new
coordinating producer
</P>
<P>
   John Fillipelli . ``It's a tracking shot that we've certainly
not seen before and will be dramatic.'' &QL; 
_ Steven Michaels , a 28-year-old USC grad, spent more than a year
producing the latest project to be shown in ESPN's SportsCentury
project, the ``Top 10 Games of the 20th Century,'' a two-hour
special that airs on ABC (11:30 a.m.) as the lead-in to the Belmont
coverage. Steven's father, Al , who admits to providing the
play-by-play on at least one of the chosen finalists (think
miracles in Lake Placid), didn't need his arm twisted to agree to
be the show's host. &QL; 
_ABC won't spring for a third man in the ``Monday Night Football''
booth, but it will at least give Michaels and
</P>
<P>
   Boomer Esiason a visual aid: that electronic yellow first-down
yard marker, as its cousins at ESPN started last year on
Sunday-night NFL games. &QL; 
_The 60th anniversary issue of Joe Weider 's Woodland Hills-based
Muscle &AMP; Fitness magazine. You've definitely got to be in shape
just to pick up the 400-plus page issue, but the pre-movie star
pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger , including the huge photomosaic
centerfold, are worth ripping through it. WHAT CHOKES _How good a
friend is ESPN to Major League Baseball? At a time when verbal
sparring over coverage of a few September games has resulted in
each suing the other, it's ironic to note that it was an ESPN
camera making history in helping umpire Frank Pulli decide a call
in Monday's St. Louis-Florida game. Sure, Pulli took it upon
himself to check the viewfinder of a third-base ESPN camera to see
a replay of a fifth-inning ball hit by the Marlins' Cliff Floyd and
decide if it was a home run or a double. But that cameraman
certainly was under no obligation to offer it up, was he? The next
day, NL president Len Coleman ruled that Pulli had erred although
he ``acted in good faith'' in making the call and proclaimed: ``Use
of the video replay is not an acceptable practice. . . . In the
course of play, instant replay has no role in major-league
baseball.'' Especially, if it's an ESPN replay. &QL; 
_As part of its annual seven-hour ``Ultimate Stanley Cup Finals''
marathon, ESPN Classic Sports has _ again _ decided that the Game 2
slot will be the '93 Kings-Montreal contest (airing Sunday, 10
a.m.). Just let it die, OK? &QL; 
_ Chris Berman 's annual hockey nicknames that ESPN felt compelled
to release with the Stanley Cup Finals here include Buffalo's
Dominik ``Burning down the'' Hasek , Colorado's
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy ``Me Worry'' and Dallas' Joe ``Huey Lewis and the''
Nieuwendyk. He couldn't come up with one for the Sabres' Miroslav
Satan ?

 &HT;    `Return' shows courage and survival of POWs in VietnamBy Jody
Seaborn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Knocked out of the action, yet firmly in the
war, the 462 American pilots held prisoner for years by the North
Vietnamese during the Vietnam War fought uniquely personal battles.
A certain amount of luck may have been with these men when they
survived their initial shoot-down and capture, but it was pure
courage, discipline, willpower and a deep sense of honor that
enabled them to survive the beatings, torture and deprivation of
their long captivity. ``I knew if I lived, I was going to get
out,'' says one of the POWs, Air Force Lt. Tom McNish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor,'' a documentary by Oscar-winning filmmakers
Freida Lee Mock and Terry Sanders that played during this year's
South by Southwest Film Festival and returns today for a theatrical
run, tells these men's stories with sober reverence. The power and
emotion of the individual accounts engage our interest.
</P>
<P>
   Equally engaging _ indeed, fascinating _ is the archival footage
given Mock and Sanders by Vietnam's Ministry of Culture and
Information. As part of their propaganda machine, the North
Vietnamese shot reel after reel of 35 mm black-and-white film of
the POWs. Often forced to ``confess'' in front of the camera, many
of the POWs instead would transmit information to their commanders,
or defy their Vietnamese captors in other ways. Navy Cmdr. Jerry
Denton, for example, blinked out the word ``torture'' in Morse
code; Navy Lt. Cmdr. Richard Stratton pretended to be brainwashed.
``I played the Manchurian candidate,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Former POWs interviewed for ``Return With Honor'' include
Everett Alvarez, the first American pilot shot down over Vietnam
and a POW for 8 1/2 years; Arizona Sen. John McCain, held prisoner
5 1/2 years; James Stockdale, Ross Perot's 1992 running mate who
was a Navy commander held prisoner 7 1/2 years; Pete Peterson, held
captive 6 1/2 years and now the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam; Texas
Rep. Sam Johnson, held captive almost 7 years; Robinson Risner,
imprisoned 7 1/2 years; and Tom Madison, held captive 6 years.
Risner and Madison, who retired from the Air Force as a brigadier
general and a colonel, respectively, now live in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyingly, Mock and Sanders resort to strange zooms and
shifting, hallucinogenic focuses when showing the inside of Hanoi's
Hoa Lo Prison, the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton,'' briefly giving
``Return With Honor'' the cheesy look of tabloid television. And
despite the moving testimony from the POWs and their wives _ to
their credit, Mock and Sanders do not forget to pay tribute to the
home front _ ``Return With Honor'' often feels constrained by its
PBS-like box. It's pretty much standard-issue talking-heads stuff;
no one will mistake this for innovative documentary filmmaking. But
it'll do.

NYSE POSTPONES AFTER-HOURS TRADING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After hearing concerns from big investment firms, the
New York Stock Exchange said Thursday it would delay extension of
its trading hours until at least the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes a week after the Nasdaq Stock Market said an
evening trading session could begin as soon as September. It raises
the possibility that, for the first time in history, significant
parts of the nation's leading financial markets will operate on
vastly different schedules.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching separate plans, the Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange are characterizing themselves as serving different
customers: individual investors, who are said to want to trade
after hours in Nasdaq stocks, and big institutions, which dominate
the business of the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, said
Thursday that the board decided it first had to insure that the Big
Board and its members have prepared their computer systems to deal
with the Year 2000 problem and with the conversion of stock prices
to decimals from fractions, a change scheduled for the second
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is consistent with the public interest to
introduce longer trading hours after these events have been
successfully reached,'' Grasso said. ``Whatever the competitive
arguments in favor of extending trading hours, the overriding
interest should be protection of the public interest and the
integrity of the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Grasso said that the exchange would probably
move up its planned introduction of late trading by a year, to this
summer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq market, said that
his group, also with the public in mind, favored coordinating the
start of extended trading hours with the Big Board and with
alternative trading systems. Several of those private
electronic-trading networks intend to offer after-hours trading to
individuals this year.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb said, though, that if the alternative trading systems went
ahead with their plans, Nasdaq would try to extend its hours, with
or without the New York exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission is needed to
change trading hours on either Nasdaq or the New York exchange.
Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman, has said he would probably not
stand in the way. But Levitt has also said that the industry should
get past the start of the year 2000 and through the conversion to
decimals before extending hours.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt's and Zarb's offices had no comment about the New York
exchange's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Some market participants said they would like to see Levitt keep
everyone in lock step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if it's not appropriate to halt everybody at the
starting line until we've had a chance to work through the Y2K and
decimalization issues,'' said Andrew Brooks, head of equity trading
at T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore brokerage and mutual-fund firm. ``I
would expect Nasdaq and the NYSE to talk very carefully through
this and take the same approach to extending hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso drew an analogy to Coca-Cola's disastrous decision in the
1980s to revamp its formula, saying that whenever a late session is
introduced, investors will have to be educated about the difference
between that session and the ``NYSE classic'' normal trading hours.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that the exchange did not want to introduce
an after-hours session, which market research might indicate that
customers want, that would instead fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the conflict between Nasdaq and the New York
exchange pits the new world against the old: a technology-driven
market that exists only in the form of electronic links among
brokerage firms versus the 207-year-old institution, which sits at
the corner of Wall and Broad streets in lower Manhattan and
symbolizes the strength of the U.S. financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso repeatedly invoked that symbolism in announcing the
decision on extended-hours trading, which he said was unanimously
reached by the exchange's 26-member board.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the gilded hall where the exchange's board had met
an hour earlier, surrounded by somber portraits of eight former
exchange presidents, Grasso said that the Big Board had a
responsibility, as the world's largest securities exchange, to
protect the public's trust in the nation's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is the model the world aspires to,'' Grasso said. ``It is
clear that equities will become a global instrument that will one
day be traded in a semicontinuous fashion,'' virtually around the
clock, he said. ``But that has got to be coupled with the one key
ingredient that has defined U.S. equity markets: the public trust
and confidence that our product provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are held to a higher standard'' than the alternative
trading systems, which aim to capture the fancy of new,
technology-driven investors, Grasso added.
</P>
<P>
   At issue again Thursday was whether sufficient demand exists
from investors who want to trade stocks for several hours in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to our customers,'' Grasso said. ``There does not
appear to be a demand, at least in our securities, for extended
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Lon Gorman, who is president of the capital markets and trading
unit of Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the largest online brokerage firm,
said that his company ``definitely does have customer demand for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman is also a member of Nasdaq's committee on the quality of
markets, which proposed after-hours trading on that market. He said
he believed that if the SEC did not stop the alternative trading
systems from proceeding with extended-hours trading, Nasdaq would
likely go ahead as well.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone intending to extend trading hours this year, he said,
would have to reach that decision ``in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the New York exchange comes with some conflicts
of its own. Some of the securities firms represented on the
exchange's board also hold stakes in alternative trading systems
that intend to go ahead with after-hours trading. That raises the
question of whether those firms are looking out more for their own
interests than those of the New York exchange, a not-for-profit
institution.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Deryck C. Maughan, vice chairman of Salmon Smith
Barney, is a director of the New York exchange. Yet on Monday,
Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, said it would invest in
Eclipse Trading Inc., a computerized trading system that plans to
begin offering evening trading to individuals this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said he was not concerned by the potential conflicts.
``These investments are all part of the evolution of the global
markets,'' he said. ``But when our directors come to the table,
they come as fiduciaries of the NYSE, and first and foremost in
their mind is the protection of the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Salomon Smith Barney declined to comment on its
potential conflict. But the firm has said it generally supported
the idea of after-hours trading if investor protections were in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sanderson, chief executive of Eclipse, said the company
would proceed with its late-hours trading plans. He was confident,
he added, that Eclipse would address the liquidity and volatility
concerns cited by Levitt and the chairmen of Nasdaq and the New
York exchange.

   BEIJING _ While emotional memorials to the 1989 Tiananmen
massacre were held in cities from Hong Kong to New York this week,
on the streets of Beijing there was nervous silence.
</P>
<P>
   June 4, 1989, remains China's ultimate skeleton in the closet:
the day troops ended six weeks of pro-democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square with guns and tanks, killing hundreds and injuring
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   There is no public discussion of the incident, except for
occasional government announcements defending the military action
as necessary to combat a ``counter-revolutionary rebellion.''
Editors delete even oblique references in manuscripts. In private,
it is mentioned cautiously, generally only among friends.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of Chinese witnessed the bloody spectacle that
played out on the boulevards of central Beijing on the night of
June 3 and the early morning of June 4.
</P>
<P>
   A factory worker recalls hauling a dying man away on a bicycle
cart; a surgeon remembers two days without sleep, operating on more
than 20 students, workers and soldiers; a young businessman _ then
a high school senior _ tells how he roamed the streets watching
protesters set fire to military vehicles and soldiers shoot into
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   However, with public discussion banned, June 4 remains largely
undigested, and many people have yet to form a clear opinion of it.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese who experienced the crackdown often voice
disillusionment with the Communist Party and politics in general.
Others say that to avoid a repeat of such carnage, compromise and
patience are in order, as long as China continues on its path of
economic development and slowly expanding personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Still others say that, despite China's progress in the past
decade, the country will never truly move forward until the painful
events of Tiananmen are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly support to redress June 4,'' said Li
Sunzhi, former president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
whose students took part in the protest. ``You hear it from taxi
drivers, retired generals and even some retired cadres. But the
government strategy is to let it drag out.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps with good reason. ``If June 4 were reappraised,'' Li
said, ``I think many potential liberals could become more
aggressive and it could lead to a real political awakening among
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the government to reverse any time soon its
official verdict any time soon. At least not as long as leaders
like Li Peng remain. Peng, who as prime minister issued the
declaration of martial law on May 20, 1989, is now chairman of
China's Parliament. Still, some prominent citizens speak out,
although within limited circles.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jiang Yanyong, who in 1989 ran Beijing's most prestigious
military hospital, told a meeting of Yanjing University alumnae
last week that for decades he had ``always believed in the Party.''
But on the night of June 3, scores of wounded were carried into his
emergency room and many were dead by morning, including the son of
two army officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest dreams I never imagined that something like this
could happen,'' he said. ``A government should never do such a
thing. That is counter-revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   But many less potent memories have been submerged in the past
decade. Many Chinese have only the vague sense that June 4 was a
terrible tragedy that will someday prove a watershed in modern
Chinese history, although many are reluctant to guess why or how.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a participant and also to some extent a victim of June
4,'' said a 36-year-old former university lecturer who, like many
protesters, was fired and afterward unable to hold another state
job.
</P>
<P>
   Now a small businessman, he struggled to define the legacy.
``June 4 was a national tragedy and a major historical event,'' he
said, ``though we've not reached the point where we can appraise
and understand the event or its consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, with a note of sadness, ``Following the trauma of June
4, many people like me arrived at the conviction that the only path
for China was one of cautious, progressive liberalization _
anything else was unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The taboo regarding June 4 sits uncomfortably in a country whose
opinionated citizens now debate environmental pollution, corruption
and foreign trade. China today is richer, less ideological and more
pluralistic, and it offers many more opportunities to its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, students were assigned jobs at graduation, and only the
privileged got passports. Today, at China's more prestigious
universities, more than half the students in some departments study
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the government has confronted some of the student
protesters' leading complaints, including official privilege and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Young Chinese, in particular, say they are more concerned with
pursuing careers than multiparty democracy, which they see as a
distant prospect. Many now view 1989 protests as naive, and redress
is generally not high on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1989 that kind of event was so new that young people were
responding from the heart,'' said a 28-year-old advertising account
manager who remembered going to the square every day after school
to watch. ``Today, it's true, we're more willing to accept the
realities of life. But we're also able to look at issues in more
independent and mature ways.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, today's college students have only their
childhood recollections. ``The memory is already fading in society
and relatively speaking among intellectuals,'' said one writer.
``In fact, where the memory of June 4 is least faded is among
officialdom. It hangs over them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent voice for a re-evaluation of June 4 is Bao
Tong, a former Central Committee member who was jailed in 1989 for
seven years after he opposed the military crackdown. He remains
under constant surveillance, though authorities have thus far
allowed him to pursue his campaign for a reversal of the official
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that public support for a
reappraisal of 1989 and for major political reform not only exists
but is widespread even under current political conditions,'' said
Bao.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1989, he said, most Politburo members opposed deploying
troops against the protesters but were overruled by Deng Xiaoping,
China's late paramount leader.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartfelt call for remembrance comes from Ding Zilin, a
retired professor who vowed to publicize the government killings
after her son, then a high school senior, was shot on the night of
June 3.
</P>
<P>
   She rues and also understands the general public's silence. ``If
my own son had not been lost in the massacre, I probably would have
been one of the silent majority,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   These lone voices have been joined by a smattering of career
democracy advocates, a number of whom were detained this week for
trying to commemorate Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Events of that day changed my life, until then I was an
ordinary worker,'' said Ma Qiang, 29, who helped carry away the
dead and injured that night. ``Afterward, I felt the need to start
writing and studying things like democracy and law. So for me June
4 is a terrible memory but also a resource.''
</P>
<P>
   But far more numerous are the vast pool of Chinese who have set
aside the memories, knowing that the government is unlikely to
agree to a reassessment any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not very convenient to talk about this topic now,'' said
a nervous young banker, who 10 years ago spent several weeks in
Tiananmen Square. ``The widespread attitude among the participants
is that they hope that June 4 can someday be re-evaluated. But this
is an event officials are still very sensitive about.''
</P>
<P>
   And too much pressure now, some say, could provoke a backlash
that might erase the freedoms Chinese have gained in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that June 4 is an event that should be left to history
to judge,'' said a 34-year-old man who uses the English name Andy.
``There are disagreements here that will be unresolved for 10 or 20
years. And until then we should do what we can do in the present
circumstances and not provoke a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But by then, others say, memories may be so faint that a
reassessment would be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, hundreds of families mourn in a vacuum. Many a
June 4, the families of two slain students, Hao Zhijing and Duan
Changnan, go to a leafy cemetery and wail by the photographs on
their sons' headstones, with little public sympathy to console
them.

<P>
   Top representatives of the West and Russia sat down with Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic Thursday night for talks that probably
offer a last _ but far from guaranteed _ chance of a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic day for Yugoslavia,'' Martti Ahtisaari, the
Finnish President, declared as he arrived in Belgrade Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He and Russian Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin had come ``with
a peace plan and an offer for peace that could end the
two-month-old conflict and allow postwar rebuilding of the region
to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the urgency of their quest was a dramatic report to
the United Nations Security Council last night by U.N. officials,
just back from Kosovo, on the humanitarian catastrophe in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides the most authoritative account yet of the
systematic ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serbs, amid a
``rampage of killing, burning...vendetta and terror.'' Council
delegates were said to have been left in ``profound shock'' by the
details set out before them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the peace mission, NATO granted no letup in its campaign
of air strikes, while its leaders moved to keep the ground-war
option open.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the envoys arrived in Belgrade, allied warplanes
attacked targets in and around the city, adding to the misery of a
population mostly deprived of power, fuel, and sometimes water.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Bill Clinton approved the dispatch of
7,000 U.S. ground troops to join in the enlarged peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton meets his military staff to discuss the future
of the war, including the possibility of an invasion of Kosovo,
William Cohen, the U.S. defense secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty of the task facing the two peace envoys was
apparent from the frantic diplomacy in Bonn that preceded their
arrival, a round-the-clock negotiating marathon that produced
agreement between the West and Russia _ but whose key provisions
were being cast into doubt even before the envoys' plane touched
down in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme essentially calls for acceptance of the plan by
Yugoslavia, including detailed provisions for the withdrawal of
Serbian forces from Kosovo, followed by a resolution of the U.N.
Security Council, that would lead to a suspension of the NATO
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The deal created ``a significant chance of a political
settlement,'' Jacques Chirac, the French president, said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But uncertainty surrounded several key elements of the plan,
above all the precise makeup of the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Muddying matters further was Chernomyrdin's assertion that there
would be separate Russian and NATO contingents under separate
command _ a formula that could lead to the de facto partition of
Kosovo, which the West categorically rules out.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington retorted that Russian participation in the force
was still ``an open question,'' while Strobe Talbott, the deputy
U.S. secretary of state who had spent 24 hours locked in talks with
Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin in Bonn, pointedly refused to answer
questions on the subject. ``We are all against partition,'' was all
he would say.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, all sides declared that enough progress had been
achieved in Bonn to justify a joint mission that could well be the
last chance to avert further escalation of the air strikes and,
possibly, a ground invasion of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The ball, they insisted to a man, was now in Milosevic's court. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 575. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO 900) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   But even if the fragile common front between Russia and the West
holds, there seemed small chance of an early agreement by
Milosevic, a master of procrastination and exploiting divisions
among his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the gap between Belgrade and the international
community looked almost as wide as ever. While the allies demand a
total withdrawal of all Serb forces, to be replaced by a force
under the technical aegis of the U.N., but dominated by heavily
armed NATO troops under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seems ready to accept at best a force without soldiers
from countries which have taken part in the bombing, and is seeking
to keep many thousand Serb troops in Kosovo after a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking during a visit to Macedonia Thursday, General Wesley
Clark, NATO's supreme commander, claimed that the Yugoslav army had
suffered ``great losses'' in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be obvious to him he cannot prevail,'' said General
Clark, in Skopje to discuss NATO's plans to increase the number of
ground troops in Macedonia from 16,000 to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks seemed tacit confirmation of a new trend emerging in
the war, whereby Kosovo Liberation Army guerillas are infiltrating
back into the province to engage Serb units _ thus forcing them out
of cover where they become easier targets for NATO aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But General Clark's claim was contradicted by General Nebojsa
Pavkovic, commander of the Kosovo-based Yugoslav Third Army, who
told a local newspaper that his 180,000-strong force had suffered
what he called ``minimal casualties'' of about 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how long the Belgrade talks would last, but
Chernomyrdin indicated they would only be a beginning, at which he
and Ahtisaari would set out the proposals to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish President was expected to fly back to Cologne Friday
to report to the EU summit on Belgrade's reaction to the plan. &QL;

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass., _ For the first time since soldiers drove them
at gunpoint from Beijing's Tiananmen Square 10 years ago, the top
leaders of China's democracy movement gathered at Harvard
University Thursday, like alumni converging for a reunion on the
leafy New England campus.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of the men and women the Chinese Communists had
denounced as instigators of a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion''
was itself significant, the leaders said, since some of them spent
years in prison and others have squabbled among themselves over
what went wrong and what they can do from exile to change China's
government.
</P>
<P>
   The former leaders, most of whom were university students at the
time, offered no new plan for political reform in China, but they
acknowledged mistakes they had made with unusual candor and
insisted that the movement they began has already changed China for
the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiananmen did not fail,'' said Li Lu, who was a physics
student at Nanjing University and a leader of the Tiananmen
demonstrators before the Communist leadership called in the troops
on the night of June 3-4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communists killed the messenger but had to take part of
the message,'' said Li, who is now managing partner of Himalaya
Capital Partners, a hedge fund in New York. ``The democracy
movement marked the end of the idea that one party dictatorship can
bring good to China, and so now the Communists are tolerating
things like village elections that they would never have accepted
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who attended the conference were Wang Dan, who
organized the student discussion groups at Beijing University in
the months before the spring 1989 protests; Wang Juntao, who ran an
independent think tank in Beijing that backed the students; and
Wu'er Kaixi, a student at Beijing Normal University who gained
prominence by daring to challenge Prime Minister Li Peng during a
nationally televised meeting. Both Wang Dan and Wang Juntao were
arrested after the crackdown and sent to prison. Wu'er escaped and
now works as a radio talk-show host in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by Wei Jingsheng, perhaps China's best-known
dissident and the author of the most daring wall posters calling
for democracy during the short-lived Democracy Wall movement in
1979. For his temerity, Wei spent 18 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Wu'er said, ``I'm optimistic, even in exile.'' The
Communists think they have made a ``deal'' with the Chinese people,
giving them economic development instead of political freedom, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Chinese government doesn't understand,'' he said,
``is that the people become greedy when they start to make money,
and when the government thinks it is satisfying them by giving them
economic freedom, the people will inevitably want more freedom to
protect their ability to make money, until this leads to
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston
University and an expert on Chinese dissidents, said the
participants at the conference now have ``a much better
understanding of what democracy means and what it takes to bring
about political change. The tragedy is, they can't use this
knowledge now from abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group that is remarkably talented and intelligent
and cares about China,'' she said, pointing to the success of most
of the leaders since they were exiled. In addition to Li, who has
degrees from Columbia's law and business schools, she said, Wang
Dan is a graduate student in history at Harvard, Wang Juntao is
studying for his Ph.D. in political science at Columbia, and Chai
Ling, the best-known female student leader, runs her own Internet
company in Cambridge, having earned a degree from the Harvard
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Wu'er pointed out, many of these highly
intelligent activists got their inspiration from Mao Zedong, when
he launched the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s. ``We spent
our first 10 years in the Cultural Revolution, and we came to
believe that if all the people in the world united, we could create
utopia,'' Wu'er said. ``It was very idealistic and appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience also led these young Chinese to question
authority, as Mao preached that the youthful Red Guards should
track down and attack corrupt party officials, Wu'er said. Then,
when Mao died in 1976 and Deng Xiaoping replaced him as China's
paramount leader, Wu'er continued, he ``left us confused'' by
denouncing the Cultural Revolution and preaching that to ``get rich
is glorious.'' This created a ``vacuum in ideology'' that prompted
some students to begin studying democracy on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also criticism Thursday of the students' tactics.
Chen Jun, a former Red Guard turned welder who published a magazine
during the Democracy Wall movement in 1979, said the student
protesters had a ``dream without a plan or leadership'' and led a
``romantic-tragic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The students in 1989, Chen said, were too elitist and mired in
China's imperial tradition of petitioning the government for change
rather than striking out on their own, and too afraid of the
government's reaction if they allied themselves with dissatisfied
factory workers who could have brought them greater numbers and
power.
</P>
<P>
   Li said the group, now formally organized as the Tiananmen
Generation Association, plans to meet again next year, in Taiwan,
to observe the presidential election there.

President Slobodan Milosevic Thursday night for talks that probably
offer a last _ but far from guaranteed _ chance of a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic day for Yugoslavia,'' Martti Ahtisaari, the
Finnish President, declared as he arrived in Belgrade Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He and Russian Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin had come ``with
a peace plan and an offer for peace that could end the
two-month-old conflict and allow postwar rebuilding of the region
to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the urgency of their quest was a dramatic report to
the United Nations Security Council last night by U.N. officials,
just back from Kosovo, on the humanitarian catastrophe in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides the most authoritative account yet of the
systematic ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serbs, amid a
``rampage of killing, burning...vendetta and terror.'' Council
delegates were said to have been left in ``profound shock'' by the
details set out before them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the peace mission, NATO granted no letup in its campaign
of air strikes, while its leaders moved to keep the ground-war
option open.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the envoys arrived in Belgrade, allied warplanes
attacked targets in and around the city, adding to the misery of a
population mostly deprived of power, fuel, and sometimes water.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Bill Clinton approved the dispatch of
7,000 U.S. ground troops to join in the enlarged peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton meets his military staff to discuss the future
of the war, including the possibility of an invasion of Kosovo,
William Cohen, the U.S. defense secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty of the task facing the two peace envoys was
apparent from the frantic diplomacy in Bonn that preceded their
arrival, a round-the-clock negotiating marathon that produced
agreement between the West and Russia _ but whose key provisions
were being cast into doubt even before the envoys' plane touched
down in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme essentially calls for acceptance of the plan by
Yugoslavia, including detailed provisions for the withdrawal of
Serbian forces from Kosovo, followed by a resolution of the U.N.
Security Council, that would lead to a suspension of the NATO
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The deal created ``a significant chance of a political
settlement,'' Jacques Chirac, the French president, said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But uncertainty surrounded several key elements of the plan,
above all the precise makeup of the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Muddying matters further was Chernomyrdin's assertion that there
would be separate Russian and NATO contingents under separate
command _ a formula that could lead to the de facto partition of
Kosovo, which the West categorically rules out.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington retorted that Russian participation in the force
was still ``an open question,'' while Strobe Talbott, the deputy
U.S. secretary of state who had spent 24 hours locked in talks with
Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin in Bonn, pointedly refused to answer
questions on the subject. ``We are all against partition,'' was all
he would say.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, all sides declared that enough progress had been
achieved in Bonn to justify a joint mission that could well be the
last chance to avert further escalation of the air strikes and,
possibly, a ground invasion of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The ball, they insisted to a man, was now in Milosevic's court. &QL;

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 575. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO 900) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   But even if the fragile common front between Russia and the West
holds, there seemed small chance of an early agreement by
Milosevic, a master of procrastination and exploiting divisions
among his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the gap between Belgrade and the international
community looked almost as wide as ever. While the allies demand a
total withdrawal of all Serb forces, to be replaced by a force
under the technical aegis of the U.N., but dominated by heavily
armed NATO troops under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seems ready to accept at best a force without soldiers
from countries which have taken part in the bombing, and is seeking
to keep many thousand Serb troops in Kosovo after a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking during a visit to Macedonia Thursday, General Wesley
Clark, NATO's supreme commander, claimed that the Yugoslav army had
suffered ``great losses'' in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be obvious to him he cannot prevail,'' said General
Clark, in Skopje to discuss NATO's plans to increase the number of
ground troops in Macedonia from 16,000 to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks seemed tacit confirmation of a new trend emerging in
the war, whereby Kosovo Liberation Army guerillas are infiltrating
back into the province to engage Serb units _ thus forcing them out
of cover where they become easier targets for NATO aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But General Clark's claim was contradicted by General Nebojsa
Pavkovic, commander of the Kosovo-based Yugoslav Third Army, who
told a local newspaper that his 180,000-strong force had suffered
what he called ``minimal casualties'' of about 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how long the Belgrade talks would last, but
Chernomyrdin indicated they would only be a beginning, at which he
and Ahtisaari would set out the proposals to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish President was expected to fly back to Cologne Friday
to report to the EU summit on Belgrade's reaction to the plan. &QL;

U.S. AND CANADA AGREE TO SET SALMON QUOTAS ALONG PACIFIC COAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seeking to end a long-festering international dispute
that has imperiled salmon stocks and once provoked an angry
blockade by Canadian fishermen of Alaska-bound ferries, the United
States and Canada on Thursday announced a comprehensive plan to set
quotas on salmon catches along thousands of miles of the Pacific
coast and establish a conservation fund to help protect the fish.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to agree on such limits after the last salmon
treaty expired seven years ago, the two countries have engaged in
often heated disagreements over who was responsible for dwindling
runs of the region's signature fish. The salmon are, of course,
oblivious to international boundaries, spawning in the rivers of
one nation and migrating to the seas of the other, and forging any
kind of binational pact to protect them had proven a remarkably
contentious proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sought to impose various limits, angering the other.
At one point, Canada seized several American fishing boats, and the
province of British Columbia once threatened to block the U.S. Navy
from access to a submarine test station in Canada. In the summer of
1997, embittered Canadian fishermen who blamed Alaskans for taking
too many fish formed a 180-boat flotilla around an Alaskan ferry
for three days near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with both nations having taken serious steps in recent
years to declare their salmon species threatened, and with the
leaders of both countries agreeing that a new pact was needed,
negotiators said on Thursday they had hammered out an agreement,
one that will cut catches of some particular salmon runs by up to
40 percent. Among the negotiators, who spoke at briefings here and
in Vancouver, was Lloyd Cutler, a former White House counsel, who
was appointed recently by President Clinton to head the American
bargaining team.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the fund money will be used to buy up fishing
licenses, essentially paying fishermen not to fish. But more
broadly, through a complex patchwork of guidelines covering dozens
of different rivers and salmon populations over the next dozen
years, the pact will for the first time set yearly harvest levels
based on scientific measurements of the salmon stocks. This
``abundance-based'' system will replace pre-set limits that both
countries had tried to impose in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement covers coastal areas and rivers in Oregon,
Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Some elements will need
legislative approval in both countries, including authorization of
the conservation funds, but there are few signs that the process
will be contentious.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the agreement will not necessarily revive the nine
different salmon runs declared threatened or endangered earlier
this year under this country's Endangered Species Act. But it will
be a major element of an overall plan to restore the salmon
populations, which in many cases are at only a fraction of their
peak populations earlier this century.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years ago, a visiting biologist from the Smithsonian
Institution, Richard Rathbun, found the fish to be so prevalent in
the Northwest that he wrote, ``The quantities of salmon which
frequent these waters is beyond calculation, and seems to be so
great as to challenge human ingenuity to affect it in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   But development, logging, irrigation for farming, dam-building,
overfishing and countless other human activities have combined
since then to hammer the salmon population.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat, hailed Thursday's
announcement as a landmark in which both countries had agreed to
switch from a ``first-come'' fishing policy to a ``fish-first
conservation approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the salmon eaten in this country is raised in domestic
pens, and the availability and price of that fish is unlikely to be
affected by Thursday's agreement. But those who fancy the
higher-priced wild fish could well find that its price rises,
especially in years in which low measurements require significant
cutbacks in the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   As one example in the network of new rules, the ceiling on
catches of Chinook salmon from southeast Alaska, now set at about
263,000 yearly, would be lowered to about 150,000 in years of what
is defined as ``normal abundance,'' said Jeff Curtis, Western
conservation director for Trout Unlimited, a group that has been
lobbying strongly for a new treaty to protect salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   But that number could fall to as low as about 60,000 or could be
set even higher than current limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue is incredibly complex,'' Curtis said. ``But
what we have here is a pretty reasonable and innovative
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Other steps will clearly be needed to revive the salmon, and the
listing under the endangered-species act has prompted local
governments in the growing Seattle-Tacoma and Portland areas to
outline possible measures, from raising water rates and curbing
fertilizer and pesticide use to curbing new development. And
another debate looms over once-unthinkable proposals to remove some
dams in the West, which interfere with the salmon's ability to
return to their spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $150 million in the conservation fund, most of it
paid by the United States, will be used to buy licenses and to
undertake restoration efforts in rivers whose spawning areas have
been damaged.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a bid to give a political lift to Vice President Al Gore, the
White House had him issue an official statement about the treaty,
which is likely to help Gore's presidential campaign in the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agreement today with the government of Canada on Pacific
salmon is welcome news for the environment and for the economy in
both our countries,'' Gore said. ``Salmon are part of the very
fabric of the Pacific Northwest, and President Clinton and I are
absolutely committed to insuring that they not only survive but
thrive once again.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy praised the agreement
in an announcement to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does demonstrate that when two sides work together for a
mutual benefit, in this case the conservation of the fishing stock,
you can come up with a good deal,'' he said.

   KUKES, ALBANIA _ They were still far too traumatized to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   As the word spread slowly that their homeland may soon be at
peace, the Kosovo refugees living in tents, on the back of tractor
trailers or in the humble homes of Albanians here reacted quietly
and skeptically.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would go back if NATO or United Nations troops
guaranteed their safety but not if Serb troops, police or
paramilitary forces remained. Many said they would go back only if
every Serb, including civilians, left Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And they were under no illusions as to what they expect to find:
a Dante's inferno of torched homes, slaughtered or missing
relatives, possessions destroyed or stolen, livestock killed, a
country without infrastructure where they will need massive world
aid to rebuild from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we are going back to the Sahara. It will make Saddam
Hussein's looting of Kuwait look like child's play,'' said Ibrahim
B., a 30-year-old student and refugee from the Kosovo capital,
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question of whether Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic will keep his word, not something he is noted
for and not something the Kosovo refugees expect him to do this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) said the same,
saying they doubted whether the Yugoslav president would pull his
men out and that they would not lay down their arms in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there's one Serb policeman left in Kosovo, we won't
put down our guns,'' said Kadri Kryeziu, the KLA spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
   KLA fighters in Swiss Army uniforms, downing Italian beer in a
Kukes bar, showed little interest in the peace deal when informed
by journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had guns. We always will have guns,'' said one.
``After what they've been through, no Kosovar is going to go back
without a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the peace agreement was being reached, the rape of
Kosovo continued, according to refugees crossing the border
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After slitting Kosovars' throats and torching their homes, they
said, the Serb forces were now trying to starve remaining ethnic
Albanians to death or into exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of food is the reason given by more and more refugees
for leaving,'' Rupert Colville, spokesman for the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), said. ``One new arrival asked
us, `When are you going to bring food to Kosovo?' We said, `Very
soon.' He said, `Very soon may be too late.'''
</P>
<P>
   Artan R., a refugee who crossed into Albania Thursday on a
tractor trailer packed with family members from the Kosovo town of
Prizren, said: ``The men are all in the hills, hiding or fighting
with the KLA. There is real starvation over there. We could not
even get bread.''
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR is faced with the dilemma of whether to continue its
relocation of refugees away from the highland border and down to
the lowlands of southwest Albania. Refugees are likely to refuse to
budge unless winter forces them to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs burned many homes but kept the best houses and cars
for their own people, especially the paramilitaries,'' said Arsim
B, from Prizren. ``I'll go back but I won't live with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are roadblocks everywhere by police or paramilitaries.
They took our passports, identity documents, house papers, drivers'
licenses, car papers. At the border, they took our license plates.
We hear they're handing them out to Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go back, how are we going to prove we even exist?
</P>
<P>
   ``At every roadblock on the way to the border, they demanded our
money. Some of us had stuffed our German mark savings into our
shoes, our socks, behind our tractor wheels, everywhere. Our women
kept some in their underwear. Eventually we were stopped by a
paramilitary in a black mask who pointed his gun at my youngest
daughter. `Your money or your children,' he said. We had to hand it
all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more NATO bombed,'' he continued, ``the more aggressive
they would get. While they were bombing, the paramilitaries kicked
us in the behind, even the women, along the road, telling us, `It's
your fault they're bombing us. Go to Clinton, go to Blair and don't
come back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, from Mitrovica, said Thursday he and other men
had been forced to work in a labor camp, building bunkers for Serb
forces against NATO bombing or a NATO ground invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked 18 hours a day and were forced to live, 50 of us, in
a byre with the cows, using the same place as a toilet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going back to? Hell. Mitrovica has been 80 percent
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing of the Albanian side of the border on Tuesday has
turned an area within about a mile of the border into a no-man's
land. Refugees have to walk through that zone alone to UNHCR buses
several miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our operation up there is pretty much in tatters,'' a UNHCR
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian border village of Morini, hit by NATO on Tuesday,
has been evacuated. Women and children have also left the next
village, Bardhoc, about three miles inside Albania on the road to
Kukes. &QL;

<P>
   The sudden appearance of two low-flying fighter planes over the
Albanian side on Wednesday terrified residents and the Albanian
army alike. Albanian officers believed the planes were Serb MiGs,
showing their defiance of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   They flew from the direction of Kosovo at a few hundred feet,
far lower than we had seen any NATO planes, but we could not tell
their type or nationality.
</P>
<P>
   We were driving on an otherwise-deserted stretch of road at
least five miles from the border but close to an Albanian tank
position when they screamed directly overhead, turned tightly and
roared back towards us. We ran from the car and watched from a
field as the pilots both did a cheeky 360-degree roll and headed
back towards Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they were defiant Serbs or cocky NATO pilots was
impossible to tell. The planes had come and gone before anyone
could capture them on film. &QL;

CLINTON RENEWS CHINA TRADE STATUS AMID ROCKY RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday renewed normal trade
relations with China, setting off an annual congressional debate
complicated this year by allegations that China has stolen U.S.
nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers expect Congress to muster enough votes to overturn
Clinton's action, but the debate is expected to be heated. And
hopes are fading that Clinton can win congressional approval for
Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization before the next
round of international trade talks in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   As one indication of the trouble now facing U.S.-China
relations, Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., who has supported normal
trade relations with China throughout his four years in Congress,
said Thursday he is now ``undecided and gravely concerned.'' The
other 10 members of the state's congressional delegation, although
expressing a variety of concerns about China's behavior, continue
to support normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted Thursday that maintaining normal trade
relations with China is in U.S. interests because of a rapid
increase in U.S. exports to China. But in a statement issued just a
day before Friday's 10th anniversary of the Chinese massacre of
protesters at Tiananmen Square, Clinton acknowledged widespread
concerns about China's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursue engagement with our eyes wide open, without
illusions,'' he said. ``We continue to speak frankly about our
differences and to firmly protect our national interests. A policy
of disengagement and confrontation would only strengthen those in
China who oppose greater openness and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, U.S.-China relations seemed to be on an
upswing. China offered to lift a 27-year ban on the importation of
Northwest wheat as part of a broad package of trade concessions,
and the two countries appeared to be on track to negotiate China's
accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 7, NATO forces accidently bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, killing three people. That was followed by several
days of anti-Western demonstrations in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a House committee headed by Reps. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., and Norm Dicks, D-Wash., reported that China had
succeeded in stealing design information about all seven nuclear
warheads currently deployed on American missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had lousy counterintelligence at our national
labs is something we should be embarrassed about, but we should not
change our basic relationship with China,'' Dicks said. ``We're
cleaning up our mess, but I don't think we should create another
one by trying to go to a Cold War setting with China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly anybody would say that this is a very difficult time
to pass legislation giving normal trade relations to China,'' said
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. ``I think it will pass ... but what I'm
worried about is that there will be so much Red Scare-ing ... that
we will lose sight of the larger goal, which is to involve the
Chinese in the community of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's Republican members of Congress are more
inclined to blame Clinton than China for the spying episode, and,
with the exception of Metcalf, they do not believe the spying
debate should be tied to trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be surprised that there are people spying on
us,'' said Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash. ``Our surprise should be when
we discover that we don't act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   China is the fourth largest trading partner of the United
States, which last year exported $14.3 billion of goods to China
and imported $71.2 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington state, where two-way trade with China ranks third
largest among Asia-Pacific nations at nearly $10 billion in 1997,
there are a variety of economic issues at stake. Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., said he supports normal trade relations with
China because of the importance of winning better access to Chinese
markets for eastern Washington agricultural products. Rep. Jay
Inslee, D-Wash., said normal relations would allow a tougher
crackdown on software piracy in China that would help companies
like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the state's largest employer, will be leading the charge
in favor of normal relations through its chairman, Philip Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade with China is a cornerstone of a stable U.S.-China
relationship, and presents Americans with unprecedented
opportunities with the world's most populous country,'' Condit
said. ``Normal trade relations with China not only sustains
hundreds of thousands of export and import-related jobs, but it
also supports U.S. companies operating in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said that ``In the long run, when
individual members of Congress are looking at the 5,000 concessions
China has made, they're going to think of their own districts, and
when they see the benefits for the high-tech community, for the
beef producers, for the wheat farmers, then we will move away from
the current contentious atmosphere and look at reality.''

   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., in the past a skeptical voice on
U.S.-China relations, this year said that he would support
permanent normal trade relations with China based on a series of
concessions agreed to this spring. Gorton is now worried that the
deal with China may have fallen apart, but if Clinton reconstructs
it, Gorton has pledged to help him win permanent normal relations
in the Senate, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The three other members of the state's congressional delegation,
Republican Jennifer Dunn and Democrats Brian Baird and Adam Smith,
support normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has normal trade relations with most
countries. The status, formerly known as most favored nation,
allows countries low tariffs when exporting to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The president must decide each year whether to renew normal
trade relations with countries like China that do not grant their
residents freedom of emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has 60 days to overturn a president's action on trade
relations, but has done so only once, in 1989, shortly after
Tiananmen Square. President Bush vetoed that action, and Congress
failed to override his veto.

   KUKES, ALBANIA _ They were still far too traumatized to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   As the word spread slowly that their homeland may soon be at
peace, the Kosovo refugees living in tents, on the back of tractor
trailers or in the humble homes of Albanians here reacted quietly
and skeptically.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would go back if NATO or United Nations troops
guaranteed their safety but not if Serb troops, police or
paramilitary forces remained. Many said they would go back only if
every Serb, including civilians, left Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And they were under no illusions as to what they expect to find:
a Dante's inferno of torched homes, slaughtered or missing
relatives, possessions destroyed or stolen, livestock killed, a
country without infrastructure where they will need massive world
aid to rebuild from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we are going back to the Sahara. It will make Saddam
Hussein's looting of Kuwait look like child's play,'' said Ibrahim
B., a 30-year-old student and refugee from the Kosovo capital,
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question of whether Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic will keep his word, not something he is noted
for and not something the Kosovo refugees expect him to do this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) said the same,
saying they doubted whether the Yugoslav president would pull his
men out and that they would not lay down their arms in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there's one Serb policeman left in Kosovo, we won't
put down our guns,'' said Kadri Kryeziu, the KLA spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
   KLA fighters in Swiss Army uniforms, downing Italian beer in a
Kukes bar, showed little interest in the peace deal when informed
by journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had guns. We always will have guns,'' said one.
``After what they've been through, no Kosovar is going to go back
without a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the peace agreement was being reached, the rape of
Kosovo continued, according to refugees crossing the border
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After slitting Kosovars' throats and torching their homes, they
said, the Serb forces were now trying to starve remaining ethnic
Albanians to death or into exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of food is the reason given by more and more refugees
for leaving,'' Rupert Colville, spokesman for the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), said. ``One new arrival asked
us, `When are you going to bring food to Kosovo?' We said, `Very
soon.' He said, `Very soon may be too late.'''
</P>
<P>
   Artan R., a refugee who crossed into Albania Thursday on a
tractor trailer packed with family members from the Kosovo town of
Prizren, said: ``The men are all in the hills, hiding or fighting
with the KLA. There is real starvation over there. We could not
even get bread.''
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR is faced with the dilemma of whether to continue its
relocation of refugees away from the highland border and down to
the lowlands of southwest Albania. Refugees are likely to refuse to
budge unless winter forces them to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs burned many homes but kept the best houses and cars
for their own people, especially the paramilitaries,'' said Arsim
B, from Prizren. ``I'll go back but I won't live with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are roadblocks everywhere by police or paramilitaries.
They took our passports, identity documents, house papers, drivers'
licenses, car papers. At the border, they took our license plates.
We hear they're handing them out to Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go back, how are we going to prove we even exist?
</P>
<P>
   ``At every roadblock on the way to the border, they demanded our
money. Some of us had stuffed our German mark savings into our
shoes, our socks, behind our tractor wheels, everywhere. Our women
kept some in their underwear. Eventually we were stopped by a
paramilitary in a black mask who pointed his gun at my youngest
daughter. `Your money or your children,' he said. We had to hand it
all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more NATO bombed,'' he continued, ``the more aggressive
they would get. While they were bombing, the paramilitaries kicked
us in the behind, even the women, along the road, telling us, `It's
your fault they're bombing us. Go to Clinton, go to Blair and don't
come back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, from Mitrovica, said Thursday he and other men
had been forced to work in a labor camp, building bunkers for Serb
forces against NATO bombing or a NATO ground invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked 18 hours a day and were forced to live, 50 of us, in
a byre with the cows, using the same place as a toilet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going back to? Hell. Mitrovica has been 80 percent
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing of the Albanian side of the border on Tuesday has
turned an area within about a mile of the border into a no-man's
land. Refugees have to walk through that zone alone to UNHCR buses
several miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our operation up there is pretty much in tatters,'' a UNHCR
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian border village of Morini, hit by NATO on Tuesday,
has been evacuated. Women and children have also left the next
village, Bardhoc, about three miles inside Albania on the road to
Kukes. &QL;

<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The sudden appearance of two low-flying fighter planes over the
Albanian side on Wednesday terrified residents and the Albanian
army alike. Albanian officers believed the planes were Serb MiGs,
showing their defiance of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   They flew from the direction of Kosovo at a few hundred feet,
far lower than we had seen any NATO planes, but we could not tell
their type or nationality.
</P>
<P>
   We were driving on an otherwise-deserted stretch of road at
least five miles from the border but close to an Albanian tank
position when they screamed directly overhead, turned tightly and
roared back towards us. We ran from the car and watched from a
field as the pilots both did a cheeky 360-degree roll and headed
back towards Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they were defiant Serbs or cocky NATO pilots was
impossible to tell. The planes had come and gone before anyone
could capture them on film. &QL;

CHILDREN'S ISSUES RECEIVED FULL ATTENTION OF TEXAS LEGISLATORS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lawmakers called it the Year of the Child, and
after approving nearly $3 billion in new state spending for
children's health, safety and better schooling, it wasn't just one
more empty promise.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantaged youngsters at risk for abuse, chronic illness,
school failure and crime stand to gain the most from programs to
ensure that they not be left behind any longer.
</P>
<P>
   All public school students, theoretically, will benefit from
across-the-board teacher pay raises and all between grades 3
through 11 will now annually take the Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills test. From preschoolers to college-bound high school
seniors, the education initiatives offer something for nearly
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all came about because of the surplus. We kept the pressure
on throughout the session,'' said Donna Haschke, vice president of
the Texas State Teachers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept saying, `If not now, when?' This year they had the
money and they had to put their money where their mouth was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it was a pretty good session for children's issues,''
said Rep. Patricia Gray, D-Galveston, who chairs the House Public
Health Committee and was a co-sponsor of a children's health
insurance bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   A new law, already signed by Gov. George W. Bush, seeks to
address Texas' embarrassment as the state with one of the largest
populations of uninsured children in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Health Insurance Program will make sure children
of lower-income working parents will get good health insurance,
including dental coverage. If the state succeeds in locating the
children who need the help, the program could insure half a million
of the 1.4 million children in Texas who lack any health coverage.
State health officials believe some of the remaining uninsured
children might qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the tobacco settlement, the state also is going to
spend millions more for expanded immunizations and newborn hearing
screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like they really did do a lot of things for the
children this year. The children are our future, and we felt so
strongly that you have to have healthy children to do well in
school and to have better students,'' said Texas PTA President
Sylvia Ostos.
</P>
<P>
   She also hailed more money for school-based health clinics, new
seat belt requirements for ages 4-15, funding for 300 more Child
Protective Services case workers to prevent child abuse and new
rules that parents be notified about class sizes and uncertified
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Grants for all-day kindergarten and pre-school kindergarten will
give preference to schools in economically disadvantaged areas
while other new programs will offer before- and after-school care
for children considered at risk. Companies that make contributions
to the school-based day care or to child care for their employees
will qualify for new tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   The PTA was joined by teachers in pushing for an end to the
practice of socially promoting children to the next grade level
even when they haven't mastered the grade they are leaving. The
practice, apparently encouraged by parents of failing children and
administrators trying to move them through the system, should be
greatly curtailed under a new policy that identifies weaknesses in
students and seeks to give them the help they need to meet school
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature and Governor Bush deserve credit for raising
academic standards dramatically and for putting necessary resources
into targeted programs for the students who need extra help to meet
those standards,'' said John Cole, president of the 31,000-member
Texas Federation of Teachers. ``The federation has fought long and
hard for an end to social promotion, and now we have a strong state
policy against social promotion, backed up by $170 million to help
those in danger of falling behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators say they are hoping a program offering remedial help
to failing ninth-graders will curb the dropout rate. Yet, it isn't
simply the failing students who drop out of school. Academically
gifted children placed in normal classrooms sometimes get so bored
they quit school as well, Ostos said. For that end of the spectrum,
the Legislature dramatically quintupled funding for advanced
placement courses for college credits from $4 million during the
last two years to $20 million for the next two.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the Legislature is lauded by so many for helping
children succeed, some people are raising concerns about how it
wants to handle kids who make mistakes or are suspected of causing
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers heeded public opinion polls showing overwhelming
support for parental notification when girls aged 17 and
under &UR;  &LR; seek abortions, passing the first major limitation on the
procedure in Texas since the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who had offered a bill of her own on the issue, lamented
that the one that passed could place a girl seeking an abortion in
the uncomfortable position of facing a judge &UR;  &LR; as an alternative to
telling a parent. She had argued for other family members to fill
the role as well, noting that some of the girls might have
irresponsible or abusive parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a perfect world. Not all children live with their
parents. Not all parents are willing to be responsive in a
supportive way. I think we passed a very harsh bill,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, said they believe pregnant teens will be
helped if a parent is informed. If a girl has been abused and turns
to a judge instead, state child protection officials would be
notified by the courts &UR;  &LR; to protect her. Also if a girl has medical
complications from an abortion, a parent could make sure she gets
immediate medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   An initiative creating a criminal street gang intelligence
database to be shared statewide also is stirring the concern of
civil libertarians. They ask what is to keep a juvenile from ending
up on a secret law enforcement list as the result of a personal
vendetta? Will minority children be singled out as most likely to
be in gangs? Will children get tagged as gang members even if they
aren't? Will parents know if their child ends up on the list?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious there are a lot of mistakes. It's not open to the
public; it's not open to inspection. The people who have access to
it are the people who have guns and badges and the power of the
state on their side. So you have the ability for the state to libel
and slander you without having any recourse,'' said Greg Gladden,
president of the American Civil Liberties Union in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Great pains were taken to toughen the criteria that law
enforcement officers must use in labeling anyone as a gang member
on a list, insisted Janna Burleson, an aide to the bill's sponsor,
Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas. Authorities could not place a person on
the list on the basis of dress alone, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed to safeguards, allowing for reviews and appeals
if someone discovers his name has been erroneously listed. Parents,
however, would not have the right to see if their child's name is
in the database.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a right to vote and they don't have anything
to say about what people in government do to them,'' Gladden said
of younger teens. ``It alienates them before they ever get a chance
to be part of the system. It's counterproductive and it's going to
drive people into antisocial behavior.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS AND WASHINGTON _ Slobodan Milosevic came to power on a
pledge to keep Kosovo inside Serbia. Thursday he appeared to sign
it away as his parliament voted to accept the G8 proposals to end
the conflict with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs put a hopeful gloss on the document brought to
Belgrade by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin, stressing it ``confirms the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   But their bold rhetoric masked what amounts to a surrender to
NATO's key demands.
</P>
<P>
   The deal demands the total withdrawal of Serbian forces from
Kosovo within seven days and the deployment of a NATO-led peace
force. It is a bitter pill for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair heard the news while attending
an EU summit in Cologne. After their working lunch was interrupted
by news of the breakthrough, the 15 heads of government
spontaneously raised their glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good news that the demands made at the outset of this
campaign have been accepted,'' the prime minister said. ``The
justice of our cause was very clear to me from the outset.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair insisted ``no deal'' was made with Belgrade. ``Mr.
Milosevic thought that allied unity would crack, that we wouldn't
have the resolve to see it through. We have shown that we are
unified...that we did have the resolve to see it through.''
</P>
<P>
   The EU summit agreed to call for an urgent resolution to be
adopted by the United Nations Security Council, authorizing the
creation of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo and a provisional
international civil administration.
</P>
<P>
   The EU leaders said in a statement: ``There is now a real
possibility of achieving a political settlement, the first stage of
which is an undertaking to proceed with the verifiable withdrawal
of all Yugoslav forces from Kosovo. This would enable NATO
operations to be suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cologne summit ceremonially congratulated Ahtisaari and
Chernomyrdin for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was cautious, however. ``This is not a time for
popping champagne corks,'' said State Department spokesman James
Rubin. ``What we are going to be looking for is implementation,
implementation and implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Serbian parliament voted 136-74 in favor of the peace
plan, Milosevic's former nationalist allies stormed out of the
government, lambasting what they saw as capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's deputy premier, Vojislav Seselj, said: ``We shall not
sit in the government and await the arrival of NATO troops into
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The all too public outrage of Serbian nationalists suggests
trouble lies ahead for Milosevic. Much as he tries to sell the
package as a victory that has staved off a NATO invasion, he will
inevitably be accused of betraying the cradle of Serbdom, as Serbs
call Kosovo, to foreign powers and hated Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   As well as a total Serbian withdrawal, the deal demands the
return of all 800,000 Albanian refugees and free and unhindered
access to Kosovo for international aid bodies.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N.-appointed administration is to take over Kosovo's
government. Belgrade will be allowed to retain ``hundreds'' of
officials in Kosovo, but they, too, will be subject to U.N.
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have seven days to withdraw their forces and only then
will the 72-day air campaign be formally ended.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the alliance would not
halt the air campaign until there was a ``verifiable withdrawal``
of Serbian forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors cracked Serbia's initially stout resistance. There
was war weariness among the Serbs, fuelled by the justifiable
suspicion that soldiers were being asked to die for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's failure to drive a wedge between NATO hawks and doves
meanwhile exposed Serbia to the threat of continually intensifying
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   What finally forced Serbia and Milosevic to cave in was the
shift by its Russian ally in favor of NATO's terms for ending the
conflict. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ On the 72nd day of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday accepted an
international peace plan to end the Kosovo conflict and allow
nearly 1 million ethnic Albanian refugees to return to what is left
of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   After forcing most of those refugees to flee from Kosovo and
enduring thousands of Serbian military and civilian deaths,
Milosevic and the Serbian parliament agreed rapidly to all key NATO
demands after emissaries from Russia and Europe bought what they
made clear was the best offer he was going to get from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In a swift retreat that may spell political trouble for him,
Milosevic agreed to withdraw all Yugoslav military and police
forces from Kosovo within seven days and allow 50,000 foreign
troops under a U.N. flag _ many of them from NATO and under NATO
command _ to police the province.
</P>
<P>
   That withdrawal could begin as early as Sunday, said Goran
Matic, a minister in the Yugoslav government, once military leaders
of both sides agreed on the details for the handover. What is
important for Belgrade is that the Kosovo Liberation Army not be
allowed to fill the vacuum and flood into Kosovo, he said, and that
NATO keep its commitment to ``demilitarize'' the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO has emphasized the need for a strong force to prevent
the Yugoslav president from reneging on his commitments, Yugoslav
officials and some Western diplomats here believe its real
difficulties will come from the KLA, which it has tried to use as a
proxy army and is unlikely to give up its ambitions for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public reactions in the West, which appeared to be taken
by surprise by the sudden fact of its victory, were cautious, and
it was not immediately clear when or even through what means the
conflict will be brought to a conclusion. Western spokesmen said
the Serbs must begin a ``credible and verifiable withdrawal'' from
Kosovo before the bombs would stop, but NATO's bombing campaign
slackened noticeably Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The peace proposals were negotiated between NATO and Russia,
acting for Belgrade. Once the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
finally agreed on the basics of the deal with the U.S. deputy
secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, Milosevic clearly felt he had
no choice but to accept them or endure further destruction his
forces could not prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposals, fewer than 1,000 Serbian personnel will be
allowed to re-enter Kosovo, to guard key border posts and Serbian
holy sites, as a symbol of Serbian and Yugoslav sovereignty over
the southern province. But there will be little substance left to
Belgrade's assertion of sovereignty. Kosovo will get ``substantial
autonomy'' within Yugoslavia, but for all intents and purposes,
will have little to do with the Serb or Yugoslav state.
</P>
<P>
   An interim international authority will supervise the running of
Kosovo and the establishment of new democratic institutions and
elections, the return of all refugees and the rebuilding of the
province. In the meantime, there will be new negotiations between
Serbian and ethnic Albanian leaders to work out a long-term
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in what Belgrade pointed to as a victory, the proposals
accepted Thursday do not include a new examination of Kosovo's
sovereignty after three years or any referendum on that topic, as
did the draft proposals accepted in March by the Albanian side only
in Rambouillet, France. It was the Serbian refusal to accept those
accords that led to the opening of the NATO air campaign on March
24, the sharp acceleration in the Serbian effort to push the
Albanians out of Kosovo and the tidal wave of refugees into
surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials also said that their resistance had forced
NATO to find a solution within the United Nations and with the
participation of the Russians. And they emphasized the firm
international guarantees of Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo,
unlike the temporary sovereignty proposed under Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But there was also important nationalist criticism of Milosevic
and this deal. The Radical Party and its leader, Deputy Prime
Minister Vojislav Seselj, voted against the proposals in
parliament, and Seselj vowed to quit the government the day NATO
troops enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The former president of Yugoslavia, the nationalist historian
Dobrica Cosic, called the vote ``an extorted decision,'' and the
proposals ``a post-modernist packaging for the occupation of
Kosovo.'' In an interview, Cosic, whose views on Kosovo carry much
weight here, called the parliament's acceptance ``a matter of
survival, and not a matter of freedom and rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no immediate political threat to Milosevic. The
weak democratic opposition parties supported the move toward peace,
and Vuk Draskovic, who was fired as Yugoslav deputy prime minister
during the war, praised the vote and said he would be willing to
rejoin the government, especially if Seselj quits.
</P>
<P>
   Some confusion remains over who will lead the international
force and over its exact makeup. The Russians are still insisting
that their forces going to Kosovo will not be under NATO command,
and have not yet agreed to send troops. The agreement accepted by
Milosevic says the forces will be under the auspices of the United
Nations, but European and American officials say the troops will in
fact be commanded by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it immediately clear when a military-to-military text
would be negotiated, or when the agreement would be codified into a
U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the deal may finally bring some peace, if not
reconciliation, to Kosovo. A year ago, the province contained some
2.2 million people, about 90 percent of them ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kosovo is eerily depopulated, with nearly 1 million
Albanians now living abroad as refugees and with several hundred
thousand more displaced from their homes. As many as 5,000 ethnic
Albanians, NATO has alleged, have been murdered by the Serbs.
Thousands of Serb women and children have also fled the province,
and it is likely that many Serbs will not want to remain in Kosovo
once their army and police have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With many thousands of ethnic Albanians shops and homes burned
and looted, and basic services like transport, roads, bridges,
electricity and water supplies destroyed or heavily damaged by the
air war, the job of reconstructing Kosovo will also be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   And it is likely that foreign troops and aid workers will occupy
the province for many years, at a cost of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following talks Thursday morning between Milosevic and the
diplomatic team of Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, who represented the European Union but articulated
NATO's views, the state news agency Tanjug said simply:
``Yugoslavia accepts the document for peace brought by the highest
representatives of the European Union and Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued: ``The three sides unanimously agreed
that commitment to peace was of vital importance, not only for
Yugoslavia, but for the whole region and all of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday morning, the Serbian parliament had accepted
the proposals after party leaders had been briefed by Milosevic the
night before. The parliament voted 136 for and 74 against, with
three abstentions and one no vote. Presumably, the 74 against
included most of Seselj's 80 deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Seselj was blunt. ``For sure, we will not stay in the
Serbian government from the moment that troops from aggressor
countries, particularly the USA, enter Kosovo,'' he said. And he
warned that NATO troops ``will not feel safe in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic was ebullient, calling the vote ``a great day for
the Serbian nation and all the citizens of Yugoslavia.'' He said:
``The Serbian parliament today declared peace, and the beginning of
peace must be the beginning of a new policy of radical economic and
democratic reform.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Serbian state television did not mention Seselj's opposition or
quote him at all, but it did give Draskovic time to praise
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There was no statement from Milosevic himself. But the anchorman
recited a long statement from Milosevic's Socialist Party praising
the Serbian nation and the international guarantees of Yugoslavia's
``integrity and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision brings us the cessation of the criminal bombing,
of the killing of the people and it brings us peace,'' the
statement said. ``The role of the United Nations is being affirmed
in accordance with the U.N. charter. Through the unity of the
people and through the heroism of our army and our police, we have
defended the country from a vastly superior enemy who committed
aggression against our country with the goal of annulling our
integrity and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There was also a statement from the Yugoslav United Left Party
of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic. ``We are proud of the heroic
resistance of our people,'' the statement said, ``and in these
circumstances we feel we can accept conditions'' laid down by the
world. ``We are looking for the end of the bombing, and the great
renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many Serbs share that optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Jovan Djordjevic, a 42-year-old postman, spoke for many when he
said: ``If Milosevic wants to accept this plan, he should have done
it before the bombing. How can he explain the dead now? How many
dead are enough for him?''

<P>
   BRUSSELS AND WASHINGTON _ Slobodan Milosevic came to power on a
pledge to keep Kosovo inside Serbia. Thursday he appeared to sign
it away as his parliament voted to accept the G8 proposals to end
the conflict with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs put a hopeful gloss on the document brought to
Belgrade by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin, stressing it ``confirms the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   But their bold rhetoric masked what amounts to a surrender to
NATO's key demands.
</P>
<P>
   The deal demands the total withdrawal of Serbian forces from
Kosovo within seven days and the deployment of a NATO-led peace
force. It is a bitter pill for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair heard the news while attending
an EU summit in Cologne. After their working lunch was interrupted
by news of the breakthrough, the 15 heads of government
spontaneously raised their glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good news that the demands made at the outset of this
campaign have been accepted,'' the prime minister said. ``The
justice of our cause was very clear to me from the outset.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair insisted ``no deal'' was made with Belgrade. ``Mr.
Milosevic thought that allied unity would crack, that we wouldn't
have the resolve to see it through. We have shown that we are
unified...that we did have the resolve to see it through.''
</P>
<P>
   The EU summit agreed to call for an urgent resolution to be
adopted by the United Nations Security Council, authorizing the
creation of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo and a provisional
international civil administration.
</P>
<P>
   The EU leaders said in a statement: ``There is now a real
possibility of achieving a political settlement, the first stage of
which is an undertaking to proceed with the verifiable withdrawal
of all Yugoslav forces from Kosovo. This would enable NATO
operations to be suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cologne summit ceremonially congratulated Ahtisaari and
Chernomyrdin for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was cautious, however. ``This is not a time for
popping champagne corks,'' said State Department spokesman James
Rubin. ``What we are going to be looking for is implementation,
implementation and implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Serbian parliament voted 136-74 in favor of the peace
plan, Milosevic's former nationalist allies stormed out of the
government, lambasting what they saw as capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's deputy premier, Vojislav Seselj, said: ``We shall not
sit in the government and await the arrival of NATO troops into
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The all too public outrage of Serbian nationalists suggests
trouble lies ahead for Milosevic. Much as he tries to sell the
package as a victory that has staved off a NATO invasion, he will
inevitably be accused of betraying the cradle of Serbdom, as Serbs
call Kosovo, to foreign powers and hated Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   As well as a total Serbian withdrawal, the deal demands the
return of all 800,000 Albanian refugees and free and unhindered
access to Kosovo for international aid bodies.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N.-appointed administration is to take over Kosovo's
government. Belgrade will be allowed to retain ``hundreds'' of
officials in Kosovo, but they, too, will be subject to U.N.
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have seven days to withdraw their forces and only then
will the 72-day air campaign be formally ended.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the alliance would not
halt the air campaign until there was a ``verifiable withdrawal``
of Serbian forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors cracked Serbia's initially stout resistance. There
was war weariness among the Serbs, fuelled by the justifiable
suspicion that soldiers were being asked to die for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's failure to drive a wedge between NATO hawks and doves
meanwhile exposed Serbia to the threat of continually intensifying
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   What finally forced Serbia and Milosevic to cave in was the
shift by its Russian ally in favor of NATO's terms for ending the
conflict. &QL;

WEATHER DATA WAS GIVEN TO PILOT IN LITTLE ROCK CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Air controllers gave detailed weather information
to the pilot of American Airlines jet before, and even while, it
crash-landed in high winds and rain in Little Rock, Ark., on
Tuesday, said federal safety officials Thursday. But they did not
say whether that information should have led the pilot to abort the
landing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nine people died and 80 were injured in the fiery crash of the
MD-80 at Little Rock National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Two wind-shear alerts had been issued before the crash, but
officials have yet to determine how major a factor the weather was
in the crash, said George Black, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board, in a briefing in Little Rock on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The flight touched down with plenty of room for a controlled
landing under normal conditions, but slid right and then left
before plowing off the end of the runway at high speed,
investigators said. Black praised the flow of information from the
control tower to the pilot about the wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they provided even more than they'd get at a busier
airport, because it appears they were getting periodic wind
vectors,'' he said of the descriptions of wind direction and speed.
``Actually, they continued to give wind vectors after the aircraft
had already crashed. They didn't know it had crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service tracked a powerful thunderstorm
approaching the runway from the northwest as the plane, Flight
1420, came in from the southwest. But thunderstorms are localized
phenomena and Black took pains to note that the storm was still
outside the airport at the time of the crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the safety board are trying to reconstruct the
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators here and in Arkansas examined evidence from the
plane, including the flight data recorder and cockpit voice
recorder, the Federal Aviation Administration began looking into
the characteristics of the runway. Diane Spitaliere, a spokeswoman,
said that since the late 1980s the agency has required 1,000-foot
overrun areas at the ends of new runways. The runway involved in
the crash does not have one, and the airport had evidently been
given a waiver, but officials were not immediately sure why.
</P>
<P>
   The airport authority, Ms. Spitaliere said, has been planning to
install an ``arrestor bed,'' a long pad of crushable concrete
designed to stop runaway planes, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1420, with 145 people on board, was landing on runway 4
Right, which at 7,200 feet is typical for a runway than handles big
jets, but is 1,073 feet shorter than runway 4 Left.
</P>
<P>
   The two runways have the same equipment for handling instrument
landings, but only the one on the right has big steel light
standards at the end of the runway, which the American Airlines jet
struck after landing and losing control. The jet split open and
burst into flames after that impact.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were not certain which of the two men in the
cockpit was flying the plane, although they said they believe it
was the captain, Richard Buschmann, who was killed in the crash,
with communications being handled by the first officer, Michael
Origel. Origel was hospitalized and investigators hoped to talk to
him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the plane executed its approach is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   In general, pilots approaching runways in bad weather usually
increase their speed, to counter the danger if the wind suddenly
shifts. A headwind that suddenly reduces in speed, or turns into a
tailwind, can cut a plane's speed through the air to the point
where the craft becomes uncontrollable. Increasing the air speed to
compensate for the wind conditions would also make the plane
somewhat harder to stop on a slick runway. Black said that
investigators would measure the traction of the runway where Flight
1420 landed, which is grooved for better water drainage.
</P>
<P>
   When flying in a crosswind, as the airplane was doing, normal
procedure is to approach in a ``crab'' position, with the nose
pointed into the wind, which in this case would have been somewhat
to the left of the plane's course over the ground. If the plane
were pointed straight ahead, the wind would blow it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But to avoid landing sideways, according to pilots, just before
touchdown the crew would align the plane with the runway, dip the
left wing into a slight bank, and move the rudder slightly to the
right, to keep the plane moving straight over the ground. That
would make the left landing gear touch down first.
</P>
<P>
   A swept-wing jet like the one that crashed acts like a weather
vane, its nose seeking to point straight into the wind. The MD-80
is slightly longer than many other planes and shows that tendency
more strongly. A gust just before landing, or just after, could
twist the plane to one side, aviation experts said, although it is
too soon to say that happened in this case. If the plane were not
pointed straight down the runway at the point that the crew engaged
the thrust reversers, that, too, would tend to twist its course.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's crash was the airport's second weather-related crash
in recent years. A 21-seat Gulfstream II jet carrying executives of
Eastman Kodak crashed there in January, 1990, killing all seven
people aboard. The Safety Board attributed the crash to pilot
errors and a faulty weather instrument on the ground.

FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF CRASH HERO GET SAD NEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time James Harrison's friends saw him, he was standing
amid the chaos of a smoke- and flame-filled jet, guiding fellow
passengers to any available exit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash of American Airlines Flight 1420, his parents,
Lewis and Reba Harrison, of Paragould, Ark., and his classmates at
Ouachita Baptist University have prayed that the 21-year-old music
ministry major had escaped the wreckage and wandered off afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, coroner's officials told them that his body had
been found. No further information on his death was available
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Chuck DeVane, pastor of Harrison's church and the
family spokesman, said he was not surprised by Harrison's last act
of heroism and selflessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be very much in keeping with his character,'' said
DeVane, pastor of the Eastside Baptist Church in Paragould. ``He
was very, very devoted to Jesus Christ and a devoted son and
student and friend who apparently gave his life so others could go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison was returning to Little Rock with 18 other members of a
university choral group, the Ouachita Singers, who had spent 10
days performing in Germany and Austria. Harrison sang bass with the
group and played saxophone in the school's jazz and concert bands,
DeVane said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett Baber, a member of the singing group who also helped
passengers escape, said on Thursday that he didn't see Harrison
after the crash. But he said he remembered hearing him guide people
to the exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quite a few rows ahead of me,'' Baber said. ``I heard
him shout out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really godly guy, a real good Christian,'' he said.
``He was really a sweet, nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family members were confused and uncertain about
Harrison's fate after American Airlines issued a list at midday
Wednesday that listed Harrison as a survivor, DeVane said. A later
list from American did not include him.
</P>
<P>
   American spokesman Tim Doke apologized for the confusion
Wednesday, calling it the result of ``honest mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 Harrison divided his time among Paragould, college
classes in Arkadelphia, and Royal, where he had worked three years
as a music minister for First Baptist Church of Royal.
</P>
<P>
   He conducted music for the worship services, led the choir and
organized special services, said the Rev. George Lynch, pastor of
the Royal church. He also helped launch the children's choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good-natured man, easy to get along with,'' Lynch
said. ``And he was always there to help, very caring, very
generous.''
</P>
<P>
   And gone too soon, Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand why the Lord would start somebody off in a
good direction and then call him home, but the Lord works as he
chooses. We have to learn to accept it,'' he said.

WITH DRAFT BEHIND, USC LOOKS AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Thursday morning flight that took the USC
baseball team from Los Angeles to the Bay Area wasn't long enough
for a movie, but if it was, the selection would have been a
natural: ``Major League.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two Trojans _ catcher Eric Munson and pitcher Barry
Zito _ have realistic aspirations of playing in the majors by next
season after going high in Wednesday's Major League Baseball
amateur draft. Six others at least know they have the option
available to them.
</P>
<P>
   And, like the Cleveland Indians in that baseball movie from the
early 1990s, the Trojans got off to a slow start this season,
losing 11 of their first 15 games, and are rallying at the finish.
USC has won eight of its last 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the defending national champions and they're playing
very well,'' Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
</P>
<P>
   USC, which had seven players picked in the first 18 rounds of
the draft and eight taken overall, now focuses on the task at hand:
beating Stanford in a three-game series in an NCAA super regional
this weekend. The Trojans (36-24) are two wins away from making
their second consecutive College World Series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The series begins tonight at 7 at Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
Saturday's game is at 1 p.m. and a third game, if necessary, is
Sunday at 1 p.m. Zito, a junior left-hander who was a first-round
choice (No.9 pick overall) of the Oakland A's on Wednesday, starts
the first game against the Cardinal's Jason Young.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (46-13) is the national No.6 seed. The Cardinal won the
Pac-10 title, finishing two games ahead of second-place USC. The
teams split six games this season, with Stanford winning two of
three at USC and the Trojans winning two of three at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Pepperdine on Sunday to win a first-round regional
at home, USC knows it won't have as much fan support this weekend.
The games last weekend between the Waves and the Trojans drew
record crowds to Dedeaux Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll definitely be outnumbered,'' USC head coach Mike
Gillespie said, remembering a Sunken Diamond-record 8,126 in three
games in April.
</P>
<P>
   Not on the field, though. In addition to Munson, the third
overall pick to Detroit, and Zito, USC features three regulars who
were drafted: senior left fielder Jason Lane (sixth round,
Houston), senior center fielder Brad Ticehurst (10th round, New
York Yankees) and senior second baseman Dominic Correa (18th round,
Yankees).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good news day for us,'' Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   USC pitchers Justin Lehr (eighth round, Oakland) and Steve Smyth
(fourth round, Chicago Cubs) were also drafted. Lehr (7-2) starts
Saturday and Smyth is a long reliever who could pitch twice this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Marquess thinks the pressure of the draft is off the USC
players, especially Munson and Zito, who could be facing each other
in the big leagues in a year. Zito (12-2) was the Pac-10 pitcher of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably relieved and they can settle down,'' he said.

 &HT;    Interleaguecould use change-up

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tom Glavine goes home to Fenway Park. The Yankees and
the Mets rumble for all of New York. The Oakland A's find their way
to Candlestick Point. The Dodgers fight freeway traffic to Edison
International Field and the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every conceivable angle will be played out this weekend
in the first dose of the season's 252 interleague games, and the
public interest in the AL-NL crossover remains undeniable. The
average interleague crowd last year was 8.2 percent bigger than
intraleague average.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Pedro Martinez, who leads the majors with 10 victories,
opposes National League Cy Young winner Glavine, from Billerica,
Mass., in tonight's top pitching showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The fanfare over interleague play has faded a bit, and the
reasons are the same in the clubhouses as they are in the stands.
There are still a whole lot of teams in the other league that fans
and players don't get to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they'd change it so that we would also play the NL
Central and NL East some years,'' Texas first baseman Lee Stevens
said. ``Because now, it's almost like it's just another game
playing the West teams again. I think the thrill of playing a new
team has worn off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Interleague is starting to get boring now,'' Pirates
outfielder Al Martin said. ``I thought it was a great idea when it
started in 1997. The fans got the chance to see some new teams.
Now, it's just five more teams on the schedule that everyone is
used to seeing every year.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way. As originally proposed after
the 1994 strike season, interleague play was supposed to rotate
yearly by division. Commissioner Bud Selig has made noise about
revamping the scheduling, but it is hardly the biggest issue on his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fans like it and it's good for baseball, I don't have a
problem with it,'' Philadelphia manager Terry Francona said. ``If
that's the case, it's up to the manager and the coaches and the
players to make it work.

 &HT;    Using zany style, former Braves coach Williams blossoms with
Boston
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Into the compressed atmosphere that seals New England
and the Boston Red Sox in a fretful vacuum, Jimy Williams stepped
to the microphones Nov. 11, 1996, and said he was prepared to serve
life's next course.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox managers are more scrutinized than almost any other in
the profession, and to Boston's hard-boiled media, this mix was all
wrong. Williams is a quirky man given to delightful double-talk. He
holds a college degree in agribusiness, animal science. His face
suggests that he is perpetually thinking about something else. He
had been holed up in Atlanta's third-base coach's box for six
years, ducking attention. He might read more than any other
manager.
</P>
<P>
   And he can be easily misread. Run out of Toronto in the early
1980s after taking the Blue Jays to consecutive second-place
finishes, a member of the Canadian press wondered, ``How can he
manage a team? He can't even keep track of the m's in his name!''
</P>
<P>
   So as Williams was ushered in as the 41st manager of the Sox
three winters ago, taking his place among the craggy likes of Joe
Cronin, John McNamara and Ralph Houk, the logical Bostonian
baseball question came from the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you see yourself as the answer?''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Williams replied: ``The city wants something back.
And I know what it is. Everybody knows what it is. It's a world
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Something back? The Sox haven't been world champions since 1918.
Something back? This is the answer to new general manager Dan
Duquette's roster sabotage? The answer to this suffering
franchise's lost direction. The answer to Bambino's Curse?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I've got a wife and four kids,'' Williams went on. ``You
want turmoil?''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing the new manager for a simpleton, Boston immediately
began its wait for manager No. 42, straining in the meanwhile to
translate the pretzel logic that came out of Williams' mouth.
Someone termed it ``Jimywocky.'' And they've been laughing ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves greet Williams tonight at Fenway Park, where
the best team in the AL East lives. Williams, runner-up for manager
of the year last season, is getting even more credit this year for
coaxing more from a hodgepodge roster than he should. Coming out of
a 20-8 month, the Sox just completed their best May since 1986,
blending rookies and sublime talents into an unexpected menace.
</P>
<P>
   They recently swept three from the league's front-running team
in Cleveland and are 3-3 thus far against the New York Yankees, who
just last year were toasted widely as the greatest team of all
time. Isn't this all something of a surprise?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that, surprise, or all those other
adjectives, or what do you use? Adverbs? Prepositions?'' Williams
replied. ``I like gerunds. I went to high school with a guy named
Gerand Thornquist. His dad drove a bus for Greyhound. He was almost
the valedictorian. You'd have to be, with a name like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimywocky.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1996 season, the Red Sox have allowed to leave or
dealt away Roger Clemens, Mo Vaughn, Jose Canseco, Aaron Sele and
Jamie Moyer. Duquette, still viewed as a dark presence, compared
with Williams' unpretentiousness, did sign free agent Pedro
Martinez. The club has watched Georgia Tech shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra blossom into a true star.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams still scrambles to get more from less. Three-fifths
of the Class AAA Pawtucket Paws rotation has been shipped up, and
Brian Rose, Juan Pena (now on the disabled list) and John Wasdin
are a combined 10-0. The club skated through closer Tom Gordon's
and starter Bret Saberhagen's stints on the DL. Starter Mark
Portugal just left the team and might retire.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hasn't hesitated to play rookies Trot Nixon
(outfielder) and Brian Daubach (first baseman), who have eight
homers and 27 RBIs. When he saw it necessary to bench second
baseman Jeff Frye in favor of Jose Offerman _ Duquette had pledged
that Offerman would not play second when he signed him to a roundly
criticized $26 million, four-year deal last winter _ Williams made
the change and even Frye understood.
</P>
<P>
   What has emerged is something stronger than its individual
parts. And Boston is lapping it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really looking for a leader, maybe a so-called
leader,'' Williams said earlier. ``This is a baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   And not one without flaws. Although the pitching leads the AL
with a 4.03 ERA, the Red Sox cannot boast the slugging lineup that
thrived for years at Fenway. Their 53 homers are the third-lowest
in the league, and with just 26 stolen bases, they also are the
AL's most inert. Yet they have a momentum that begins in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of the players up there, and they like Jimy,''
said Braves outfielder Otis Nixon, who played for Williams in
Atlanta in the early 1990s and against him last year when Nixon
played for Minnesota. ``They like playing for him. They want him to
do well. And when you have guys like that playing for you and
busting their butt for you, that means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Transformed from the clueless intruder of three years ago,
Williams has become a reluctant celebrity. As if to satisfy the
public's thirst for Jimywocky, he already has uttered these items
this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ Called on league president Gene Budig's carpet after the
brawl-filled game on April 23 with Cleveland, Williams said, ``I
saw the good doctor. I don't know why he was smiling. I don't know
if it's because this is a good day or ... maybe his treasury's
gonna have more eagles in there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ While praising scouts as the ``unsung heroes'' for finding
tomorrow's talent, Williams was asked what scout found him in 1964
when he was playing in the semi-pro Basin League in Sturgis, S.D.
Response: ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Asked if he felt helpless in the early going as the club
struggled at the plate, Williams replied, ``Helpless? Oh, no, I
don't have a chauffeur. I can still drive. I can make it through
two rotaries.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Prompted for suggestions on what should be kept from the old
Fenway and included in the new Fenway, still under design, Williams
said, ``I think I have the best shower in baseball. I'll take that
shower I got and put it in the new park. The rest of it, I'll leave
up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows where this is headed. At the start of the 1998
season, some people projected this team for fifth place. For now,
they play as if they deserve to win every game. Earlier in the
week, when the Sox rallied twice to beat Detroit on late home runs,
Tigers catcher Brad Ausmus said, ``Everything is going Boston's
way. When they need a player to fall on the basepaths, they have a
player fall on the basepaths.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the team has been transformed, then so has Williams, who
has become the answer to Boston's question after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a different town,'' Nixon said. ``They know their
baseball up there, and maybe they were waiting for the big name to
come in and sail the ship. And Jimy's got his own style of doing
things. It's a little different from the normal person. But it
works. And I don't think they're grumbling about anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimywocky: ``The only day you feel good is the first day of
spring training. After that it's all downhill.''

 &HT;    Even Ewing finds that gain can't cover up the pain
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the world of sports, where heroes are expected to
ignore their aches and pains to stay immortal, courage often is
confused with stupidity. That brings us to Patrick Ewing, the
Knicks' center who will spend the rest of the NBA playoffs watching
instead of playing.
</P>
<P>
   Good. Only a cast around Ewing's partially torn Achilles' tendon
could bring a little sanity to this situation.
</P>
<P>
   A team physician diagnosed Ewing's injury between games of the
Knicks' ongoing battle with the Pacers for the Eastern Conference
championship. Otherwise, Ewing would still be out there, hobbling,
stumbling, looking much like a skyscraper ready to crash to Earth
at any second.
</P>
<P>
   It's as bad as it gets, when a guy doesn't know when it's time
to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Namath and Jim Otto are among the many NFL greats
maneuvering these days on artificial knees. They all stayed a
couple of hits too long. Willie McCovey's legs are so feeble from
his 22 years in baseball that he couldn't join other San Francisco
Giants stars of the 1960s during a recent celebration at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes will have a certain amount of pain after their
playing days, and I'm no exception,'' said Willis Reed, 57, who was
Ewing before Ewing. In fact, on May 8, 1970, Reed created a moment
for the ages by dragging his sore leg down the tunnel of Madison
Square Garden to inspire his Knicks to a world championship over
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Was that courage or stupidity? Reed chuckled Thursday over the
phone, before saying, ``I played the next year, and the leg wasn't
a problem. You really do get to the point where the wear and tear
on your body catches up with you, and, like all great players, I'm
sure Patrick knows right now in his career what he can take. What
is he, 40?''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is 36. He just seems like he's older. When his knees
aren't covered with braces or pads, they are packed in ice. In
addition to his knees, he plays with a sore left shoulder, a
throbbing right quadriceps and a strained rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   I saw Ewing's physical woes up close and personal during the
Knicks' demolition of the Hawks in the second round. Once, at the
Garden, Ewing suffered so much that he staggered toward the Knicks'
bench in the middle of a play. His mind told him to leave, but his
heart told him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   That's when somebody has to bring common sense to the situation.
Somebody like the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Knicks' Jeff Van Gundy allowed Ewing to decide
whether to trust his mind or his heart, and you know what warriors
always pick. Ewing played, just as he did Tuesday night after he
felt a rip to his left Achilles' tendon in warmups.
</P>
<P>
   While ignoring the pain, Ewing nearly pushed the game into
overtime with a shot that just missed at the buzzer. Reed said,
``He's like Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Reggie Miller and John
Stockton. They're all motivated to keep playing to get that world
championship ring.''
</P>
<P>
   They're also all motivated by the belief that they are
invincible, and many athletes live such a myth until their bodies
say otherwise. If not sooner, then definitely later.

 &HT;    Likable Lewises have horse sense
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ He wore green to the Belmont draw. She wore gold.
As in their racing colors, the colors borrowed from the University
of Oregon, where a platoon sergeant back from training recruits for
WWII first asked out a girl fresh off her tryouts for the pep
squad. All these years later, Bob and Beverly Lewis even dress as a
team.
</P>
<P>
   Hang in there, because the story gets even gooier.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises are horse racing's favorite grandparents. Thrown
into the public glare with their second Triple Crown candidate in
three years, they have managed to come off as a rare breed _
likable rich folk.
</P>
<P>
   For these past nine years of a 52-year marriage, they have
forged a most profitable partnership. He buys the horses. She names
them.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Charismatic' just came to me in the middle of the night,''
said Bev Lewis, citing the current Kentucky Derby and Preakness
champion that they bring to Saturday's Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the word. I couldn't even spell it,'' Bob Lewis
said. He has since learned that the name means a chance at racing
history. The same chance that his Silver Charm brought here in
1997, finishing three-quarters of a horse short.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to find a chink in the Charismatic story _
underappreciated horse, reborn jockey, trainer heading to the Hall
of Fame with only a Triple Crown missing from his resume _ don't
look to the owners. Bev, 72, and Bob, 75, are riding this wave of
good fortune with smiles permanently affixed.
</P>
<P>
   They're just so darn cute. ``They're always happy,'' said
Charismatic's jockey, Chris Antley. ``They're always
shoulder-length apart. If he turns to the left, she turns to the
left behind him. They're about as true a people as you would ever
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, they don't come off as equine Einsteins. The
sport has played a fundamentally important role in their lives. Bob
Lewis was 10 when his parents took him to the opening weekend at
Santa Anita. The couple honeymooned at Del Mar, and returned there
for their 50th anniversary. But that doesn't mean they invented
horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   There is the free admission that when Charismatic was risked on
a $62,500 claiming race in February, Bob Lewis was hoping someone
would take the nag off his hands. ``I was ready to take the money
and hit the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months later, that same horse attempts to become
the first Triple Crown winner in 21 years. ``You can't even fall
into that kind of luck,'' Bob Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   As horse owners, they have distinguished themselves as being
immensely successful without being overbearing. The ideal owners,
Charismatic trainer D. Wayne Lukas claims. ``They represent you
well,'' Lukas said. ``I've had to write plenty of notes to maitre
d's and valets apologizing for owners. Not them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lewis ``loves this sport so much,'' said Bob Baffert, who
trained Silver Charm for the Lewises and now goes against them with
the filly Silverbulletday. ``He has taken a lot out of the sport,
and put a lot back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   As humans, they haven't done too poorly, either. Bob Lewis made
a lot of money with his Southern California beer distributorship,
and has given a good chunk of it away. He helped build one
cancer-care facility and funded another one that cares for
developmentally disabled children. That's where Lukas' son
rehabilitated after being kicked in the head by a rambunctious
thoroughbred.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises insist that, regardless of how Saturday shakes out,
it will be a day for celebration. They wouldn't dare brood over a
horse race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to be a loving husband, an adoring father (to
two sons and a daughter), win two Kentucky Derbies, two
Preaknesses, a Dubai World Cup,'' Bob Lewis says. ``Isn't that
lucky enough?''

WITH A TREATY, KOSOVO PROBLEMS ARE ONLY BEGINNING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even if the agreement reached Thursday with
Slobodan Milosevic ends the bombing of Yugoslavia, staggering
problems lie ahead, first among them the repatriation of nearly a
million Kosovars to the land of ashes and graves that was their
home.
</P>
<P>
   If they do return, experts on the region said, the Kosovars will
probably rally behind the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
making the rebels even less likely to disarm or abandon their
dreams of independence, which NATO opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things to watch as this unfolds,'' said
Michael Mandelbaum, a professor of foreign policy at the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ``First, the war
isn't over until the bombing stops. Second, it's not a success
until the refugees return. And third, it will not hold until the
KLA is disarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the United States and its allies must still find a
way of dealing with Milosevic, the president now indicted for war
crimes but still the man in charge in Belgrade, and presumably
still viscerally opposed to autonomy for the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Then the allies have to repair relations with the Russians and
Chinese, which have been sorely strained by the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that stretches the enormously costly challenge of
rebuilding the devastated economies of Kosovo, the rest of Serbia
and their neighbors. Only if that succeeds can the United States
and NATO begin to think of ending the stewardship they have now
assumed, whether by design or miscalculation, in the perennially
troublesome Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What remains unresolved far exceeds what has been resolved,''
said Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The gloomy and cautious talk stood in contrast to the hopes
raised by Belgrade's apparent agreement to conditions for an end to
the 10-week bombardment negotiated by Viktor Chernomyrdin of
Russia, President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott of the United States. As described by the
negotiators, these conditions include the verifiable withdrawal of
all Yugoslavian troops from Kosovo, the deployment of a NATO-led
peace force and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   To the experts, however, the very fact that Milosevic had agreed
to a deal touched off alarms. Many voiced suspicions either that he
would test allied resolve further, as President Saddam Hussein has
done repeatedly in Iraq, or that he would undermine the peace in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is a master of close negotiating sessions,'' said
Walter R. Mead, senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the
Council on Foreign Relations. ``He has been able in the past to
manipulate Western responses by coming close, moving away,
appearing to agree.''
</P>
<P>
   David Rieff, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute who
has written extensively on the region, said: ``If Milosevic is able
to call some kind of victory, this is a pause, rather than the end.
I hope I'm wrong, God knows. But my sense of this is that strife is
mother's milk to Milosevic. He hasn't changed. He's no different
from the man responsible for the Bosnian War and the mass expulsion
of most Kosovars and the murder, we'll probably discover, of many,
many thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the deal works, a Pentagon official said, NATO
forces must work swiftly to assess the situation in Kosovo and to
determine when and how the refugees can start returning home. One
problem, the official said, is to prevent a chaotic flood of
refugees. The official said the first priority would be to care for
the untold thousands of Kosovars driven from their homes but still
wandering about in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, however, thought it might prove difficult to
persuade many refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I hear from people who follow refugees is that many will
choose not to go home,'' Mead said. ``It's too late to put in a
crop, their homes are devastated and burned down, the roads are all
in a mess, there's nothing to go back to except a winter of
starvation. In the camps, they at least had food. So they'll
probably have to winterize the camps anyway. There's no chance for
a lot to go back before spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Haass added: ``NATO cannot coerce them to return. It has to be
safe. They have to have shelter, a livelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO does succeed in bringing home the refugees, the
peacekeeping forces will be confronted with the problem of
disarming a strengthened rebel army and quelling demands for
independence. Thursday's agreement reportedly reaffirms that the
guerrillas should be disarmed and that Kosovo should remain, at
least formally, a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon official acknowledged that the guerrillas pose a
serious problem. ``We are obviously paying a lot of attention to
that particular issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching problem, said Susan Woodward, a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution, ``is that all the people we want to help
us make a stable Kosovo have been destroyed by the effects of the
bombings. They're either in third countries, or so traumatized that
they can't be reorganized, or they've been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are going to control the next stage of the
process are the KLA,'' she added, ``however fragmented and
internally rivalrous they are. But they're not prepared. So all the
assumptions we are making _ that the refugees want to return, that
we can work with these people, that we can restore civil society _
are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-term challenge before NATO will be to find ways of
disentangling itself from the Balkans. That, the experts agreed,
will require restoring a viable economy to the entire region,
including Serbia, still its central force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether as monitors, European Union development and
reconstruction experts, NATO armies, I think that this decision in
Kosovo means that not only are we in Kosovo, but we're in the south
Balkans for a generation,'' Rieff said. ``But there's no long-term
solution to this crisis without a solution to Serbia. Everything
else until then is just first aid.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was general agreement that no assistance for
Yugoslavia is possible as long as Milosevic is there. Experience
shows that this is not a man who will give way willingly,
especially since all that awaits him outside the presidential
office in Belgrade is a trial for war crimes in The Hague,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken ownership of the Balkan problem,'' said John J.
Mearsheimer, professor of politics at the University of Chicago.
``I kind of imagine Milosevic smiling and saying, `We tried to deal
with the Kosovars and the KLA; now let NATO try.'''

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, May 31,
about social class as a predictor of health misstated the
correlation between employees' perception of job control and
employment grade. It was a direct correlation, not an inverse one:
the higher the grade, the more perception of control, and therefore
the better predictor of good health.

YUGOSLAVIA AGREES TO WITHDRAW FORCES FROM KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Battered by a 72-day NATO bombardment, Yugoslavia
agreed Thursday to withdraw its forces from Kosovo, stop ravaging
ethnic Albanians and end Europe's worst conflict since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton and NATO leaders expressed wariness at
President Slobodan Milosevic's apparent capitulation and demanded
to see Serb forces begin their withdrawal from Kosovo before
calling a halt to the daily airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movement by the Serbian leadership to accept these conditions,
established by NATO and the international community, is, of course,
welcome. But based on our past experience, we must also be
cautious,'' Clinton said in a Rose Garden address following a
meeting with his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we must have clarity that the Serbian leadership has
fully accepted these conditions and intends to fully implement
them. Until then, and until Serb forces begin a verifiable
withdrawal from Kosovo, we will continue to pursue diplomacy, but
we will also continue the military effort that has brought us to
this point,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav parliament, controlled by Milosevic, met behind
closed doors to accept the terms of a two-page peace agreement on a
136-74 vote. Opposition came from the Serbian Radical Party.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after a series of diplomatic moves by Russian
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari
who represented the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The plan required the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, the
return of thousands of Kosovar Albanian refugees, the deployment of
an international security force ``with essential NATO
participation,'' and autonomy for Kosovar Albanians. Some Serb
forces will remain to protect Orthodox Christian religious sites in
Kosovo, and the ethnic Albanian rebel forces fighting for an
independent Kosovo must be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia accepts the documents for peace brought by the
highest representatives of the European Union and Russia,''
reported the state Tanjug news agency. The parliament action
followed a meeting between Milosevic, Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the agreement a
political breakthrough. ``The peace, in my opinion, is very close.
And politically we have to make sure that it doesn't slip out of
our hands,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari, joining Schroeder in meeting reporters, said he and
Chernomyrdin presented Milosevic with the two-page document as
``the best offer that the international community was in a position
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, ``The acceptance by
Belgrade of these terms is a vital first step. But the
confrontation cannot end until these terms are complied with and
implemented. As a result, caution is the word of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav acceptance of the plan came at a critical time for
both the Balkan nation and the NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Daily poundings by NATO bombs were destroying Yugoslavia's
infrastructure as well as its military equipment as the allies
sought to force Milosevic to halt his ``ethnic cleansing'' policy
against ethnic Albanians in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But as the bombing campaign entered its 11th week, the United
States and other nations were coming under increasing pressure to
either launch a ground campaign to oust Serb forces from Kosovo or
seek a diplomatic solution short of their original demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was coming under increasing criticism from Congress as
U.S. support for the conflict waned.
</P>
<P>
   The pact is similar to one rejected by Milosevic earlier this
year. His rejection prompted the phased NATO bombing campaign. But
Milosevic's policy of ``ethnic cleansing'' continued as he sent
40,000 troops into Kosovo to oust nearly all the 1.7 million
Kosovar Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces have killed an estimated 2,000 ethnic Albanians in
the past 13 months and reports of atrocities since the NATO air
raids began prompted the indictment last week of Milosevic for war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   If the peace agreement holds, it would pave the way for nearly
50,000 international troops to secure sites in Kosovo and ensure
the safety of the returning refugees. The troops would include
7,000 U.S. soldiers. Russia also will commit personnel but possibly
under its own command. The inclusion of NATO troops and its push
for a unified command had been a sticking point with Russia as the
plan was hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met in the afternoon with the Military Joint Chiefs of
Staff to discuss the deployment of U.S. forces. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said NATO military officials will meet with
Yugoslavia military officials to work out details on the withdrawal
of Serb forces and the deployment of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no action taken that would in any way impede
their full withdrawal,'' Cohen said. ``Until such time as we're
satisfied that they intend to fully comply with the agreement, then
the air campaign will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin told reporters in Russia that NATO would halt its
bombing of Yugoslavia within two or three days of Milosevic
complying with the demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we have succeeded in doing at this stage is to
bring the situation into the legal field of the United Nations,''
Chernomyrdin said. NATO's military actions, taken without the
approval of the United Nations, sparked outrage from Russia and
China, both members of the permanent Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   At the EU Summit in Cologne, Germany, members issued a statement
emphasizing the ``urgent need'' for a UN Security Council
resolution authorizing the international security force and
establishing the provisional international civil administration for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many details are yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to clarify the information that's been made available,
we need to figure out the details and the implementation,'' said
Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman. ``We're dealing with
someone who has made promises before and has not kept them.''

CLINTON RENEWS CHINA TRADE STATUS AMID ROCKY RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday renewed normal trade
relations with China, setting off an annual congressional debate
complicated this year by allegations that China has stolen U.S.
nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers expect Congress to muster enough votes to overturn
Clinton's action, but the debate is expected to be heated. And
hopes are fading that Clinton can win congressional approval for
Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization before the next
round of international trade talks in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   As one indication of the trouble now facing U.S.-China
relations, Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., who has supported normal
trade relations with China throughout his four years in Congress,
said Thursday he is now ``undecided and gravely concerned.'' The
other 10 members of the state's congressional delegation, although
expressing a variety of concerns about China's behavior, continue
to support normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted Thursday that maintaining normal trade
relations with China is in U.S. interests because of a rapid
increase in U.S. exports to China. But in a statement issued just a
day before Friday's 10th anniversary of the Chinese massacre of
protesters at Tiananmen Square, Clinton acknowledged widespread
concerns about China's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursue engagement with our eyes wide open, without
illusions,'' he said. ``We continue to speak frankly about our
differences and to firmly protect our national interests. A policy
of disengagement and confrontation would only strengthen those in
China who oppose greater openness and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, U.S.-China relations seemed to be on an
upswing. China offered to lift a 27-year ban on the importation of
Northwest wheat as part of a broad package of trade concessions,
and the two countries appeared to be on track to negotiate China's
accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 7, NATO forces accidently bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, killing three people. That was followed by several
days of anti-Western demonstrations in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a House committee headed by Reps. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., and Norm Dicks, D-Wash., reported that China had
succeeded in stealing design information about all seven nuclear
warheads currently deployed on American missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had lousy counterintelligence at our national
labs is something we should be embarrassed about, but we should not
change our basic relationship with China,'' Dicks said. ``We're
cleaning up our mess, but I don't think we should create another
one by trying to go to a Cold War setting with China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly anybody would say that this is a very difficult time
to pass legislation giving normal trade relations to China,'' said
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. ``I think it will pass ... but what I'm
worried about is that there will be so much Red Scare-ing ... that
we will lose sight of the larger goal, which is to involve the
Chinese in the community of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's Republican members of Congress are more
inclined to blame Clinton than China for the spying episode, and,
with the exception of Metcalf, they do not believe the spying
debate should be tied to trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be surprised that there are people spying on
us,'' said Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash. ``Our surprise should be when
we discover that we don't act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   China is the fourth largest trading partner of the United
States, which last year exported $14.3 billion of goods to China
and imported $71.2 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington state, where two-way trade with China ranks third
largest among Asia-Pacific nations at nearly $10 billion in 1997,
there are a variety of economic issues at stake. Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., said he supports normal trade relations with
China because of the importance of winning better access to Chinese
markets for eastern Washington agricultural products. Rep. Jay
Inslee, D-Wash., said normal relations would allow a tougher
crackdown on software piracy in China that would help companies
like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the state's largest employer, will be leading the charge
in favor of normal relations through its chairman, Philip Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade with China is a cornerstone of a stable U.S.-China
relationship, and presents Americans with unprecedented
opportunities with the world's most populous country,'' Condit
said. ``Normal trade relations with China not only sustains
hundreds of thousands of export and import-related jobs, but it
also supports U.S. companies operating in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said that ``In the long run, when
individual members of Congress are looking at the 5,000 concessions
China has made, they're going to think of their own districts, and
when they see the benefits for the high-tech community, for the
beef producers, for the wheat farmers, then we will move away from
the current contentious atmosphere and look at reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., in the past a skeptical voice on
U.S.-China relations, this year said that he would support
permanent normal trade relations with China based on a series of
concessions agreed to this spring. Gorton is now worried that the
deal with China may have fallen apart, but if Clinton reconstructs
it, Gorton has pledged to help him win permanent normal relations
in the Senate, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The three other members of the state's congressional delegation,
Republican Jennifer Dunn and Democrats Brian Baird and Adam Smith,
support normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has normal trade relations with most
countries. The status, formerly known as most favored nation,
allows countries low tariffs when exporting to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The president must decide each year whether to renew normal
trade relations with countries like China that do not grant their
residents freedom of emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has 60 days to overturn a president's action on trade
relations, but has done so only once, in 1989, shortly after
Tiananmen Square. President Bush vetoed that action, and Congress
failed to override his veto.

RUSSIA SAID TO HAVE PLAYED KEY ROLE IN ADVANCING NATO PLAN FOR
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Despite its outspoken criticism of allied bombing
raids, Russia played a vital role in advancing NATO's peace plan
for Kosovo, Western diplomats and Russian officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian envoy Victor Chernomyrdin supported the two-page list of
demands that Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari presented to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia during talks in Belgrade
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's move appears to have persuaded Milosevic that he
was isolated diplomatically and that NATO was very unlikely to
soften its conditions.
</P>
<P>
   That has not only improved the prospects for concluding a peace
agreement, it has also helped President Boris Yeltsin defuse
domestic complaints that his government was powerless to end the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia diplomatic effort appears to have made a difference,''
said State Department spokesman James Rubin. ``We think they played
a crucial role in showing the Serbs that there was a united front
of Russia, Europe and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Chernomyrdin's diplomacy has been
universally applauded here. The Russian envoy returned Thursday
night to something less than a hero's welcome. Left-wing members of
parliament assailed him for going along with NATO. And some Russian
military officials were quick to register their dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our hearts, we soldiers are dissatisfied with many of the
points agreed upon in the negotiations,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's department of
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's bombs first began to fall on Yugoslavia 10 weeks
ago Yeltsin has found himself on the political defensive.
Nationalists complained that NATO's attacks demonstrated that
Russia had become weak and marginalized on Yeltsin's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Some even demanded that the Kremlin provide military assistance
to Belgrade, a step Yeltsin steadfastly opposed and one that would
have dealt a blow to his policy of maintaining a working
relationship with the West.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Kremlin a strong motivation to promote a
diplomatic settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking an end to the bombing, the Russians began by marketing
their own peace plans. One Russian proposal, which was promoted by
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, would have confined NATO's most
potent peacekeeping troops to the Albanian and Macedonia border
regions, while neutral nations and Russia forces maintained order
in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO let Moscow know that the plan was not going anywhere. That
left the Yeltsin government with some choices: pull out of the
peace talks, drag out the negotiating by proposing other
initiatives, or cooperate with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin opted for the last. A former prime minister who was
also once the head of his country's natural gas monopoly,
Chernomyrdin may not be among Russia's foremost democratic
reformers. But he understands the value of cooperating with the
West.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Russian politics, however, it was too much to expect
Chernomyrdin to negotiate on NATO's behalf. So he recommended that
a Western diplomat accompany him on negotiating trips to Belgrade,
relieving Russia of the unwelcome role of serving as NATO's
postman.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's proposal was made during a breakfast meeting he
held with Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Washington a few weeks ago. NATO tapped Ahtisaari for
the role.
</P>
<P>
   In his meetings this week in Belgrade, the Finnish president
warned that he had come to present NATO's demands, not to haggle
over them. Chernomyrdin backed him up.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian envoy got something for his support. NATO's plan
concedes that an international force should be stationed in Kosovo
with the authorization of the United Nations. Russia holds a veto
in the Security Council and has long sought to strengthen the U.N.
role.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the plan presented to Belgrade acknowledges that
Yugoslavia will maintain formal sovereignty over Kosovo. That is an
important principle for the Russians. With so many ethnic groups in
Russia, Moscow does not want to establish a precedent for using
Western power to create a homeland for separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin also insisted that Russian peacekeeping troops
would not serve under direct NATO command. Deciding how Russian
troops would work alongside NATO forces is still a major issue.
Chernomyrdin is likely to be deeply involved in that effort.

LITTON CLINCHES DEAL WITH AVONDALE SHIPBUILDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In a deal that broadens its fleet of warship
products, Litton Industries Inc. on Thursday agreed to buy Avondale
Industries Inc. for $529 million in cash after a rival suitor
refused to submit a higher bid.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale, based in New Orleans, had agreed earlier to merge with
Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. in a deal valued at $470 million,
and the combination had won the government's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   However, on May 6 the board at Litton hit the merger broadside
by making separate offers of $503.9 million for Avondale and $1.9
billion for Newport News.
</P>
<P>
   During negotiations, Litton increased its offer to Avondale, and
that company's board agreed this week to accept it but gave Newport
News, based in Newport, Va., 48 hours to come up with a higher bid.
</P>
<P>
   Newport News declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thoroughly reviewed the issues and determined that it was
not in the best business interests of our shareholders to raise our
offer for Avondale,'' William P. Fricks, the chairman of Newport
News, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's purchase price for Avondale works out to $39.50 a
share. Avondale shares closed at $38.1875 on Thursday, down 18.5
cents. Litton shares closed at $69.0625, up $2.125.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies would have revenues of approximately $5.5
billion, a backlog of orders totaling $8.8 billion, total market
capitalization of $4.7 billion and more than 40,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase is expected to have a positive impact on Litton's
earnings per share in the first year following the close of the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Brown, Litton's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the deal creates a world-class shipbuilding operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It significantly strengthens our lines of business and
provides substantial opportunities to increase revenues by
broadening our surface combatant and noncombatant government
business, both in new construction and support services,'' he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, layoffs are expected, and Avondale's senior
management will keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale's operations will continue to be managed by Albert L.
Bossier, that company's chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Litton spokesman Randy Belote said the merger would not
necessitate a major restructuring at the new company. And while a
new corporate identity has not been selected, both Litton and
Avondale probably would be part of the new name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Newport News-Avondale merger probably was doomed May 28 when
the government indicated its intent to oppose Litton's combination
with Newport News on the grounds that the reduction in competition
from that merger would not offset cost savings in ships and other
kinds of military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pentagon officials said there would not be any
objections to Litton merging with Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   But that deal still has to be approved by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and government antitrust regulators, a process
that could take up to four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a couple of hurdles to get through, but for the
most part the heavy lifting has been done,'' Belote said. &QL;

WILLES RESIGNS AS PUBLISHER OF LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark H. Willes, chief executive of Times Mirror Co. and
publisher of its flagship newspaper, The Los Angeles Times, has for
the last 19 months used the publisher's job as a bully pulpit to
advance his argument that the newspaper business can thrive if only
it is willing to reinvent itself. Thursday, he suddenly resigned as
publisher, saying his corporate duties require his full attention.
</P>
<P>
   He turned the publisher's job over to Kathryn M. Downing, who
has served as the newspaper's president for the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   The move makes Ms. Downing the fifth person in the last 20 years
to serve at the helm of one of the country's leading newspapers _
an institution that had only four publishers, all members of the
Otis and Chandler families, in the preceding 98 years. Like Willes,
Ms. Downing, 46, comes to the job with significant executive
experience, and like him, she had little exposure to the newspaper
business before she joined The Times as its president last year.
She had been a top executive in the company's legal publishing
division before it was sold last year.
</P>
<P>
   Willes said Thursday that while he regretted leaving the
publisher's job he was convinced that Ms. Downing had built a
management team that could carry out the ambitious circulation and
revenue goals he has established for all Times Mirror newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In his early days with the company, Willes said he believed that
the newspaper's circulation could grow from just over a million to
1.5 million. Last year, Ms. Downing upped the ante, saying she
believed the paper could sell two million copies daily _ a
prediction she reiterated Thursday, without giving any firm time
frame by which the goal should be reached. The paper's daily
circulation now is 1.1 million; Sunday circulation is 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Downing was named president of The Times, a decision
that surprised observers who had expected the job to go to Mary E.
Junck, a Times Mirror executive with a long track record in
newspaper publishing, there has been extensive turnover in the top
ranks of business executives at the paper. One executive recruited
by Willes stayed at the paper just six weeks earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Willes said, ``Serving as publisher of
The Los Angeles Times, even with all of the criticism, even with
all of the breakage, even with all the difficulties involved, has
been intrinsically the most exciting and satisfying job that I have
ever had or expect to have.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added: ``When I appointed myself publisher, one of the
most difficult questions to answer was: how do you serve as
corporate CEO and publisher? The honest answer is, it's hard
because they are two very big jobs. My answer at the time was that
the most important thing that needed to be done within Times Mirror
was to be sure the L.A. Times was on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he believes he has done that, noting that the
newspaper's second-quarter earnings will reflect the first
year-to-year growth in five quarters. However, Ms. Downing said
circulation _ which has grown steadily over that same period _ was
``soft'' and would be down during the second quarter as the
circulation strategy shifted from an emphasis on direct marketing
to partnerships with Korean- and Spanish-language newspapers and
increased local coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Willes' dual roles as chief executive and publisher had already
caused some comment among the directors of Times Mirror. Last
summer, at a farewell dinner for three outgoing Times-Mirror
directors, one of the three, C. Michael Armstrong _ now chairman
and chief executive of AT&AMP;T _ noted in a farewell toast that he had
difficulty endorsing the concept that one person should hold both
jobs, according to two people at the dinner who insisted they not
be named.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing's appointment was announced to the newsroom by the
newspaper's executive editor, and vice president, Michael Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday what her journalistic goals were, Ms. Downing
praised Parks and singled out two areas of coverage for special
mention: an article about the paucity of textbooks available to Los
Angeles schoolchildren and the Kosovo coverage of Paul Watson, a
Times reporter who went back into the war-scarred province after
Western journalists had been ordered out in March.

EXILED LEADERS OF TIANANMEN GATHER TO MULL ERRORS AND
ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass., _ For the first time since soldiers drove them
at gunpoint from Beijing's Tiananmen Square 10 years ago, the top
leaders of China's democracy movement gathered at Harvard
University Thursday, like alumni converging for a reunion on the
leafy New England campus.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of the men and women the Chinese Communists had
denounced as instigators of a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion''
was itself significant, the leaders said, since some of them spent
years in prison and others have squabbled among themselves over
what went wrong and what they can do from exile to change China's
government.
</P>
<P>
   The former leaders, most of whom were university students at the
time, offered no new plan for political reform in China, but they
acknowledged mistakes they had made with unusual candor and
insisted that the movement they began has already changed China for
the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiananmen did not fail,'' said Li Lu, who was a physics
student at Nanjing University and a leader of the Tiananmen
demonstrators before the Communist leadership called in the troops
on the night of June 3-4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communists killed the messenger but had to take part of
the message,'' said Li, who is now managing partner of Himalaya
Capital Partners, a hedge fund in New York. ``The democracy
movement marked the end of the idea that one party dictatorship can
bring good to China, and so now the Communists are tolerating
things like village elections that they would never have accepted
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who attended the conference were Wang Dan, who
organized the student discussion groups at Beijing University in
the months before the spring 1989 protests; Wang Juntao, who ran an
independent think tank in Beijing that backed the students; and
Wu'er Kaixi, a student at Beijing Normal University who gained
prominence by daring to challenge Prime Minister Li Peng during a
nationally televised meeting. Both Wang Dan and Wang Juntao were
arrested after the crackdown and sent to prison. Wu'er escaped and
now works as a radio talk-show host in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by Wei Jingsheng, perhaps China's best-known
dissident and the author of the most daring wall posters calling
for democracy during the short-lived Democracy Wall movement in
1979. For his temerity, Wei spent 18 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Wu'er said, ``I'm optimistic, even in exile.'' The
Communists think they have made a ``deal'' with the Chinese people,
giving them economic development instead of political freedom, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Chinese government doesn't understand,'' he said,
``is that the people become greedy when they start to make money,
and when the government thinks it is satisfying them by giving them
economic freedom, the people will inevitably want more freedom to
protect their ability to make money, until this leads to
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston
University and an expert on Chinese dissidents, said the
participants at the conference now have ``a much better
understanding of what democracy means and what it takes to bring
about political change. The tragedy is, they can't use this
knowledge now from abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group that is remarkably talented and intelligent
and cares about China,'' she said, pointing to the success of most
of the leaders since they were exiled. In addition to Li, who has
degrees from Columbia's law and business schools, she said, Wang
Dan is a graduate student in history at Harvard, Wang Juntao is
studying for his Ph.D. in political science at Columbia, and Chai
Ling, the best-known female student leader, runs her own Internet
company in Cambridge, having earned a degree from the Harvard
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Wu'er pointed out, many of these highly
intelligent activists got their inspiration from Mao Zedong, when
he launched the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s. ``We spent
our first 10 years in the Cultural Revolution, and we came to
believe that if all the people in the world united, we could create
utopia,'' Wu'er said. ``It was very idealistic and appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience also led these young Chinese to question
authority, as Mao preached that the youthful Red Guards should
track down and attack corrupt party officials, Wu'er said. Then,
when Mao died in 1976 and Deng Xiaoping replaced him as China's
paramount leader, Wu'er continued, he ``left us confused'' by
denouncing the Cultural Revolution and preaching that to ``get rich
is glorious.'' This created a ``vacuum in ideology'' that prompted
some students to begin studying democracy on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also criticism Thursday of the students' tactics.
Chen Jun, a former Red Guard turned welder who published a magazine
during the Democracy Wall movement in 1979, said the student
protesters had a ``dream without a plan or leadership'' and led a
``romantic-tragic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The students in 1989, Chen said, were too elitist and mired in
China's imperial tradition of petitioning the government for change
rather than striking out on their own, and too afraid of the
government's reaction if they allied themselves with dissatisfied
factory workers who could have brought them greater numbers and
power.
</P>
<P>
   Li said the group, now formally organized as the Tiananmen
Generation Association, plans to meet again next year, in Taiwan,
to observe the presidential election there.

EXPLORER SPORT SEEMS TO HAVE WHAT THEY WANT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I entered the working world full-time in the late 1970s, I
couldn't wait until I'd saved enough from my meager paychecks to
buy my first brand-new car. I wanted something small, nimble, sleek
and sporty. And make it red.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was before trucks ruled the earth. Now a young
career woman's fancy frequently turns not to cute little sports
cars, but to rugged, assertive sport utilities. It seems women are
passing up Ralph Fiennes for a fling with Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the success of the Ford Explorer Sport. In 1998, sales
of these two-door models soared 72 percent, pushing total Explorer
sales to record levels. Women bought about half, a significant
percentage for any vehicle. These women were largely unmarried, and
more than a third fell into the 18-to-34 age group that
manufacturers covet.
</P>
<P>
   After a week with the Explorer Sport, I still cannot explain its
attraction to young women. I found its ride harsh, its steering
twitchy and its cabin uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Explorers have come in two-door versions since Ford introduced
the midsize sport utility in March 1990. But until last year, 90
percent of the Explorers sold _ and, as America's best-selling
sport utility, three million have hit the streets _ were of the
four-door variety. Many found homes with baby boomer couples that
had children.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a couple years ago, Ford and its dealers in California and
the Southeast, where four-wheel drive is not essential, began a
$19,995 price promotion to propel sales of the two-door,
two-wheel-drive Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the positive response, Ford gave all two-door
models the Explorer Sport name for 1998, and it gave them the same
$19,995 base price. Now the Sport accounts for one of every four
Explorers sold.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also came up with a ``premium package'' with more prominent
wheel well moldings and bumpers with a painted platinum surface.
Most buyers order this package, and Ford says the young women who
buy the Explorer Sport list styling as a main reason for their
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the Ford's versatility in hauling people,
cargo and pets, which most of the female owners have. It can carry
five passengers, though I wouldn't want to ride cross-country in
the back; the rear backrest seemed particularly low and lacking in
upper-back support.
</P>
<P>
   Before you climb out, someone in front must release a front
seatback. There is some consolation for back seat passengers: In
the test vehicle they had their own air vents and audio jacks.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo bay is more than ample for groceries and sports
equipment _ there's also a roof rack _ and access through the
liftgate is convenient. A lever pull folds the bottom of the back
seat into the footwell, and the seatback folds to form a flat cargo
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, storage is stingy. There are a lot of nooks and
crannies, but they offer dainty bits of space. The door pockets
accommodate little more than a couple of cassettes. The armrest in
the test model covered a rectangular bin, but a compact disk
changer consumed most of the space, leaving room for only a
half-dozen CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Women buyers also say they bought the Explorer Sport for its
maneuverability and fun-to-drive character. It is maneuverable
enough for its size, but I found the test vehicle anything but fun
to drive.
</P>
<P>
   After a week at the wheel, I concluded that only a young person
could live with the Sport. My middle-age body and fragile lower
back felt battered by the harsh ride. The steering required
constant attention to keep the vehicle moving in a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   And the women who buy these vehicles had better have long legs.
I used the narrow running board for footing and clutched the grab
handles to hoist my short frame inside. As with any sport utility,
this is no ladylike maneuver in a skirt.
</P>
<P>
   The seats proved extremely uncomfortable for my short legs. The
bottom cushion was too deep, hitting me in the calves. I never felt
confident at the wheel because I couldn't find a good driving
position despite the multiple seat adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's standard engine is a pushrod V6 rated at 160
horsepower. The test vehicle had a 4-liter overhead-valve V6 that
puts out 210 horsepower; it is the better choice. A five-speed
manual transmission is standard; a four-speed automatic is
optional.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer Sport comes with two-or four-wheel drive. A knob
controls the four-wheel-drive system; positioned on ``auto,''
four-wheel drive kicks in when needed. There are high and low
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Women seem to like sport utilities in general because of the
safe, secure feeling they get from the high seating position. The
Explorer Sport is further equipped with dual front air bags,
anti-lock brakes and an anti-theft system. Side air bags are
optional for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features are power windows, mirrors and locks,
air-conditioning and an AM/FM radio with stereo/cassette. A new
option this year is a reverse sensing system that alerts drivers to
objects at the rear when backing up.
</P>
<P>
   Though the base price is $19,995 ($20,405 with destination
charges), four-wheel drive, the premium package and other equipment
can push the price above $30,000. The test car, which had the
$1,600 premium package as well as side air bags, reverse sensors,
power moon roof and upgraded stereo, came in at $31,230 _without
leather seats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the base prices for both the two- and four-wheel drive
versions undercut the Chevrolet Blazer and Jeep Cherokee. The
Explorer is a little more expensive than the cute sport utilities
like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V, but it is a heavier, more
powerful, more substantial vehicle. To my taste, though, it's too
rough around the edges. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: More of a brute ute than a cute ute.

RIVLIN, NO. 2 OFFICIAL TO GREENSPAN, QUITS AT FED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alice Rivlin resigned Thursday as vice chairwoman
of the Federal Reserve, leaving the No. 2 job empty at the central
bank as it confronts a tough call on whether to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivlin, 68, said she was stepping down to do research at the
Brookings Institution and to devote more time to her role as head
of the District of Columbia's Financial Assistance Authority, which
is trying to clean up Washington's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said there was no hidden agenda in her decision,
which came a little less than four weeks before the Fed is to next
vote on whether the persistent strength of economic growth requires
an increase in interest rates to forestall the possibility of
resurgent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Although her resignation will not take effect until July 16, the
Fed said she would not take part in the monetary policy meeting
June 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   While unexpected, Ms. Rivlin's resignation is unlikely to have a
crucial effect on the debate within the Fed on the degree of danger
that inflation poses to the nation's long economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   She has been perhaps the most outspoken proponent at the central
bank of the view that the economy is more capable of
noninflationary growth than in the past, and more sympathetic than
most of her fellow policy makers to the idea that driving the
unemployment rate lower under those circumstances is worth the risk
of a slight uptick in prices.
</P>
<P>
   But her views were well within the economic mainstream, and
never once during her three-year tenure did she vote against the
Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, whose influence inside and outside
the institution vastly overshadowed her own. Indeed, Ms. Rivlin was
the fourth deputy since Greenspan took office almost 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan has the bulk of the power, given both his position
as chairman and his successful stewardship of the Fed up until
now,'' said William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
``This doesn't really change things very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivlin accepted the Fed post somewhat reluctantly in 1996 at
President Clinton's behest, and although she was sometimes
mentioned as a possible successor to Greenspan, she never lost the
reputation of being more interested in fiscal policy _ her area of
expertise _ than in monetary policy. And Greenspan showed every
sign of wanting to stay on in the job even after his third term
ends next June.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivlin declined interview requests Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Her departure leaves Clinton with two slots to fill on the Fed's
seven-member board of governors. The White House is close to
completing background checks on its choice for the seat left open
last year by the resignation of Susan M. Phillips _ Carol Parry, an
executive vice president of Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had been aware of Ms.
Rivlin's intention to leave for several weeks, and that the search
for a successor was ``well under way.'' They gave no hint of who
was under consideration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Rivlin announced her resignation after the close of the
stock market. The news had little effect on other financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is a strong bulwark of U.S. economic policy, and I
believe we have contributed to keeping the American economy growing
and reducing strains in the international financial system,'' Ms.
Rivlin said in her resignation letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Greenspan said, ``Her wisdom influenced all our
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for whom she served as White House budget director and
before that deputy director, said in a statement that she had been
``a steady and strong voice for fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed watchers have scrutinized the central bank particularly
closely the last several weeks, after its decision on May 18 to
tilt policy toward an increase in interest rates. The first
substantial clue could come on Friday, when the Labor Department
releases May unemployment data.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Fed's discussions in coming weeks will
crystallize a debate that has dominated policy making for the last
several years. To a substantial degree, that debate has revolved
around issues central to Ms. Rivlin's view of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   She has made the case that not just factors like higher
productivity are tamping down inflation, but that low unemployment
_ seen in traditional economic models as a trigger for inflation _
might itself be spurring higher productivity by forcing companies
to hold down wage costs through improved efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economists have had in their head the idea that tight labor
markets would lead to inflation and low productivity,'' she said in
an interview in April with The Financial Times. ``It may be that
under the present circumstances of fierce global competition, the
effect of tight labor markets is exactly the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivlin has also been forthright in her belief that a low
unemployment rate _ especially during a period in which federal,
state and local governments are pushing many welfare recipients
into the work force for the first time _ is a benefit that should
not be given away through blind adherence to old rules about the
relationship between inflation, growth and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The models have been predicting higher inflation based on
tight labor markets,'' said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. ``Alice Rivlin tended to rely less on
models and more on her own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivlin's long service as an economist and public official
included director of the Congressional Budget Office, which she
founded, from 1975 to 1983.

BIG CHANGES SAID TO BE AFOOT AT PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is expected to announce next week that it
will cut thousands of jobs worldwide, close several
under-performing plants and take a huge charge to become more
competitive and improve profits, according to analysts and
institutional investors who have met with management.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization will give investors the first detailed look
at where Durk Jager, P&AMP;G's new chief executive, is steering the
company, which makes Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Crest
toothpaste among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, most of which are expected to take place outside the
United States, are intended to streamline P&AMP;G's top-heavy
management structure and allow the company to compete better in
fast-changing and highly competitive global markets.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G is expected to divide its businesses into seven units, which
will be run as global entities instead of as parts of regional
divisions. The units will focus on specific product segments,
including hair care, laundry and feminine protection, and are
expected to speed up the company's lethargic product development
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, part of what P&AMP;G is calling Organization 2005, are
part of a plan to focus on research and development instead of
geographical expansion. The strategy represents a new direction for
the company under Jager, who took over in January after 29 years
with P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a bit of a change in mindset,'' said Mark
Godfrey, senior analyst with Investco Funds Group in Denver, which
holds 1.6 million P&AMP;G shares. ``Before they stuck to a pretty
conservative game plan. Durk has come in and shaken things up a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization is expected to be announced next Wednesday
when executives meet with investors and analysts in New York. The
company declined Thursday to comment on any planned job cuts or
shift in its business structure.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts said that in addition to the job cuts and
plant closings, they expected the company, which has 110,000
employees worldwide, to announce charges of $2 billion to $3
billion related to the reorganization. It would be the first
significant revamping since 1993, when the company dismissed
thousands of workers, closed dozens of plants and also took huge
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said management would have to justify another round of
hefty charges. But the overall reorganization, if well executed,
should make the company more competitive and ultimately increase
profitability, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very strong hint we've been getting from P&AMP;G is that they
will end up being more nimble and getting product to market
faster,'' said Constance Maneaty, an analyst with Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Though still a dominant force in consumer products, P&AMP;G has long
been accused of having a cumbersome management structure, a slow
product development pipeline and a far too conservative global
growth plan. Such weaknesses have enabled rivals like Unilever to
grow more aggressively globally and smaller competitors like Clorox
Co. to respond faster to new product trends. In one high-profile
misstep, P&AMP;G was too slow to come out with new versions of Crest,
long the undisputed leader in toothpaste. As a result,
Colgate-Palmolive's new brand, Total, now outshines Crest.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, P&AMP;G has begun to show more spunk. It has
worked to push more forcefully into international markets. And last
year, it introduced Febreeze, a product that removes odors from
fabric and has quickly become a juggernaut. What is more, P&AMP;G is
rolling out two products that, while not revolutionary, analysts
said, represent innovation that has at times been lacking at the
company. They are Dryel, a dry-cleaning kit for home use, and
Swiffer, an electrostatic mop with with disposable cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the potential of such new products as well as
innovation with its more traditional products, like new features on
diapers and new formulas for laundry detergent, P&AMP;G has said that
it expects to lift earnings 12 percent to 14 percent even without a
reorganization. Now, ``I'd expect that range to ratchet up,'' said
Sally Dessloch, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities. &QL;

 Governor Davis Appoints 2 Interim Commissioners for PUC  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith and Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Governor Gray Davis yesterday appointed two members of his staff to
serve on the state Public Utilities Commission _ but only as
interim commissioners until permanent members are named.
<P>
   The surprise move, hastily arranged Wednesday night, appeared to
have been inspired by fear the commission, with three Republican
holdovers from the Wilson administration, was preparing to approve
measures the governor opposes.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has been postponing decisions on important
telecommunications and energy issues since two of its five members
departed six months ago. The temporary appointments come amid
criticism that Davis has been taking too long to fill positions
throughout state government.
</P>
<P>
   The new appointees would not say what direction, if any, they've
received from Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't discuss my discussions with the governor,'' said
Loretta Lynch, 37, a former San Francisco litigation attorney who
headed the governor's Office of Planning and Research until she was
appointed to the PUC yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The other appointee, Tal Finney, 35, is known as an ``Energizer
bunny'' in Sacramento. He earned the nickname after Davis appointed
him on four previous occasions to temporarily head other agencies
or commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in February, Finney served two months as interim
director of the Department of Social Services. In January, he was
named to the Agriculture Labor Relations Board _ for a day. In
addition to the PUC, he has been representing the governor for no
pay on the Managed Risk Medical Board and the California Earthquake
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   His regular job has been the governor's director of policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I serve at the governor's pleasure wherever he wants me,''
Finney said after yesterday's PUC meeting in San Francisco. ``We'll
be representing his views here.''
</P>
<P>
   At yesterday's meeting, Finney and Lynch got the commission to
postpone scheduled votes on three issues:
</P>
<P>
   _One would affect the way phone companies compensate each other
for completing each other's calls. The issue is important because
it could affect how much consumers pay for Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, calls made to a local ISP number are considered
local. But Pac Bell has been arguing that calls made to an ISP are
long-distance, because the Internet is a global network.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which has ISPs fuming and threatening to raise
rates if it passes, apparently has the support of one or two
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   _Rival proposals would let electric utilities like Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric earn profits of as much as 11.6 percent on regulated
activities, such as power distribution. Consumer advocates have
suggested that the profits of PG&AMP;E, Southern California Edison and
San Diego Gas &AMP; Electric Co. be capped at something closer to 9
percent _ potentially saving ratepayers hundreds of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _The final issue would have established the PUC's position on a
bill that would reorganize its governance. The bill, SB 33, would
let the governor pick the PUC president _ rather than continuing to
use peer selection. It also would expand the president's powers and
allow the commissioners to hire more personal advisers from outside
the PUC staff.
</P>
<P>
   At yesterday's meeting, Commissioner Henry Duque attacked the
bill, saying it would ``politicize the agency'' and ``betray the
Commission's legacy as an independent agency and replace experts on
markets and law with experts on politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and Finney said they will carefully study each issue
before casting votes as early as Thursday, at the PUC's next
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers expressed disappointment that Davis had not made &LR; 
 &LR; appointed permanent PUC commissioners. The job pays about $100,000
per year.
</P>
<P>
   One other important PUC position _ director of the Office of
Ratepayer Advocates _ is still vacant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride over there,'' said Nettie
Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a consumer
advocacy group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Finney previously served as Davis' general counsel when he was
lieutenant governor. He earned his bachelor's degree in political
science from the University of California at Los Angeles, and has a
law degree from Loyola Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch has been a partner in the San Francisco law firm Keker &AMP;
Van Nest since 1991. Previously, she was a lawyer for the Legal Aid
Foundation of Los Angeles, handling homelessness and welfare policy
cases and worked, briefly, for state Attorney General John Van de
Kamp.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Southern
California and earned her law degree from Yale University Law
School.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ On the 72nd day of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday accepted an
international peace plan to end the Kosovo conflict and allow
nearly 1 million ethnic Albanian refugees to return to what is left
of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   After forcing most of those refugees to flee from Kosovo and
enduring thousands of Serbian military and civilian deaths,
Milosevic and the Serbian parliament agreed rapidly to all key NATO
demands after emissaries from Russia and Europe brought what they
made clear was the best offer he was going to get from NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In a swift retreat that may spell political trouble for him,
Milosevic agreed to withdraw all Yugoslav military and police
forces from Kosovo within seven days and allow 50,000 foreign
troops under a U.N. flag _ many of them from NATO and under NATO
command _ to police the province.
</P>
<P>
   That withdrawal could begin as early as Sunday, said Goran
Matic, a minister in the Yugoslav government, once military leaders
of both sides agreed on the details for the handover. What is
important for Belgrade is that the Kosovo Liberation Army not be
allowed to fill the vacuum and flood into Kosovo, he said, and that
NATO keep its commitment to ``demilitarize'' the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO has emphasized the need for a strong force to prevent
the Yugoslav president from reneging on his commitments, Yugoslav
officials and some Western diplomats here believe its real
difficulties will come from the KLA, which it has tried to use as a
proxy army and is unlikely to give up its ambitions for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Initial public reactions in the West, which appeared to be taken
by surprise by the sudden fact of its victory, were cautious, and
it was not immediately clear when or even through what means the
conflict will be brought to a conclusion. Western spokesmen said
the Serbs must begin a ``credible and verifiable withdrawal'' from
Kosovo before the bombs would stop, but NATO's bombing campaign
slackened noticeably Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The peace proposals were negotiated between NATO and Russia,
acting for Belgrade. Once the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
finally agreed on the basics of the deal with the U.S. deputy
secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, Milosevic clearly felt he had
no choice but to accept them or endure further destruction his
forces could not prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposals, fewer than 1,000 Serbian personnel will be
allowed to re-enter Kosovo, to guard key border posts and Serbian
holy sites, as a symbol of Serbian and Yugoslav sovereignty over
the southern province. But there will be little substance left to
Belgrade's assertion of sovereignty. Kosovo will get ``substantial
autonomy'' within Yugoslavia, but for all intents and purposes,
will have little to do with the Serb or Yugoslav state.
</P>
<P>
   An interim international authority will supervise the running of
Kosovo and the establishment of new democratic institutions and
elections, the return of all refugees and the rebuilding of the
province. In the meantime, there will be new negotiations between
Serbian and ethnic Albanian leaders to work out a long-term
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in what Belgrade pointed to as a victory, the proposals
accepted Thursday do not include a new examination of Kosovo's
sovereignty after three years or any referendum on that topic, as
did the draft proposals accepted in March by the Albanian side only
in Rambouillet, France. It was the Serbian refusal to accept those
accords that led to the opening of the NATO air campaign on March
24, the sharp acceleration in the Serbian effort to push the
Albanians out of Kosovo and the tidal wave of refugees into
surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials also said that their resistance had forced
NATO to find a solution within the United Nations and with the
participation of the Russians. And they emphasized the firm
international guarantees of Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo,
unlike the temporary sovereignty proposed under Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But there was also important nationalist criticism of Milosevic
and this deal. The Radical Party and its leader, Deputy Prime
Minister Vojislav Seselj, voted against the proposals in
parliament, and Seselj vowed to quit the government the day NATO
troops enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The former president of Yugoslavia, the nationalist historian
Dobrica Cosic, called the vote ``an extorted decision,'' and the
proposals ``a post-modernist packaging for the occupation of
Kosovo.'' In an interview, Cosic, whose views on Kosovo carry much
weight here, called the parliament's acceptance ``a matter of
survival, and not a matter of freedom and rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no immediate political threat to Milosevic. The
weak democratic opposition parties supported the move toward peace,
and Vuk Draskovic, who was fired as Yugoslav deputy prime minister
during the war, praised the vote and said he would be willing to
rejoin the government, especially if Seselj quits.
</P>
<P>
   Some confusion remains over who will lead the international
force and over its exact makeup. The Russians are still insisting
that their forces going to Kosovo will not be under NATO command,
and have not yet agreed to send troops. The agreement accepted by
Milosevic says the forces will be under the auspices of the United
Nations, but European and American officials say the troops will in
fact be commanded by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it immediately clear when a military-to-military text
would be negotiated, or when the agreement would be codified into a
U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the deal may finally bring some peace, if not
reconciliation, to Kosovo. A year ago, the province contained some
2.2 million people, about 90 percent of them ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kosovo is eerily depopulated, with nearly 1 million
Albanians now living abroad as refugees and with several hundred
thousand more displaced from their homes. As many as 5,000 ethnic
Albanians, NATO has alleged, have been murdered by the Serbs.
Thousands of Serb women and children have also fled the province,
and it is likely that many Serbs will not want to remain in Kosovo
once their army and police have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With many thousands of ethnic Albanians shops and homes burned
and looted, and basic services like transport, roads, bridges,
electricity and water supplies destroyed or heavily damaged by the
air war, the job of reconstructing Kosovo will also be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   And it is likely that foreign troops and aid workers will occupy
the province for many years, at a cost of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following talks Thursday morning between Milosevic and the
diplomatic team of Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, who represented the European Union but articulated
NATO's views, the state news agency Tanjug said simply:
``Yugoslavia accepts the document for peace brought by the highest
representatives of the European Union and Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued: ``The three sides unanimously agreed
that commitment to peace was of vital importance, not only for
Yugoslavia, but for the whole region and all of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday morning, the Serbian parliament had accepted
the proposals after party leaders had been briefed by Milosevic the
night before. The parliament voted 136 for and 74 against, with
three abstentions and one no vote. Presumably, the 74 against
included most of Seselj's 80 deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Seselj was blunt. ``For sure, we will not stay in the
Serbian government from the moment that troops from aggressor
countries, particularly the USA, enter Kosovo,'' he said. And he
warned that NATO troops ``will not feel safe in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But Draskovic was ebullient, calling the vote ``a great day for
the Serbian nation and all the citizens of Yugoslavia.'' He said:
``The Serbian parliament today declared peace, and the beginning of
peace must be the beginning of a new policy of radical economic and
democratic reform.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Serbian state television did not mention Seselj's opposition or
quote him at all, but it did give Draskovic time to praise
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There was no statement from Milosevic himself. But the anchorman
recited a long statement from Milosevic's Socialist Party praising
the Serbian nation and the international guarantees of Yugoslavia's
``integrity and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision brings us the cessation of the criminal bombing,
of the killing of the people and it brings us peace,'' the
statement said. ``The role of the United Nations is being affirmed
in accordance with the U.N. charter. Through the unity of the
people and through the heroism of our army and our police, we have
defended the country from a vastly superior enemy who committed
aggression against our country with the goal of annulling our
integrity and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There was also a statement from the Yugoslav United Left Party
of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic. ``We are proud of the heroic
resistance of our people,'' the statement said, ``and in these
circumstances we feel we can accept conditions'' laid down by the
world. ``We are looking for the end of the bombing, and the great
renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many Serbs share that optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Jovan Djordjevic, a 42-year-old postman, spoke for many when he
said: ``If Milosevic wants to accept this plan, he should have done
it before the bombing. How can he explain the dead now? How many
dead are enough for him?''

 Tech Millionaires Face the Rest of Their Lives  &HT;     By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
When Greg Gianforte sold the software company he founded to McAfee
Associates for $10 million five years ago, he faced an unsettling
question: Was he ready to retire at an age when most people have
barely gotten their careers on track?
<P>
   ``At 33 years old, I didn't have to work anymore,'' said
Gianforte, who was founder and chief executive of a New Jersey firm
called Brightwork &UR;  &LR; Development. ``I had to search through: What am
I going to do for the rest of my life? I wasn't ready to fly-fish
for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Reaping the riches of the Internet boom, a growing number of
30- to 50-year-old technology professionals today are facing
choices like Gianforte's.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They've helped turn living-room startups into billion-dollar
companies. They've amassed enough wealth to retire without a worry.
But they're rarely ready for golf-and-travel retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Many plunge right in to the next startup without a second
thought. Some move smoothly to new lives as private venture
investors, full-time parents or volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be hard for other folks to work up much sympathy
for them, people who cash out early can face some deeply unsettling
questions: What do they really want out of life? Who are they if
they don't have a business card and a new venture in the works?
Will they ever be able to match their past success? How much money
is ``enough'' in today's turbo-charged tech economy?
</P>
<P>
   ``People find themselves with a set of issues that no one told
them about,'' said Rick Eigenbrod, who opened the Silicon Valley
office of Right Management Consultants and who has counseled a
number of newly wealthy tech professionals. ``There's no set of
instruction booklets saying what it means to `live happily ever
after.' And it's the undiscussable: It's considered unseemly or
ungrateful to talk about the problems that come with success.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, newly minted tech millionaires amount to only
a minuscule fraction of the American population.
</P>
<P>
   But the ranks of the super-rich are growing: The number of
households worth $10 million or more rose from 190,000 in 1995 to
275,000 in 1998, according to New York University economist Edward
Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   And a fair number of such households _ at least in Silicon
Valley _ are headed by people well under 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who are 24 or 25 years old and are now
millionaires,'' said one woman who works at Yahoo. ``People are
seeing the four-year mark come (when their options are fully
vested) and scratching their heads and saying, ``What next?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; How Much is Enough? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just how much is enough to retire in Silicon Valley these days?
</P>
<P>
   There's no simple answer. As people's income rises, so does
their spending. So while most Americans would be happy with a nest
egg of $100,000, many Silicon Valley professionals can't imagine
retiring without $6 million, $10 million or even $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 21, I probably thought that $1.5 million was enough
to walk away,'' said Gene Raphaelian, 40, who recently left the
Gartner Group with several million dollars but plans to continue
working until he can amass about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I had kids and a mortgage in Saratoga,'' Raphaelian
continued. ``The consensus among my friends, who are people making
$150,000 to $200,000, is that you need $6 or $7 million free and
clear to be at a point where you can weather any economic
downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Opting Out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once they've reached their own personal ``magic number,'' some
young tech professionals do in fact retire from the five-day work
week.
</P>
<P>
   Deepak Puri was the 68th employee at Netscape. Last winter, his
final stock options vested and he dramatically changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   Puri, 41, now spends two and a half days each week with his
4-year-old daughter, a day and a half working as a consultant and a
day volunteering for groups like Juma Ventures, a San Francisco
nonprofit that helps low-income teens get work experience.
</P>
<P>
   Puri's friends urge him to join another startup. He gets raised
eyebrows when people ask him what he's doing and he answers,
``Taking it easy.'' But he doesn't regret his change.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends say, `This is the golden age to make money
on the Internet,''' Puri said. ``Eighty percent of them joined
other startups. But I use the analogy of a buffet: All this food is
out there, but at some point you have to say, `My stomach's full.'
You don't continue to nibble.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Back in the Fray
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech millionaires leave one venture to start another,
part of a group known as ``serial entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kirsch amassed about $30 million as CEO of Frame
Technology. But after selling the firm in 1995, he jumped back in
the fray as founder and CEO of Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still working like a dog because I enjoy it and I can make
a difference,'' Kirsch said. ``It's not the money. It's what you're
doing and whether you're contributing in a positive way. I never
made a calculation, `Can I retire?' I'd just get bored if I quit my
day job.''
</P>
<P>
   On a similar but less grand scale, Kurt Brown sold one small
software startup and quickly founded a new one called Eletter,
which uses the Internet to speed up mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 38, didn't need more money. But he craved the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a roller coaster,'' Brown said. ``The first time
through you get sick and say, `What am I doing?' Then you get off,
a little woozy, and you need some time to let your lunch settle.
But then you just want to get back on the roller coaster again _ a
bigger one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger`` is a key point. Brown and his co-founder Manish Mehta
refused to consider new ventures that didn't have the potential to
be bigger by a ``factor of 10'' than their previous one.
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley veterans think that too much financial
success, too fast, has inflated people's egos and career
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newly rich are not entrepreneurs, but engineers or
managers of average talents who lucked into the right company at
the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their sense of personal value is inflated,'' said Valerie
Frederickson, an outplacement consultant who works with many tech
firms. ``I've had job candidates say to me, `I'm ready to become a
CEO.' When I mention that to their former company, people at the
company are appalled _ they don't view the person at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Angels
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of tech millionaires stop daily work but become
angel investors _ private venture capitalists who provide seed
money to new companies in return for an ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Clark, the serial entrepreneur behind Silicon Graphics,
Netscape Communications, Healtheon and most recently MyCFO, is
skeptical of the talents of many young tech retirees, especially
those who were employees rather than founders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't entrepreneurs or people who drove the business,''
said Clark, who himself is worth well over $500 million. ``They
just came along and had some luck. Now they seem to think of
themselves as angel investors, but they don't have the drive or
skill set to be a venture capitalist. They hope to get lucky, so
they put $50,000 or $100,000 into these little schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   At its worst, sudden wealth may end up undermining the drive and
creativity of part of a generation in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Clark recalls describing plans for a new business
to a group that included both wealthy former Netscape employees as
well as younger people without money.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The ones who made $10 million were a little cocky, almost
blase, saying, `I'm not sure that is worth my time,''' Clark said.
``While the younger guys were enthusiastic, eager, ready to jump
in. It was a really interesting, stark contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, however, sudden wealth may liberate people to do
work that is more creative, risky or meaningful than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get lured to do something quite interesting because
they don't need to take a `safe' job,'' said John Wilson, an
executive recruiter with Korn Ferry International.
</P>
<P>
   New wealth sometimes can give more meaning and focus to a
longtime job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, the money made me a better employee,'' said one
woman who amassed $6 million from stock options while at 3Com.
``Because every day, I was there by choice. You can't be a victim;
you're there because you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greg Gianforte's case, he decided to start a new company
after he sold his old one to McAfee, which since has become Network
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he had the financial ability to write his own
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Gianforte moved to Montana, fulfilling a longtime dream he
shared with his wife. He no longer does much business travel, and
he's home with his kids by 5:30 or 6 p.m. And his focus now isn't
so much on making money as as on creating jobs _ both through his
own small firm, Right Now Technologies, and by helping bring
business to Bozeman.
</P>
<P>
   That, for him, is much closer to the good life than
seven-day-a-week fly-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are given certain skills, and if you don't use them
effectively, you are being irresponsible,'' Gianforte said. ``I
concluded that I know how to start and grow software companies. The
worthwhile thing I could do was create livelihoods for people.''

TOWER REPORTEDLY RELAYED UPDATED WEATHER CONDITIONS TO AMERICAN
AIRLINES CREW

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ American Airlines Flight 1420 was radioed
frequent weather updates before it crashed on landing but was
unaware that an intense storm was approaching the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew would not have known there was a level six, (the most
powerful of rain storms) we know that now because we analyzed the
data. They would have known there was a thunderstorm or an intense
storm, but not necessarily a level six,'' said George Black Jr., a
member of the National Transportation Safety Board investigating
the aircraft's crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Super MD-80, carrying 145 people from Dallas attempted to
land at Little Rock National Airport late Tuesday. It shot past the
end of the runway in gusting winds and heavy rain, hit a light
standard and caught fire, killing eight passengers and the pilot
and injuring 83.
</P>
<P>
   Black declined to speculate whether the crew should have
attempted the landing in heavy weather. He said wind gusts up to 39
mph per hour were reported when the accident occurred, but that the
brunt of the intense storm did not hit the runway until five or six
minutes after the accident, when wind gusts reportedly reached 87
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Now little used by weather officials, the 1-6 scale of
categorizing thunderstorms referred to by Black was a general
designation of a storm's potential power and ability to generate
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The weather updates to the pilots came from the airport control
tower, sometimes as frequently as every 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of conveying this information, by all means,
is for the flight crew to make the decision on whether they want to
try to shoot the approach or not and that is purely their
discretion,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the flight crew makes that decision
based on the information that they get from the ground plus what
they see on their own radar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard Buschmann, was an experienced flier
with American Airlines who served as a pilot chief, flying only
about two months of the year on regular routes to maintain
proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, originating from Dallas/Fort Worth International
Airport, was delayed by more than two hours by inclement weather
and became the last commercial aircraft of the evening to approach
Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, the first fatal crash of a domestic flight in the
United States in 1 1/2 years, has raised questions about the
decision to land in intense weather and about the condition of the
flight crew, which had been on duty 13 1/2 hours, a half hour short
of the maximum a crew is expected to work in a day.
</P>
<P>
   James Burnett, a former NTSB chairman, said the crew was bound
to follow thunderstorm avoidance procedures, which stipulate
landing attempts should be avoided whenever a severe thunderstorm
is within three miles of the runway after the aircraft has
descended under 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know whether the three-mile guideline was violated or
not because we do not know yet how close the thunderstorm was at
the time the initial decision to land was made,'' said Burnett, a
Little Rock native.
</P>
<P>
   He said any attempts to land as a major storm moves into an
airport can be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a pilot attempts to race a thunderstorm to the airport,
that's like attempting to race a locomotive to a crossing,'' he
said. ``You're fine if you beat it, but if you tie, you're in
trouble and in this case they tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have heard a portion of the radio traffic between
the flight crew and the tower taken from the cockpit voice recorder
and hope to interview Buschmann's co-pilot, Michael Origel, on
Friday. Origel, who suffered a broken leg, was questioned briefly
Wednesday, but he was still under medication.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Feith, NTSB accident investigator-in-charge at the scene,
said investigators also were trying to determine which pilot
attempted the landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now one of the first priorities of the (cockpit voice
recorder) group is to actually confirm who was flying the aircraft
and who was not flying, who was radioing communications. The
presumption right now is that it was the first officer doing the
two-way communications with the tower. At this point right now we
can't confirm that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever was handling the radio traffic, he said, he was
receiving updates as frequently as every 20 seconds to 30 seconds
on changing wind direction and velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the tower continued transmitting updates, even after
the accident, apparently unaware the aircraft had crashed.
</P>
<P>
   He said a doppler radar site located about seven miles northwest
of the airport showed the level six storm approaching the airport.
Though the radar site was not state-of-the-art, he said it
sufficiently diagrammed the storm. He said those diagrams will be
enhanced for further analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorm was traveling from the northwest to the
southeast and remained away from the runway during the aircraft's
approach from the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The flight crew) was given a regular interval sequence of
weather updates namely winds and wind directions by the controller
and these were available to the crew to help in their
decisionmaking about their flight and their approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What the crew did not know, however, was the storm's level of
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10-year tenure as NTSB board member and chairman,
Burnett said, guidelines were developed to offset the problems of
aircrafts taking off and landing in thunderstorms From 1970 to
1985, the NTSB was investigating wind shear incidents every year
involving pilots flying in thunderstorm conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the 1985 Delta accident, guidelines were developed on
wind shear avoidance because there were people in the aviation
industry who thought that if you flew in the southeastern United
States you had to take off and land into thunderstorms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Black said families and survivors will be allowed to return to
the crash site today to retrieve personal items and luggage. Crews
will begin removing the wreckage today to a storage area for
further analysis.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 investigators working in various groups in Washington
and Little Rock have begun the tedious process of documenting data
from the crash site and survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, investigators have determined that skid marks show the
aircraft landed about 2,000 feet from the approach end of the
7,200-foot runway, indicating a normal touchdown. Commercial
airplanes normally land about a third of the way down a runway.
</P>
<P>
   He said skid marks show the airplane drifted gradually to the
right and then turned to the left before running off the runway.

 WORKWAYS/ILANA DEBARE  &HT;     Hiring Is A Hairy Situation 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: Can a company reject someone for an executive-level position
because they have a beard and the company feels beards are ``not
appropriate for our image''?
<P>
   A: Let's assume you're talking about a neat and trim beard, not
the Charles Manson model. And let's assume the job in question
isn't CEO of a company that sells razors.
</P>
<P>
   Then this kind of hiring criterion falls in the ``legal but
dumb'' category of corporate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Why legal? Because companies have the right to hire whomever
they want for whatever reason they want, as long as they're not
discriminating on the basis of one of the categories protected by
civil rights law. Those categories include gender, race, religion,
national origin, age, disability, and in some states like
California, sexual orientation _ but they don't include appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time that a company couldn't require employees to be
clean-shaven would be if they had a beard for religious reasons or
because of a skin condition that prevented shaving,'' said Denise
DeRose, an employment lawyer with Crosby Heafey Roach &AMP; May in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the policy you're describing dumb? If it's not obvious,
let me drop a few names.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. Men's Wearhouse CEO George Zimmer.
Adobe Systems executives Chuck Geschke and John Warnock. Wells
Fargo Chief Financial Officer Rodney Jacobs. Former Symantec &UR;  &LR; CEO
Gordon Eubanks. National Semiconductor CEO Brian Halla. Some dude
named George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   They all run world-class companies. They've all sported beards
during their executive tenure. And while their firms may have had
ups and downs, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who would
suggest it was because of their facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm a 54-year-old Denver resident and a wife, mother of five
children, and grandmother of eight. I'd like to find work doing
exactly what I have been doing over the years _ lifestyle
orchestration for a mature individual. This job would involve
managing his or her residences, directing the household staff, and
assisting in this person's social responsibilities. I have formerly
been an administrative assistant to a U.S. senator as well as a
flight attendant, tour director, model, Realtor and concierge. I
have been a wife/partner to two professional husbands who have
required business entertainment in our homes, so I know how to do
it. What is your suggestion on to connect with the appropriate
person? The type of person I hope to assist is not the type, I
believe, that would hire me from a classified ad.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are definitely people out there doing what you want to
do, which typically goes by the title of personal assistant,
household manager or personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to find such folks in big financial centers like New
York and Los Angeles. Some cities have firms that place such
people, like Private Secretaries Agency Inc. in San Francisco. In
L.A., they've even organized themselves in a group called the
Association of Celebrity Personal Assistants at (310) 322-4495.
</P>
<P>
   There's an institute in your own backyard that trains and places
household managers all over the country _ the Starkey International
Institute in Denver. Starkey offers two-month courses for $6,300
that cover topics like how to behave in a wealthy household and how
to set boundaries between yourself and your client. It then helps
its grads find jobs, which typically pay $35,000 to $50,000 plus
housing.
</P>
<P>
   With your extensive experience you may feel like you don't need
to spend that much money on formal training. But you wouldn't
necessarily feel out of place in their program: More than 80
percent of its students have college degrees, and their average age
is 44.
</P>
<P>
   Can't stomach the idea of returning to school for something
you've been doing for the past 20 years? It couldn't hurt to place
ads in small neighborhood newspapers that cater to well-heeled
communities.
</P>
<P>
   But basically, you'll need to network, network and network. Get
to know local corporate leaders through your Chamber of Commerce.
Meet the top human resource folks at big local companies: Their
executives may be looking for someone like you.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like you already know a fair number of wealthy people.
Ask all of them if they know someone who could use your services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'd phrase it is that you're about to enter a new
phase in your life,'' said Oakland career counselor Marty Nemko.
``Tell them you've been the (famed Washington hostess) Perle (CQ) &LR; 
 &LR; Mesta of your own domicile and it seems a shame to toss out 30
years of experience. Tell them you're looking to offer your talents
to someone else who needs a director of operations.''

 _ SF CHRON   Judge Nixes GTE's Plan to Grab 4 Parking Spots at SFO 
 &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a case that pits for-profit utilities against local governments,
a Superior Court judge has shot down GTE Wireless' attempt to take
control of four parking spots at the San Francisco International
Airport.
<P>
   In a ruling yesterday, San Mateo County Superior Court Judge
Phrasel Shelton rejected GTE's claim that it could assume control
of the parking spots under a 1930s state law.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could have a wide-ranging effect because it may
prevent other wireless carriers from annexing public property for
private use.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne called the ruling a
``crucial decision'' for local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone company wanted the parking spots _ which are
public property _ to house equipment that GTE needs to offer
wireless phone service near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   GTE argued it could take the spots using a 1930s state law,
which gave utilities, including phone companies, the ``power of
eminent domain.'' That power allowed utilities to assume control of
public or private land in order to lay infrastructure needed for
telephone or electric service.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco argued that the law was never intended to be
used by competitive wireless carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the law was written at a time when there was just one
phone company, which was highly regulated, and getting telephone
service to people was viewed as a public necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eminent domain statute was intended to allow the old Ma
Bell to provide a public service, not to allow a potentially
unlimited number of companies to take whatever public property they
think they need in order to compete with each other,'' said Deputy
City Attorney Andrew Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   While the judge's ruling doesn't set a legal precedent for any
company other than GTE, Schwartz said other carriers may be less
likely to try to use eminent domain given yesterday's order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's victory here is not going to go unnoticed in the
industry,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   GTE officials said they were disappointed with the ruling and
said the company might appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had a very well-established eminent domain law that
we applied to this,'' said Annette Jacobs, GTE area president of
California. ``There were several facts that the city presented that
we dispute and we are going to consider all the options that are
available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said the ruling will not disrupt the carrier's wireless
service at the airport.

 Roche Swallows Genentech  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Relief and hope were in the air at Genentech Inc. yesterday as
employees mulled the news that their biotech firm will be acquired
then partially spun off by the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche.
<P>
   Roche, which already owns two-thirds of Genentech, said late
Wednesday that it would exercise its option under a 1995 agreement
to buy the rest of Genentech for $4 below Wednesday's closing price
of $86.50 a share, or about $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 Genentech employees crowded into a warehouse at the
company's South San Francisco headquarters yesterday as chief
executive Art Levinson explained Roche's promise to resell up to 19
percent of Genentech in an IPO _ letting the biotech firm keep its
name, some independence and its stock option incentive plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have been subsumed, but now we can all rest much
easier,'' Levinson said, promising no layoffs or management
changes. ``We are going to chart our own course for future
success.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Joining Levinson on a stage festooned with balloons was Herb
Boyer, the silver-haired scientist who launched the entire biotech
industry when he co-founded Genentech in 1976. The warehouse
cheered when Boyer, who has been on Genentech's board for 23 years,
said Roche had asked him to serve on the new, six-person board that
will run Genentech after the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer alluded to the tough negotiations that led up to the
current plan, which lies somewhere between what Genentech had
wanted _ which was for Roche to let its option lapse and do nothing
_ and a full acquisition as a Roche subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board pounded into their heads how valuable it would be to
maintain the independence of Genentech,'' Boyer said, adding, ``I
will try to maintain the culture of Genentech, of which I am so
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said he could understand if outside observers took a
wait-and-see attitude about how much independence Genentech really
would maintain once Roche completes its acquisition and replaces
the current board with new directors. Roche has named two
representatives to the new board. Levin and Boyer hold two other
seats, with two yet to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said this quasi-independent status is the best that
Genentech could have hoped for given the two agreements, negotiated
in 1990 and 1995, that gave Roche until June 30, 1999, to buy
Genentech at a set price no higher than $82.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the other end of the spectrum, you had the very possible
scenario of Roche buying the rest of Genentech and assimilating
them,'' said Joel Sendek, with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meirav Chovav, with Salomon Smith Barney in New York, said Roche
and Genentech both win something from the compromise. Roche gets
Genentech at a below-market price, with the option of making a
profit on the sale of IPO shares. And Genentech presumably keeps
enough identity and control to keep its top talent from walking to
startups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roche gets to eat its cake and have it, too,'' Chovav said.
``And the likelihood is if they manage it the right way, Genentech
will generally remain intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The big losers, Chovav said, clearly are the current
shareholders, who had bid Genentech shares above the $82.50 call
price on the bet that Roche would let the June 30 deadline lapse
without exercising its below-market option. Chovav said in addition
to losing the $4 per share, institutional investors would get stung
with huge capital-gains taxes because many had held Genentech
shares for years and bought the company in the $30s or $40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current holders are not happy,'' Chovav said. ``The first
several clients I spoke with in the morning were angry. By
afternoon, they were more resigned to their fate.''
</P>
<P>
   The fates of Roche and Genentech have been intertwined since
February 1990, when the Swiss pharmaceutical-maker bought a 60
percent stake in the biotech firm for $2.1 billion. At the time,
Genentech shares hovered under $30. During the years, Roche
gradually increased its stake and negotiated a larger say in
Genentech's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Genentech ousted former chief executive Kirk Raab and
replaced him with Levinson, after Raab asked Roche to guarantee a
$2 million personal loan. Under Levinson's leadership, Genentech
steadily has increased its products and revenues. Levinson won
approvals for key cancer-fighting drugs and doubled the company's
share price, which was in the $40 range when he took over.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Genentech's strong performance gave it extra
bargaining clout. Levinson said the deal was ironed out in
transatlantic phone calls in the 36 hours leading up to the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Haefeli, a Roche spokesman, said one of the reasons his
firm will put 19 percent of Genentech on the stock market is so
Genentech employees can keep the stock options that they've come to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think their culture is driving their success, and an
integral part of that is their incentive program,'' Haefeli said.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and Genentech said it was only a coincidence that their
deal was announced just hours after a San Francisco federal jury
deadlocked on a patent trial against the biotech giant brought by
the University of California. UC had sought as much as $1.2 billion
in damages, alleging that Genentech infringed on a UC patent for
human growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Charles Engelberg, with AmeriCal Securities in San
Francisco, thinks Roche deliberately waited until after Genentech
had won this round in the case. He noted that the U.S. Justice
Department recently fined Roche $500 million _ a record punitive
damage _ for price-fixing in the vitamin market, and European
regulators have opened their own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would Roche buy a potential $1.2 billion liability?''
Engelberg asked.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts could only speculate on the possible price of a
Genentech IPO. A $100-per-share figure has been kicked around, but
Chovav, at Smith Barney, observes that a price that high would only
permit Roche to issue some 13 million shares _ too small a float to
interest institutional investors who like to see 30 million shares
of an issue so they can move in and out of a stock without causing
ripples.
</P>
<P>
   At Genentech headquarters, some employees expressed a
willingness to roll their current options over to the new IPO. Paul
Boles, James Owens and Martin Gaffney, maintenance men on
Genentech's drug assembly line, sipped champagne after Levinson's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to let it roll,'' Boles said, adding, ``I believe in
Art (Levinson).''

CLINTON TO RENEW CHINA'S `MOST FAVORED' TRADE STATUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton notified Congress on Thursday
that he intends to renew China's ``most favored nation'' trade
status, despite suspicions that China stole top-secret nuclear
weapons data and satellite information from U.S. research
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to congressional leaders, Clinton sought to separate
economic and trade issues from the continuing debate on Capitol
Hill over Beijing's human rights abuses and a congressional report
released last week accusing China of pilfering information that can
be used to enhance its missile and weapons development programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that keeping the trade relationship strong would
not only help promote the economic well-being of both nation's
peoples, but also would make it easier for the United States to
register its strong objections and concerns about the other issues
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursue engagement with our eyes wide open, without
illusions,'' Clinton said. ``A policy of disengagement and
confrontation would only strengthen those in China who oppose
greater openness and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that trade would ``remain a force for social change
in China'' and could lead to the creation of a democratic
government there over time.
</P>
<P>
   The president's letter was sent to congressional leaders on the
eve of the 10th anniversary of the violent Tiananmen Square
crackdown on student protesters by the Chinese military. Clinton
referred to the demonstration as a courageous show of determination
by the Chinese people to change their government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to speak and work strongly for human rights in
China. A continued policy of principled, purposeful engagement
reinforces these efforts to move China toward greater openness and
broader freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will have 90 days to consider Clinton's recommendation
that China's MFN status be renewed for another year before it takes
effect automatically. But lawmakers are expected _ after an intense
debate that's expected to be more angry and contentious than in
past years _ to go along with the annual renewal, which last year
accounted for $14.3 billion in U.S. exports to China and nearly $72
billion in imports from the Asian giant.
</P>
<P>
   The special trade status would continue to give China the same
kind of low-tariff access to American markets that most countries
already have. The MFN designation must be renewed each year by law,
however, because China is not governed by freely elected leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans and Democrats are expected to raise serious
objections to renewing MFN, but congressional leaders in both
parties plan to support Clinton's call for another one-year
extension, including Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., one of the
authors of the report essentially charging China with stealing U.S.
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Cox and other Republicans believe that to deny China the normal
trade status held by nearly every other country with the United
States will further strain relations already hurt by charges of
spying and the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia by NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we treat China like an enemy she surely will become one,''
Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., told Reuters News Service. ``There are
a number of my colleagues who realize what a mistake that would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Dreier said, ``that doesn't mean we shouldn't be as
vigilant as we could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will have the support of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential front-runner, who came out Thursday in
favor of renewing China's MFN status. Bush spokesman David Beckwith
said the governor agrees with Clinton that the United States must
work constructively with China by expanding trade.

50,000 ALLIED TROOPS TO ENTER KOSOVO AS YUGOSLAV FORCES WITHDRAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS with CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first of nearly 50,000 NATO troops will begin
moving into Kosovo within days of a final agreement, taking over
the ravaged province as Yugoslavia's army, police and paramilitary
forces withdraw in stages over seven days, American and European
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's peacekeeping force, known as KFOR, will ultimately occupy
the entire province, as well as a three-mile buffer zone inside
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, according to a senior
defense official here.
</P>
<P>
   The force will be under the auspices of the United Nations, but
the troops will remain under NATO's command, according to officials
here and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force, nearly the size of the one that entered
a much larger Bosnia in 1995, will divide the province into five
sectors, each overseen by one of NATO's five largest members: the
United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though American and NATO officials long predicted the air
war would prevail, President Slobodan Milosevic's abrupt acceptance
of NATO's terms caught the alliance and the Pentagon by surprise,
leaving officials scrambling to prepare for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details of the peacekeeping force are still
unformed; alliance diplomats met only two days ago to begin
discussing the exact size and shape of their countries'
contributions of troops and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of NATO's 19 members have pledged some troops, including
the United States, which has offered 7,000. The force is also
expected to include soldiers from other nations, among them Jordan
and the United Arab Emirates, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO still hopes that Russia will agree to participate,
contributing a contingent of soldiers that would operate within one
of the NATO sectors. A senior American defense official said that
the Russians would operate within the American sector, as is the
case in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, said Russia had
still not agreed to contribute troops, though an alliance official
said it had acceded to NATO command of the force.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and here in Washington, alliance officials responded
cautiously to Milosevic's sudden reversal. Wary of halting the
bombing before nailing down details of an agreement, they said
NATO's warplanes would continue to strike in Yugoslavia until there
was clear evidence that the army and police units were pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, not a single Serb soldier has withdrawn from
Kosovo,'' Secretary of Defense William Cohen said at the Pentagon
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's strikes continued Thursday and into Thursday night,
though officials said the attacks would be less intense as long as
Milosevic's government appeared to be sincerely moving toward a
final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cohen said that he expected a military delegation from
NATO to meet with Yugoslav army leaders within a few days to work
out the details of what will amount to NATO's occupation of Kosovo.
That delegation is expected to be led by the British officer, Lt.
Gen. Michael Jackson, who will also serve as field commander of the
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, an allied official said that the delegations would
meet somewhere in Europe and hammer out a specific timetable and
plan for withdrawals, even designating evacuation routes for
individual army and police units.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to withdrawal of troops within seven days, NATO's
terms also call for the removal of Serb anti-aircraft defenses
within 15 miles of Kosovo within 48 hours of an agreement so that
allied reconnaissance aircraft can safely verify when Serb troops
begin to move out, according to a written agreement of terms
Yugoslavia accepted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO will actually stop bombing is a delicate question of
timing. President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, the mediator who
returned to Germany from Belgrade Thursday to report that
Milosevic's government had agreed to NATO's terms, said that NATO
could order a pause in the bombing once it had verified the Serbs'
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, if there was an agreement tomorrow, it would be in
days, and only a very few days that I understand a suspension in
bombing, in other words a pause in the bombing, could take place,''
he said. ``I'm not in a position to say one, two, or three days.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NATO has nearly doubled the size of the peacekeeping force it
had planned to send before the bombing began because of the extent
of damage within Kosovo, including the destruction of entire
villages by the Serbs and NATO's systematic destruction of roads,
bridges and other installations over the last two and a half
months.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has pledged more than 17,000 soldiers, nearly a third of
the total, and will control a central sector that includes Kosovo's
provincial capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The American force of 7,000 is expected to include three heavy
armored divisions and a fourth lighter infantry division from the
1st Infantry Division in Germany, known as the Big Red One. The
American contingent will also include helicopters and other support
units, which could be culled from the 5,000 soldiers already sent
to Albania with Apache helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   The first American troops, though, could be Marines. The 26th
Marine Expeditionary Unit, with 2,200 personnel already nearby,
could establish the American presence immediately and then
gradually turn over the mission to the Army units.
</P>
<P>
   The American sector, the officials said, will be in the
southeastern part of Kosovo. The French, Germans and Italians will
control sectors on the western side.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting NATO command over the sectors was a significant
concession for Milosevic, who had long insisted that he would not
allow NATO countries to participate in any peacekeeping force. It
was also a concession by Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO official said that one Russian proposal in the
negotiations was to create separate occupation zones inside Kosovo.
Under that proposal, which was rejected, Russians would have
occupied Kosovo's north, near Serbia and most thickly populated
with ethnic Serbs and Serbian landmarks, while American, French,
and British forces would have been limited to the areas near
borders with Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no exclusion zones where only Russians could
tread, or anything like that,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's European members insist that any peacekeeping mission in
Kosovo should be mandated by the United Nations, with a civilian
administrator overseeing the reconstruction of the province and the
resettlement of the refugees, the same as the mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, France, Italy,
Germany, Russia, Japan and Canada have begun discussions to draft a
Security Council resolution authorizing the force and a temporary
Kosovo administration. They hope the countries' leaders will
approve it at a meeting in Cologne, Germany, beginning June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers and international authorities, not Serb officials,
would take over administration of Kosovo and would control
decisions concerning the refugees' return, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the military force, however, NATO's spokesman,
Jamie P. Shea, said NATO's control was clear. ``We are talking
about a single force with a single chain of command and a single
set of rules of engagement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At some point after the peacekeepers move in, the allies agreed
to allow ``a few hundred'' Serbian troops to return to the province
under international administration to symbolize continued Serb
sovereignty. But officials said that exactly how many Serb officers
could return, where they would go, and when they could come back
had not been decided.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of fighting between the Serbs and the
rebels and weeks of bombing, the peacekeepers will face daunting
obstacles. Not only is there extensive destruction, but mines,
booby traps and, according to reports, wells poisoned by decaying
human corpses or animal carcasses dumped by the Serbs. Peacekeepers
will also have to cope with disarming Kosovar Albanian guerrillas,
as called for in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The senior American defense official said that NATO would, at
first, prevent the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Albania and
Macedonia from returning. He said that such a repatriation would be
impossible until some stability was established.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope to avoid is a tremendous backwash of refugees,''
the official said. ``These people might not be happy in their
camps, but they're under cover. They're being fed. They have
water.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Rate Jitters Keep Slamming Net Stocks  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The threat of higher interest rates has taken a huge toll on
Internet stocks, which continued their slide yesterday. Many,
including Amazon.com and Yahoo, are trading at half their recent
highs.
<P>
   The Dow Jones Internet index has fallen by one-third since April
13, as air continued to leak from the online balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Growth stocks have always been especially sensitive to interest
rate fluctuations, because they trade at high multiples to
earnings. If higher rates hurt corporate earnings, these stocks
have farther to fall than low-P/E stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks, being the most growth-oriented of all, have
been especially hard hit by rate jitters. The recent drops may
deepen if today's unemployment report nudges the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stock charts ``are beginning to look like the
Washington Monument _ thin triangles,'' said David Simons, managing
director at Digital Video Investments, a New York research company.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Jim Marks, an Internet analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York,
said Internet stocks were suffering from oversupply of shares as
more companies went public, seeking to take advantage of Wall
Street's euphoria about the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're nearing a point of some saturation,'' said Internet
analyst Jill Frankle, of International Data Corp. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Some Net companies are postponing their IPOs until the market
settles down and some recent new issues regain their footing.
</P>
<P>
   Companies including TheStreet.com, a financial news service in
New York, and Santa Monica's EToys Inc., an online retailer, have
fallen at least a third from their first day of trading last month.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, high-tech experts had said it would be a
catastrophic event _ such as a huge market drop, a jump in interest
rates or a financial collapse in Japan _ to temper the wide-scale
Internet stock shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Internet stocks have been falling since mid-April,
there was no single event that sparked the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all greed going up and all fear coming down,'' said
William H. Davidow, a partner at Mohr Davidow Ventures in Menlo
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Simons called the mad dash to invest in online stocks a
``perfect blend of video arcade and gambling casino, but where few
lose.'' Until recently, in fact, everyone seemed to be making a
killing in the cyber Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Motro, chief executive of Web portal Infoseek, is taking
the long view. ``It's a volatile sector. It goes up and down and
will probably go back up again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not for the weak of heart. But it's premature to say
the game is over. The market is sorting through a number of new
online IPOs.''

FROM WEATHER WOES TO A DESCENT INTO TERROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN and BETSY BLANEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least four hours before the crash of Flight 1420, the leg to
Little Rock wasn't going as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The American Airlines plane that skidded off the runway late
Tuesday night wasn't supposed to be headed to Arkansas. Plane
``N215AA,'' now crumpled beside the Arkansas River, was pressed
into duty after mechanical problems surfaced on another MD-80
aircraft, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The substitution was routine, but it followed a bad-weather
delay that had already set back air travel out of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday flight from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport to Little
Rock, Ark., was scheduled to depart at 8:28 p.m. A full plane, with
139 passengers and six crew members, didn't leave until 10:40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't worry a lot about it,'' said Wayne McDaniel, who was
returning from a family reunion in New Mexico and had sat through a
two-hour delay in Albuquerque. ``I just went outside and smoked
cigarettes and drank a good cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been through that before.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon, he and dozens of others would be in unfamiliar and
frightening territory. They would be scrambling through cracks in
the fuselage of the wrecked aircraft, ducking to avoid fire and
smoke, and tramping through a violent thunderstorm, battered by
gale-force winds, heavy rain and hail.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said they had no inkling of the terror to come. They
recall that the pilot, about 25 minutes before Little Rock, turned
off the seat belt sign but warned that some turbulence might be
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, the plane was buffeted by the storm and the
seat belt sign was on again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit it a little sooner than expected,'' the pilot said on
the public address system, according to McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had been forming for many hours, and meteorologists
had been tracking it most of the day. George Wilken of the National
Weather Service in Little Rock said a ``typical squall line,''
common in Arkansas during May and June, was spawning thunderstorms
just ahead of a cold front that stretched from Missouri through
Arkansas and into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The same line probably produced the storms that delayed the D/FW
departure of Flight 1420, he said. But the Little Rock storm was
created by a separate cell along that line, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 9:30 p.m., the weather service issued a severe
thunderstorm watch for the area around Little Rock, and a local TV
weatherman began warning about the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The storm line was moving from the northwest toward the
southeast and gaining momentum, Wilken said. At 10:15, a 60-mph
wind gust hit Hot Springs, 45 miles southwest of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:18, Wilken said, the service issued a severe thunderstorm
warning for Pulaski County, which includes Little Rock. The warning
indicated that residents could expect hail up to 3/4-inch in
diameter and wind gusts of at least 58 mph.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines prohibits its MD-80 pilots from landing when
cross-winds top 30 knots, or about 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, wind conditions at the Little Rock airport were
mild, Wilken said, but the storm was moving toward it and
intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:30, wind gusts hit 65 mph at the NWS office 7 miles
northwest of the airport, Wilken said. By 11:45, spotters near the
airport area clocked 75-mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1420 was approaching its destination, and the crew and
passengers appeared to be aware of the growing storm.
</P>
<P>
   Paul MacIntosh, traveling on business from Glendale, Ariz., said
the plane began flying through heavy rain about five minutes
outside of the airport. A few moments later, the rain became
stronger and the drops larger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the lightning picked up, illuminating the standing water on
the soggy ground and giving the area a surreal look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite an electrical show,'' MacIntosh said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were in constant discussions with air traffic
controllers, assessing the weather conditions, crash investigators
said yesterday. As the plane approached the runway, it was headed
from the north. But the pilots decided to take another tack,
passing the airport and returning in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane began landing at 11:50, wind speeds at the
airport were about 34 mph, near the permitted limit, Wilken said.
The surging wind drove the rain even harder, producing about .30 of
an inch of rain in a minute, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the aircraft was approaching from the south, the storms
were approaching at the same time from the northwest,'' Wilken
said. ``They collided at about the worst moment.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel is a truck driver, and he said he knows the
destabilizing effects of wind and water. As soon as the plane
touched down, he thought it was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was out of control,'' he said, adding that he ducked his
head in preparation for a crash.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntosh said the plane bounced and then turned nearly 180
degrees as it slid across the ground and crashed into light banks
used for the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear the wheels scraping on the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Klamm, who was sitting in first class with his son,
Jason, said he was just hoping the plane would stop sliding.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I put my head down and just held on for life,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane hit the light banks, the pilot was killed, the
co-pilot broke his leg, and part of the fuselage was sheared off
behind the cockpit. The plane broke into several pieces, and fire
and thick smoke began to build.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the craft, the storm was surging, and survivors who
climbed from the wreckage were pelted by hail and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes after the crash, wind gusts hit 87 mph at the
airport, the peak recorded during the storm, Wilken said.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntosh climbed out of a hole near the front of the plane and
darted for the marshy ground. He was hospitalized for a deep gash
in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting out of that plane because I was thinking there'd
be an explosion,'' he said. ``I made a dash for the swamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Klamm said he was briefly knocked unconscious, and had to be
roused and led from the plane by his son.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel was smashed in the right shoulder, breaking the bone,
and had to wiggle free from an object that was pinning him to his
seat. As the lightning continued, it illuminated a crack in the
fuselage a few rows away, and he moved in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   He and several people squeezed through the opening and dropped
to the ground. They huddled near bales of hay, seeking shelter from
the pelting hail and rain.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the shock settled in: ``I started getting the shakes
real bad,'' McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   A nearby passenger used his cell phone to call 911, and McDaniel
described their location. It is his voice, he said, that is on the
911 tapes being played on newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes, the rescue mission was under way.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 ambulances arrived on the scene, along with 85
rescue and medical workers. They marked the injured with colored
tags, and in 90 minutes had transported more than 80 people to six
area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel said he didn't stay at the hospital long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't let me smoke there,'' he said, ``and I needed a
smoke.''

LACK OF DOPPLER RADAR LIMITED WEATHER INFORMATION BEFORE CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The pilots of doomed American Airlines
Flight 1420 had been alerted to wind shears but had no way of
knowing the severity of the thunderstorm pounding National Airport
with high winds, blinding rain and hail, a federal investigator
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Without the state-of-the-art Terminal Doppler Weather Radar that
is installed at major airports, not even the air traffic
controllers guiding the pilots knew that the thunderstorm packed
the severe rating of Level 6, said George W. Black Jr., the
National Transportation Safety Board member in charge of the crash
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew could not have known it was a Level 6 storm,'' Black
said. ``We only know that from our analysis of the Doppler weather
radar data after the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather is suspected as a primary factor in Tuesday night's
fiery crash, which killed the captain and eight passengers on the
McDonnell Douglas Super 80 jetliner. At least 82 others were
injured, some critically, but 136 people survived.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which had aborted one landing to make its ill-fated
approach from the opposite direction, slid off the runway, hit a
large steel stanchion supporting runway lights, broke apart and
burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the pilots had been given regular updates on the
deteriorating weather conditions, consisting primarily of wind
speed and direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was changing rapidly,'' Black said. ``There's even
indications the tower controller was providing sort of a
play-by-play wind direction and velocity sequence of radio
transmissions during the approach.''
</P>
<P>
   NTSB chief investigator Greg Feith described the stormy
conditions as .MDSD/.MDNM/''a very dynamic situation with wind
conditions changing every 20 to 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Feith and Black emphasized, however, that the plane's captain,
not the controllers, decided whether to land or divert to another
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers initially cleared the aircraft to land from the
north on Runway 22-Left. Informed of the shifting wind, the pilots
then requested permission to land on the same runway, but from the
south.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft touched down about 2,000 feet down the 7,200-foot
runway but then veered off the concrete, went over an embankment at
the end of the runway, hit a steel support for runway lights and
broke in two, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they have not determined how fast the plane
was going when it touched down, whether it was blown off the runway
by a strong wind gust or whether the tires hydroplaned on the wet
pavement, causing the plane to go out of control, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed at 11:51 p.m., when airport winds were clocked
as high as 35 mph. Within five minutes, the NTSB said, a gust of
more than 80 mph was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Burnett, a former NTSB chairman, said the pilots had enough
information about the tumultuous storm that they never should have
tried to land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to race a thunderstorm to the airport is like trying to
race a locomotive to the railroad crossing,'' said Burnett, who
served as NTSB chairman from 1982 to 1988. He is now a lawyer and
transportation safety consultant in Clinton, Ark. ``Even if you
tie, you're in bad shape. And this airplane tied.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baker, American's executive vice president of operations,
cautioned against speculation blaming the pilot for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, he said, must learn ``exactly what the facts are
regarding the wind velocity and direction ... exactly when that
airplane was making the approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to want to try to figure out exactly what the
(cockpit) crew knew. What did the tower tell them? What did the en
route (air traffic control) center tell them? Did the crew have the
information to make an intelligent decision? And then what were the
actual wind conditions?''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said pilot fatigue could have figured in the decision to
land rather than divert to another airport.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Buschmann, the pilot who was killed, and Michael
Origel,the co-pilot who survived with a broken leg, had been on
duty 13 hours, 20 minutes at the time of the crash. The limit for
American pilots is 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked longer than 14 hours yesterday, but nothing I did
affected the lives and safety of anyone,'' Burnett said. ``With
pilots, the last thing they do at the end of a 14-hour shift is
land an airplane, which is the most difficult part of any flight.
They were called upon to make value judgments as well as to use
their flying skills to bring that airplane down safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 14 hours is just too long for pilots to work.
Eventually something will go wrong, like it did here.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett also said the accident might have been averted if the
airport had the Federal Aviation Administration's Terminal Doppler
Weather Radar, which could have given controllers better
information about the position and intensity of the thunderstorm
approaching the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated radar system has been installed at such major
U.S. airports as Dallas/Fort Worth, Dallas' Love Field and
Houston's George Bush Intercontinental, but smaller airports such
as Little Rock's were not budgeted to get the multimillion-dollar
system.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, who left the NTSB in 1991 while the Terminal Doppler
Weather Radar program was being developed, said he was pressured by
the federal Office of Management and Budget ``not to advocate a lot
of these radar systems'' because of their cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Doppler radar was developed in direct response to the deadly
1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191 at D/FW Airport, which was
attributed to a microburst of wind from a thunderstorm over the
airport as the Lockheed L-1011 tried to land.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure, questioned why the Little Rock
airport does not have the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the system at Little Rock now, this radar could warn
the pilot in advance that dangerous winds were developing,'' he
said. ``There is no reason that airports like Little Rock should be
lacking the latest in weather prediction technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock has a regional Doppler weather radar facility about
seven miles northeast of the airport, but it does not provide the
detailed information about wind shear and microbursts _ highly
localized, high-speed downward blasts of wind _ that an airport
Doppler system is designed to detect, NTSB officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The airport does have a less-sophisticated, low-level wind-shear
alert system with sensors that measure wind speed and direction. A
computer links the sensors and compares their information to give
controllers information about wind shear _ rapid changes in wind
speed and direction that can be deadly to a low-flying aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   That system alerted controllers to wind shear as Flight 1420
approached the airport, and that information was relayed to the
pilots, Black said.

<P>
   This year, U.S. airlines are expected to fill more than 14,000
cockpit seats with new pilots, and one is Michael Origel, the first
officer aboard Flight 1420, which crashed Tuesday night in Little
Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Origel and his peers are hardly fledglings, having already spent
hundreds if not thousands of hours steering tons of aluminum
through the sky. They train in multimillion-dollar flight
simulators, use weather data that didn't exist a decade earlier,
and rely on cockpit technology incorporating the best of today's
computer wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   But their prospective employers also look for something else: Do
they make good decisions?
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash of Flight 1420, which occurred in nasty
weather, remains unknown. But in addition to weather, investigators
are examining many factors, including decisions made by the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines did not return phone calls on thursday seeking
comment on pilot training, and other airlines, along with flight
simulation companies, also declined to comment, citing the Arkansas
crash.
</P>
<P>
   But two pilot training experts say that during the past 20 years
the industry has invested as much on improving pilot judgment and
behavior as it has on improving technology. The issue is
particularly important today, as airlines hire record numbers of
new pilots to replace retirees and staff growing fleets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines interview the most qualified pilots, but they hire
the people they like, who do a good job solving problems,'' said
Kit Darby, a United Air Lines pilot and a principal at Aviation
Information Resources in Atlanta. AIR, as the company is known,
advises military and private pilots who want to work for the
nation's largest airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 U.S. carriers hired 14,123 pilots, a record for the
fourth consecutive year, and are expected to top that in 1999,
Darby said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, those airlines have adopted pilot training
systems that increase collaboration between crew members, the air
traffic control system and any other source of information that
could help pilots make good decisions. The systems go by names such
as human factors and crew resource management.
</P>
<P>
   An example is line-oriented flight training, or LOFT. Using a
flight simulator, a flight crew must deal with equipment failures,
unexpected weather and other crises.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose is to teach the entire crew, including flight
attendants, ``to hone those skills they have been taught dealing
with judgment and decision-making,'' said Tim Forte, flight safety
officer for Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach,
Fla. The school bills itself as the world's largest aviation
training institution, with about 12,000 students worldwide, about
half of them pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The captain who once flew solo through emergencies, relying on
technical skills, is an outdated concept, Forte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a wealth of information out there,'' he said, and the
plane's captain _ who still has the responsibility of the final
decision about what to do _ is expected to use all the resources at
hand to achieve the best result.
</P>
<P>
   Said Darby: ``The fighter pilot, the lone individual that
doesn't work so well when all these other people and resources are
available,'' isn't an airline's first choice.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, some of his clients complain that they were passed
over for someone with lesser technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It mystifies pilots who spend years getting their tickets
punched along the way, getting experience that gets them in the
door,'' Darby said. ``But those things don't get them selected _
and they shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Darby and Forte suggested that the ultimate example of
cooperative crew work is the 1989 crash-landing of a crippled DC-10
in Iowa. With one of three engines out and the plane's hydraulic
controls disabled, a fourth pilot _ who was a passenger on the
flight _ jumped in to help maneuver the plane using the plane's two
remaining engines. The crew also used information from the plane's
builder and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot was receptive, and that saved many lives,'' Darby
said.
</P>
<P>
   That assumes there is time to explore options, Darby said. And
usually there is, he and Forte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's usually a chain of events that lead to an accident,''
Darby said. ``Crew resource management gives you many opportunities
to break that chain.''
</P>
<P>
   An example of the failure to break the chain of error is the
1995 crash of an American Airlines jet near Cali, Colombia. That
accident, which killed 159 of the 163 people aboard, was traced to
a discrepancy between the crew's navigational charts and the
plane's autopilot system that distracted the crew as the plane flew
too low in a mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
   In response, American altered its training to blend the teamwork
approach with renewed emphasis on pilots actively controlling their
aircraft, rather than relying too much on cockpit automation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the federal government also required that pilots be
trained in recovering from unusual events, such as a buildup of ice
on the wings.

 GUYS _ SF CHRON  
 Good Guys' Founder Back To Rescue Firm  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Good Guys is bringing back its founder, Ron Unkefer, in a bid
to reverse its flagging fortunes.
<P>
   Battling competition from Best Buy and Circuit City,
Brisbane-based Good Guys has posted three years of losses amid
stagnant sales in its consumer electronics stores. Shares dropped
to a low of $3 last month, but shot up $1.38 on yesterday's news to
close at $5.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is arguably one of the best moves the board could have
made,'' said David Childe of Morgan Keegan, one of the few
securities analysts who still follows the company.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced, though. ``I'm not betting on him, but
I'm not betting against him,'' said Douglas Gordon, an analyst with
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. ``He's got a big job ahead of
him and there are a number of things that are outside of his
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer founded Good Guys in 1973 as a store in the Marina
District and ran the company for 20 years, taking it public in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   He ceded the chief executive position in 1993 to Bob Gunst, who
has announced his resignation and is now handing the title back to
Unkefer. In 1996 Unkefer resigned the chairman's post, which Gunst
never held. Unkefer will resume the chairmanship upon his return
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a search under way and we had some good candidates, but
Ron very aggressively wanted to come back,'' said Good Guys board
member Howard Lester, who is also chairman of Williams-Sonoma Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the judgment was that there was a big benefit in
bringing in someone who knew the company, who knew the vendor
community and could hit the ground running, versus someone who was
unproven for us,'' Lester said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This turnaround will be the biggest business challenge I've
ever had,'' said Unkefer. ``I didn't want the company to drift for
another couple or three years and wind up in Chapter 11. I also saw
a great business opportunity'' because the stock price is so low.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with his return, Unkefer bought 10 percent of
Good Guys' shares outstanding, or 1.45 million shares, for $4.7
million, and acquired warrants to buy 1.43 million more shares over
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer returns to a competitive consumer electronics
environment dominated by two low-cost national retailers, Circuit
City and Best Buy.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting Best Buy, which is opening stores aggressively on the
West Coast, is one of Good Guys' biggest challenges, said Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   But Childe said there is plenty of room for a more upscale
player like Good Guys. A turnaround ``requires a different
merchandising vision, not a Herculean effort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Good Guys' heyday in the late '80s, it had ``the highest
operating margins, the highest sales per square foot and the
highest return on assets in consumer electronics sector,'' said
Childe. ``It was competitive then, there were just different
players. So there's no reason why Good Guys can't get to those kind
of levels again, in my opinion.``
</P>
<P>
   Unkefer expects to move back to the Bay Area from Dallas, where
he is chairman of First Broadcasting, a company he founded to
develop and resell radio stations. In the early- and mid-1990s, he
owned KYA and KSFO in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years he has funded and run First Ventures, a
venture capital firm that invests in early-stage Silicon Valley
startups.

 AS FAR AS THE SENATE IS CONCERNED, `DR. E-MAIL' IS IN
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   A Cambridge, Mass., company that has devised an artificial
intelligence software package that can read and respond to e-mail
confirmed Thursday that it has a new client _ the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The company is General Interactive Inc., and it was cofounded by
V.A. Shiva, an MIT graduate who bills himself as ``Dr. E-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiva and GII have come up with an automated system that, in
theory, would allow computers, rather than people, to answer many
of the e-mails voters send to their senators.
</P>
<P>
   That could come in handy for the Senate, which a few months ago
was awash in e-mails churned up by the impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This solution will help senators reduce processing time when
tracking and responding to e-mail received from their
constituents,'' said Steve Walker, the Senate's manager of Web and
technology assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the contract were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate contract is quite a coup for Shiva and GII.
</P>
<P>
   Five yars ago, Shiva was running a start-up that helped
Cambridge artists sell their work on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today GII makes a software package called EchoMail that
analyzes, tracks, and responds to e-mail _ in most cases without
requiring a human to read individual e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Among the firms that have hired GII are Nike Inc., AT&AMP;T Corp.,
and IBM Corp. According to Shiva, the same technologies that have
helped another client, Calvin Klein Inc., sell perfume may be an
ideal tool for 21st century democracy.
</P>
<P>
   EchoMail ``is a phenomenal tool for listening to constituents,''
said Shiva, 35, a one-time wunderkind who worked on his first
e-mail system as a New Jersey teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Bored by high school, Shiva became part of a team that devised a
pioneer e-mail system for Rutgers University in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he enrolled in the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where over the years he has studied pattern-recognition
analysis, a key component to EchoMail.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shiva, EchoMail is the digital equivalent of an oil
refinery. At an oil refinery, raw crude is pumped through various
filters that separate it into coal, tar, and petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   EchoMail uses several methodologies, including artificial
intelligence and pattern-recognition, as its filter as it refines a
volume of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing words by their shapes, the system can log, route,
track, understand, and respond to thousands of e-mails. The
software is so semantically sensitive that Shiva boasts it can
detect the attitude of an e-mail's writer.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of impeachment, the system could have categorized
huge volumes of e-mail into voters for and against impeachment;
those strongly pro Clinton and those who detested him; those from a
Senator's state and those who were not; and Democrats vs.
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (All this assumes, of course, that a constituent reveals this
information in the contents of the e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, EchoMail can update e-mail sentiment on a real-time
basis, giving it some of the aspects of an instant opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell you who they are in an e-mail,'' he said. ``So you
can extract valuable data from studying a person's e-mail, and that
can go into a company's marketing data base.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, EchoMail can use that data to compose and send an
e-mail response to the sender of the original e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose a constituent e-mails a Senator to express concern on
such subjects as Medicare and gun control. In theory, EchoMail
could sort through the senator's position papers on those issues,
string together prefabricated paragraphs from its data bank, and
then fuse them into a coherent, seemingly personalized whole that
would be sent as a response.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a human aide in the Senate office would never
read the constituent's e-mail; EchoMail would simply extract all
useful information from the message and log the constituent's
concerns and e-mail address into the Senator's data bank.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having to sift through thousands of messages, a
Senate aide could simply be presented with EchoMail's overview of
what's on the minds of voters.
</P>
<P>
   To a business that receives 60,000 e-mail messages a month, the
potential cost savings can be enormous. According to Shiva, it can
cost a business about $9 to process a consumer inquiry by
telephone. It can cost the same business about $5 to have a person
read a consumer's e-mail and respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   But for a business client using EchoMail, the cost of analyzing
and responding to a consumer's e-mail can drop to under $1, Shiva
claims.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other benefits as well. EchoMail yields more
valuable information for a client's customer data base than a call
center processing a phone call, said Bruce Padmore, GII's chief
technology officer and another MIT graduate.
</P>
<P>
   According to GII, EchoMail processes about 80 percent of a
company's incoming e-mails without human intervention; the
remaining 20 percent is referred to EchoMail's human acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   Shiva offered examples of how EchoMail has worked for his
clients. Nike, for example, was recently the subject of allegations
that it uses sweatshop labor, prompting many people to write angry
e-mails to the Oregon sneaker company.
</P>
<P>
   GII's EchoMail sorted those complaints by attitude _ just hw
mad was the e-mail writer? In many cases, the writer had mixed
feelings: Love the sneakers; hate the labor practices.
</P>
<P>
   To each group, EchoMail could send an e-mail response, thanking
writers for their interest and directing them to a special Web site
created by Nike's public relations team. At the Web site, Nike
sought to refute the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did EchoMail help with damage control, but it also let
Nike send follow-up e-mails a few weeks later, once writers had
cooled off. A follow-up e-mail might alert someone to a new product
or forward a firm's newsletter about women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, GII was part of a team that developed an e-mail soap
opera that was the heart of a marketing campaign for cK one, a
fragrance from Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional ads introduced a plot line and the soap opera's
initial characters. The ads also invited the public to send e-mails
to the characters they identified with. Consumers who responded had
their e-mails answered seemingly by the characters, but, in
reality, it was EchoMail sending the messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get e-mails two days in a row, and then not hear
from them for a week,'' said Calvin Klein publicist Diana Lin.
``It's just like in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Many young consumers resist the hard sell of conventional
advertising but seem more comfortable with revealing information
about themselves in a medium such as e-mail. ``This is about
establishing relationships,'' said Shiva of Calvin Klein's strategy
to cultivate brand loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   GII is hardly alone in promoting e-mail as a marketing tool.
Many big advertisers now recognize that e-mail should be a part of
their Web marketing efforts, said Melissa Bane, director of
Internet marketing strategies for the Yankee Group, a Boston
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Several firms, including GII, have sprung up to serve that need,
and Bane envisions a future period of consolidation when some of
these firms could be acquired by the likes of IBM, Microsoft, or
portal companies such as Lycos or Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   GII makes money in two ways. It sells EchoMail to clients, then
charges them based on the volume of e-mail it processes. A private
company, GII discloses no financial information.
</P>
<P>
   When the company was formed five years ago under a different
name, its initial mission was to help Cambridge artists build Web
sites to sell their work on line.
</P>
<P>
   At its founding, the company brought together Shiva, who was
studying for his doctorate in pattern recognition; Padmore; and Zoe
Helene, a Brandeis University artist who once aspired to be a
Disney animator and is now GII's chief creative officer.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Shiva saw his doctoral studies in pattern recognition
and his interest in Internet marketing converge.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Shiva's change in focus from helping struggling
Cambridge artists to becoming ``Dr. E-Mail'' to Fortune 500
companies _ and now the US Senate _ Helene said, ``At some point,
we needed a way to pay the rent.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After two years spent studying the social and
economic effects of the gambling industry's vast growth, a federal
commission completed its work here Thursday and prepared to deliver
a list of more than 70 recommendations to President Clinton,
Congress, governors and American Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals are a moratorium on gambling expansion, a
ban on college-sports betting and a prohibition against all
wagering on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The nine members of the federal panel, the National Gambling
Impact Study Commission, had to overcome stark differences among
themselves in order to give unanimous approval to a sweeping report
on the state lotteries, casinos, race tracks and other forms of
legal wagering that last year generated revenue of more than $50
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners found that for all the economic benefits, the
boom in wagering had also brought an array of negative
consequences, most significantly a rise in problem gambling. But
they agreed that the gaming industry would remain a fixture on the
American landscape, at least as far as they could see to the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the American people want legalized gambling,
and it has already sunk deep economic and other roots in many
communities,'' says their report, which they are to deliver on June
18. ``Its form and extent may change _ it may even disappear _ but
for the present, it's a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress' creation of the commission in 1996 initially caused
fear in the casino industry that federal regulations and new taxes
would result. But the report calls for no such measures to be
imposed on the major commercial casino operators.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations, however, are a call for states to
impose a pause in gambling expansion, as a way of encouraging local
governments to review closely the effects of gaming businesses on
their communities; a prohibition on all forms of Internet gambling,
because of the Net's little-regulated reach; a curtailing of state
lottery advertising and new lottery games; closer regulation of the
casinos operated on Indian reservations, and a vast array of ways
to finance research and treatment of problem gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also recommended ``tight restrictions'' on
political contributions from casino companies, whose ability to
prosper is closely tied to licensing and regulation by state
officials; a ban on college-sports wagering, legal now only in
Nevada; a ban as well on the unregulated gambling boats that
sponsor ``cruises to nowhere,'' and the removal of automated cash
machines from casino floors.
</P>
<P>
   None of these restrictions will be realized, of course, unless
they are adopted by legislators, and many of the tougher proposals
are expected to face fierce political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, two or three recommendations and a couple
of observations will get through and in the end be viewed as what
this commission contributed,'' said one member, Richard C. Leone,
president of the Century Foundation, a public-policy research
institute.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's most ardent gambling opponent, James C.
Dobson, president of the conservative Focus on the Family, said he
intended to use his organization's web of radio broadcasts and
mailing lists to force lawmakers to respond to the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work at getting the word out,'' Dobson said. ``I
really don't think this report is going to gather dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission spent two years and $5 million traveling the
country, to tour the back rooms of casinos, see the thousands of
workers streaming into and out of the gambling halls on
Mississippi's Gulf Coast and the Las Vegas Strip, and hear
testimony from hundreds of people on everything from the dangers of
compulsive gambling to the economic benefits that legalized betting
had brought to Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet the commissioners often found it difficult to reach
consensus on an industry that may yield billions but also elicits
strong moral objections from many.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairwoman was Kay Cole James, a conservative
Republican who is a dean at Regent University, a Virginia
institution that was founded by Pat Robertson and bills itself as
``America's premier Christian graduate school.'' Her views were
frequently at odds with those of members like J. Terrence Lanni,
chief executive of the Las Vegas casino giant MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, though, agreement was struck on a number of issues.
Lanni, for example, surprisingly parted company with other gambling
proponents on Wednesday to vote in favor of restricting casino
contributions to state and local political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't sit well with people in my industry,'' he said.
``But I think it's important that we maintain the appearance as
well as the substance of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such accords, critics complained that the commission's
effectiveness was ultimately undermined by unyielding positions
among some members. As a result, the critics said, the report is
filled with recommendations that are not likely to have much
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming out with lightweight recommendations, no
question,'' said Arnie Wexler, a counselor on compulsive gambling
who testified before the commission.
</P>
<P>
   And Tom C. Rodgers, a lobbyist for the Indian gambling industry,
called the commission ``a lost opportunity.'' Echoing a view held
by others, Rodgers said the panel could have been more effective
had fewer members come to the task with a predisposition on
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this with every commission like this,'' he said.
``People try to form a compromise, but they can't for political
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the gambling debate, meanwhile, were
declaring victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the commissioners came away understanding that
there are vast benefits associated with some forms of gambling,''
said Alan Feldman, a spokesman for the Las Vegas casino company
Mirage Resorts. ``This whole process represented our opportunity to
show government and the public just how legitimately operated our
businesses are.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman conceded, however, that the commission's report would
show that ``there are areas we need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grey, who heads the National Coalition Against Gambling
Expansion, said he believed that the report would give his movement
much-needed ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``By getting the commissioners to come out and say that the
product _ gambling _ is flawed, gives us fuel to attack,'' Grey
said. The existence of the commission has ``made the industry
recognize that they have a problem'' with compulsive gambling, he
added. ``Now gambling will be in the public consciousness along
with alcohol, tobacco and drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Grey concurred with others who said that while the
commissioners had studied most of the social and economic issues
associated with gambling, they had proved unwilling to recommend
anything that might have severely affected the earnings of the
powerful casino companies.
</P>
<P>
   These critics also said that some of the seemingly tough
recommendations either faced uphill political battles or would have
little effect in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ban on Internet gambling, for example, is seen as
nearly impossible to enforce fully. And two weeks ago, just minutes
after the commission addressed a wave of college-sports gambling
scandals by voting to recommend that sports books in Las Vegas be
prohibited from taking bets on college games, casino officials
quickly pointed out that such a proposal was highly unlikely to
ever pass the Nevada Legislature.

AIRLINES EXPECTED TO HIRE MORE THAN 14,000 NEW PILOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to include summary line) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM FUQUAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, U.S. airlines are expected to fill more than 14,000
cockpit seats with new pilots, and one is Michael Origel, the first
officer aboard Flight 1420, which crashed Tuesday night in Little
Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Origel and his peers are hardly fledglings, having already spent
hundreds if not thousands of hours steering tons of aluminum
through the sky. They train in multimillion-dollar flight
simulators, use weather data that didn't exist a decade earlier,
and rely on cockpit technology incorporating the best of today's
computer wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   But their prospective employers also look for something else: Do
they make good decisions?
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash of Flight 1420, which occurred in nasty
weather, remains unknown. But in addition to weather, investigators
are examining many factors, including decisions made by the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines did not return phone calls on thursday seeking
comment on pilot training, and other airlines, along with flight
simulation companies, also declined to comment, citing the Arkansas
crash.
</P>
<P>
   But two pilot training experts say that during the past 20 years
the industry has invested as much on improving pilot judgment and
behavior as it has on improving technology. The issue is
particularly important today, as airlines hire record numbers of
new pilots to replace retirees and staff growing fleets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines interview the most qualified pilots, but they hire
the people they like, who do a good job solving problems,'' said
Kit Darby, a United Air Lines pilot and a principal at Aviation
Information Resources in Atlanta. AIR, as the company is known,
advises military and private pilots who want to work for the
nation's largest airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 U.S. carriers hired 14,123 pilots, a record for the
fourth consecutive year, and are expected to top that in 1999,
Darby said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, those airlines have adopted pilot training
systems that increase collaboration between crew members, the air
traffic control system and any other source of information that
could help pilots make good decisions. The systems go by names such
as human factors and crew resource management.
</P>
<P>
   An example is line-oriented flight training, or LOFT. Using a
flight simulator, a flight crew must deal with equipment failures,
unexpected weather and other crises.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose is to teach the entire crew, including flight
attendants, ``to hone those skills they have been taught dealing
with judgment and decision-making,'' said Tim Forte, flight safety
officer for Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach,
Fla. The school bills itself as the world's largest aviation
training institution, with about 12,000 students worldwide, about
half of them pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The captain who once flew solo through emergencies, relying on
technical skills, is an outdated concept, Forte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a wealth of information out there,'' he said, and the
plane's captain _ who still has the responsibility of the final
decision about what to do _ is expected to use all the resources at
hand to achieve the best result.
</P>
<P>
   Said Darby: ``The fighter pilot, the lone individual that
doesn't work so well when all these other people and resources are
available,'' isn't an airline's first choice.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, some of his clients complain that they were passed
over for someone with lesser technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It mystifies pilots who spend years getting their tickets
punched along the way, getting experience that gets them in the
door,'' Darby said. ``But those things don't get them selected _
and they shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Darby and Forte suggested that the ultimate example of
cooperative crew work is the 1989 crash-landing of a crippled DC-10
in Iowa. With one of three engines out and the plane's hydraulic
controls disabled, a fourth pilot _ who was a passenger on the
flight _ jumped in to help maneuver the plane using the plane's two
remaining engines. The crew also used information from the plane's
builder and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot was receptive, and that saved many lives,'' Darby
said.
</P>
<P>
   That assumes there is time to explore options, Darby said. And
usually there is, he and Forte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's usually a chain of events that lead to an accident,''
Darby said. ``Crew resource management gives you many opportunities
to break that chain.''
</P>
<P>
   An example of the failure to break the chain of error is the
1995 crash of an American Airlines jet near Cali, Colombia. That
accident, which killed 159 of the 163 people aboard, was traced to
a discrepancy between the crew's navigational charts and the
plane's autopilot system that distracted the crew as the plane flew
too low in a mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
   In response, American altered its training to blend the teamwork
approach with renewed emphasis on pilots actively controlling their
aircraft, rather than relying too much on cockpit automation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the federal government also required that pilots be
trained in recovering from unusual events, such as a buildup of ice
on the wings.

WEARY AND WARY, THE SERBS ARE SKEPTICAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ It was hard to find anyone in Belgrade
Thursday who expressed support for President Slobodan Milosevic,
but with the news of a peace deal, the recriminations came
unusually swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Ivica Tasic, 33, a bookseller on the main shopping street, asked
the most common question: ``Who will ask him why so many people had
to die and all of us have had to go through this? He will never
have to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Katarina Ivanovic, 32, asked, ``Why did all those people
die?''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Belgrade expressed relief at the news of a deal
that could end the war, but their relief was tinged with bitterness
that they had been put through 10 weeks of bombing for little
apparent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians welcomed Belgrade's acceptance of NATO's terms
as a chance for peace and prosperity, but people on the street did
not seem so sure. Few said they would be celebrating. Many were
uncertain, even skeptical that this really meant an end to the war.
Some warned that NATO had more in store for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a trick,'' said one flamboyantly dressed student with
ragged dreadlocks. ``They will send nuclear bombs next.''
</P>
<P>
   Jelena, an economist who has found herself unemployed since the
beginning of the war, said: ``People will not be celebrating. They
are relieved but weary. This is a wise decision, but it should have
been accepted at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Visnja, a retired teacher, said, ``It is great, because it means
a stop to the killing of people and to the ruin of our country.''
She acknowledged that the agreement seemed like a defeat for
Serbia, but added, ``We do not have any other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic had to agree because he faced ``a destroyed country
and destroyed people,'' said Visnja's friend Mila, an architect.
Both women chatted freely in an outdoor cafe, but they did not want
their full names in a foreign newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he was even thinking of going on to fight a
ground war,'' Mila said of Milosevic, ``but there are some
intelligent people around who warned that we should on no account
embark on a ground war.''
</P>
<P>
   For such ``intelligent people,'' the women said, the loss of
electricity and water was the last straw. Added to that, Mila had
four missiles land just 300 yards from her home on Monday. ``I did
not realize the bombing would be so drastic, that civilians would
be killed,'' she said. ``I thought it would just be in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs expressed anger at their government for the long
bombing campaign. ``That was a mistake of our government,'' said
Damir, 22, a waiter in a hotel restaurant. ``A lot of people died
for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Nenat, 23, chimed in, ``We did not want foreign
troops on our land, but now so many people have died, it's not
worth it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tried to put a good face on things. ``Well, everything is
OK if you have your head on your shoulders,'' said Sloba, a worker
drinking beer with a friend selling popcorn. ``Things will get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Others took some solace in branding NATO a loser, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least Kosovo is clean of a lot of Albanians and not all of
them will come back,'' said Nenat, a supporter of the extreme
nationalist Serbian Radical Party.
</P>
<P>
   As Mila put it: ``You could not say NATO is the winner when they
had such a large force and they had to bomb for nearly three
months.'' Her friend Visnja added, ``NATO is the moral loser _ such
a large force attacking such a small country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many Serbs remain suspicious of NATO's intentions, saying they
expect that the alliance would not be satisfied with occupying
Kosovo and would later move to take over the whole of Serbia in
their pursuit of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Few think that Serbia will be free of war for long: some foresee
civil war, and some think NATO will be behind it. Nenat said that
``with 50,000 troops'' in Kosovo to resettle refugees, the alliance
``could start a war in 15 minutes,''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone predicts that Serbian civilians will flee
Kosovo as their troops and police forces leave, swamping Serbia
with a new wave of refugees. They also predict an exodus from
Serbia as people try to go abroad. ``What is there for us here?''
Nenat asked.

NETSCAPE CEO'S TESTIMONY IS RE-EXAMINED BY MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. promised it would question the
credibility of key Justice Department witnesses during the rebuttal
phase of the antitrust trial that began this week, and Thursday a
company lawyer introduced several documents that did just that.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent inconsistencies between a government witness'
testimony last fall and subsequent statements out of court caught
the attention of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson _ so much so that
the judge urged a government attorney to take account of them in
court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very interesting information in there, and I hope you
will revisit it,'' he told David Boies, the lead government
attorney. Boies assured him that he would.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the testimony last October of Netscape
Communications Corp. chief executive James Barksdale, who asserted
that Microsoft, through predatory conduct, had so pushed Netscape
into a corner that his company could no longer get computer makers
to provide its browser with their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's over half the distribution channel,'' Barksdale said on
the witness stand, ``and we're basically out of it.'' At another
point he said, ``I think I've seen numbers around'' showing that
only about 10 percent of the world's computers come with Netscape
pre-installed.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out, however, that just as Barksdale was testifying,
America Online was midway through a review process to determine
whether to buy Netscape. As part of that, the investment banking
firm Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. was gathering data from Netscape, and one
figure Netscape gave the bankers showed that the company's browser
was being bundled on 24 percent of the personal computers being
sold by the 20 largest manufacturers last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's inconsistent, isn't it?'' a Microsoft lawyer, Michael
Lacovara, asked Franklin Fisher, a government witness on the stand
for the third day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he thought Barksdale had simply exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Boies called the problem a minor inconsistency
and noted that while Netscape may have been on 24 percent of the
new computers, Microsoft's Web browser was on all of them, since it
came included with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Boies carried off a highly effective cross-examination of
Microsoft witnesses earlier this year by raising assorted
credibility questions for all of them. Now Microsoft says it
intends to use the same approach with government witnesses, using
material from documents subpoenaed from America Online, Netscape
and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   But the day in court was hardly one-sided. The judge, Boies and
the witness threw credibility questions at Lacovara, too.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to show that Microsoft had not seriously impeded
Netscape, Lacovara introduced another internal America Online
document prepared during deliberations over the sale showing that
Netscape had reported distributing 160 million copies of its
browser in 1998 _ though Lacovara, quoting government figures, said
he believed there were only 100 million Internet users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they believe this document on its face, they'd have to
believe there's been big adoption of the Netscape browser'' in the
last year, Fisher said. ``I don't think they believe it; I don't
think you believe it.'' Lacovara did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Lacovara presented evidence to support
Microsoft's recurring contention that Linux, a free operating
system, poses a real threat to Windows. He introduced an e-mail
message in which a Microsoft employee complained that Linux was
outselling Windows 2-to-1 in certain software stores in Silicon
Valley, where Microsoft is not particularly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson scoffed at this, calling the e-mail ``a self-serving
out-of- court declaration,'' asking with a laugh and a sarcastic
tone: ``Can you think of a reason it was forwarded to you?'' Then
the judge noted that the chart of comparable sales presented with
the e-mail did not support the 2-to-1 statement. In fact it showed
Windows outselling Linux in these stores. Lacovara said the 2-to-1
figure came from sales at another store not shown on the chart.
</P>
<P>
   When Boies got his turn, he entered into evidence interviews
with Microsoft executives over the last year, including chairman
Bill Gates, calling Linux an insignificant phenomenon that did not
worry Microsoft. ``They've constructed a parallel universe in the
court room,'' Boies declared.

QUEEN NOOR URGES   BAN ON LAND MINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jordan's Queen Noor, a leader in the global campaign
against land mines, warned Thursday that long after fighting ends
in Kosovo, hidden anti-personnel weapons will be killing and
maiming returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo, land mines have been used in barbaric and
terrifyingly inhumane ways to promote ethnic cleansing,'' said
Noor, who was in Boston as part of a series of events sponsored by
UNICEF of New England aimed at outlawing the use of land mines.
</P>
<P>
   If ethnic Albanian refugees are allowed to return to Kosovo as
part of the peace agreement that Belgrade accepted Thursday, she
said, their return will have to be carefully managed to avoid a
``humanitarian catastrophe'' because of the large number of mines
and booby-trapped houses left by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The routes in are heavily mined,'' said Noor, who is patron of
the Landmine Survivors Network, an organization that helps people
injured by land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of a ban on land mines call them ``a slow motion
weapon of mass destruction'' that kill at least 800 people a month
around the globe and injure another 1,200. Most of the victims are
civilians; many are small children.
</P>
<P>
   Mines wait silently long after wars end. It will take many years
to clear mines in Kosovo and neighboring Bosnia, Noor said. Though
the military has new techniques for demining, the primary means of
disarming them remains a soldier inching along the ground on his
stomach, probing with a bayonet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That epitomizes the great evil and inhumanity of
anti-personnel mines,'' she said. ``They have an impact 50 or 100
years after they are laid.''
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF New England has launched a program in Mozambique to raise
awareness of the danger of land mines, which were sown throughout
that country during years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of Jordan's King Hussein took up the anti-mine cause
early last year, filling a role the late Princess Diana once held.
She said she is especially concerned about mines in the Middle
East, many of which are from World War II and continue to cause
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Noor said she has personally lobbied President Clinton and
members of Congress to join 135 other nations in signing the 1996
Ottawa Convention banning land mines. The vast majority of land
mines in the world are manufactured in the United States or contain
US-made components.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have opposed the treaty, arguing that mines
are an important military tool that have enabled US forces, for
instance, to defend South Korea from a possible attack from North
Korea. But many former US military commanders, including retired
General Norman Schwartzkopf, have endorsed the treaty, saying
humanitarian concerns far outweigh military utility.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have also been worried that wording in the treaty
could mean a ban on cluster bombs, such as those dropped by NATO in
Yugoslavia. Cluster bombs, which are used against tanks and mobile
artillery, scatter dozens of hand-size bomblets around an area.
These devices can kill or injure civilians long after they are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are figures in Congress who understand,'' said Noor, who
was born and raised in the United States. ``But many have only been
given a perspective from the Pentagon.''

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Gordon and Linda Joyce McClaren moved to
Arkansas more than 10 years ago, but according to their friends
they remained ``true Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved Texas. He loved the coast. He loved to fish in the
Gulf,'' Arnold Bowden said Thursday from his home in Russellville,
Ark. Bowden and his wife, Kathey, developed a close relationship
with the McClarens after they retired to the small town about 50
miles northwest of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, originally from Corpus Christi, were among nine
killed aboard American Airlines Flight 1420 when it crash-landed
Tuesday night at Little Rock National Airport. The McClarens and
Bowdens had been traveling with eight friends, returning from a
tour of the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those on the tour group, which planned yearly jaunts
around the world, did not survive the crash. Along with the
McClarens, those who died included Judy Thacker, 54, Betty Evelyn
Ingram, 69, and Sara Renee Gray, 88, all of Russellville, and Mary
Elizabeth Couch, 68, of Havana, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``All six had been in Rome last year together,'' Bowden said.
``It's very personal for me. All those people we had with us are
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were the pilot Capt. Richard Buschmann,48, and
passengers Debra Ann Sattari, 38, of San Jose, Calif., and James
Harrison, 21, of Paragould, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and his wife escaped with minor injuries but the pain of
losing their friends will haunt them forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my best fishing buddy,'' Bowden said. ``My wife and I
developed a close relationship with them. They were the type of
friends you didn't mind sharing everything with because you knew it
would be held in confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The McClarens bought a lot in the community that rests in the
shadow of the Ozark Mountains near the Ouachita River and in 1988
they built a home _ to be closer to their eldest son who works for
Entergy in Arkansas. They are survived by two other adult children
and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Linda McClaren, whom friends called Joyce, often volunteered her
clerical skills to local charity organizations in Russellville
while Gordon, a retired chemist for the Texas Health Department in
Corpus Christi, served as president of his new hometown's art
council.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said Gordon McClaren never forgot where he came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``His allegiance to Texas was to the point that it was awfully
hard to make a hog out of him,'' Bowden said. ``He must have had
more than 350 Aggie jokes, and he very rarely told the same one
twice. He had a tremendous sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the trip that began May 19, Bowden said, both
McClarens were interested in seeing the Scottish Highlands because
both were of Scottish descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove up there and he saw the home of his ancestors,''
Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more memorable moments of the trip to the Highlands
was when they got to a village where the Campbell clan on the
orders of Queen Mary killed part of the MacDonald clan in 1692, an
event that has taken on legendary status in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joyce was a Campbell,'' Bowden said. ``And when we got there
Gordon said ``You know I don't think we'll tell them we've got
Campbell blood.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of man he was. He was quick with a joke, but
he was very intelligent. He spoke three languages, English, Spanish
and German. He was also an amateur astronomer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he, Gordon McClaren and two other friends usually
planned an extensive fishing trip each year. This year they were
scheduled to cast into the Buffalo River in northern Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a bigger Texan than Gordon,'' Bowden said. ``He
would always tell me ``A Texan never lies,' and I'd say back ``When
his lips are closed tight.' That's the kind of relationship we
had.''

EUROPEAN UNION ANNOUNCES PLAN TO FORM A MILITARY FORCE

   COLOGNE, Germany _ The leaders of 15 European countries decided
Thursday to make the European Union a military power for the first
time in its 42-year history, with command headquarters, staffs and
forces of its own for peacekeeping and peacemaking missions in
future crises like those in Kosovo or Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Long an economic giant, the European Union today has a common
currency, the euro, in 11 countries. But when it comes to foreign
and defense policy, Europe does not even have a telephone number,
as Henry Kissinger sarcastically observed 25 years ago when he was
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   All that will change by the end of next year, the 15 leaders
vowed.
</P>
<P>
   By late 2000, according to the plan announced at the European
Union summit meeting here, a single foreign and security policy
czar would speak for Europe and carry out the military will of
European leaders. The move will enable many of the members of NATO,
as well as several European nations that are not in the alliance,
to mount their own campaigns without America's might.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed
up by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them,
and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to international
crises without prejudice to actions by NATO,'' the European leaders
declared.
</P>
<P>
   They echoed language first used by President Jacques Chirac of
France and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain six months ago
after two crises in the Balkans showed how far Europe still had to
go to be taken seriously as a military power, even on its own
continent. Neither in Bosnia nor in Kosovo were European countries,
whose total armed forces exceed those of the United States in size,
able to project military power convincingly enough to halt the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, all 15 leaders agreed to absorb the functions of
the 10-nation Western European Union, a long-dormant European
defense alliance founded a year before NATO in 1948.They said the
Western European Union's 60,000-troop force, Eurocorps, would be
put at the disposal of the new, more assertive Europe that is
taking shape under the European Union. ``In that event,'' they
said, ``the WEU as an organization would have completed its
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   All 10 members of the WEU _ Britain, Belgium, France, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Germany and Greece _
already belong to both NATO and the European Union. Denmark does,
too, but has only observer status in the smaller European defense
organization, as do four other European Union members, Austria,
Ireland, Finland and Sweden, which are neutral or nonaligned and do
not belong to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   These countries would be able to join future European Union
peacekeeping or peacemaking operations, but only if they wanted to,
the leaders agreed, saying they would also welcome participation by
other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   With Germany's unification in 1990 acting as a spur to its
neighbors to closer unity among themselves, the Treaty of European
Union, negotiated at the end of 1991, committed the Europeans to a
common currency and a common foreign and security policy and
defense policy, building on the common market they created in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   They reaffirmed those aspirations in another treaty signed in
1997, and succeeded in launching the euro at the start of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the common foreign and security policy sputtered along
through successive crises in the Balkans in which the Europeans
showed little unity or common purpose until the Americans sent in
armed forces to help them in Bosnia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany, Chirac, Blair and
the others are determined that Europe should be taken more
seriously on the world stage. Part of what is driving them, their
advisers say, is concern that the United States, with only 100,000
troops in Europe now compared with three times that many at the end
of the Cold War, will not indefinitely be willing to pull the fat
out of the fire for Europeans who have long since been rich enough
to provide for their own defenses.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats have welcomed Europe's newfound willingness
to do more for itself. But they remain skeptical about whether
Europeans will actually be willing to spend the billions of dollars
it would take to build the stronger European defense pillar that
American defense secretaries for decades have been saying they
wanted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's declaration by European Union leaders makes clear
that they still have a lot of work ahead of them to create the kind
of military decision making and planning ability that NATO has had
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac suggested that the Western European Union's general staff
and military committee, both based in a small headquarters in the
center of Brussels some distance from NATO's, should be transferred
to the European Union and presided over by its new foreign and
security policy coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   That could be Javier Solana of Spain, now secretary general of
NATO, whose candidacy for the job was on the leaders' agenda here
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   If Solana is selected, one senior U.S. official said, ``We would
be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Verheugen, a German government official who has also
been suggested for that job, said of the plan to strengthen
European defense, ``It is not a replacement for the Atlantic
partnership, but a significant and necessary complement to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders themselves also noted, ``The alliance remains the
foundation of the collective defense of its member states.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders agreed at their summit meeting in Washington in
April on detailed arrangements to lend military headquarters
organizations, multinational staffs, and tanks, helicopters and
other equipment to the Europeans if they decided to undertake
operations the United States prefers to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany said when he retired last
month as NATO's senior military officer, such arrangements exist
only on paper so far.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, when the NATO allies decided to use air power to try
to force the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, to accept a
settlement in Kosovo, only the United States had the ability to
throw hundreds of airplanes into the battle. And though the
European allies all support the air war, their total contribution
of 277 planes is dwarfed by the United States, which has committed
as many as 815 to the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States had the intelligence satellites and
precision-guided weapons the allies needed to mount a campaign with
minimum casualties to their own pilots, and only the United States
has invested in a fleet of large-capacity transport aircraft big
enough to fly in the 50,000 or more peacekeepers planned for
Kosovo.

   DEIR QADDIS, West Bank _ Hundreds of Palestinians marched down a
hilltop here Thursday, trampling though rocks and bramble toward a
neighboring, and expanding, Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Adults waved protest banners and youths swung slingshots loaded
with rocks. They hiked determinedly toward a line of Israeli
soldiers waiting with guns beside a rough road newly plowed by the
settlers through the Palestinians' olive fields.
</P>
<P>
   Khandumi Moustafa, an elderly woman wearing a traditional
Palestinian embroidered dress, went running toward the marchers,
shaking her head. ``Go back, young people, I beg you,'' she said.
``Go back. It is my olive trees that were uprooted, but I'm 80
years old. I don't want to see any more blood spilled, not on my
land.''
</P>
<P>
   This town and others throughout the West Bank and Gaza
experienced an unexpectedly feeble day of protest Thursday.
Palestinian officials had summoned their people into the streets
for a ``Day of Rage,'' only to turn around and order them to be
peaceful in their rage.
</P>
<P>
   Confused by the mixed signals, many Palestinians stayed home.
Others, especially young men, pushed to the brink of violent
confrontation with Israeli troops, but most of those
confrontations, at poorly attended demonstrations, fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   The Day of Rage was meant as a warning to Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak that the Palestinians will not tolerate
the continuing expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
But it served mostly as an exercise in security cooperation between
Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers, in most cases, acted with restraint, and
Palestinian protest leaders used bullhorns to tamp overheating
emotions. As in this village, there were patches of stone-throwing
and firing of rubber-coated bullets, but in relative terms there
were few injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to an uncertain future, many Palestinians are as
frustrated and wary as ever. But five years after the end of the
protracted uprising known as the intifada, many have tired of
violent street fights with the Israelis. And many have grown
equally weary _ and suspicious _ of their leaders' calls for
protests that bear little fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Amar Barghouti, for instance, who spent months in an Israeli
prison for rock-throwing during the 1987 to 1994 intifada, stood on
the sidelines here Thursday, swinging his cellular phone. Shading
his eyes under a fierce midday sun, he scanned the crowd for the
faces of the Palestinian officials who had convened the protest,
sponsoring buses from Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is Abu Ala?'' he asked, referring to Ahmed Qurei,
speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council. ``Home eating
watermelon? The Legislature called us here and none of them
appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Thursday's protests were directed at Barak, who for
the last two weeks has been working to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, the Labor Party leader, has made no known overtures to
the Palestinians since he was elected May 17. He has also voiced no
reaction to settlement activity that seems to have increased in the
final days of the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   And he is negotiating with the conservative Likud Party, which
Netanyahu has quit as leader, as well as with the settlers'
National Religious Party to join his government.
</P>
<P>
   All this concerns the Palestinians, who fear that Barak is cut
from the same cloth as Netanyahu, whom they loathed. They are also
anxious that Barak will give priority to negotiations with Syria on
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barak has not even been sworn in yet, ``it's never too
soon'' to protest, said Yusef Farsakh, 73, a Palestinian-American
from Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's protest day was specifically intended to alert Barak
that the Palestinians felt very strongly about the settlement
expansion and would not re-enter peace negotiations until he froze
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to continue to talk about peace when they
continue to build settlements on our ground,'' said Marwan
Barghouti, a leader of the Fatah Party of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. Barghouti has called settlement building a
``terrorist act.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Palestinians said they did not believe their leaders
had any intention to break off relations with a new Israeli prime
minister. Their relative apathy Thursday _ not even 2,000
demonstrated throughout the West Bank and Gaza _ fit into a general
wariness, a concern that they are being manipulated by Palestinian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Palestinian merchants held a general strike. In
Bethlehem, Palestinian police helped disperse a demonstration near
Rachel's Tomb. In Gaza, Palestinians blocked the main thoroughfare
near a junction with a Jewish settlement. In Hebron, Israeli
soldiers, under order from their commander, permitted Palestinians
to march farther than they ever have into the Jewish section of
town _ right to the door of the Bet Hadassah housing complex on
Martyrs Street.
</P>
<P>
   Near Hebron, in an incident separate from the demonstrations, a
Palestinian man, Ala Abu Sharkh, was shot to death by Israeli
troops at a roadblock. Israeli and Palestinian officials gave
different accounts of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   In Deir Qaddis, an Arab village of 500 families, protesters
gathered on the playground of the high school and then trekked to
the border with the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Sefer, an expanse
of concrete apartment buildings, ringed by new structures under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud Abdel Rahim, an elderly man wearing a caftan, walked
with a cane. He said he owns many acres of land that the Israelis
are trying to confiscate, and he is enmeshed in court proceedings
to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This land is our precious blood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The town's zoning is controlled by the Israelis, and the
Palestinians say they cannot obtain building permits to expand.
``We live on top of each other like in a refugee camp,'' said Tareq
Nasser, 30, a truck driver. ``I'm married with four children and we
are all in one room. We have land, but we cannot build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age boys pushed by, whistling, rowdy and ready for action.
Middle-age women yelled after them, imploring them to calm down. At
the same site, in a confrontation with the Israelis two years ago,
one Palestinian man was killed and 17 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd clambered up a hilltop, chanting, ``We are the sons of
this land and we will resist.'' Wrapped in Palestinian flags, they
thundered down, slingshots in tow. Behind them, organizers shouted
over bullhorns for them to keep back from the soldiers. ``Your
security and safety is more important,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The youths began unearthing large rocks. A few were lobbed. The
soldiers, on a signal from their commander, exploded tear gas
canisters. Palestinians fumbled in their pockets for the onions
they bring to demonstrations; inhaling a sliced onion counteracts
the effect of the gas.
</P>
<P>
   These confrontations are almost choreographed. They were a
routine part of many days during the intifada. But this time, the
adults on both sides held the younger men back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank you very much for your solidarity,'' the organizers
shouted. ``Please retreat. We've conveyed our message and the other
side has received it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the youths had been summoned to rage. They left and
returned. Six collapsed from the tear gas. Others hurled more
rocks. The soldiers let loose a few rubber bullets. And then it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that was nonsense,'' Amar Barghouti said as he began the
walk back to the village. ``That accomplished nothing fast.''

 AT HOME, NO PEACE FOR ACCORD'S ARCHITECT
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Having helped win Yugoslavia's backing for a plan to
end the Kosovo conflict, Russia's Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin
returned home Thursday to meet another challenge, getting the rest
of his countrymen on board.
</P>
<P>
   It promises to be no easy task. As Western leaders hailed
Thursday's approval by Yugoslavia's parliament of the peace
proposal as a major step toward ending the Balkans crisis,
Chernomyrdin faced an angry reaction from Russian legislators _ and
dissent among military members of his negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Moscow and the West remained far apart on how
Russian and NATO peacekeeping troops should be deployed and
commanded.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari spent
the past two days selling the plan to Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic, Thursday played down the problems raised by the deal and
said peace is expected in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to stop'' the conflict, Chernomyrdin said
after arriving Thursday night in Moscow. ``I think we have reached
that stage and it will be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said the plan would work because it meets the
West's main demands _ that Yugoslavia withdraw its 40,000 troops
from Kosovo as a condition for NATO to stop its airstrikes, and
that the 50,000 peacekeeping troops will be a NATO-led force with a
large US contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Since being appointed in April, Chernomyrdin, a former prime
minister, who has been meeting regularly with US Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott and other senior Western officials, has
gradually reversed the pro-Serb, anti-Western stance taken by
Moscow in the first days of the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, officials talked angrily of arming the Serbs and
breaking ties with the West. The trouble is, many Russian
politicians still feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Russian lawmakers complained that Chernomyrdin had
sold out to the West by dropping Moscow's objection that any deal
would have to be preceded by a halt to the Western alliance's
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Moscow also panned another point of the plan:
that NATO troops would form the core of the peacekeeping force in
Kosovo. In the Russian view, all peacekeeping activity should be
under the auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Angry lawmakers in the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, threatened a no-confidence vote against Chernomyrdin
and demanded more details.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, a senior Defense Ministry
official and part of Chernomyrdin's delegation, bluntly criticized
the deal, saying military officers were ``not quite satisfied with
the role of NATO that is being imposed and the diminished role of
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, while NATO insists its forces will make up the core
of any peacekeeping force, Chernomyrdin said Russian troops would
also be present and ``under separate Russian command,'' not under
NATO auspices. Chernomyrdin also suggested that Russian troops,
which could number as many as 10,000, would serve in a different
sector than NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   If the reaction at home highlights the difficulties Chernomyrdin
faces in negotiating a Kosovo settlement, Chernomyrdin's status in
Russia underscores the risks the West runs by putting too much
faith in the deals he brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was appointed by President Boris N. Yeltsin, who is
by most accounts in poor health and rarely engaged in day-to-day
problems. Chernomyrdin is thought to be at odds with Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, who was pushed aside when Yeltsin named his
special envoy. Further, Yeltsin's new prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin, has been too preoccupied with a power struggle over the
formation of his Cabinet to be involved in Balkans negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything through Chernomyrdin,'' said Michael McFaul,
a Russia specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace Studies in
Washington. ``But who is Chernomyrdin reporting to?''

2 CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING ON TAKEOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Conn.)   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For two years, a junior investment banker at Salomon
Smith Barney and his former boss at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Trust Co. thought they had devised a foolproof plan to make
millions through insider trading. But Thursday they were charged
with criminal securities fraud and conspiracy by the U.S. attorney
and civil insider-trading violations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with 13 potential and announced takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kirkbride, an associate at Salomon, would take note of
what he overheard and saw on desks, copiers and printers about
takeovers in the works, federal authorities said. Then he passed
the information along to Richard Ference, his old boss and a vice
president at the Bank of Tokyo, who would trade on the information
and split the profits with him.
</P>
<P>
   By using pay phones and prepaid calling cards, exchanging
cash-stuffed envelopes and never making bank deposits, authorities
contend the pair figured they were in the clear _ even after
amassing $750,000 in profits from deals including Tyco
International Ltd.'s takeover of Keystone International and the
Hughes Electronic Corp.'s acquisition of United States Satellite
Broadcasting Co.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their carefully laid plans to avoid detection, the
pair broke their own rules and traded without each others'
knowledge, ultimately unraveling their scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkbride's lawyer, Frank Wright, did not return a telephone
call, and a message left at Kirkbride's Manhattan residence was not
answered. Calls to Ference's home in Greenwich, Conn., were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the investigation, the scheme began
to unravel after Salomon Smith Barney was informed that Kirkbride,
30, was making stock trades at another brokerage firm, York
Securities, in strict violation of Salomon's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkbride was immediately suspended in March and Salomon Smith
Barney officials informed the SEC of what they had learned. He left
the firm soon after.
</P>
<P>
   William Baker, an associate director in the SEC's enforcement
division, declined to comment on how the case was broken. But he
said, ``They broke their own rules. I think there's an old adage:
No honor among thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount at issue here is by anybody's standards a
significant amount,'' Baker added. ``This was egregious
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkbride was arraigned in U.S. Magistrates Court in Manhattan
Thursday morning, where he pleaded not guilty and was released on a
$10,000 personal recognizance bond. If convicted, he could face 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, said in a statement:
``This former employee violated our stringent rules on employee
trading, upon discovery of which he was promptly suspended and the
appropriate authorities notified.''
</P>
<P>
   Ference, who is 51 and could also face 10 years in prison if
convicted, is expected to be arraigned Friday morning. Bank of
Tokyo officials declined to comment about him, citing company
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the two men made $750,000 illegally, which they
agreed to split three ways: Ference would keep one third for
himself, keep one third to cover taxes, and pass the remainder to
Kirkbride. Ference still holds $1.2 million in stock purchased
based on illegal insider information, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ference traded on the information Kirkbride supplied about
takeovers involving Salomon Smith Barney clients, and then to avoid
detection, he paid Kirkbride in envelopes that he instructed the
younger man to throw away immediately, adding that he should not
deposit it anywhere or report it on tax filings but only spend it
on ``luxury'' items, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ference also instructed his former subordinate to act like he
did not keep in touch with his old boss if the matter ever came up
in conversation, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But while all this was going on, Kirkbride traded in his own
name at his account at York Securities, including a fateful trade
that was brought to the attention of his employer. According to the
SEC, the trades were made ``despite Ference's warning that
Kirkbride not trade in his own name.''

2 REPORTERS JAILED FOR PROTECTING SOURCES IN OLYMPIC-BOMBING
STORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Atlanta Thursday ordered two reporters for
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to be jailed for failing to reveal
who told them that Richard Jewell, a part-time security guard, was
a leading suspect in the bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper immediately filed an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The two reporters, Kathy Scruggs and Ron Martz, based their
reporting in July 1996 on confidential sources. The
Journal-Constitution identified Jewell as the focus of a Federal
investigation into the bombing and wrote that he ``fits the profile
of a lone bomber.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion on July 27, 1996, injured 111 people and killed
two. Jewell, who was never charged with a crime, is suing the
newspaper, its owners and the reporters for libel.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998 and again in March of this year, the two
reporters were directed by Judge John R. Mather of U.S. District
Court to reveal their sources. Both times they refused.
</P>
<P>
   An order to imprison reporters in a libel case is rare, said
Jane Kirtley, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press. Ms. Kirtley said there are three other cases
in the United States that involve reporters who have failed to
comply with a court order to reveal sources and whom the court has
subsequently ordered imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   None of these reporters are in prison and none are involved in
libel suits.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how long it will take for the appeal by The
Journal-Constitution to be processed.
</P>
<P>
   Peter C. Canfield, the lawyer for Cox Communications, the
company that owns The Journal-Constitution, said Thursday, ``We are
confident that the Court of Appeals will find any disclosure of
confidential sources unnecessary. When your reporting has been
accurate, who your sources were is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No court as yet has looked at the issue of whether The
Journal-Constitution's reporting was accurate,'' Canfield added.
``We're confident that when a court does, it will conclude that it
was accurate, that Jewell was the focus of the investigation, and
that we accurately reported why he was the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the case involves libel, Jewell's lawyer, L. Lin Wood,
is required to prove that the newspaper knowingly printed false
stories about Jewell that were negligent or malicious.
</P>
<P>
   Wood has argued that because he cannot identify the reporters'
sources, his case is unfairly hampered. He said he was confident
that the reporters would eventually serve a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere down the road,'' Wood said, ``the newspaper and
these reporters face some tough decisions. They have to decide
whether they are going to jail, or whether they will do what they
have been ordered to do, and that is to tell the truth.''

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Bank lending officer Judy Thacker shared her
passion for travel by sending postcards home to co-workers and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Her final greeting, which arrived just hours before American
Airlines Flight 1420 cracked open upon landing, will haunt tiny
Russellville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wales is more spectacular than I ever imagined &AMP; tomorrow we
head for Scotland. ... I may see you before this arrives!''
</P>
<P>
   Thacker, 53, was among five Russellville residents killed in the
crash late Tuesday. Three other passengers also died, as did the
pilot, Richard Buschmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our small town is in utter shock,'' said Betty LaGrone,
president of the Russellville Chamber of Commerce. ``It's hard to
keep going on with the day-to-day work. ... The loss has left an
opened wound in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Thacker organized a 12-member group of widows and older couples
who left Russellville on May 19 for a trip to London, Scotland and
Wales. Among them were Thacker and her husband, Jack; 88-year-old
Sue Gray; Betty Ingram, 69; and Gordon McLerran, 64, and his wife,
Joyce, 65. Mary Couch, 68, was from neighboring Havana.
</P>
<P>
   All six perished when the McDonnell Douglas Super 80 that was
bringing them home crashed upon landing in a severe thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrone said the dead were wound into the fabric of
Russellville, a city of 25,000 about 75 miles northwest of Little
Rock. The devastation is easily felt in the tight-knit community,
where children play in the streets and old-timers fish and picnic
along Lake Dardanelle.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, a widow, taught Sunday school and embroidered altar linens
at All Saints Episcopal Church, said church member Beverly Lanier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue took care of our church's memorial garden,'' Lanier said.
``She kept the most beautiful flowers there. Her love was pink
roses and they circled the whole garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting for her to come home so she could bring more
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Lawton, executive vice president at River Valley Bank, said
Judy Thacker lived at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a ball of energy ... '' Lawton said. ``She was a
friend to the young and the old and was so warm. It's strange to
think she died doing what she loves to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Thacker was in critical condition at Baptist Memorial
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Bowden, 63, and his wife, Katherine, who survived the
crash, said the travelers were drained when they boarded Flight
1420 at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Most rested during the flight. The McLerrans were exhausted
because they had caught a late-night performance of Shakespeare's
Othello in Stratford-on-Avon. The couple had used the British tour
to research their Scottish roots.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden described Gordon McLerran, a retired state chemist from
Corpus Christi, as a fishing buddy and ``true Texan'' who had ``no
fewer than 150 Aggie jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, Bowden lost contact with the McLerrans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see anything but fire and smoke in front of me,''
he told The Associated Press. ``There's no time to consider your
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden grabbed his wife's hand and fled, following the smell of
fresh air. While heading toward a wing exit, he helped a 2-year-old
girl whose mother was struggling with her other child.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden's son, Jeff, learned of the crash when his father woke
him with a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder why these things happen,'' said Jeff Bowden, a
Marine Corps major. ``I don't know what it would be like to be a
relatives of those who perished. We've determined that the Lord
took six angels home and left the other angels here on earth to
finish what needs to be accomplished.''

BY BLAZING A COAST-TO-COAST TRAIL, SHE HELPED PUT A NATION ON
WHEELS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.J.)   (af)  
 By CHERYL JENSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   It was a soggy bon voyage. Alice Huyler Ramsey stood in the rain
outside the Maxwell auto company's New York showroom on the Upper
West Side in Manhattan, holding a bouquet of carnations and posing
for photographers as she waited impatiently to climb into her car
for a cross-country drive.
</P>
<P>
   The trip would not merit attention today, but Ramsey, who left
for San Francisco 90 years ago this week, was intent on becoming
the first woman to drive across America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Damp but not discouraged, the 22-year-old Vassar graduate set
out on June 9, 1909, in her 30-horsepower Maxwell for the
3,800-mile trip. Her adventure would take 41 days, but its success
would help convince America that automobiles were safe and
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   If Ramsey had doubts, she did not make them public. A newspaper
quoted her as saying: ``I see no reason why any woman who can drive
a car cannot take one across the continent. All that is needed is a
good car such as I have, and careful driving in the bad spots, and
the trip can be, I think, consummated without trouble.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One challenge was navigation. She made her drive before there
were guidebooks or road maps from the Mississippi west. The first
transcontinental road trip had come six years earlier, when Dr. H.
Nelson Jackson of Burlington, Vt., and his chauffeur, Sewall K.
Crocker, drove a Winton from San Francisco to New York in 63 days.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey left her husband and year-old son at home in New Jersey
and took along her husband's two sisters and a woman friend. The
right-hand-drive Maxwell was started with a hand crank _ in those
days, a crank's kickback sometimes resulted in a broken arm. The
fuel tank was under the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   The women's daily mileage over dirt tracks ranged from 4 to 198
miles. When it rained, the dirt turned to muck, making travel
impossible or dangerous. It took the women 13 days to get across
Iowa's 360 miles of ``gumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   They had to be towed out of two holes within a mile of each
other in Nebraska. She wrote in her book, ``Veil, Duster and Tire
Iron'': ``The farmer's son caught one of their horses in pasture
and pulled us out _ for a fee _ then walked on to the next hole,
repeated his towing, but doubled his fee!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, they thought they were being attacked when they saw
Indians on horseback heading at them and heard what they thought
were war whoops. ``I could almost feel the color drain from my
face,'' she wrote. ``I had read _ not too long ago _ about Indians
having attacked people in the Western United States.'' Then a jack
rabbit leaped across their path trying to escape its pursuers, who
paid no attention to Ramsey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey continued to make at least one coast-to-coast trip every
year for much of the rest of her life. In 1961, she expressed
amazement at the improvements that had shortened her 41-day trip to
a week: ``As evening approaches one can be sure of Beautyrest
mattresses and other luxuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, who lived in Hacksensack, died in Covina, Calif., in
1983. She was 97. &QL;

   Q. (italics)Help! I've just been promoted to a position that
will require me to give presentations to clients, trade
organizations and even our board of directors. Unfortunately, I'm
one of those people who freezes in front of a group. I've tried
picturing the audience in its underwear and a half-dozen other
tricks, but the moment the spotlight falls on me, I start babbling.
I'm thinking of signing up for public-speaking lessons, but I've
got a big speech to get through in a couple of weeks. Any survival
tips?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Scrunch your toes together several times. Seriously. ``It's
an isometric exercise that diverts a bit of the adrenaline edge,''
said Frank Carillo, president of the Executive Communications
Group, a consulting firm in Englewood, N.J. ``When a person starts
freaking out, it's because their adrenaline response is getting the
best of them. You don't want to shut off that response, but you
need to get the edge off.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ways to reduce stress include warming up your voice for a
few minutes before a presentation and, during your speech, talking
a bit louder than usual, Carillo added. ``This gets you breathing
more vigorously,'' he said, and the pumping of breath eases the
tension.
</P>
<P>
   As for the presentation, make sure the key points are clear in
your mind and stick to them, said Pam Keyzer, district governor of
the New York and New Jersey branch of Toastmasters International,
an organization that helps members sharpen their public-speaking
skills. ``Say what you have to say and then stop talking,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it focused and succinct, Carillo agreed. At high-level
meetings in particular, he advised, ``don't go in planning to make
an hour presentation with 75 slides.'' Your listeners will become
impatient and start interrupting you with questions to get the
information they want. ``And you will feel victimized,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid babbling, learn the value of strategic repetition. Many
speakers start rambling because they've lost their train of thought
and want to cover their lapse, Carillo said. Instead, pause and
reiterate a snippet of what you just finished saying. ``Most people
are such bad listeners they won't notice,'' he said, ``and it will
give you a second running start at the thinking process.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if someone asks you a tough question, repeat it
aloud. That not only insures that you (and the rest of the
audience) are clear on the question, but it also buys you valuable
thinking time, Ms. Keyzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to take a few seconds to formulate an answer. ``You
don't have to hit the button like you're on `Jeopardy,''' Carillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because many speakers feel overwhelmed by a sea of
faces in front of them, try focusing on just one person at a time.
``Don't ever try to talk to `the audience,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And forget about that picturing-people-in-their-underwear trick.
``That's not a pretty sight,'' he joked, ``with most senior
management groups.'' &QL;

EMERGENCY RESPONSE TIME COMES UNDER SCRUTINY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene was ``surreal'' when emergency crews reached the site
where American Flight 1420 crashed, one fire official said
Thursday. Passengers who had escaped the burning wreckage were
scattered in a boggy field. Some were ``walking wounded;'' others
seemed dazed and disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   For some, help came too late. Some may have perished in the
flames that erupted when the plane careened off the runway.
Authorities requested dental records from families to identify
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The crash has raised questions about how long it took emergency
crews to get the call alerting them to the crash in Little Rock,
Ark., and how long they took to reach the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not release the exact times that emergency crews
arrived. ``Some things we're not at liberty to say,'' said Al
Davis, Little Rock's fire chief, citing the National Transportation
Safety Board investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials estimated response time at seven minutes.
Others, including passengers, put the response time at 25 minutes
or more.
</P>
<P>
   That would be far longer than the three minutes required by the
Federal Aviation Administration. All commercial airports _
regardless of their acreage or passenger load _ are required to
have at least one fire engine at the center of any runway within
three minutes and a second one there a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the emphasis on time is that, when an aircraft is
on fire, the interior quickly can reach temperatures of 400 to 600
degrees Fahrenheit, Dallas/Fort Worth Airport firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first five or six minutes of a fire is critical,'' said
John Broyles, a systems engineer for Environmental Tectronics
Corp., a Florida company that sells aviation disaster-simulation
products. ``That's the time you need to break that fire down.''
</P>
<P>
   Help may have been delayed in Little Rock because for some time
after the crash, air traffic controllers were apparently unaware of
what had happened and continued to radio the crew with weather
updates, NTSB officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed about 11:50 p.m. Tuesday. Little Rock fire
officials said Thursday that they headed to the scene ``around
midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   A 911 call from a passenger at the scene was received about
12:07 a.m. Wednesday, officials said. It was unclear if that call
was the first time any emergency crews learned of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers said the wait added to their terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I circled three or four times around the airplane to help
people,'' Paul MacIntosh said, describing the scene before rescuers
arrived. ``A lot of things were occurring around the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, Brian Boyce, added: ``It seemed like forever.
It was just surreal, with all these people hurt like this, no
lights, no sirens, the plane burning. That was to me the worst
feeling about this whole thing. It was a very helpless feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very curious why after the first three or four minutes,
the tower couldn't know they had a problem and roll their own
trucks to look,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes of helping others, Boyce said he spotted
firefighters walking up a rock embankment and over a 15-foot
section of fence the plane barrelled through. Soon after, other
fire department units arrived on the rain-soaked and mushy
perimeter road and put out the fire using chemicals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three fire engines stationed at the airport went to find the
crash scene after possibly getting word from the tower that a jet
was missing from Runway 4R, Davis said, although he was unsure how
they learned of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Before medical personnel arrived, firefighters worked to put out
flames and to get people off the plane, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their main function is to extinguish the fire, open the
aircraft and get the people out,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as many as 85 emergency rescue and medical personnel and
more than 30 ambulances from Little Rock and surrounding areas
worked to help the injured and transport them to six area
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Wilkerson, a driver of a Little Rock fire engine, said
it took three minutes for him to get to the airport after he
learned of the crash and five more minutes to get to the crash
site. He did not know what time he started toward the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, he said, the worst wounds he saw were burns, some
over as much as 50 percent of some passengers' bodies. Some
supplies at the scene got depleted quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have had more blankets,'' Wilkerson said.
``Everybody was freezing to death.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at D/FW Airport's fire training center, officials
declined to discuss details of the Little Rock incident, but they
put on a emergency preparedness demonstration to show how emergency
crews learn to cope with such disasters. Firefighters from across
the nation come to the facility to practice putting out fires at
two simulated aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who trained at the facility last year were six
firefighters from Little Rock, said Capt. Bill Wekenborg, training
director for D/FW's Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Wekenborg said he did not know if any of those six firefighters
took part in the rescue effort after the American Airlines crash.
</P>
<P>
   Wekenborg stood outside the husk of a simulated aircraft
Thursday and pointed into the smoke that hid the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of fire that can usually happen on a plane,''
Wekenborg said. ``There is thick black smoke, and you can't even
see the fire. A lot of times everything is done by touch.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA standards require that small airports and large airports
have the same type of firefighting equipment, Broyles and Wekenborg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the airport fire department, that's one
budget that doesn't get cut,'' Broyles said. ``Those people
generally get whatever they need.'' (Star-Telegram writers Mitch

ROCHE EXERCISES ITS OPTION FOR ALL SHARES OF GENENTECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Roche Holding AG, the European drug maker, said
Thursday that it would exercise its right to buy the 33 percent of
Genentech Inc. it does not already own.
</P>
<P>
   Roche will then issue new shares equivalent to as much as 19
percent of Genentech, the pioneering biotechnology company, so it
can continue to be publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the option, Roche, based in Basel,
Switzerland, will pay $82.50 a share, or $4.2 billion, for the
remaining shares and options of Genentech, which is based in South
San Francisco. Terms of the new stock offering have not been
disclosed, but the sale should help Genentech maintain its
entrepreneurial culture and lets it offer stock options to attract
and retain key employees.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Genentech dropped on the news, closing at $82, down
$4.50, in NASDAQ trading on Thursday. Genentech shares have been as
high as $90 over the last year as investors bet that Roche would
let its option to buy the rest of the company expire. Roche had
until June 30 to exercise its option, which it has held since
buying its original stake in Genentech in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the transaction was good for Roche, which should
realize a gain when it sells shares, and good for Genentech, which
retains its quasi-independent status. But it is not so good for
shareholders, particularly if they bought shares within the last
few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Roche's point of view, it's a brilliant and creative
solution to a dilemma they faced,'' said Viren Mehta, an analyst
with Mehta Partners. ``From Genentech's point of view, we must
await precise terms of the additional rights Roche has obtained.
The current shareholders face a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche now has so-called opt-in rights, which let it obtain
marketing rights to new Genentech drugs when they have completed
the second of the three phases of clinical trials typically
required for approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Under
the new arrangement, Roche is expected to be able to extend those
rights to the completion of the third phase of trials, thus
virtually eliminating any risk that the drug might fail. Roche
might also add to its two seats on Genentech's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roche, in the end, I believe, concluded that they would not be
able to exercise their call option, exert 100 percent ownership and
control and still retain the growth prospects of the company,''
said Genentech president and chief executive Arthur Levinson in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson acknowledged that the deal did little for current
shareholders. ``Existing shareholders, particularly those that came
in recently, understandably will be disappointed, but it's hard for
me to imagine any remotely sophisticated investor not being aware
that Roche could take them out at $82.50,'' he said. ``To some
extent we were an arbitrage play between those that believed Roche
would exercise its call and those that believed Roche would not.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche's arrangement with Genentech is in contrast to its 1994
acquisition of Syntex, whose identity was rapidly submerged within
the parent company. ``We believe in the value and unique culture of
Genentech,'' said Roche chief executive Franz Humer in a statement.
By selling a portion of shares, Genentech ``will maintain its
independent operations as it continues to pursue its mission to
provide important products for patients and an opportunity for
financial growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Genentech was struggling, Roche passed on a
previous option to buy the remaining stake for $60 a share. But
under the management of Levinson, who took over as chief executive
in 1995, Genentech has delivered a string of breakthrough drugs,
including Herceptin, the first gene-based therapy for breast
cancer, and steady growth in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Levinson's strategy has been to increase earnings per
share to a level where a reasonable price-earnings multiple would
put the share price above Roche's option, thus prompting Roche to
keep the company semi-independent. Toward this end, he spent
heavily on research and development in the early 1990s to build the
company's pipeline of drugs and has cut back in recent years to
lift the bottom line. But the strategy may have worked too well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really rather sad because Art Levinson and his team have
really done a fantastic job of returning Genentech to its former
glory,'' said Richard van den Broek, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genentech is the most powerful drug development engine in all
of pharmaceuticals'' he said, noting that of 18 drugs in the late
stage of development at Roche, 8 came from Genentech. ``That is
exactly why Roche exercised its option. They couldn't afford to let
it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's founding scientist, Herbert Boyer, pioneered the
process of splicing together DNA to produce therapeutic proteins.
Genentech's performance has been consistent in recent years, but
there have been some setbacks this year, including the clinical
failures of a drug to promote nerve growth in diabetes patients and
a protein-based drug to stimulate the growth of blood vessels.

EUROPEANS IMPRESSED BY THEIR UNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gerhard Schroeder, the German chancellor and current
president of the European Union, opened Thursday night's news
conference in Cologne, Germany, with the words, ``This is a good
day for Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the bombing campaign 10 weeks ago, European
leaders have emphasized that the Kosovo conflict was being fought
on the fringe of Europe to protest activity condemned under
European values by a Yugoslav regime led by Slobodan Milosevic who
by his actions had given up any claim to being accepted as a
European.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the most combative
proponent of the war, heads of governments appealed for popular
support by recalling the particular responsibilities borne by a
continent where some 50 million people have died in wars during
this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Europe, the war is about more than the singular wickedness
of Milosevic,'' said Philip Stephens in a column for The Financial
Times. ``The rape of Kosovo is an affront to the Continent's
self-image. It awakens the demons of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   All 19 NATO members, some like Greece, Italy and Germany with
considerable levels of internal dissent, maintained support for the
air campaign to a degree that apparently surprised Milosevic,
pleased senior NATO diplomats and even impressed the Europeans
themselves, who have had ample reason to be skeptical about the
Continent's ability to live up to its own claims of togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people I talk to have been surprised that the coalition
held together the way it did,'' said David Hine, a fellow of Christ
Church College, Oxford, whose speciality is the politics of
European integration. ``Two or three years ago, the Italian
moderate left or the Greens would have never held on for this.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some sense of shame in European capitals four years
ago when the conflict in Bosnia, a crisis that many European
leaders said would be a test of the Continent's ability to build a
common political will and to act with the force of unity, ended up
being settled in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put simply, we failed then,'' Hine said. ``The question is,
have we passed the test this time? The answer, I suppose, is yes,
but the cynical answer is yes, with the help of American command
and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the realization that the Europeans had finally
succeeded in coming together for a common purpose and beating back
individual national pressures, the war brought clear evidence that
they cannot mount military campaigns without the dominant
assistance of the United States. Most of the air power deployed in
the Kosovo operation has been American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite years of grumbling about the need to enhance the
defense capacity of Europe, the reality is that Europeans are even
more dependent on the U.S. than during the Cold War,'' said Gerald
Segal, director of studies at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Blair enjoyed support in Britain for his aggressive push for a
no-compromise solution and the possible commitment of combat troops
to Kosovo, and President Jacques Chirac held a firm line in France
and Thursday night praised the ``solidarity of the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But other European leaders had to stand back from hard-line
positions to keep followers from withdrawing support for NATO.
Schroeder, whose coalition depends upon the cooperation of Green
Party members eager to see a halt in the bombing and a negotiated
end to the war, had to separate himself from Blair's pugnacious
statements, declaring the discussions over ground troops a
``specifically British debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany came up with the first peace plan in mid-April, when
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer produced a proposal, notably
including the Russians, that would have rewarded the beginning of a
Yugoslav pullout from Kosovo with a bombing pause.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema supported NATO, sent
Italian troops to Macedonia, dispatched aid for refugees and
allowed bombing raids from Italian soil but did so in the teeth of
deep opposition from the leftist groups that form the base of his
government's political survival.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's seeming breakthrough was greeted with particular
fervor and relief in Rome and in Athens, where the Greek government
was also cooperating in the NATO effort while holding off
overwhelming public opposition to the aerial war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It has been a trying year for European institutions, with the
entire European Commission in Brussels, Belgium, forced to resign
after allegations of cronyism and mismanagement and the European
single currency going into an unanticipated swoon after its festive
launching.
</P>
<P>
   The euro made its debut on Jan. 1 with 11 countries signed up
and hopes high that it would challenge the dollar. Instead it has
fallen 12 percent from its opening value of $1.17 to Thursday's
level of $1.03.
</P>
<P>
   If it dips below the dollar, its credibility as an alternative
to the U.S. currency will be severely dented.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Gretschmann, an adviser to Schroeder, said Thursday that
moves toward peace in the Balkans would reverse the euro's falling
fortunes. ``If we get more news from Yugoslavia, then I am sure
that it will strengthen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in European budget discipline was undermined last
week by a deal allowing Italy to escape tough European rules on
deficits. On the other hand, the deal displayed a new flexibility
on the part of Europe since the favorable treatment was extended to
Italy in the knowledge that D'Alema was facing difficulties at home
shoring up support for the NATO campaign and needed evidence that
there was something for Italy in holding to European unity.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the European Commission president-designate, Romano
Prodi, set out plans in Cologne to overhaul the disgraced executive
body, saying he would merge portfolios to put an end to past
favoritism and duplication.
</P>
<P>
   There are elections June 13 for the members of the 626-seat
European Parliament in Strasbourg. The Legislature has grown in
stature this year since it was its members who successfully
challenged the continuation in office of the members of the
commission.

EWING LIGHTS A FIRE UNDER HIS UNDERMANNED TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The Knicks had just finished stretching on the
practice floor when they drifted toward Patrick Ewing and huddled
in front of him as if they were at a bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   They took a peek at the plastic boot protecting his torn
Achilles' tendon, stared up at his square jaw and weary eyes, and
listened to a superstar who, in a very Ewing-esque way, inspired
them as he demanded a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them before practice started that I believe in them,
and for them to go out there and get me my ring,'' Ewing said
Thursday with a smile. ``They're ready. They're ready to get it for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And so a defiant mood was struck for a team that tends to hook
itself up to adversity as if it were an intravenous dripping
adrenaline into its bloodstream. After the stunning diagnosis of
Ewing's season-ending injury was made on Wednesday _ when a partial
tear of his Achilles' tendon was discovered _ his teammates moved
past their dismay, embraced their aging superstar after his brief
message Thursday and proceeded to have one of their most intense
practices of the shason.
</P>
<P>
   There was a definite edge to the Knicks that extended from the
10 healthy players left on the roster _ all of whom seem undaunted
by the task of facing the Indiana Pacers for Game 3 of their
Eastern Conference final on Saturday _ to the prickly demeanor of
Coach Jeff Van Gundy. Instead of striking a somber tone of a coach
who had just lost his center, he struck back at the Pacers for
their vocal attempts to change the tone of officiating between
Games 1 and 2. In Game 1, the Knicks won and were called for 27
personal fouls. In Game 2, the Knicks lost on their way to
absorbing 40 foul calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the NBA has come to a point where the way you
try to win in the playoffs is by whining,'' Van Gundy said. ``And
they whined about everything. They're a great team, and I know
they're trying to take over for Chicago, but they didn't have to do
it in the whining category.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to grouse, of course, but Van Gundy did discuss the matter
on Wednesday with Rod Thorn, the league's vice president of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to him, but it's not about him,'' Van Gundy said.
``It's about what's going to be called in the heat of battle.''
</P>
<P>
   By complaining, Van Gundy was returning a volley Coach Larry
Bird began when he noted the Knicks' physical play in Game 1. And
now, without Ewing, each whistle is going to carry more weight.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley, Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby have all found
themselves in foul trouble at one time or another in this series.
Although Van Gundy did not name a starter at center _ which has
usually been Dudley when Ewing has been out in the past _ all three
big men will be critical to the Knicks' success. Without Ewing as a
post presence, there is less opportunity to lure Rik Smits into
foul trouble. Without Ewing, there is a hole in the Knicks'
defensive rebounding and a vacuum in their offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks have managed great stretches against Indiana
without Ewing, such as the 17-4 run they went on during the second
half of Game 2. During that game, the Knicks made up for their
deficiencies with speed in transition and lively play on defense.
Now, everyone will see if the uptempo style run by Latrell
Sprewell, Childs and Camby _ a look that has grown in popularity
with some Knicks critics _ has the legs to carry them through the
playoffs in Ewing's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days ago, Ewing seemed prepared for the push to the end
on his sore Achilles' tendon. He was told by doctors months ago
that he couldn't damage it any further, but as he explained today,
he knew something was wrong when he felt a tearing sensation as he
jogged through the layup line before Tuesday's Game 2. He played
on, in visible pain, but late that night, as the injury showed
signs of swelling, a decision was made to have a magnetic resonance
imaging test on Wednesday morning as a precaution. Or so he
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and disappointed,'' said Ewing, who fought back
from wrist surgery and a four-month absence last season. ``It was
rough. After going through what I did last year with my wrist, to
have to go through this now is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It is especially difficult for a player two months shy of his
37th birthday, a player who has been through an often-jinxed
14-year journey to achieve the one thing he has never accomplished:
winning a title. If that championship occurs this season, Ewing
will let the confetti fall on him as he stands on the court in
street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still part of this team,'' Ewing said. ``I'm still going
to be on the sideline cheering them on, patting them on the back
and cursing them out. Whatever I have to do to help the team win.''

ANGELS IN FAMILY FEUD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- As talks between the Angels and Terry Collins about a
contract extension for the club's manager proceed, general manager
Bill Bavasi has found himself in the middle of a family feud.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi met with a small group of Angels players Wednesday
afternoon to discuss Collins' status with the team. The group of
players, who initiated the meeting, is apparently unhappy with
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi is unhappy that word of the meeting got out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a huge bite taken out of the trust that existed
between the organization and the players,'' he said. ``A player, or
players, in the meeting or who knew of the meeting, within a
half-hour chose to talk to a writer. That's a bitter pill to
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some players who are so unhappy with Collins,
according to a source close to the team, they have implied they
would strongly consider leaving if Collins returns. Of course, only
players eligible for free agency would have that option.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the group of players eligible for free agency at
season's end are pitcher Chuck Finley and second baseman Randy
Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, who refused to identify any of the players involved, was
asked what Angels management thought of the job Collins was doing
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're asking for is a vote of confidence, and that is
absolute garbage,'' he said. ``The club has shown a lot of heart
and I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi also said he is doing everything he can to difuse the
situation, which he says is not so unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are employers, like any other company,'' he said. ``When
employees have complaints, concerns or questions, it's our
responsibility to listen. We take it seriously. We evaluate it
seriously. To the extent any employee is dissatisfied with what I'm
doing, or what Terry is doing, we'll look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Collins said he's not concerned about
having everyone like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never going to be a manager in the game that can
please 25 guys, it's impossible,'' he said. ``You make decisions,
and any decision you make, somebody's not going to like it.''

MO BACK AT FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Mo Vaughn will be back at first base tonight against
the Dodgers, because he has no choice. In the National League
ballparks -- the Angels play three at Dodger Stadium and three in
San Francisco in the next six days -- there is no DH spot for
Vaughn and his sore left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hasn't played first base since May 9 at Boston, when it
was obvious that his ankle would not allow him to play in the
field. The decision has been a good one as Vaughn has hit well in
the DH spot and struggled at the plate when playing first base.
</P>
<P>
   He's hitting .328 with 12 homers and 37 RBIs as a DH, and only
.095 (2 for 21) with one homer and two RBIs as a first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited, Vaughn said about playing first again. ``To tell
you the truth, I'm surprised about the success I've had DH-ing.
It's not my style. I like to get a sweat going. My last couple of
at-bats the last couple of nights, I've been freezing cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also said he's looking forward to playing at Dodger
Stadium for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of history there, and I'm into that,'' he said.
``You talk about rivalries, I was a part of one between Boston and
New York. If you can't be excited about that, something's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charlie O'Brien heard a pop in the bottom of his right
foot and he ran toward first base in the second inning Wednesday
night and had to leave the game. He was scheduled to have an MRI
exam performed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time through the starting rotation, the five Angels
starters have combined to give up 10 earned runs in 40 innings,
going 4-0 (one no-decision) with an ERA of 2.25. All five pitched
at least seven innings, four of the five pitched at least eight
innings and two pitched into the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a horrendous May at the plate (.130, 12 for 92), third
baseman Troy Glaus is on a pace to break the Angels record for
doubles in a season. With 17 doubles, he's on a pace for 52. The
team record is 42, held by Jim Edmonds (1998), Johnny Ray (1988)
and Doug DeCinces (1982).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and Angels have played eight regular season games
since interleague play begin in 1997, the Dodgers holding a 5-3
lead.

Clinton's action, but the debate is expected to be heated. And
hopes are fading that Clinton can win congressional approval for
Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization before the next
round of international trade talks in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   As one indication of the trouble now facing U.S.-China
relations, Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., who has supported normal
trade relations with China throughout his four years in Congress,
said Thursday he is now ``undecided and gravely concerned.'' The
other 10 members of the state's congressional delegation, although
expressing a variety of concerns about China's behavior, continue
to support normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted Thursday that maintaining normal trade
relations with China is in U.S. interests because of a rapid
increase in U.S. exports to China. But in a statement issued just a
day before Friday's 10th anniversary of the Chinese massacre of
protesters at Tiananmen Square, Clinton acknowledged widespread
concerns about China's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursue engagement with our eyes wide open, without
illusions,'' he said. ``We continue to speak frankly about our
differences and to firmly protect our national interests. A policy
of disengagement and confrontation would only strengthen those in
China who oppose greater openness and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, U.S.-China relations seemed to be on an
upswing. China offered to lift a 27-year ban on the importation of
Northwest wheat as part of a broad package of trade concessions,
and the two countries appeared to be on track to negotiate China's
accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 7, NATO forces accidently bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, killing three people. That was followed by several
days of anti-Western demonstrations in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a House committee headed by Reps. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., and Norm Dicks, D-Wash., reported that China had
succeeded in stealing design information about all seven nuclear
warheads currently deployed on American missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had lousy counterintelligence at our national
labs is something we should be embarrassed about, but we should not
change our basic relationship with China,'' Dicks said. ``We're
cleaning up our mess, but I don't think we should create another
one by trying to go to a Cold War setting with China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly anybody would say that this is a very difficult time
to pass legislation giving normal trade relations to China,'' said
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. ``I think it will pass ... but what I'm
worried about is that there will be so much Red Scare-ing ... that
we will lose sight of the larger goal, which is to involve the
Chinese in the community of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's Republican members of Congress are more
inclined to blame Clinton than China for the spying episode, and,
with the exception of Metcalf, they do not believe the spying
debate should be tied to trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be surprised that there are people spying on
us,'' said Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash. ``Our surprise should be when
we discover that we don't act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   China is the fourth largest trading partner of the United
States, which last year exported $14.3 billion of goods to China
and imported $71.2 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington state, where two-way trade with China ranks third
largest among Asia-Pacific nations at nearly $10 billion in 1997,
there are a variety of economic issues at stake. Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., said he supports normal trade relations with
China because of the importance of winning better access to Chinese
markets for eastern Washington agricultural products. Rep. Jay
Inslee, D-Wash., said normal relations would allow a tougher
crackdown on software piracy in China that would help companies
like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the state's largest employer, will be leading the charge
in favor of normal relations through its chairman, Philip Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade with China is a cornerstone of a stable U.S.-China
relationship, and presents Americans with unprecedented
opportunities with the world's most populous country,'' Condit
said. ``Normal trade relations with China not only sustains
hundreds of thousands of export and import-related jobs, but it
also supports U.S. companies operating in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said that ``In the long run, when
individual members of Congress are looking at the 5,000 concessions
China has made, they're going to think of their own districts, and
when they see the benefits for the high-tech community, for the
beef producers, for the wheat farmers, then we will move away from
the current contentious atmosphere and look at reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., in the past a skeptical voice on
U.S.-China relations, this year said that he would support
permanent normal trade relations with China based on a series of
concessions agreed to this spring. Gorton is now worried that the
deal with China may have fallen apart, but if Clinton reconstructs
it, Gorton has pledged to help him win permanent normal relations
in the Senate, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The three other members of the state's congressional delegation,
Republican Jennifer Dunn and Democrats Brian Baird and Adam Smith,
support normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has normal trade relations with most
countries. The status, formerly known as most favored nation,
allows countries low tariffs when exporting to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The president must decide each year whether to renew normal
trade relations with countries like China that do not grant their
residents freedom of emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has 60 days to overturn a president's action on trade
relations, but has done so only once, in 1989, shortly after
Tiananmen Square. President Bush vetoed that action, and Congress
failed to override his veto.

HOT TIMES FOR NHRA COMPETITORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summertime? When the living is easy?
</P>
<P>
   Not for National Hot Rod Association competitors, who start the
dreaded summer season when opening-round qualifying begins today
for this weekend's Route 66 Nationals in Joliet, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Summertime in the NHRA usually means competing in hot weather
conditions on very slippery race tracks. That sometimes spells
trouble for Top Fuel and Funny Car crew chiefs who must find a way
to control their 6,000-horsepower machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer is always the key (to the championship),'' said
Tony Pedregon, who along with teammate John Force, is one of only
two Funny Car drivers to win a national event this season. ``I said
that even after the first couple of races that we won. Once we get
on these tracks (in the summer), like Chicago (Joliet), Columbus
(Ohio), and (Indianapolis) to an extent, it gets a little hot and a
little tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like some of the lesser power cars get down tracks
like that. They've proved that time after time, and that's going to
be the true test. Whoever can make that swing in the summer, is
definitley going to make the difference in the championship. It's
going to be very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   One who might have an advantage in Top Fuel is two-time
defending champion Gary Scelzi, whose most recent win was on
Atlanta Dragway's slick and hot asphalt. ``Now that we are in the
heat of the summer and on the slicker race tracks, there are only a
few guys who have a handle on it,'' Scelzi said. ``I feel that
after Atlanta, (crew chief Alan Johnson) has real good tuneup for
slick tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan is really good at controlling tire spin from halftrack
on. We did very well at all the slippery race tracks last year, so
I think (the summer) kind of plays into our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   It also might work well for five-time champion Kenny Bernstein,
who completed the three-race stretch at Chicago, Columbus and St.
Louis with two wins and a runner-up finish.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Skuza, who has finished in the top 10 in the Funny Car
points standings in each of the past three seasons, announced this
week that he and long-time crew chief Ronnie Swearingen have parted
company.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Lance Larsen, who was co-crew chief with Swearingen of
Skuza's Dodge, will assume all crew chief duties.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the second such change in the Funny Car division.
Joe Gibbs Racing dismissed veteran driver Cruz Pedregon in a mutual
agreement last week.
</P>
<P>
   Covina native Randy Anderson will drive the Gibbs Pontiac Funny
Car this weekend before Tommy Johnson Jr. takes over the seat on a
permanent basis next week.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR driver Dale Jarrett said he wouldn't mind going winless
in a season if he could trade it for the Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Top Fueler Bernstein isn't sure if he agrees with that,
but that doesn't mean he is disappointed about his peformance after
nine races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy I guess because the consistency is there,'' said the
five-time NHRA champion, who is third in points, 108 behind leader
Mike Dunn. ``We're certainly in the points chase. But on the other
side, I'm a little disappointed that we haven't won a race yet.
It's a strange deal, a bit different from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine. I happy with (the start), we just need to win a
race or two to make things a little better.'' &QL;

MORE RANKINGS FOR BCS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commissioners of the six conferences tied into the Bowl
Championship Series will meet later this month to decide which --
if any -- computer rankings should be added to the survey that
determines the nation's top college football team, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, featuring the Pac-10, Big Ten, Atlantic Coast, Big
East, Southeastern and Big 12 conferences, and Notre Dame, will be
held in Newport, R.I. from June 20-23.
</P>
<P>
   It has attracted the attention of a different breed of college
football fan -- university mathematicians who have developed
programs that rank NCAA Division I teams.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these mathematicians and hobbyists post their findings
in the Internet newsgroup rec.sport.football.college. Most would
love to see the inclusion of more computer polls in the BCS formula
and several hope that they will be chosen to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a really good idea to add more computers,'' said
Ross Baker, an Indiana University computer science grad student who
has his own ranking system.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS promises college football fans that the top two teams in
the country will play for the national championship during New
Year's week. In its current configuration, the championship game
rotates among the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta and Rose bowls.
</P>
<P>
   This year the championship was played at the Fiesta Bowl. The
Sugar Bowl will serve as host for the game on Jan. 4, 2000. The
Rose Bowl will be the host in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Last year BCS standings were determined by a combination of
national polls, won-loss records, strength of competition and
computer rankings. Those rankings come from the New York Times, the
Seattle Times and college sports guru Jeff Sagarin of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Still the system can't get a consensus. Many believe more
computers will help smooth out irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good because the polls (of sportswriters and coaches)
don't take into account a team's strength of schedule enough,''
Baker said. ``(Last year) it seemed that the BCS was more about
picking the hottest team.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be pitfalls. If the college football Internet
newsgroup is any indication, many of the computer gurus are more
likely to know the names -- and correct spellings -- of Star Wars
characters than the name of their university's second-string middle
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilson, a University of Wisconsin mathematician whose
ranking system is being considered for inclusion by the BCS,
readily admits he's never been to a college football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in the mathematics of it,'' said Wilson, who
also maintains a web site devoted to the various computer rankings.
``The problem is that there is no official champion. On the other
hand, nobody would be interested in this if there was a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, in math terms, the problem becomes, how does one think
that the champion should be picked?,'' Wilson said. ``It's an
interesting math problem that has no one right answer.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Pac-10 is concerned, the more computers the
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine with us,'' said Jim Muldoon, assistant
commissioner in charge of public relations. ``One the reason
there's more than one computer (used by the BCS) to start with, is
that it makes this more legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more computer rankings you have out there, the less
important any one is,'' he said. ``It makes it so that one computer
doesn't have undue influence. It's a good idea.''

 &HT;    Authorities release report on jailed Mexican who died
 &HT;    By Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Juan Campos was arrested at his Austin home this
spring on a 2-year-old misdemeanor charge, booked into the Travis
County Jail and died after 18 days in custody from a mysterious
blow to the head.
</P>
<P>
   That much is certain from a 50-page report on Campos' May 12
death the sheriff's department provided Thursday. But the report,
which suggests Campos injured himself by banging his head, says no
one saw or heard Campos hurt himself. It also raises questions
about whether he was adequately cared for and supervised.
</P>
<P>
   Campos is among 21 inmates who have died in the sheriff's
department's custody in the last 10 years. Virtually all deaths
were from suicide or illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Campos, 35, was first found lying on the floor of his cell about
3:45 a.m. on May 11, but jailers didn't realize he was in danger
until more than six hours later. He was taken to Brackenridge
Hospital at 11:30 a.m. where doctors said he was already brain
dead. He died the next morning in the intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   A week before he died, Campos was moved from a closely
supervised medical unit where inmates are checked every 15 minutes
to a second-floor ``psych'' block where he was isolated but checked
only hourly.
</P>
<P>
   The jail's medical staff said Campos was suffering from extreme
withdrawal from alcohol _ hallucinating, talking gibberish and
walking into walls _ up to the day he was found comatose. A
psychiatrist who evaluated him May 8 found him incompetent to stand
trial, but Campos died before a hearing that probably would have
sent him to the Austin State Hospital, said Dr. Richard Coons.
</P>
<P>
   Det. Stan Roper of the sheriff's department, who investigated
the death for potential criminal wrongdoing, said he found nothing
to indicate that anyone intentionally hurt or neglected Campos. But
he questioned the hours Campos was left on the floor of his cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say who's at fault there,'' Roper said. ``Was
something wrong and they just didn't see it?''
</P>
<P>
   Roper's report also quotes corrections officers who disagreed
with a nurse's decision to transfer Campos to the less-supervised
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The death will be further investigated by the Travis County
district attorney's office, which may refer the matter to a grand
jury, and by the sheriff's internal affairs division, which will
send the case to the state attorney general's office. Those
procedures are routine for inmate deaths, said Sheriff Margo
Frasier.
</P>
<P>
   Campos, a Mexican citizen who lived in Travis County for nearly
20 years, was unmarried and had many relatives in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief conversation Wednesday, Felipe Nun(tilde)ez said he's
angry about his brother's death, which is also being investigated
by the Mexican consulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know exactly what happened and how it happened,'' he
said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Cortez of the consulate said the family had requested
help, but she declined to define the scope of the consulate's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Campos' autopsy report lists the cause of death as a subdural
hematoma, or bleeding in the brain, ``probably sustained by
striking his head against a wall in his jail cell,'' wrote Travis
County Medical Examiner Roberto Bayardo.
</P>
<P>
   Bayardo said Thursday the injury ocurred no more than a few
hours before Campos was found lying unconscious on floor. Bayardo
said he was told by sheriff's deputies that Campos hit his head
against the wall at various times.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Roper's report says that Campos banged his head
against the wall, though several are quoted saying he couldn't get
up without help and frequently fell. Roper said no one heard any
noise from Campos' cell the hours before he died.
</P>
<P>
   The report gives this chronology:
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 a.m. on May 11, a jailer saw Campos trying to open a
cell window. He told the guard, ``The taco lady is trying to shut
the garage door and I want to get some tacos.'' The jailer notified
a nurse of the behavior, and she said she would evaluate him during
her rounds, three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:35 a.m., the nurse saw Campos standing in his cell. When
she went in a few minutes later, he was lying on the floor on his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse checked him and noticed his hair was wet. She looked
for cuts and bruises but saw none. Campos swallowed two pills and
she left, giving instructions that he be monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Guards reported that he stayed in the same position, snoring,
with his eyes open and unblinking. One guard told others Campos
appeared dead but wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   After Campos missed two meals, a guard called another nurse at
10:30 a.m. She and other staff tried to revive him. An ambulance
came at 11:15 a.m. One guard who rode with him to Brackenridge said
Campos was bleeding from the nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Campos' 18 days in jail started April 24 when Austin police
arrested him on an outstanding warrant stemming from a criminal
trespass charge in 1997. A videotape of Campos being booked at the
jail shows him acting normally, the report says. However, the
booking form indicated he might be suicidal, so he was referred to
the medical unit.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few days, Campos was restrained five times,
either by handcuffs or soft leather straps, to prevent him from
falling and hurting himself. He spoke incoherently but didn't
communicate with anyone, including his court-appointed attorney,
Wade Russell of Austin.

AIRBORNE MAKES E-COMMERCE DEAL WITH POSTAL SERVICE FOR FASTER
DELIVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Airborne Express plans to enter the booming electronic
commerce market in July by joining forces with the U.S. Postal
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Airborne, exclusively a business-to-business delivery service
until now, has missed out on much of the growth of e-commerce.
Internet retailers have relied mostly on United Parcel Service or
Federal Express because those companies ship directly to customers'
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Seattle-based Airborne promises to move a package to
one of the Postal Service's 24,000 hubs within two days. Then, the
Post Office will deliver the order to the customer the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Airborne &LR; Home, as the new service is known, involves only a
handful of clients in its initial test. But Airborne executives
have little doubt they will expand the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge potential opportunity because the market is
enormous,'' said Kent Freudenberger, executive vice president of
marketing at Airborne Express. ``It's millions and millions of
dollars'' of potential business.
</P>
<P>
   Freudenberger, however, said it is too early to estimate how
much revenue the company could eventually earn from its new
venture.
</P>
<P>
   The Post Office opened the door for Airborne and others in
January when it offered discounts to shippers for the first time.
The discounts made it cost effective for Airborne, according to the
company's executives. In the past, Airborne, along with other
shippers, avoided the residential market because of its high costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it made economic sense for us,'' Airborne's
Freudenberger said. Now, Airborne, the third-largest U.S.
express-freight carrier, will compete with the No. 1 carrier,
Federal Express Corp., owned by FDX Corp., and United Parcel
Service of America Inc. for a piece of the residential shipping
pie. All three firms are particularly interested in tapping the
burgeoning e-commerce market.
</P>
<P>
   That's because retail sales on the Internet are expected to
explode in the next three years, with sales estimated to rise by as
much as 75 percent to $75 billion by 2002, from $8 billion in 1998,
according to a report from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them a platform in the new medium which is
e-commerce,'' said Jeffrey Pittsburg, a partner at Goldis-Pittsburg
Institutional Services. ``It will boost the bottom line
significantly'' over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, RPS Inc., a subsidiary of Federal Express, launched its
own plan to test the residential market last week. If the test goes
well, the firm could begin a full-fledged service as early as 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While Airborne is following Federal Express's lead, it is
launching a more ambitious program, according to financial
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bought the infrastructure (from the Post Office)
basically,'' said Alex Brand, a research analyst for Richmond,
Virginia-based Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Airborne is already promising consumers it will be able to
deliver products up to 60 percent faster than competing services.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors welcomed the deal, pushing the stock of Airborne
Express's parent, Airborne Freight Corp., up 3 7/8, or 16 percent,
to 28 9/16 in trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is completely sold on the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the jury is still out over whether the
Seattle-based carrier can balance the need to offer low prices to
attract clients with the drive to generate profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's all predicated on their ability to
generate large volumes from shippers,'' said Scott &AMP; Stringfellow's
Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers will also lose their ability to track packages once the
Post Office picks them up under the Airborne system.

CLINTON RENEWS CHINA TRADE STATUS AMID ROCKY RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday renewed normal trade
relations with China, setting off an annual congressional debate
complicated this year by allegations that China has stolen U.S.
nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers expect Congress to muster enough votes to overturn
Clinton's action, but the debate is expected to be heated. And
hopes are fading that Clinton can win congressional approval for
Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization before the next
round of international trade talks in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   As one indication of the trouble now facing U.S.-China
relations, Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., who has supported normal
trade relations with China throughout his four years in Congress,
said Thursday he is now ``undecided and gravely concerned.'' The
other 10 members of the state's congressional delegation, although
expressing a variety of concerns about China's behavior, continue
to support normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted Thursday that maintaining normal trade
relations with China is in U.S. interests because of a rapid
increase in U.S. exports to China. But in a statement issued just a
day before Friday's 10th anniversary of the Chinese massacre of
protesters at Tiananmen Square, Clinton acknowledged widespread
concerns about China's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pursue engagement with our eyes wide open, without
illusions,'' he said. ``We continue to speak frankly about our
differences and to firmly protect our national interests. A policy
of disengagement and confrontation would only strengthen those in
China who oppose greater openness and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, U.S.-China relations seemed to be on an
upswing. China offered to lift a 27-year ban on the importation of
Northwest wheat as part of a broad package of trade concessions,
and the two countries appeared to be on track to negotiate China's
accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 7, NATO forces accidently bombed the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade, killing three people. That was followed by several
days of anti-Western demonstrations in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a House committee headed by Reps. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., and Norm Dicks, D-Wash., reported that China had
succeeded in stealing design information about all seven nuclear
warheads currently deployed on American missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had lousy counterintelligence at our national
labs is something we should be embarrassed about, but we should not
change our basic relationship with China,'' Dicks said. ``We're
cleaning up our mess, but I don't think we should create another
one by trying to go to a Cold War setting with China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly anybody would say that this is a very difficult time
to pass legislation giving normal trade relations to China,'' said
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. ``I think it will pass ... but what I'm
worried about is that there will be so much Red Scare-ing ... that
we will lose sight of the larger goal, which is to involve the
Chinese in the community of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's Republican members of Congress are more
inclined to blame Clinton than China for the spying episode, and,
with the exception of Metcalf, they do not believe the spying
debate should be tied to trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be surprised that there are people spying on
us,'' said Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash. ``Our surprise should be when
we discover that we don't act on it.''
</P>
<P>
   China is the fourth largest trading partner of the United
States, which last year exported $14.3 billion of goods to China
and imported $71.2 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington state, where two-way trade with China ranks third
largest among Asia-Pacific nations at nearly $10 billion in 1997,
there are a variety of economic issues at stake. Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., said he supports normal trade relations with
China because of the importance of winning better access to Chinese
markets for eastern Washington agricultural products. Rep. Jay
Inslee, D-Wash., said normal relations would allow a tougher
crackdown on software piracy in China that would help companies
like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the state's largest employer, will be leading the charge
in favor of normal relations through its chairman, Philip Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade with China is a cornerstone of a stable U.S.-China
relationship, and presents Americans with unprecedented
opportunities with the world's most populous country,'' Condit
said. ``Normal trade relations with China not only sustains
hundreds of thousands of export and import-related jobs, but it
also supports U.S. companies operating in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said that ``In the long run, when
individual members of Congress are looking at the 5,000 concessions
China has made, they're going to think of their own districts, and
when they see the benefits for the high-tech community, for the
beef producers, for the wheat farmers, then we will move away from
the current contentious atmosphere and look at reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., in the past a skeptical voice on
U.S.-China relations, this year said that he would support
permanent normal trade relations with China based on a series of
concessions agreed to this spring. Gorton is now worried that the
deal with China may have fallen apart, but if Clinton reconstructs
it, Gorton has pledged to help him win permanent normal relations
in the Senate, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The three other members of the state's congressional delegation,
Republican Jennifer Dunn and Democrats Brian Baird and Adam Smith,
support normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has normal trade relations with most
countries. The status, formerly known as most favored nation,
allows countries low tariffs when exporting to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The president must decide each year whether to renew normal
trade relations with countries like China that do not grant their
residents freedom of emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has 60 days to overturn a president's action on trade
relations, but has done so only once, in 1989, shortly after
Tiananmen Square. President Bush vetoed that action, and Congress
failed to override his veto.

   WASHINGTON _ New technology and a global economy are pushing the
labor market to 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week operations, increasing
the number of fatigued drivers on American roads, a federal report
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the
National Center on Sleep Disorders Research at the National
Institutes of Health reported to Congress that shift workers and
young men, especially those driving long trips with late-night
hours, were the most vulnerable to fatigue-related automobile
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 traffic deaths and 40,000 injuries occur each
year at least in part because of fatigue, said Ricardo Martinez,
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, the number of people on evening, night, rotating or
split shifts rose by 30 percent, while the overall work force rose
23 percent. More than 15 million workers are now employed on a
nondaytime shift.

TIMES MIRROR CEO STEPPING DOWN AS L.A. TIMES PUBLISHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co. chief executive Mark H. Willes
stepped down Thursday as publisher of the Los Angeles Times after
20 controversy-filled months and named second-in-command Kathryn M.
Downing to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Willes was an executive at cereal maker General Mills when he
joined Times Mirror in 1995 and pledged to reinvent the newspaper
business. In naming Downing as publisher, he said the foundation
has been laid for significant gains in profits and revenues. ``The
time is right for me to step back and allow Kathryn to continue to
lead the revitalization of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Willes, 57, remains Times Mirror chairman, chief executive
officer and president.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper world was surprised when Willes took the reins of
one of the nation's largest newspaper publishing companies in
mid-1995. Among his first moves was slashing 800 jobs at the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was delighted and Times Mirror's long-depressed
stock price rocketed upward. But Willes' promise to boost
circulation by 500,000 has been unfulfilled, and recently the
company's stock performance has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with reporters Thursday, Willes
acknowledged that many executives have departed during his reign
because of other opportunities and disagreements over strategy. But
he emphasized that he has become ``increasingly comfortable and
confident'' with the senior management team.
</P>
<P>
   Downing, 46, was named president and chief executive officer of
the Times 15 months ago. She joined Times Mirror as head of its
legal publishing arm in 1995.

JUSTICE OFFICIALS CLOSE TO DECISION ON INDICTING A CHINESE
AEROSPACE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a diplomatically sensitive case, the Justice
Department is nearing a decision on whether to indict one of
China's most powerful state-owned corporations, law-enforcement
officials and lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Some career prosecutors in the department have recommended the
indictment of the corporation, CATIC, an aerospace giant, on
charges of buying American machining equipment for civilian use in
1994 and diverting some of it to a military plant, the officials
and lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment was sold to the Chinese by McDonnell Douglas, now
part of The Boeing Co., which has also been under criminal
investigation for possible violations of U.S. export laws.
</P>
<P>
   But the current chill in relations between Beijing and
Washington and congressional scrutiny of the case has complicated
the decision. Law-enforcement officials said they were unaware of
any previous case in which the United States had indicted a Chinese
government entity on the scale of CATIC, the China National
Aero-Technology Import Export Corp.
</P>
<P>
   CATIC agreed with the Justice Department last month to extend
the deadline for filing charges, the officials and lawyers said. It
was five years ago that McDonnell Douglas applied for a Commerce
Department license to sell the machining equipment to CATIC, which
buys and sells civilian aerospace technology.
</P>
<P>
   Since the extension, the parties have been in a ``continuing
dialogue,'' and CATIC has discussed the possibility of paying a
civil penalty to resolve the case, one lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Van Gelder, CATIC's lawyer in Washington, said Thursday
that ``we are exploring a settlement with the Justice Department
and the Commerce Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department can impose civil penalties for
violations of export control laws and could bar CATIC and its
affiliates from future export licenses if the company was
criminally convicted of export control violations.
</P>
<P>
   Larry McCracken, a spokesman for Boeing, which bought McDonnell
Douglas in 1997, said, ``We're cooperating but we don't want to get
into the details at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman had no comment on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   CATIC has ample incentive to resolve the case without risking
its fate with an American jury at a time of strained
Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of machining equipment was part of a 1994
billion-dollar jetliner deal in which McDonnell Douglas was to
build aircraft in China. At the time, the aircraft deal was touted
by President Clinton and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown as a
centerpiece of the administration's commercial diplomacy, the
policy of using economic engagement to broaden ties with Beijing
and promote exports.
</P>
<P>
   But within a few months of the announcement of the deal,
McDonnell Douglas discovered that some of the equipment it sold to
China had been sent 800 miles from Beijing to a military facility
in Nanchang that makes missiles and fighter aircraft. And though
the 1994 deal announced by Clinton called for the building of 20
planes, a Boeing spokesman said Thursday that China would build
only one or two planes with the company.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction of CATIC could further strain relations between the
countries and curb other American exports to China, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the administration's policy of promoting exports to
China now faces serious challenge in Congress. Last week a select
congressional committee's report on transfers of sensitive American
technology to China concluded that American export control policies
had tilted too much toward commerce at the expense of national
security.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The committee, headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said
the machining equipment deal was a case study in how China ``will
attempt diversions when it suits its interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's unanimous report also found that CATIC played a
central role in China's drive to acquire technology with civilian
and military uses and that on several occasions CATIC had
``misrepresented the proposed uses of military useful U.S.
technology.'' The Clinton administration prevented the committee
from disclosing further details.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Justice Department officials blocked the committee
from disclosing 1994 cables that showed how administration
officials delayed seeking timely assurances from CATIC on how it
planned to use the machining equipment so as not to disrupt Brown's
announcement in China of the McDonnell Douglas aircraft deal,
officials familiar with the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department received an assurance from CATIC after
Brown left China but it left unanswered the question of exactly
where the machining equipment would be located, according to
excerpts of a Sept. 13, 1994, cable contained in the Cox committee
report.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14 the Commerce Department approved the export of the
machining equipment _ some of it more than a decade old, including
machine tools to shape and bend large aircraft parts _ for eventual
use in Beijing as part of the McDonnell Douglas project to build
aircraft in China.
</P>
<P>
   The license contained some last-minute additions to allay
concerns raised by the Pentagon. In August, the Defense
Intelligence Agency had warned that the Chinese did not really need
the equipment for the civilian aircraft deal but ``an advanced
machine tool facility presents a unique opportunity for Chinese
military aeropsace facilities to access advanced equipment which
otherwise might be denied,'' the Cox report said.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department officials said the licensing conditions that
were added led to a discovery by McDonnell Douglas in 1995 that
some of the equipment had wound up at the Nanchang military
complex. The equipment was eventually moved to a civilian location
in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department began an investigation seven months
after the discovery of the diversion. The discovery and recovery
illustrates, Commerce officials say, that their enforcement system
works.
</P>
<P>
   The case was also referred to the Customs Service and the
Justice Department. In 1996, a federal grand jury began examining
whether CATIC and McDonnell Douglas had complied with export
control laws.
</P>
<P>
   By last September, prosecutors in the office of the U.S.
attorney for the District of Columbia had completed a lengthy
memorandum recommending charges against both CATIC and McDonnell
Douglas, according to law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   But then the lead prosecutor in the case left the government.
Over the next several months other prosecutors reviewed the case
and asked the Customs Service to continue its investigation,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During the subsequent review, some lawyers basically concurred
with the original memorandum while others raised questions,
including some reservations about the strength of the case against
McDonnell Douglas, which is said to rely more on circumstantial
evidence, officials and lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the Justice Department has given final
approval to seek any indictments from the grand jury.

LAMAR ALEXANDER CUTS BACK AS CAMPAIGN FUNDS FLOW TO TEXAS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After months of watching Republican dollars bypass
Tennessee in a mighty rush toward Texas, Lamar Alexander moved to
hoard his disappointing campaign treasury Thursday, laying off four
top staff members and curtailing his travels.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, is making his
second run for the Republican presidential nomination, and has
found the all-important task of raising money far more difficult
than it was in 1996. He has now raised about $1.7 million, and
aides said he would report from $2 million to $2.5 million at the
end of the month, about a third of his original target.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has raised about $10
million, much of which has come from donors whom Alexander and the
other Republican contenders had hoped to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of Bush's fund-raising has been phenomenal,
unprecedented, just amazing to watch,'' said Steve Schmidt,
Alexander's communications director, one of the staff members who
is leaving the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he's sucked all the oxygen out of the news
environment, and everyone else's fund-raising is off from their
projections,'' Schmidt continued. ``So the campaign had to make a
decision to take some painful moves now.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials insisted that this was only a minor bump in
Alexander's carefully plotted road to the Republican nomination.
Only five of 35 staff members were being let go, they said _
including Schmidt's deputy, the campaign's legal director, and its
research director _ allowing Alexander to save money to achieve his
primary goal, a strong showing in the early stages of the campaign
in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is still planning to add several lesser-paid staff
members based in Iowa, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision, first reported Thursday by The Associated
Press, comes as Alexander is struggling to buck up his supporters
concerned about his low standing in national polls. Wherever he
goes, the candidate tells voters that the early polls mean nothing
until the caucus-goers of Iowa have their say next February. Now
his aides must say the same thing about his fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does well in Iowa, the money will turn around on a
dime,'' said Ted Welch, Alexander's finance chairman and one of the
Republican Party's most able fund-raisers. ``After he came in third
in Iowa last time, we started to get $100,000 a day. So the idea of
this move is to get to the first of the year with enough money to
prevail in those early primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is by no means out of the political picture. He has
what is generally regarded as the strongest campaign organization
in Iowa, with two-thirds of the county leaders behind him, along
with a popular former governor, Terry Branstad.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is a crisp speaker with a wholesome personal life who
is certain he can capitalize on a national longing for strength of
character in high office. If he does well in the Iowa caucuses or
in a straw vote that takes place in Ames, Iowa, in August, his poll
ratings and his treasury are likely to climb rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's cutbacks make it clear how much of Alexander's
campaign is based on the hope that Bush will stumble, or that
damaging disclosures will emerge about the Texas governor's private
life. With $10 million in hand and many months before Iowa, Bush is
capable of a withering media assault that none of his competitors
can match, much as Bob Dole effectively turned his cannons on
Alexander in the 1996 New Hampshire primary. The party's rush to
embrace a governor with a famous last name has been infuriating to
the Alexander camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hard to figure out this Bush phenomenon,'' Welch
said, adding: ``There's no justification for him being at these
lofty levels. And yes, it probably has made it harder to raise
money this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who will stay on temporarily as a consultant to the
campaign, said he suspected that other Republican campaigns were in
the same financial straits as Alexander's, but were not announcing
similar moves because they feared the momentum-slowing impact of
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, the other campaigns are going to have to face
reality like Lamar has,'' Schmidt said. ``If they don't, they'll
never make it to Iowa.''

POISED AGASSI IS TALK OF PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ His recent divorce from Brooke Shields may be the talk
of Hollywood, but here in Paris, it is Andre Agassi's solo act at
Roland Garros that has become the talk of the town. The fans
perform the wave for him, he responds with air-blown kisses, and
now he is in his first French Open semifinal since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he has been a runner-up at the French, the only Grand Slam
event he has not won. But this year, the 13th-seeded Agassi seems
primed, poised and pared-down for his first Grand Slam title in a
roller-coaster four-year span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to go out there and win because I deserve it,'' said
Agassi, who knocked out the defending champion, Carlos Moya, in the
fourth round and faces 30th-ranked Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia in
the semifinals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The only cloud on Agassi's Paris horizon is his 0-1 record
against Hrbaty, the 21-year-old powerball player who defeated him
this year at Lipton. Hrbaty got to the semifinal by defeating the
top-ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the second round and outgunning
ninth-seeded Marcelo Rios in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   In the other semifinal, 100th-ranked Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine,
who reached this round six years ago, takes on 54th-ranked Fernando
Meligeni of Brazil. Meligeni, 28, derailed third-seeded Patrick
Rafter, sixth-seeded Alex Corretja, and 14th-seeded Felix
Mantilla. &QL;

LAVIN MAKES POINT TO FILL NEEDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Servic clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Each spring seems to bring a twist to UCLA's
recruiting efforts. Two years ago, the Bruins landed Baron Davis
and Schea Cotton after prolonged, surreal pursuits. Last spring,
they battled maddening NCAA logistics to sign the giant Europeans,
Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   While the current group can't match its predecessors for
melodrama or reputation, it didn't exactly follow a conventional
path to Westwood: When the April signing period began, the Bruins
didn't expect to sign either Artesia High School's Jason Kapono or
Santa Margarita's Spencer Gloger. Yet today, they form coach Steve
Lavin's third straight successful recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past UCLA recruits like Mitchell Butler, Toby Bailey,
Jelani McCoy, Charles O'Bannon, JaRon Rush, Ray Young, Moiso and
Gadzuric _ exquisite athletes with raw talent _ both Gloger and
Kapono are highly skilled. They can pass, shoot, read defenses, use
screens and handle the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both bring high basketball IQs, and they're both
tremendous shooters,'' Lavin said. ``When you look at our team last
season, we were (ninth) in the Pac-10 in 3-point shooting and last
in free-throw shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of filling our needs, we've definitely addressed two
glaring deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloger, who picked UCLA over Princeton, is a 6-foot-6 shooting
guard with long arms, good quickness and live legs. He probably
won't challenge for a starting spot next season, but in two or
three years the Bruins expect him to contribute consistently. And
he's a better player than the big-name shooting guard UCLA did not
sign, Kareem Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono, meanwhile, is a 6-8 McDonald's All-American who chose
UCLA over Missouri and Arizona. Capable of playing any position
except center, Kapono will be UCLA's best passer and 3-point
shooter the instant he enrolls. No doubt, his presence will create
intense competition _ with Young, Rush, Moiso, Rico Hines, Billy
Knight and Matt Barnes _ for playing time at shooting guard and
both forward spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we don't have a true power forward, there are minutes
to share,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns: No player has made more offseason progress than
Young, a 6-4 sophomore whose workouts emphasize shooting and
ballhandling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are talking him up,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Gadzuric is rapidly recovering from the
arthroscopic knee surgery that forced him to miss the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running on the track and playing once or twice a week,''
Lavin said. ``He's ahead of schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and Ends: Both Gadzuric and Moiso are expected to
participate in Hall of Fame coach Pete Newell's highly regarded
summer camp for big men.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin said he has received no indication that either Rush or
Barnes plans to transfer following Kapono's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if forward Travis Reed reverses his decision
to transfer and winds up at UCLA next season. Asked about Reed's
future, Lavin declined to comment.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Say goodbye to the 30-plex movie theater and put
the 24-screen megaplex on the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   That's the clear message from the nation's theater operators,
who are tapping the brakes after four wild years of
bigger-is-better expansion. It's a stunning reversal following an
explosion of shiny new palaces with a seemingly infinite number of
auditoriums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been some degree of insanity to build as large as
30 screens,'' said theater design veteran Francisco Behr, head of
Behr Browers in Westlake Village, Calif. ``There's only so much
product to show. I think people have started to realize that
there's not much advantage beyond 24 screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail consultant Mark Kissel of Rockville, Md., agreed. ``For a
while, it seemed we were heading toward the infinity-plex,'' he
said. ``Maybe we've realized there is a limit to what you can place
on one site.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the nation's biggest chains _ AMC, Regal and Loews
Cineplex _ have indicated recently that 20 rather than 30 has
become the top-end number at new theaters. ``There's no ideal
single size for a theater, but the biggest ones have become subject
to more scrutiny,'' Behr said.
</P>
<P>
   During the expansion, the biggest theater to come to the San
Fernando Valley has been the Winnetka 20, which includes two
715-seat auditoriums. Neal Haltrecht, director of real estate for
Los Angeles-based Pacific, said the Winnetka is as big as his chain
will go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may build another 20, but we're most likely to build
theaters in the 10- to 18-screen range,'' Haltrecht said. ``We
never believed in 24- to 30-screen theaters and thought they were a
mistake. What we like is a complex with several large auditoriums
rather than 30 small auditoriums.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one is proclaiming the death of the megaplex, the
major motor in the modernization of the American movie house.
Between 1995 and the end of last year, the number of U.S. screens
grew an astounding 23percent to 34,168 even though the number of
sites slid 4.2percent to 7,418.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call this the abandonment of the megaplex, but
building 30-screen theaters was never a part of our plans,'' the
megaplex,'' said Marc Pascucci, Loews executive vice president.
``You lose operating efficiencies when you're too big.''
</P>
<P>
   Loews plans to spend $1billion over the next five years to add
12 or 13 new theaters annually. During that time, it will install
700 new screens, an average of a dozen per site, and close down 500
older auditoriums.
</P>
<P>
   AMC launched the megaplex era in 1995 with the Grand 24 in
Dallas, offering staggered start times, huge snack bars, stadium
seating with unobstructed sight lines and state-of-the-art sound
and projection. It raised the ante in December 1996 by opening the
Ontario Mills 30, 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, the Edwards chain stunned the business by
rolling out a 22-screen theater across the street from Ontario
Mills. Rival executives doubted either would make much money; one
even proclaimed at that year's ShoWest convention, ``Thou shalt not
Ontario each other.''
</P>
<P>
   AMC wound up building eight other 30-screen complexes, including
sites in Covina and Orange, but recently closed down six
auditoriums at its 30-plex in Kansas City in favor of restaurant
space. Its most recent announcement of a new theater called for 20
auditoriums with 4,000 seats in a Dallas suburb.
</P>
<P>
   As for Edwards, it also opened 22-screen plants in Brea and
Irvine and a 26-screen complex in Long Beach. But its most recent
expansion efforts have included much smaller properties such as the
six-screen Grand Palace Cinemas in Calabasas, which opened late
last year and occupies a mere 60 feet of frontage at the Tuscan
village-like Commons shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Caruso, chief of the firm that designed the Grand Palace
exterior, said communities prefer smaller theaters to megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Calabasas, the theater's size was driven by the
community not wanting a large project,'' he said. ``Operators want
more than six screens to make it more efficient, but I believe the
Grand Palace has become popular partly because of the small scale.
Our goal was to bring back the romance of going to the movies
instead of going to a large box and fighting crowds.''

U.S. AND CANADIAN SALMON TREATY HAILED AS MAJOR STEP FORWARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Endangered chinook salmon runs of Puget Sound and the
Columbia River system emerged as apparent big winners Thursday as
U.S. and Canadian officials offered details of the 10-year Pacific
Salmon agreement reached by the two countries' negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Oregon achieved a key conservation goal as Canada
agreed to sharply cut back fishing for U.S.-bound chinook in waters
off Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make it much easier to promote restoration of salmon
habitat. Before, it was difficult to make the case for habitat when
not many fish were coming back to spawn,'' Oregon Gov. John
Kitzhaber said.
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen in Alaska waters will continue to catch hundreds
of thousands of chinook, sockeye and coho salmon bound for rivers
in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be a major kill,'' Canada's fisheries
minister David Anderson acknowledged after a Seattle news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said, however, that the agreement is ``a step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has agreed to take fewer fish in years when runs are
weak. The two countries will replace fixed quotas with an
``abundance-based'' system that adjusts the catch to relative
abundance of runs.
</P>
<P>
   During 1996, when Canada closed its fisheries due to low runs,
Alaska took 170,000 chinook. The average Alaska chinook catch has
been about 250,000 fish a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if chinook salmon populations remain similar to those
observed in the past few years, Alaska-based fishermen under the
agreement can catch between 150,000 and 207,000 chinook a year.
They also will be able to catch sockeye and coho salmon bound for
Northwest rivers.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark wasn't pleased by the
agreement, saying it entrenches ``the right of Alaskans to catch
more B.C. salmon than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement _ which ends a five-year conflict between the
United States and Canada _ appears likely to produce certainty and
allow long-term planning for salmon conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The ending of the impasse at sea produced relief by most
officials of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy, but after five frustrating years of
negotiating breakdowns, we finally ended the stalemate,'' said
Washington Gov. Gary Locke, whose ad hoc fish conservation
agreements with Anderson last year helped open the way for a
long-term settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Both government officials and fisheries groups said they can
concentrate on preserving and restoring salmon habitat now that
peace is in place in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's agreement is absolutely integral to our long-term
strategy to bring the salmon back,'' Vice President Al Gore said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Locke and Kitzhaber had particular reason to smile. Canada's
concessions are likely to mean more _ many more _ salmon returning
to Northwest streams, according to figures released Thursday by the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   If the agreement had been in effect the past few years, between
25 percent and 30 percent more salmon would have returned to Puget
Sound rivers. The return of chinook salmon to the Columbia River
would have been 40 percent higher. Imperiled Snake River salmon
runs would have seen double the number of spawners.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement won't come cheap, however.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as the price of preserving chinook and coho
salmon, the United States agreed to limit its catch of Fraser River
salmon to 16.5 percent, down from a historical average of 20
percent. Last year, U.S. fishermen took 25 percent of the catch.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government and Washington state are expected to
appropriate another $30 million to $35 million to buy out the
licenses of U.S. fishermen, including some Indians, who will lose a
big chunk of their customary Fraser River catch.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement sets up two funds, under joint U.S. and Canadian
management, for fisheries science, restoration and enhancement. A
$75 million Northern Fund would cover Alaska as well as northern
and central British Columbia, including B.C.'s troubled Skeena
River fishery. A $65 million Southern Fund would cover southern
British Columbia _ including the Fraser River _ as well as
Washington, Oregon and Idaho's Snake River basin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has committed to seek money to pay the $140
million for both funds _ in addition to the $100 million salmon
enhancement program already proposed by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll get it,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.,
pointing to the number of Northwest lawmakers on the appropriations
committees that control Congress' pursestrings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, deeply felt differences were apparent Thursday,
particularly between Alaska and British Columbia fisheries
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska fishermen ``should not be made to make more
concessions,'' said Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House
Resources Committee. However, Young praised negotiators and said he
was ``glad we have a long-term agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Clark argued that last year, British Columbia
fishermen caught no B.C.-bound coho salmon in order to assure
survival. ``At the same time, Alaskans caught 800,000 B.C. coho,''
Clark said. ``This year B.C. will not catch any endangered coho.
The Alaskans will. In fact, Alaskans will catch endangered B.C.
coho next year, the year after that and every year for the next 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The premier's concerns were reflected even among British
Columbians who generally support the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any deal was better than no deal, and the real danger is that
our salmon runs will disappear,'' said Ric Careless, director of
B.C. Spaces for Nature, a conservation group. ``The real question
is what will happen up the coast with Alaska's continued
interception of chinook and coho.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fulton, who represented Prince Rupert in Canada's parliament
for 14 years, added: ``I wish this were a better agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Curtis, western conservation director for Trout Unlimited
in Portland, raised a different concern. ``The agreement is
incredibly technical,'' Curtis said. ``Can they pull it off? Manage
the details? And will Congress put up the enormous amount of money?
Those are the questions remaining before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the agreement acknowledged as much. ``This is a
beginning,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Strong, a longtime leader of the Columbia River Intertribal
Fisheries Commission, compared challenges facing U.S. and Canadian
negotiators to salmon trying to find their way home from the
Pacific Ocean to the river of their upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the dispute has ``spawned new perspectives'' about
conserving a resource shared by different countries and cultures,
Strong said.

LOS ANGELES: fighting crowds.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Megaplexes _ defined as any theater with at least 16 auditoriums
_ will live on because of compelling economics. They are more
profitable at the snack bars and customers will often drive past
conventional theaters to get to a state-of-the-art one.
</P>
<P>
   But chains have taken on big debt loads to open hundreds of
megaplexes as they plowed profits into building programs that cost
$1million per screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall view in the exhibition business is that Act 1 is
now over and the period of aggressive building has come to a
close,'' said Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners. ``The
question during Act 1 was when was saturation going to be reached
with all the good sites taken. There are only so many markets that
can support a 25- or 30-screen theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal theater size may be somewhere between 14 and 20, Behr
asserts. ``When you drop below 14, you're vulnerable to someone
coming in and undermining you but when you get over 20, you don't
have that much advantage,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Behr points out, all the obvious places for
megaplexes have been filled in, leading to a focus on smaller
theaters. ``Secondary markets are going to be next, where you have
smaller populations and it doesn't warrant putting in Death
Star-type theaters,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude marks a huge change from a few years ago when
megaplexes were booming. Doug Brown, managing partner at Los
Angeles-based Regent Properties, recalls finding little enthusiasm
in 1996 when he first tried selling the idea of an ``urban
village'' center with an eight-to-10 screen theater at the run-down
area at Sunset and Vine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, we were calling possible tenants and they
were laughing at us,'' Brown said of the Hollywood Marketplace
development, due to break ground this summer. ``But what we're
finding now is when you do a large theater, it scares potential
retail tenants because they're concerned that customers won't be
able to find parking. So it makes sense to build something more
manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   What's replaced the megaplex as the industry's hot development
ticket? Developers now swoon over what's termed the entertainment
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Cineplex, for example, is opening 15 theaters in mid-June
in San Francisco at Sony's massive Metreon, a cross between a theme
park, shopping mall and Sony marketing vehicle. Metreon includes
such offbeat attractions as The Way Things Work _ In Mammoth 3D. If
successful, Sony plans to roll out other Metreons around the world.
</P>
<P>
   New theaters are now often integrated into business districts
with powerful retailers. At the Marketplace in Glendale, a Mann
fourplex is surrounded by such draws as Gap, Borders, Tower and Old
Navy. ``What we were trying for is a fun village environment where
parents can bring their kids and spend four hours,'' said Brown,
who helped develop the project.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, developers are taking similar approaches at the
legendary Mann's Chinese Theatre and Pacific's Cinerama Dome, along
with the Hollywood Marketplace and the first theaters at Farmer's
Market. ``Downtowns got blighted because of the power of malls so
what those areas are now looking for are powerful retail tenants
and theaters that still have a village feel,'' Brown said. ``The
newer projects are the best of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Caruso, who is developing the Farmer's Market expansion, said
theater operators originally wanted up to 20 screens but the
project will likely contain 10 to 12. ``We don't want the theater
to overwhelm the rest of the project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, moviegoers want more than a megaplex. ``Customers are
still looking for alternatives to driving out to the big box and
walking through a 20-acre parking lot,'' Behr said. ``That's not a
very rich experience.'' &QL;

<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ If the Knicks can take a most improbable run to
a championship climax, at least Patrick Ewing will have his ring,
even if he is on the sidelines for most of the last two legs. At
least he will have been part of a team that would be long gone from
the playoffs if it weren't for him.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing won't have to die a thousand athlete's deaths, as Don
Mattingly did when the Yankees won the 1996 World Series the season
after he'd quit. Mattingly watched the Yankees take down the Braves
in his Evansville, Ind., home until there were two out in the ninth
inning of Game 6. Then he walked out of the room, leaving behind
his wife and children, not wanting them to see his ashen face.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Mattingly, the retired first baseman's wife, described this
moment to me a couple of winters ago, tears filling her somber blue
eyes. That, I remember thinking, had to be among the saddest of
sporting happenstances. This latest Ewing development has some of
that but may eventually be remembered more as another contentious
chapter in a continuing allegory that was carried too far.
</P>
<P>
   Along the journey from out of the playoffs into title
contention, Ewing the warrior became Ewing the martyr. Is it
coincidence that he sustained a partial tear of his Achilles'
tendon after 40 grueling and unrealistic minutes last Sunday
against Indiana in Game 1? The team physician, Norman Scott, said
it was exactly that _ a coincidence _ but under the circumstances,
what else could he say?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird limits Rik Smits and his nerve-damaged feet to 32
minutes a night, when Smits doesn't foul out first. After Game 1 of
the conference final, Bird drawled that if Smits played 40 minutes,
we wouldn't see him for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bird is no doctor, and neither am I, but the timing of Ewing's
injury brings us back to when the Achilles' problem surfaced, after
an out-of-shape Ewing labored through major minutes of several
early-season games, including 43 one typically heated night in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, Jeff Van Gundy, was already feeling the fiery breath
of the general manager, Ernie Grunfeld, on his neck and was
overusing the player he trusted most. Van Gundy held a news
conference one night and played a little doctor himself, mocking
the notion that there was a bodily difference between playing 32
minutes and 40-plus. Days later, Ewing limped out of a game at
Madison Square Garden, and here we are, Ewing telling his teammates
Thursday that he believes in them and to go ahead and ``get me my
ring.'' The Knicks proceeded to promise an inspired, up-tempo
assault Saturday night at the Garden in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   With all the intramural shouting this season about the new
running game versus the old half-court game, you kept wishing that
Red Holzman were still around to clear his throat and remind
everyone that championship teams, in the end, have usually been
capable of executing both ways, as the Knicks demonstrated in Game
1.
</P>
<P>
   If that road victory turns out to be the difference in this
series, then Bird will be Indiana's goat for not removing Smits in
two late-game dead ball situations with the Pacers ahead by 5, then
3. On the first of those two Knick possessions, Bird compounded his
mistake by not double-teaming Ewing as he drove against Smits to
rescue the Knicks from the edge of the cliff. Smits had no mobility
and five fouls. On one leg, Ewing blew by him to the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that Patrick does is go at Smits and get him in foul
trouble,'' Van Gundy said, correctly worried that Smits won't have
to guard anyone the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ewing's injuries gave him no choice, but he seemed to be
relishing his reduced part on this evolving team. He was no longer
the franchise but he had an important role, and it was better than
the role Mattingly chose in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's and Mattingly's careers ran similar courses,
statistically brilliant players whose teams lacked essential
championship components until their bodies were breaking down. In
his last season, Mattingly was stung by criticism that the Yankees
were better off without him. When they signed Tino Martinez, he
took his glove home, rather than refocus, become a spare part in
pursuit of a ring. He was never as hard-headed as Ewing and, as it
turned out, not as resolved. Ewing turned a deaf ear to it all,
fought off the pain, limped past Miami, kept going, right around
Smits near the end of Game 1, his last crucial basket in what could
still be that championship season.
</P>
<P>
   The ring will fit Ewing fine if the Knicks somehow win.  &QL;

WHITE HOUSE REACTS WITH CAUTIOUS RELIEF TO WORD OF PEACE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct number in 7th graf.)  (rm) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton cautiously welcomed word of
Yugoslavia's apparent acceptance of international peace terms for
Kosovo as some members of the administration privately expressed
relief that a difficult military and diplomatic episode may be
coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, if it holds up, would mark the beginning of the
end of a 10-week crisis that has brought devastation to the Balkans
and a bitter debate in Washington over Clinton's concept of a
limited, casualty-free war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movement by the Serbian leadership to accept these conditions,
established by NATO and the international community is, of course,
welcome,'' the president said in a brief Rose Garden appearance
Thursday afternoon. ``But based on our past experience, we must
also be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other senior administration officials still
expressed deep skepticism about Belgrade's intentions, saying that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has repeatedly broken
promises to abide by international accords. They insisted that the
bombing of Yugoslavia would continue until Milosevic has begun the
rapid withdrawal of his army and police forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, and until Serb forces begin a verifiable
withdrawal from Kosovo, we will continue to pursue diplomacy, but
we will also continue the military effort that has brought us to
this point,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met late in the afternoon with the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, to review the terms of the peace agreement and discuss the
steps leading to the deployment of a 50,000-troop peacekeeping
force in Kosovo. Military leaders told the president that they are
prepared to move allied soldiers into Kosovo swiftly, beginning as
soon as Yugoslavian forces start to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials at the White House, State Department and Pentagon
all hewed to the cautious line the president laid down. Behind the
administration's public reserve, however, was a deep sense of
relief, almost of vindication, after more than 10 weeks of
relentless war-making in the Balkans and harsh criticism at home.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including members of Congress, charged that the
president engaged the nation in a distant war that did not threaten
U.S. interests. Others said Clinton pursued a military campaign of
half-measures that would never achieve its stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   But the calibrated war waged by the United States and its NATO
allies appeared to be on the brink of success in its limited aims _
the removal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo, the return of refugees
to the province and the entry of a NATO-led peacekeeping force to
police the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore particularly welcomed the news, aides
said, not only because it meant the likely end of the latest Balkan
conflict, but because U.S. troops would not be fighting a European
war during his campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was too early to declare victory, because
countless details need to be resolved and nearly a million refugees
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, one of the most ardent
advocates within the administration of the air war, expressed
guarded satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   She underlined the uncertainties about how Milosevic would
proceed in the coming days, a wariness brought on by the Yugoslav
leader's past failures to live up to accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to take this a step at a time,'' she told
reporters at the State Department Thursday afternoon. ``He has
accepted something but it has to be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Her chief spokesman, James Rubin, added: ``This is not a time
for popping champagne corks. This is a time for getting the
refugees home and for getting the Serb forces out of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official, speaking candidly only when
promised anonymity, said there would be plenty of time for
self-congratulation later if an end to the conflict on allied terms
has in fact been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to declare victory when victory in fact is at
hand,'' the official said. ``We will be relieved when he has
withdrawn his forces. But right now we're viewing this with more
than a dash of skepticism. It's a long way from this to seeing the
last Serb soldier cross the border and walk north.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this wariness, a top foreign policymaker said that the
allies are in a much stronger position today than they were 24
hours ago _ indeed, at any time since the bombardment of Yugoslavia
began on the night of March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either Milosevic complies, or his defiance vastly strengthens
our hand to do what we need to do,'' this aide said. ``It would
demonstrate his cynicism _when given the chance to choose peace he
chose war. It would alienate the Russians and make it easy to
resume the bombing until he complies.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Albright described Milosevic as accepting and understanding the
demands listed in a document delivered to him by the president of
Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, who was representing the European Union,
and the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The two-page document, obtained by The New York Times, outlined
the basic five demands of NATO, most importantly the withdrawal of
all of Milosevic's forces from Kosovo under a ``rapid'' timetable
and the deployment of an international force under NATO command and
control to take back and protect the ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement said that once all the Serbian and Yugoslav forces
had left, an ``agreed number of Yugoslav and Serbian personnel''
would be allowed to return. They would serve as liaison with the
international military and civic missions in Kosovo, clear
minefields, and maintain a presence at Serb religious sites and at
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   No specific number was mentioned in the document for the Serb
and Yugoslav officials who would be allowed to return, referring
only to ``hundreds, not thousands.'' Administration officials have
insisted in the last several weeks that these people would amount
to only a symbolic presence.

THEATERS TO PREMIERE DIGITAL PROJECTION WITH `PHANTOM MENACE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The digital Force is coming to the San Fernando
Valley soon.
</P>
<P>
   Two local theaters _ Pacific's Winnetka 20 in Chatsworth and the
AMC Burbank 14 _ were tapped Thursday to screen digital showings of
``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' starting June 18 for
four weeks. Only two other theaters, both in Loews Cineplexes in
New Jersey, will offer digital runs.
</P>
<P>
   The showings represent the first time that a film has been
digitally projected for moviegoers. They will unveil competing
projection systems by Texas Instruments (at the AMC) and Qualcomm
affiliate CineComm (at the Winnetka).
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, long a proponent of bringing
leading-edge technology into the movie business, decreed in March
that ``Phantom Menace'' would screen on four digital projection
systems a month after its May 19 opening.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sherak, 20th Century Fox's distribution chief, said the AMC
and Pacific theaters were chosen for two reasons _ their proximity
to Hollywood studios and their ability to allow an immediate
comparison with a showing of ``Phantom Menace'' on a conventional
projector.
</P>
<P>
   Although digital projection enthusiasts say the new technology
greatly enhances the moviegoing experience, analysts have warned
that digital projector technology could take a long time to catch
on because of the huge installation costs _ as much as $140,000 per
system, compared with $20,000 for a conventional 35 &UR;  &LR; mm projector.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the industry has had a hard time reaching a format
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The TI system relies on a chip with a million tiny mirrors,
while CineComm's is based on a light valve produced by Hughes-JVC.
The key selling point for both is that the magnetic tapes or
digital disks in the new projection systems won't wear out, unlike
film, and will be able to project pristine images even after
hundreds of showings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to get a consistently high level of image
quality,'' said TI spokesman David Smith. ``We really want
audiences to see it. We think that two or three years out, hundreds
of theaters will have it; within five years, it will be in the
thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   TI and CineComm held side-by-side demonstrations with
conventional prints at the ShoWest convention in March in Las
Vegas. ``Most people in the business found that the differences
were negligible,'' said Doug Darrow, marketing and business
development manager for TI's DLP Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real-world test,'' Darrow said of the upcoming
showings. ``We've already gotten a lot of interest from Hollywood
studios.''
</P>
<P>
   If digital movies catch on, it could be a massive blow to North
Hollywood-based Technicolor Worldwide Film and Hollywood-based
Deluxe Laboratories, top suppliers of prints to theaters.
Technicolor chief Ron Jarvis noted his company has relaunched its
dye transfer process, leading to major gains in color quality and
durability, for several films on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new dye transfer prints are superior to digital by a big
factor,'' Jarvis said. ``We're not sitting here shaking in our
boots, but it's not necessarily going to be easy for film and
electronic transfer to co-exist.'' &QL;

 WASHINGTON: symbolic presence.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was some confusion over whether the document given to
Milosevic _ and which was primarily drafted under the supervision
of the Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott _ was precisely
the same as that passed by the Serbian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference, according to the State Department
spokesman, Rubin, was a footnote which was on the document given to
Milosevic but excluded in the document passed by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote dealt with differences between NATO and Russia over
participation of Russia in the international security force.
Russia, according to the footnote, did not agree to its soldiers
participating in the international security force that was under
NATO command and control.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote states that the force would have a unified NATO
chain of command under the political direction of the NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   If Russian soldiers participated in the force, they would do so
under arrangements to be made in the future, the administration
said. The State Department said that Ahtisaari explained to
Milosevic the meaning of the footnote and told the Yugoslav leader
that the question of Russian participation was a matter between
NATO and Russia and had no bearing on Yugoslavia. Milosevic,
according to this account, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   For the State Department, the next few days promised to be
tense: a waiting game to see if Milosevic would agree to codify his
acceptance in a formal military-to-military agreement worked out
between NATO and the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The British general, Michael Jackson, who heads the NATO troops
already deployed in Macedonia as a vanguard for the international
security force, was expected to head a NATO military delegation
that would negotiate with the Yugoslav military, an administration
official said. The meeting likely would take place not in Belgrade,
but along one of Serbia's borders, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The terms under which the NATO bombing would be suspended were
the most critical steps in the coming days, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This was because once the bombing was suspended it would be
extremely difficult to resume the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   A number of alliance members would resist a resumption. Further,
an administration official said, once the bombing stopped, refugees
were likely to start returning home, making a resumption of bombing
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   While officials said the bombardment would continue until a
verifiable withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo begins, they
indicated that the pace and breadth of the bombing would diminish
over the next several days as the final diplomatic details are
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONALT TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes will not attack retreating Serb soldiers, one
official said. ``Everybody understands we would not do anything to
impede the withdrawal of their forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the agreement ran from relief to scathing
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., lambasted the agreement as a ``so-called peace
deal'' which had been negotiated by the Russians, the European
Union and an indicted war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only acceptable deal with Slobodan Milosevic is one that
offers him safety in exile in exchange for his agreement to step
down and hand power to Serbian Democrats,'' Helms said in a
statement. ``Milosevic must be driven from power, vertically or
horizontally.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., has supported the air war but
has questioned whether air power alone would compel Milosevic to
capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he expressed satisfaction that Milosevic apparently
had given in to the core NATO conditions, relieving the United
States of the burden of planning and carrying out a ground
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that in fact we have achieved our objectives on the
ground from the air and achieved them at astonishingly low rate of
casualties. We did not lose a NATO soldier in combat,'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we have been victorious in turning back ethnic
aggression. It is very important for the stability and peace of
Europe, but also critically important for the credibility of NATO
and the United States as protectors of the rule of law.''

SPORTS COLUMN: DON'T TRY NEW YORK'S TRIPLE CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don't do it. Make believe Ed Koch is still the mayor
and repeat after me: ``Don't even think of trying it,'' with heavy
Kochian emphasis on the ``think.''
</P>
<P>
   What you should not attempt Saturday is attending all three
events in New York's own Triple Crown, one of the epic sporting
days in the region:
</P>
<P>
   At 1:15 p.m., the Mets and the Yankees will continue their
interleague series for the fans' right to say nyah-nyah for another
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 p.m., the Knicks will play the Pacers in a vital playoff
game, without their injured captain, Patrick Ewing, as they
continue to embarrass top management, which was caught dickering
with another coach for next season.
</P>
<P>
   And in between, Secretariat's great grandson, Charismatic, will
try to win the Triple Crown of horse racing out at the Belmont on
the Queens-Nassau border.
</P>
<P>
   No horse has won racing's Triple Crown since 1978, but New
York's own Triple Crown would be even more demanding. Performing it
would be such a gross stunt that only somebody with absolutely no
taste, like a builder who puts his own name on all his projects,
would even attempt it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you were into conspicuous consumption and wanted to pay
three-figure street prices for a baseball ticket and maybe even
four-figure street prices for a basketball ticket from the friendly
gents working the sidewalks of New York, you cannot get there from
here. Make that your mantra. It would be folly to try to watch even
the first six or seven innings of the Met-Yankee game and then
drive to Belmont. George Steinbrenner makes things up, but he is
not making it up about the traffic jams at the antiquated ball yard
in the Bronx. Sometimes it takes an hour just to get away from
161st Street.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you managed to get within striking distance of the
Belmont before post-time, the parking lots will already be jammed
from a potential crowd of 80,000, and latecomers will be forced to
park farther away than the mile-and-a-half distance of the Belmont
itself. Then it would be impossible to drive to the Garden remotely
close to 6:30 p.m., a starting time so ludicrous that only a
network could have come up with it. Nah. Fuhgeddaboutit.
</P>
<P>
   Mass transit? Nice idea, taking the IND or the IRT from the
Bronx to Penn Station and then the Long Island Rail Road out to the
Belmont, but, alas, the last special racing train from Penn Station
leaves at 12:55 p.m. (they want the bettors out early to do their
duty.)
</P>
<P>
   Anybody at the Belmont could catch a 6:09 p.m. train back to the
city right after the big race, arriving in the dismal basement
below the Garden at 6:41 p.m., just in time to catch Latrell
Sprewell take off his warm-ups and glare at Jeff Van Gundy for not
starting him.
</P>
<P>
   However, we are talking about catching all three events, which
probably involves a helicopter (does Trump have landing rights at
the Garden?) A limousine has already been done, for a Grand Slam of
New York sports dabbling.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1982, this very newspaper dispatched John Leonard into
the hinterlands to observe snippets of the Giants football game in
New Jersey, the Yankee game in what Leonard called ``East Berlin''
(the Cold War was still on), the Jets game in their old playground
at Shea, and then Jimmy Connors playing cock-of-the-walk at the
United States Open tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard managed the stunt with the help of a rented limousine,
and then concluded with the lament: ``At $30 an hour, couldn't I
have rented a brain? I didn't deserve a limousine. Nobody does.''
The Cold War is over, but Leonard's words are definitive. It's time
to make sane choices.
</P>
<P>
   Go Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   For $4 you can get into the clubhouse section and for $2 you can
mingle with the real people in the general admission. Come early.
Bring something electronic to follow the intramural ball game up in
the Bronx: a Cuban named Hernandez versus a Japanese named Yoshii.
Only in America.
</P>
<P>
   Go Belmont. There are real trees and real grass and you can
watch the horses being saddled in the paddock. Here's a dirty
little secret of racing: you don't have to bet. They cannot make
you. Also, bring a pair of binoculars to see if an imported filly
named Silverbulletday or one of the colts can keep Charismatic from
winning the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, let everybody else scurry to their cars for a
traffic jam worthy of Yankee Stadium. The people who run Belmont
Park have promised to put the Knicks game on the television sets
all over the stands. During those interminable television timeouts,
you can do a bit of honest stooping for discarded tickets. You
never know. By avoiding most of the traffic from New York's own
Triple Crown, you just might get lucky.  &QL;

 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a sweltering July afternoon and Bob Baffert
thought he was done buying horses. Before he climbed in his car,
however, he caught sight of a bay filly ready to enter the sales
ring. She wasn't on his shopping list. When he took a closer look,
he noticed her knees were off center. But the California trainer
was bowled over by her athletic look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we missed one,'' Baffert told his blood stock agents,
Kevin and J.B. McKathan, who have helped him find future racing
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes and $155,000 later, Baffert had bought
Silverbulletday for the owner Mike Pegram at the Fasig-Tipton sale
in Lexington, Ky. Now, two years and $2.2 million in winnings
later, Silverbulletday will try to become just the third filly _
the first since 1905 _ to win the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   She is a formidable challenger to Charismatic, the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness winner, who will be bidding to become the 12th
Triple Crown winner in history tomorrow. But by running
Silverbulletday in a one-and-a-half-mile test of endurance, Baffert
and Pegram are taking on one of horse racing's most fundamental
tenets: that fillies don't belong with the colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been taboo,'' Baffert said. ``The wisdom has been, why
take the chance when there are plenty of races for fillies. There's
the thought that colts are more developed at this time of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there's no reason,'' said Baffert, sounding like an
iconoclast, before adding, ``If it wasn't a $1 million race, I
wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The battles between the sexes in horse racing have been around
from the beginning of the sport. In fact, the very first Belmont in
1867 was won by the filly Ruthless. But the debate about it has
gotten louder in more modern times, especially in the spring when
the rich Triple Crown races showcase the maturing 3-year-old
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Fillies rarely run against the colts. Even more rarely do they
win. Thirty-seven have run in the 125-year-old Kentucky Derby and
only three have won, the last being Winning Colors in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 927 Belmont starters in the 130-year history of the race,
Silverbulletday will be only the 21st filly to run. Baffert and
Pegram hope she joins Ruthless and the 1905 winner, Tanya, in the
record books. Those two fillies won the Belmont at different
distances _ Ruthless at the longer distance of 1| miles and Tanya
at a shorter distance of 1\ miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are physical differences,'' said John Nerud, the
86-year-old Hall of Fame trainer and breeder. ``Why don't women
play baseball against men? Because they aren't good enough. Why
don't they play football? They aren't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure why a filly can match a colt's time on a
stopwatch, but needs extraordinary talent to beat the opposite sex
in head-to-head competition. Dr. Ted Hill, a veterinarian, said
most of the evidence is anecdotal and encompasses a variety of
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, males are bigger and stronger,'' said Dr. Hill,
who is the Jockey Club steward at New York tracks. ``But there also
is a question of intimidation, especially when the filly is eye to
eye with a colt. There's an awful lot of energy and proximity when
the horses load in the gate. They are social and herd animals and
the male dominance may be intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silverbulletday, Baffert and Pegram have a champion filly who
has overwhelmed her own sex. She has won 11 of 12 races at five
different tracks _ including eight in a row _ each time as the
odds-on favorite. Her speed figures are higher than those of any
colt in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   In any given race, horses must overcome a variety of factors _
including post position, track bias, pace and racing luck. For
fillies, there's one more factor that doesn't affect colts _ during
spring and summer they come in heat every 20 days. Baffert said the
only time he noticed the affect of the cycle on Silverbulletday was
in March at the Fairgrounds in New Orleans. She ran a sluggish
race, he said, but still won by three lengths.
</P>
<P>
   In track parlance, Silverbulletday has earned the reputation as
a ``monster'' or ``freak'' because of how effortlessly she seems to
run. And win. In her last race, the Black Eyed Susan at Pimlico,
Silverbulletday came within three-fifths of a second of breaking
the track record for a mile and an eighth despite the fact her
jockey, Gary Stevens, never used his whip and just galloped her
home to a two-lengths victory. ``This is the only horse I've ever
seen who is cooled down by the time she gets to the winner's
circle,'' Baffert said. ``She is a push button horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and his rival, D.Wayne Lukas, who trains Charismatic,
both came from quarter-horse racing where colts against fillies is
more common. Lukas marshaled Winning Colors from her Derby victory
to a third-place finish at the Preakness and a last-place finish at
the Belmont. He respects Silverbulletday and Baffert's attempt to
capture the race, but said that Winning Colors was tested against
the colts before her Derby triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had a cupcake schedule,'' Lukas said of Silverbulletday.
``We'll see what happens when she is tested.''
</P>
<P>
   The filly, however, has her backers. Cynthia McGinnes, an owner
and breeder in Maryland, applauds Baffert and Pegram for entering
Silverbulletday in the Belmont when there is little reward. She
watched the filly roll at Pimlico and believes she is the best
3-year-old regardless of sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sporting because it's back to the essence of the sport,''
she said. ``Who has the fastest horse. She is a Secretariat type of
filly and I don't think the colts are that outstanding of a
group.''
</P>
<P>
   If Silverbulletday wins, there is no guarantee that it will
increase her value beyond the $600,000 first-place money. While big
victories enhance the value of stud fees for colts, it does little
for potential broodmares.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Baffert nor Pegram are thinking beyond tomorrow.
They believe they have a fast horse who can get the distance and
gun down the competition. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert can even envision a duel down the stretch between
Silverbulletday and Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see him pulling eye to eye with her,'' Baffert said.
``Then he falls in love and doesn't pass her.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like Baffert did two years ago in a sales ring.

CITY GAMES, WITH A DASH OF MUSTARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There will be pressure on the Mets to emerge from
their deepest slump of the season against a superior team in enemy
territory. There will be pressure on the Yankees to show they are
the best team in the five boroughs and to satisfy George
Steinbrenner. There will be pressure for three hectic days at
Yankee Stadium because it is New York against New York in baseball
and there is really nothing else that compares.
</P>
<P>
   Leave work early, make sure the babysitter is prompt and take
mass transit. Be prepared. Wear Derek Jeter's jersey and boo
Armando Benitez if you are a Yankee fan. Wear Mike Piazza's jersey
and, since Hideki Irabu is not likely to pitch, pick another Yankee
to chastise if you are a Mets fan. Laugh at the bleacher denizens
if you love Paul O'Neill. Stay away from them if you have a Benny
Agbayani cheer lurking in your lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The series features a second-place club that is slowly surging
and a third-place club that is quickly crumbling and it could be
considered a blip on the 162-game regular-season schedule, but it
is an event that has been and will be talked about for weeks. The
majority of the 170,000 tickets for the three games sold out
swiftly, more than 250 news media credentials have been issued and
both teams have had their advance scouts studying each other's
pitches, swings and signs for close to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if the city commands you to stop and make this
a big series,'' David Cone said. ``Everyone's into it. The city is
excited. I don't think the fans can get enough of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who will oppose the Mets' Rick Reed in the opener Friday
night, understands the rivalry between the Yankees and the Mets and
between their fans as much as anyone since he has pitched for both
teams and is one of the handful of players who has lived in
Manhattan. More than any other player, he knows both organizations,
knows what both teams' fans are like and knows why these three
games and three more at Shea Stadium in July, though draining for
players who are more concerned with the Red Sox or the Braves
respectively, are important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know after playing three games at Shea last year, our
players were glad to see it was over,'' Cone said. ``There was
intense scrutiny, high stress and high drama at a time of the
season when you're trying to play it day by day. But it's for the
fans and I'm sure they will see six games as a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Joe Torre acknowledged the importance of the matchup
for fans, the first thing the manager said when asked about playing
the Mets was, ``I hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how Bobby Valentine and the Mets feel. They have to face
the Yankees' three best starters in Cone, Orlando Hernandez and
Roger Clemens, they have to do it in a hostile environment and they
have to do it while they are searching for their first victory in a
week. Obviously, the Yankees are not invincible, as they seemed to
be last year, and are not as crisp as they would like to be,
despite winning 8 of their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   But the defending World Series champions have the advantage in
all the pitching matchups, especially since the Mets' five primary
starters have a 17-19 record and a 5.67 earned run average. Still,
the Mets, who might be helped by using a designated hitter like
Bobby Bonilla in the American League park, hope that the spotlight
jostles them out of their six-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I think we'll need,'' Mike Piazza said. ``There
will definitely be a little bit of a shot of adrenaline, a little
shot of electricity. Hopefully it will be like another opening day
for us. We can turn the page and get going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will try to turn the page Friday night. The Yankees
will try to stop them. It will be a fight between two teams who are
not competitors in their own divisions, but who are fierce
competitors everywhere else. There will be dueling fans and feuding
fans as two teams who usually catch only glimpses of each other on
television play amidst the pressure and skirmish for the pride of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play the Mets, that's the media World Series,''
O'Neill said. ``It just kind of goes on and on. I don't think we've
played our best baseball. Maybe we need something like this to get
us going. There are a lot bigger games down the road with us,
especially in September and October. Some of the attention and
stuff gets to you with this, but this is a fun atmosphere. Just put
it that way. It's a fun atmosphere to play in.''

EWING'S ABSENCE MAKES THE PACERS THINK AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Reggie Miller said winning the Eastern Conference
finals may be more difficult for the Indiana Pacers now that
Patrick Ewing is out for the year. Antonio Davis chimed in that the
Knicks may be more motivated after losing the cornerstone of their
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   As the Indiana Pacers resumed preparation Friday for Game 3 on
Saturday at Madison Square Garden, the prevailing sentiment on
Ewing's season-ending injury was offered by Mark Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not a better team without Patrick Ewing; let's get
that out of the way,'' Jackson, the Pacers' point guard, said.
``They can still win without him but they're certainly not better.
They're missing a Hall of Fame center, a guy who requires your
undivided attention when he's in the game and catches it on the
post. They'll miss that. They'll miss his presence. But they still
have capable, quality guys that can hurt you. They can still win.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after Ewing was diagnosed with a partial tear in his
left Achilles' tendon, Coach Larry Bird began preparing the Pacers
for a sleeker, revved-up version of a Knicks team that could
present problems for Indiana in transition.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Pacers is Rik Smits. The 7-foot-4-inch
center fouled out of the first two games trying to stop Ewing and
now he may spend more energy concentrating on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to stay in the game to help us,'' Bird said.
``Hopefully we'll be able to keep him in the game a little longer
because he's been playing great defense for us. He's been giving a
lot of help so we want to keep him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird befriended Ewing when they were teammates at the 1992
Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. Much the same way he wanted
Michael Jordan to be the measuring stick for his team this season,
Bird regretted that Ewing would not be on the floor to help decide
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Patrick,'' Bird said. ``His career is winding
down and he had a legitimate shot to win the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird added: ``I don't know if they're better but obviously
they'll come out and they'll play well. They've been playing
without Patrick a little bit this year, so they'll know what to
expect. They'll be running a little bit more and be driving and
kicking and trying to hit the open shooters. But our defense has to
toughen up.''
</P>
<P>
   The sideline chess match is altered significantly by Ewing's
injury. While the 6-11 Chris Dudley is expected to start in Ewing's
place, the Knicks will try to counter the Pacers' size advantage by
trying to seize an advantage on the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they go small, we go big,'' Bird said. ``Let them stay
small. We're going to try to establish inside position because it
opens up the outside for other players. They've been doubling
Reggie off every pick and roll, which we like. So we're just going
to punch it down low and keep driving it at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, ``They'll run more, so it's up to us to get back
faster and not let them get out on the break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are 7-5 without Ewing this season and 28-28 last
season while he was rehabilitating a broken wrist. Liberated from a
low-post game, many of his more-athletic teammates often flourish
early on in Ewing's absence before discovering how much they miss
an offensive-minded center.
</P>
<P>
   Against a more physical and taller Pacers team, Ewing's loss may
be even more compounded. Asked if, in fact, the Knicks were a
better team without Ewing, Bird said: ``No, not at all. I think
with Patrick Ewing in there they're a lot better. You've seen at
the end of games here in our series, every time they needed a
basket down the stretch they went to Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose, the Pacers' sixth man, said: ``A lot of people were
talking during the season about them being a better team without
Patrick. Now we'll have a chance to see.''

OFFICERS' DEFENSE: TORTURER ACTED ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the final day of arguments in the Abner Louima
police brutality case, the lawyer for a police officer charged with
holding Louima down while Justin A. Volpe tortured him declared
Thursday that his client was the victim of an unjustified attempt
to widen the case beyond ``one sick, depraved'' officer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the officer, Charles Schwarz, sought to convince
the jurors in Federal District Court in Brooklyn that Schwarz had
not joined in the attack with Volpe, who has admitted that he
jammed a stick into Louima's rectum in a restroom at a Brooklyn
police station two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said as he entered his guilty plea last week that another
officer, whom he did not identify, had been in the restroom with
him. He described the other officer only as someone who ``saw what
was going on'' and ``did nothing to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in responding to the prosecution charge that the other
officer was Schwarz, his lawyer, Stephen C. Worth, said that
Schwarz was not in the restroom at all, and argued that the
prosecution had sought to expand the case to show that police
brutality went beyond ``a few bad apples'' like Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been tried to be made into this culture of
police brutality, and it never was,'' Worth said, holding that the
case involved a form of ``rape'' that a single officer had
committed against a prisoner in ``some kind of sick rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth's closing arguments reflected statements on Wednesday in
which defense lawyers for two of the other three officers on trial
and the prosecution invoked Volpe's name to their own ends. Neither
side called Volpe as a witness, saying they believed he had no
credibility, but the prosecution used its closing arguments to
portray Volpe as the ``driving force'' behind the crimes against
Louima, while defense lawyers used theirs to suggest to the jury
that the only guilty officer had come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Worth continued that argument Thursday. He said that Louima
``has been vindicated'' by Volpe's plea and that the jury should
now vindicate Schwarz by acquitting him.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is expected to begin deliberations in the case Friday.
The others on trial include Officers Thomas Wiese and Thomas
Bruder, who prosecutors say joined Volpe and Schwarz in beating
Louima in a police car after he was arrested in a street brawl in
Flatbush, Brooklyn, in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Michael Bellomo is charged with trying to cover up the
alleged beating in the police car and Volpe's assault of a second
man, Patrick Antoine, in the area of the melee.
</P>
<P>
   The case has had bitter racial overtones from the time that
Louima, who is black, first accused the officers, who are white, of
brutalizing him.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in giving the final prosecution argument, Loretta E.
Lynch, chief assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, contended that
Wiese had ``tried to hide behind the color of his girlfriend's
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a response to a defense argument Wednesday, and earlier
in the trial, that Wiese's fiancee, a black woman, would not ``have
had a child with him and moved in with him and become his fiancee''
if he had been the kind of man who used racial slurs, as Louima had
earlier testified to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lynch criticized the argument Thursday, a woman sitting
with relatives and friends of Wiese in the packed courtroom gallery
said, ``Oh, come on!'' Later, members of the group complained to
Ms. Lynch's boss, Zachary W. Carter, the United States attorney,
who was also sitting in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's lawyers asked Judge Eugene H. Nickerson to declare a
mistrial, arguing that Ms. Lynch's comment could create prejudice
against the officer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said they considered it proper for them to refer to
the officer's fiancee in the context of refuting Louima's
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   In his summation, Worth also assailed Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M.
Kornberg, for his suggestion in his opening argument in the case a
month ago that Louima's severe internal injuries _ a torn rectum
and bladder _ had been caused not by Volpe's attack with the stick
but by a consensual sex act with another man.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion, Worth said, was ``despicable and, frankly,
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was insulting to you and it was insulting to us and it was
insulting and offensive to Abner Louima,'' he told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg, who has not been in the courtroom since Volpe pleaded
guilty last week and was jailed, said later, ``Every lawyer has to
say and do what's best for his client's interests, and that
certainly goes for Steve Worth during his summation, although he
did not take that position at the beginning of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo's lawyer, John Patten, said in his closing argument
Thursday that rather than trying to cover anything up, the sergeant
had made ``honest mistakes'' in his reports about what had happened
in the chaotic street melee in which Louima and Antoine were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's here because the prosecution needed to have a boss in the
case,'' he said, referring to Bellomo's rank as a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lynch responded that Bellomo was being tried not ``because
of his rank,'' but because of his efforts to cover up illegal
assaults by his officers and then hide his original cover-up
attempt.

   ROCHE TO PAY $4.2 BILLION FOR THE REST OF GENENTECH
</P>
<P>
   Roche Holding, the European drug maker, said that it would
exercise its right to buy the 33 percent of Genentech it does not
already own for $82.50 a share, or $4.2 billion. Roche will then
issue new shares equivalent to as much as 19 percent of Genentech,
the pioneering biotechnology company, so the company can continue
to be publicly traded. Analysts said the transaction was good for
Roche, which should realize a gain when it sells shares, and good
for Genentech, which retains its quasi-independent status. But it
is not so good for stockholders because shares have been as high as
$90 over the last year. They fell $4.50, to $82, on the news.
</P>
<P>
   RETAIL SALES INCREASED 5.6 PERCENT IN MAY
</P>
<P>
   Sales in retail stores open at least a year rose 5.6 percent in
May as consumers continued to show great confidence in the economy
by snatching up everything from wardrobes in summer white to pool
furniture.

   STOCKS MIXED AHEAD OF JOBS REPORT

<P>
   Stock prices were mixed as traders and investors awaited
Friday's release of the government's monthly report on the job
market for May. The Nasdaq composite index finished with a loss of
29.09 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,403.32. The Dow Jones industrial
average surged in the final 15 minutes of trading and ended with a
gain of 85.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,663.69. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index ended with a gain of 4.73 points, or 0.4

   MICROSOFT SCRUTINIZES TESTIMONY
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Microsoft questioned the credibility of James
Barksdale, the chief executive of Netscape, in the rebuttal phase
of the software giant's antitrust trial. The apparent
inconsistencies between Barksdale's testimony last fall and
statements out of court caught the attention of Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson _ so much so that the judge urged a government
lawyer to take account of them in court.

   NEW PUBLISHER AT LOS ANGELES TIMES

paper's president for the last 14 months, was hand-picked by Willes
as his successor.

   SANCTIONS SOUGHT IN BEEF DISPUTE
</P>

   A trans-Atlantic fight over hormone-treated beef intensified

ON BASEBALL: METS SINK INTO MIRE OF UNMET EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About those plans to watch the Subway Series in
October, better plan instead to watch the Mets and the Yankees this
weekend and July 9-11 and save October for watching the leaves
change colors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tarnish on the legendary status they gained last
season, the Yankees will play in October. Even if the Boston Red
Sox should somehow continue playing well over their heads and gain
revenge for 1978, the Yankees are virtually guaranteed a spot in
the playoffs. No one in their own division or either of the other
divisions would beat them out of the wild-card entry.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets are another matter. The Mets once again have
promised more than they can deliver. They have fooled their fans
and themselves before, and here they have gone and done it again.
</P>
<P>
   The team that was going to challenge the perennial champions of
their division or, at the least, snatch the wild-card spot is
stumbling all over itself. A third of the way through the season,
the Mets are 27-26 and have established only that the race they are
running in is the one with the Los Angeles Dodgers to see which can
be the league's most disappointing and underachieving team.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mets await Friday night's start of their first three-game
interleague series with the Yankees, five National League teams
that aren't in first place, four in the supposedly weaker Central
Division alone, have better records. That's a lot of company for a
wild-card race even if the season has four months to run.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Mets put together a team they thought worthy
of post-season play, the manager, Jeff Torborg, paid for their
miscalculation. He wasn't fired that season, 1992, but that was his
first with the Mets. He was, however, gone after 38 games of the
1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   No one has suggested that a repeat of that act is being
contemplated this season, but Bobby Valentine is in the classic
dismissal position. The Mets have a $63.5 million payroll, eighth
highest in the major leagues; they made moves during the winter
designed to improve the team and they are playing poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow we have to shake it up to get it back on track,''
general manager Steve Phillips said on the telephone Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He had not been asked about Valentine's status, and he
presumably was not alluding to Valentine's status, but teams have
been known to fire their manager to shake things up and get the
team back on track, especially when they feel they should be on the
track headed for first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood,'' Phillips added, ``is the solutions are from
within because there aren't any solutions from without.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager, it is well known, does not hit for the hitters and
he does not pitch for the pitchers. Injuries generally are beyond
his control. Nevertheless, managers are fired all the time when a
team underachieves, especially an expensive team.
</P>
<P>
   With the Atlanta Braves suddenly looking vulnerable under the
weight of the uncharacteristically ineffective pitching of Greg
Maddux and Tom Glavine, the Mets had a wonderful opportunity to
establish their credentials as replacement champions.
</P>
<P>
   But they failed to take advantage of Atlanta's problems,
spiraled into a skid of their own and plummeted five games behind
the Braves. Rather than resemble a challenger for the Braves'
perennial division championship, the Mets have more readily evoked
memories of 1962, the year of the 40-120 record.
</P>
<P>
   With the sweeps by Arizona and Cincinnati, the Mets lost
successive three-game series at home for the first time since 1962.
In May, the pitchers compiled a 5.71 earned run average. Only once
before, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, had the Mets' staff
produced a higher ERA in a calendar month. The ERA was 6.32; the
month was the first of their existence, April 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the Mets did not have a $63.5 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   If Valentine survives the team he has been unable to spark and
the Mets don't supplant the Braves, he will solidify his rank among
managers who have never finished first. With 65 more games _
concluding Aug. 14 in San Francisco, barring rainouts _ Valentine
will supplant Jimmy McAleer (1901-11) as No. 3 on that list.
Valentine will have managed 1,659 games without a winner and will
have only Paul Richards (1,837) and Jimmy Dykes (2,962) ahead of
him.
</P>
<P>
   As if the team's shortcomings haven't created enough problems,
Valentine has more people in baseball pulling against him than any
other individual. Brian McRae, the Mets' center fielder, raised
that issue after a late-season loss last year, and others have
brought attention to it this season.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Arizona Diamondbacks said that one of their
pitchers wanted ``to go after'' Valentine last Saturday when the
manager questioned the glove of the team's 20-year-old relief
pitcher, Byung Hyun Kim. Then Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon
questioned Jason Isringhausen's glove as he was about to pitch
against the Reds on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips prefers to focus on the races, division and wild-card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're five behind the Braves and three behind the Cubs,'' he
said. ``It's not like we've buried ourselves. This is a test to see
how strong we are. We have our work cut out for us. We're going
into Yankeetown and that's not an easy task for us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets emerge having been swept for a third successive
series, October won't come soon enough. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE KOSOVO PEACE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   Unless Slobodan Milosevic is playing diplomatic games, the war
in Yugoslavia is ending. Thanks to the resolve of NATO and
constructive peacemaking by Russia, Milosevic on Thursday accepted
settlement terms that he had repeatedly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that critical details can be worked out with Belgrade,
more than a million displaced ethnic Albanians should be able to
return home safely later this year and ethnic cleansing in the
Balkans will stop. If so, the most dangerous military conflict in
Europe since the Second World War will conclude as a victory for
the principles of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his European allies must insure that the
Kosovo peace plan is not diluted as specific measures are set and
carried out. Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, one of the
architects of the plan, said Thursday that he had no doubt that
Milosevic well understood its terms during their meeting in
Belgrade, including the use of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo and the
withdrawal of Serbian forces from the province. But Milosevic has a
long record of undermining agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing should end only when NATO can verify that a
substantial number of the 50,000 Serbian troops in Kosovo have
left. Plans for this withdrawal should be set by Belgrade as
quickly as possible in consultation with NATO commanders. It will
be the first tangible sign that Milosevic is serious about the
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Ukrainian soldiers should participate in the
peacekeeping force, but overall command must be retained by Western
nations. NATO will have to move quickly to assemble the 50,000
troops it intends to use, including 7,000 Americans. It would be
best if the United Nations Security Council authorized the use of
peacekeepers in Kosovo to eliminate the perception that their
presence is solely a U.S. or NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's abrupt retreat after meeting with Ahtisaari and
Russian envoy Victor Chernomyrdin was surely spurred in part by the
NATO air offensive. The sustained bombing has been more effective
than many critics allowed, and for the most part was conducted with
restraint and a proper regard for civilian casualties. Though air
power alone may not win wars, this conflict demonstrated that over
time it can grind down an opponent's will to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin's courageous decision to align Russia with the
West despite opposition at home left Milosevic without any credible
ally. Chernomyrdin was especially helpful in developing the peace
deal in concert with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is doubtless thinking about his own political
survival, always his first concern. Weeks of additional bombing,
and the prospect of a possible NATO invasion, might eventually have
eroded his support in Serbia. Because the peace plan does not call
for the independence of Kosovo, he can argue that he successfully
defended Serbian interests. He will also gain the assistance of
NATO peacekeepers in disarming and pacifying ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, a step vital to restoring peace to Kosovo. Unhappily,
as long as Milosevic remains in power, it is unlikely he will be
arrested and prosecuted for crimes against humanity. Someday he
must be held accountable for his savage assault on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation and reconstruction in Kosovo, as well as Serbia,
will not come quickly or easily, and Milosevic's continued rule is
an impediment to both. But if the peace plan holds up, everything
possible must be done to get the ethnic Albanian refugees home and
their villages rebuilt. They are the primary victims of Milosevic's
policies, and they must be the primary beneficiaries of peace.

KOSOVO PEACE ACCORD: 10 STEPS TO VERIFIABLE END OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the text of the international proposal
to end the Kosovo conflict that was accepted Thursday by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. The text was provided by the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement should be reached on the following principles to move
toward a resolution of the Kosovo crisis:
</P>
<P>
   1. Immediate and verifiable end of violence and repression in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   2. Verifiable withdrawal from Kosovo of all military, police and
paramilitary forces according to a rapid timetable.
</P>
<P>
   3. Deployment in Kosovo under U.N. auspices of effective
international civil and security presences, acting as may be
decided under Chapter VII of the Charter, capable of guaranteeing
the achievement of common objectives.
</P>
<P>
   4. The international security presence with substantial NATO
participation must be deployed under unified command and control
and authorized to establish a safe environment of all people in
Kosovo and to facilitate the safe return to their homes of all
displaced persons and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   5. Establishment of an interim administration of Kosovo as a
part of the international civil presence under which the people of
Kosovo can enjoy substantial autonomy within the F.R.Y. (Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia) to be decided by the Security Council of
the United Nations. Interim administration to provide transitional
administration while establishing and overseeing the development of
provisional democratic self-governing institutions to insure
conditions for a peaceful and normal life for all inhabitants in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   6. After withdrawal, an agreed number of Yugoslav and Serbian
personnel will be permitted to return to perform the following
functions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Liaison with international civil mission and international
security presence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marking/clearing minefields.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maintaining a presence at Serb patrimonial sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maintaining a presence at key border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   7. Safe and free return of all refugees and displaced persons
under the supervision of the U.N.H.C.R. and unimpeded access to
Kosovo by humanitarian aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   8. A political process towards the establishment of an interim
political framework agreement providing for a substantial
self-government for Kosovo, taking full account of the Rambouillet
accords and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries of
the region, and the demilitarization of the U.C.K. [Kosovo
Liberation Army). Negotiations between the parties for the
settlement should not delay or disrupt the establishment of
democratic self-governing institutions.
</P>
<P>
   9. Comprehensive approach to the economic development and
stabilization of the crisis region. This will include the
implementation of a Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe with
broad international participation in order to further promotion of
democracy, economic prosperity, stability and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   10. Suspension of military activity will require acceptance of
the principles set forth above in addition to agreement to other,
previously identified, required elements, which are specified in
the footnote below. A military-technical agreement will then be
rapidly concluded that would, among other things, specify
additional modalities including the roles and function of
Yugoslav/Serb personnel in Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawal
</P>
<P>
   _ Procedures for withdrawals, including the phased, detailed
schedule and delineation of a buffer area in Serbia beyond which
forces will be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Returning Personnel
</P>
<P>
   _ Equipment associated with returning personnel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terms of reference for their functional responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timetable for their return.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delineation of their geographical areas of operation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rules governing their relationship to international security
presence and international civil mission.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE
</P>
<P>
   Other Required Elements
</P>
<P>
   _ Rapid and precise timetable for withdrawals, meaning e.g.,
seven days to complete withdrawal; air defense weapons withdrawn
outside a 25 kilometer mutual safety zone within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Return of personnel for the four functions specified above
will be under the supervision of the international security
presence, and will be limited to a small agreed number (hundreds,
not thousands).
</P>
<P>
   _ Suspension of military activity will occur after the beginning
of verifiable withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   _ The discussion and achieving of a military-technical agreement
shall not extend the previously determined time for completion of
withdrawals.

CROMBIE TAYLOR, ARCHITECT WHO HELPED CHAMPION BAUHAUS, DIES AT 85  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., Ill., Calif.)   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crombie Taylor, an architect and teacher who helped spread the
influence of the Bauhaus to American architecture during the 1940s,
died on May 24. He was 85 and lived in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oakmont, Pa., Taylor was educated at Penn State and
Princeton University. In 1944 he joined the Institute of Design, a
Chicago school founded by a former Bauhaus instructor, Laszlo
Moholy-Nagy. The school was a successor to the New Bauhaus, so
called because its faculty included prominent refugees from Nazi
Germany. After Moholy-Nagy's death in 1946 Taylor became assistant
director to the designer Serge Chermayeff.
</P>
<P>
   While in Chicago, Taylor became a passionate enthusiast of the
work of Louis Sullivan, a pioneer of modern skyscraper design and
the mentor of Frank Lloyd Wright. Taylor was instrumental in the
restoration of interior spaces at Sullivan's Auditorium Building at
Roosevelt University in Chicago. The Chicago architect John Vinci,
Taylor's student at the time, said his restoration of the
building's banquet hall in 1967 was ``a revelation that introduced
a new way of thinking about Sullivan.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's work included unearthing Sullivan's long-neglected
polychromatic stencils for the auditorium's ceilings and walls.
Taylor had recently completed a book on Sullivan's work, written in
collaboration with Jeffrey Plank. It is to be published next year
by Harry N. Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's own architectural work was spare, in the manner of Mies
van der Rohe, but distinguished by interiors furnished with 18th-
and 19th-century antiques. In 1973 Taylor was elected a fellow of
the American Institute of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Hope; three children, Victoria
Taylor of Los Angeles, Beth Fergon of Monterey, Calif., and John
Taylor of Santa Barbara, and two grandchildren.

AS CHARISMATIC SEEKS THE TRIPLE CROWN, ABC IS SMILING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silver Charm proved it. So did Real Quiet. If you're a horse,
and you've won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, you can
boost ABC's Belmont Stakes ratings by showing up and looking
competitive. You don't even have to win, although the Triple Crown
means nice cash and plenty of gourmet oats.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Real Quiet's loss by a nose to Victory Gallop
elevated the Belmont's Nielsen rating to a 5.9 from a 5.3 for
Silver Charm's loss in 1997 by three-quarters of length. The year
before, when the Kentucky Derby winner, Grindstone, skipped the
Preakness because of a knee injury, the Belmont rated a 2.9.
</P>
<P>
   Two consecutive near-Triple Crown winners emboldened Al Michaels
of ABC Sports to say, ``I don't know how we'd handle the Belmont if
this were not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get giddy when an equine nears Visa's $5 million
bonus. If Charismatic runs away from the pack, might ESPN amend its
list of the century's 100 greatest North American athletes?
Secretariat's place is secure at No. 35.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will focus on Charismatic's gallop to glory/disappointment
with 37 cameras, including two isolated on him, and some others on
his owners, trainer and chiropodist. The vehicle-borne ``Ben-Hur''
camera will follow the race from an access road inside the track.
Whether a victory by Charismatic can solve all of thoroughbred
racing's ills is uncertain. Newly created fans will probably not
follow him around the country and jam tracks. He's only one horse!
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to get too far ahead,'' said Tim Smith, commissioner
of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, ``but if he wins
the Triple Crown, he could run several more times this year and
there'd be a lot of celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic could star in the Breeders' Cup, shoot a layout for
Cigar Aficionado and ink licensing deals. Actually, his handlers
have cut a licensing deal with the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, which is selling his T-shirts and caps. But if he wins
Saturday, Charismatic will not wear the officially licensed locker
room cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Cigar's victory tour, he traveled the country and
people wanted to see him,'' said Smith. ``It was a little like
McGwire and Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   As he ages, Charismatic could take advantage of the thoroughbred
association's plans. ``We're trying to harness the great public
relations of the Triple Crown by setting up a series for older
horses,'' said Smith. May I suggest the AARP Handicap?
</P>
<P>
   The experience of two potential Triple Crown winners has caused
the Belmont to expand its marketing. ``The last couple of years, we
decided to spend a couple of hundred thousand dollars on ads only
after the Preakness,'' said Terence Meyocks, president of the New
York Racing Association. ``This year, we decided no matter what,
we'd spend it, Triple Crown or not.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is unworried about competition coming from the
Mets-Yankees and the Pacers-Knicks games. ``I've gotten hundreds of
requests from people who never would have thought of coming but are
coming Saturday,'' he said. ``People sense there is something
special here.''

HAMM RELUCTANTLY HOGS THE LIMELIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During a recent conversation with Cobi Jones'
agent, Corey Clemetson, the discussion turned to who is the most
popular American soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clemetson gave numerous reasons why Jones deserves
that label. He sells the most Major League Soccer merchandise, had
an MTV health show gig and sports those popular dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with that, except... he hasn't done a
commercial with Michael Jordan. That honor belongs to Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, who recently became the world's scoring leader, was joined
by her U.S. teammates Tuesday at a Los Angeles hotel to promote the
upcoming 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, which starts June 19 and ends
July 10 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, who has earned almost every soccer award imaginable _ four
NCAA championships at North Carolina, a 1991 World Cup title, a
1996 Olympic gold medal and two athlete-of-the-year awards _ is
arguably the most popular soccer player in America.
</P>
<P>
   With no disrespect to Jones, Alexi Lalas, Eric Wynalda or anyone
else, U.S. coach Tony DiCiccio thinks Hamm is one of those special
people who the media, corporate America and the fans love to
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably the most popular soccer player that we've ever
had,'' DiCiccio said. ``That's not to take away from any of the
other great names in soccer that have been the missionaries leading
up to this point, but she kind of surpasses just sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gone into that category of where she's at the
entertainment level now. Her name is recognized by people who don't
know anything about soccer. She's become an icon, not only for
women's athletics but soccer in general. It's just a tremendous
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm shrugs off any comparisons to the men's players or thoughts
that she carries the torch for women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, she does. Whether it's her two-fisted pump or
just shouting to the sky, Hamm is exciting and fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go out and try to play as hard as I can,'' Hamm said.
``I want to do whatever I can to help my team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say, though, when I play, I play with a lot of
intensity, emotion and passion. I can't change that; that's the
only way I've known how to play. I think people get excited with
that, and I'm just thankful that they enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The label of women's soccer's best player is one Hamm deals with
on a daily basis, but it's not one with which she's comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to just keep it in perspective,'' she said. ``People
want to attach labels to you because it's easy to do that. But I
have to give the same things that every player who might not get
the same attention gives. I'm only one player on this team and, if
I don't realize that, then somebody else should be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon neared its end and several TV network cameras
hovered around Hamm for one more quick interview, DiCiccio wondered
if any knew about her best attribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has so many wonderful qualities, but I'll tell you what:
Her best one is just how humble she is,'' he said. ``We're in a day
and age where athletes of her caliber expect these accolades _ but
not Mia. She's just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't give you a bunch of rhetoric; she's truly sincere.
She's not one to stand on the top pedestal and show off her
abilities.... Let me tell you, for a society looking for a sports
hero, she's definitely a breath of fresh air.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ From the moment Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic rejected NATO's terms for agreement at Rambouillet in
March and NATO embarked on its military operation, U.S. President
Bill Clinton was adamant that the use of military force was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons were moral _ to end the suffering of the Kosovo
Albanians _ and strategic _ to stabilize the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   While there was an element of political calculation, the
consistency with which he represented the decision always suggested
a more personal commitment reflective of his temperament and
generation.
</P>
<P>
   He has had an ambivalent relationship with the military since
his first presidential campaign, when documents suggested he dodged
the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely looks comfortable addressing military audiences and
his salute still looks unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, perhaps, his lack of experience may have given him
something to prove, and he has resorted to force more than any
recent president _ helped by the end of the Cold War, which removed
the risk of precipitating a superpower conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, though, there appeared also to be three other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   First was his sense that if Yugoslavia could be pacified, the
last source of instability in Europe could be removed, leaving the
continent with a durable peace. That would be a legacy this
legacy-conscious president could claim when he left office.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor was not to repeat the mistake of leaving
intervention too late, as he believed happened with the breakup of
Yugoslavia and the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The third, common to the new generation of European leaders, was
a grander ambition: to end the 20th century by demonstrating that
nothing like the Holocaust could happen again, because the next
generation of leaders would not flinch from meeting force with
force.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed into advocates of limited force, the likes of Bill
Clinton have resurrected the just war, a concept their anti-war
campaigning qualifies them uniquely to embrace. &QL;

<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, widely portrayed as ``NATO's
hawk'' during the Kosovo crisis, does not mind looking tough but
believes his label does not do him justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not about being a hawk _ it is about being right,'' one
of the prime minister's closest aides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   British cabinet ministers believe Blair has come into his own
during the Kosovo crisis, seeing his ``just war'' as a moral as
well as military crusade.
</P>
<P>
   They see it as a foreign policy parallel to his belief in
creating social justice at home, stemming from his Christian
Socialist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Blair feels completely at home with Britain's
armed-service chiefs _ unlike many of his Labour predecessors. He
struck up a good relationship with the chiefs of staff while he was
Opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sometimes gives the impression he would like to go on the
bombing raids himself,'' quipped one minister.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three months, Blair has devoted most of his waking
hours to Kosovo, to the surprise of Cabinet colleagues. At the same
time, he had to juggle the fragile peace process in Northern
Ireland and the already gruelling day-to-day grind of government.
</P>
<P>
   At both home and abroad, Blair can expect to reap a dividend
from the peace settlement. He can argue that NATO's determination
to stand firm produced a deal very much on its own terms and not
those of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will enhance Blair's reputation on the world
stage, helping Britain to ``punch above its weight'' as the Foreign
Office calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Blair will get the credit for stiffening NATO spines _ including
U.S. President Bill Clinton's _ when they threatened to ``go
wobbly.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Clinton are back on good terms now, but there was a
sticky patch when the U.S. president told the prime minister to get
a grip on aides he accused of highlighting NATO's differences by
talking up the possible use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the 10-week air campaign worked without NATO troops
going in. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The war in Kosovo has shown both the strengths and
weaknesses of NATO, and they are the reverse of what might have
been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatically, the alliance has kept together well through
months of crisis. But the price has been a lack of military
effectiveness. The key European allies _ Britain, France, Italy and
Germany _ have been sharply divided over the war.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and to a lesser extent France have been keen to escalate
the conflict, with British Prime Minister Tony Blair pushing
publicly for a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Germany have been far less keen, with both countries
insisting that there could be no land invasion under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   America has stayed in the middle, refusing London's pressure for
ground operations and blocking moves from Berlin and Rome for a
bombing pause.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, the need to keep the allies together imposed severe
constraints. Target lists were pared down to accommodate alliance
concerns; operations had to be agreed through cumbersome structures
in Brussels and Mons.
</P>
<P>
   The war makes clear that a European defense policy run by the EU
is a far off. Had there been a ground invasion, it would almost
certainly have been led by American troops, with the British and
probably the French accompanying.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Europeans were well-represented in the early stages
of the war, this was not the case as the number of air strikes went
up. The combined contributions of France and Britain paled in
comparison with U.S. efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The war will help America press its view that Europe must spend
more on weapons, especially advanced technology. The Europeans will
argue that they need to create their own defense structures around
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force will claim a victory for air power, while its
critics will say that the war in Kosovo showed precisely the
limitations of aerial force. &QL;

   SKOPJE _ It began in urgent whispers; within minutes it had
turned into an excited murmur which seemed to fill the camp.
Serbian President and ethnic cleanser Slobodan Milosevic had
accepted the peace deal, they may at last be going home to their
beloved Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true my son, is it true?'' An old woman dressed in black
with most of her teeth missing and bright shining eyes tugged at
the arm of a young man. He impatiently shook her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me listen, they are saying it now,'' then he bent forward
into the group huddled around a radio. Around them there were
similar clusters, all avidly soaking in the news.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at Stenkovec II outside Skopje was, no doubt, being
repeated in camps around Macedonia and Albania. What seemed
unbelievable appeared to be happening at last and there was a
growing belief that their days of suffering may be coming to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   At Stenkovec, after the news broke there was a buzz, then a sort
of silence as if people were trying to adjust to what was
happening. Then the talking and debates began.
</P>
<P>
   Some made a rush along the dusty track to a large tent where
France Telecom were offering free three-minute calls, others begged
aid workers, U.N. officials and journalists to borrow their mobile
phones, something which has not happened for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Emier Bashi did not want to phone, he just wanted to show a
photo of the house he had left behind near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was building a garage there,'' he said jabbing a finger at
the grainy and grubby picture. ``And that is the garden. It is a
big garden, there is a big tree and we used to have our meals under
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure it's still there?'' his friend Hakim asked
half-jokingly, ``The Chetniks may have destroyed it.'' But Emier
would not be dissuaded from his dream. ``No, no they didn't burn
it, I have news,'' he nodded firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Others just wanted to go back, even if there was not much to go
back to.
</P>
<P>
   ``They set fire to my house. We saw it burning when we left. One
of the Serb soldiers hit me on the shoulder because I kept turning
around,'' said Fahmi Ramidi, a teacher. ``But the land is there,
they could not burn the land, could they? We shall build another
house, we have five brothers, we shall do it together.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, for the time being at least, a lot of laughter and
chattering among the lines of the tents.
</P>
<P>
   Even the normally taciturn and scowling Macedonian guards, whose
job used to keep the refugees in behind the wires, seemed relaxed.
One of them almost broke into a smile as he waved in the general
direction of the 22,000 penned inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can go home, and we can start living normally again now.
No one wants this.''
</P>
<P>
   It may, however, be a while before that happens. Although the
Macedonian authorities would like nothing better than to tip all
270,000 within its border back into Kosovo the minute peace is
declared, NATO has told the U.N. Aid Agency that it would be at
least a month before the roads and the land, with their mines and
fallen allied weaponry, can be made safe.
</P>
<P>
   But for some, that is not the only danger. Fahrije Krahiqi, and
her husband Zamiz come from the village of Stanovc in the north of
Kosovo. Their fear is going back to a zone controlled by the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrije said: ``Frankly that is almost as bad as being under
Milosevic. We know that the Russians and the Serbians are brothers.
We have heard that there are Russians serving in the Serbian army.
How can we trust them?''
</P>
<P>
   An U.N. official said: ``It could get like Europe after the
Second World War with refugees struggling to get into the Western
sector rather than the Soviet one. The details of this peace plan
will have to be very carefully worked out. We have a lot of very
nervous people here.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO 925) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   For some in the camp there was a bitter edge to the rejoicing.
They had lost members of their family as they came out of Kosovo,
and they are still missing. The search for them goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Vitina Bekoli has been trying to find out what happened to her
18-year-old brother who got separated when the family were ordered
to leave their home near Obelic.
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``My mother has hardly spoken since this happened. She
just sits there, she is worrying herself to death. Of course we are
glad that there will perhaps be peace, but am I going to get my
brother back?
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's not the only one, there are thousands like him. Will
NATO help us find these missing ones or are they going to be
forgotten just because Milosevic had agreed to this deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Arife Hamah has not seen his wife and family when he fled from
his home in Pristina. A 23-year-old student, he was warned that the
Serbs were rounding up young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall find them, I know they haven't died. It will take a
long time perhaps but I'm hoping that if we all return from
different directions to our home we shall meet up again. That is my
hope anyway.'' &QL;

similar clusters, all avidly soaking in the news.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at Stenkovec II outside Skopje was, no doubt, being
repeated in camps around Macedonia and Albania. What seemed
unbelievable appeared to be happening at last and there was a
growing belief that their days of suffering may be coming to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   At Stenkovec, after the news broke there was a buzz, then a sort
of silence as if people were trying to adjust to what was
happening. Then the talking and debates began.
</P>
<P>
   Some made a rush along the dusty track to a large tent where
France Telecom were offering free three-minute calls, others begged
aid workers, U.N. officials and journalists to borrow their mobile
phones, something which has not happened for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Emier Bashi did not want to phone, he just wanted to show a
photo of the house he had left behind near Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was building a garage there,'' he said jabbing a finger at
the grainy and grubby picture. ``And that is the garden. It is a
big garden, there is a big tree and we used to have our meals under
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure it's still there?'' his friend Hakim asked
half-jokingly, ``The Chetniks may have destroyed it.'' But Emier
would not be dissuaded from his dream. ``No, no they didn't burn
it, I have news,'' he nodded firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Others just wanted to go back, even if there was not much to go
back to.
</P>
<P>
   ``They set fire to my house. We saw it burning when we left. One
of the Serb soldiers hit me on the shoulder because I kept turning
around,'' said Fahmi Ramidi, a teacher. ``But the land is there,
they could not burn the land, could they? We shall build another
house, we have five brothers, we shall do it together.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, for the time being at least, a lot of laughter and
chattering among the lines of the tents.
</P>
<P>
   Even the normally taciturn and scowling Macedonian guards, whose
job used to keep the refugees in behind the wires, seemed relaxed.
One of them almost broke into a smile as he waved in the general
direction of the 22,000 penned inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can go home, and we can start living normally again now.
No one wants this.''
</P>
<P>
   It may, however, be a while before that happens. Although the
Macedonian authorities would like nothing better than to tip all
270,000 within its border back into Kosovo the minute peace is
declared, NATO has told the U.N. Aid Agency that it would be at
least a month before the roads and the land, with their mines and
fallen allied weaponry, can be made safe.
</P>
<P>
   But for some, that is not the only danger. Fahrije Krahiqi, and
her husband Zamiz come from the village of Stanovc in the north of
Kosovo. Their fear is going back to a zone controlled by the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrije said: ``Frankly that is almost as bad as being under
Milosevic. We know that the Russians and the Serbians are brothers.
We have heard that there are Russians serving in the Serbian army.
How can we trust them?''
</P>
<P>
   An U.N. official said: ``It could get like Europe after the
Second World War with refugees struggling to get into the Western
sector rather than the Soviet one. The details of this peace plan
will have to be very carefully worked out. We have a lot of very
nervous people here.'' &QL;

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO 925) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   For some in the camp there was a bitter edge to the rejoicing.
They had lost members of their family as they came out of Kosovo,
and they are still missing. The search for them goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Vitina Bekoli has been trying to find out what happened to her
18-year-old brother who got separated when the family were ordered
to leave their home near Obelic.
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``My mother has hardly spoken since this happened. She
just sits there, she is worrying herself to death. Of course we are
glad that there will perhaps be peace, but am I going to get my
brother back?
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's not the only one, there are thousands like him. Will
NATO help us find these missing ones or are they going to be
forgotten just because Milosevic had agreed to this deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Arife Hamah has not seen his wife and family when he fled from
his home in Pristina. A 23-year-old student, he was warned that the
Serbs were rounding up young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall find them, I know they haven't died. It will take a
long time perhaps but I'm hoping that if we all return from
different directions to our home we shall meet up again. That is my
hope anyway.'' &QL;

KUEHNE'S LEADS BY 1 IN U.S. WOMEN'S OPEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ It was 90 degrees in the shade, but Kelli
Kuehne's performance was even hotter.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with poise and precision, and displaying the talent that
carried her to U.S. Amateur championships in 1995 and 1996, Kuehne
stole the first-round spotlight Thursday at the U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting the second-best round in Open history, and setting a
course record at Old Waverly Golf Club, Kuehne finished with an
8-under par 64. That was one stroke better than Juli Inkster and
three strokes better than Moira Dunn, who was at 67.
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri Pak, the defending champion, was tied for fourth place
(68) with Dottie Pepper and Sherri Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Kelli Kuehne many expected to see last year, when
she joined the LPGA Tour at age 21, backed by a lucrative contract
from Nike and carrying great expectations after a splendid amateur
career. But Kuehne struggled as a rookie, earning just $39,831 and
finishing 124th on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   She returned this year with a fresh attitude, a better game and
an insulin pump she wears on her waist while playing, which has
enabled her to cope better with the diabetes condition she has had
since age 10.
</P>
<P>
   After winning her first professional tournament on Sunday, the
LPGA Corning Classic, Kuehne entered this week with momentum. Is
Kuehne ready to win a U.S. Open at age 22? Didn't Pak win last year
at age 20?
</P>
<P>
   ``My driving was solid, my irons were sharp, and my putting was
true,'' said Kuehne, who needed only 25 putts during her round.
``I've been playing really well and I came here this week with a
lot of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this course is in unbelievable shape. If you pick the
right line, you can make a lot of putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne fell one stroke short of the Open record 63 shot by Helen
Alfredsson in 1994 during the first round at Indianwood Golf and
Country Club in Lake Orion, Mich. But that was a par-71 course, so
Kuehne's 8-under Thursday matched Alfredsson's 8-under.
</P>
<P>
   Making eight birdies during a bogey-free round, Kuehne's putting
stroke was the key. She set the tone at No. 1 by making a 30-footer
for birdie, and later she made another 30-footer at the 12th hole,
and an 18-footer at the 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   When Kuehne made four consecutive birdies at the sixth through
ninth holes and made the turn at 5-under par, the leader board was
filled with red numbers. The Open is not usually a birdie-fest, but
with the greens softened by heavy rains Wednesday, and with the
rough at Old Waverly lower than most Opens, players kept firing at
pins and making putts.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest obstacle was the heat, as 90-degree afternoon
temperatures, coupled with 60-degree humidity, led to a heat index
of 99. However, no player looked cooler than Kuehne, who at 5 feet
2 inches averages about 245 yards off the tee, and held her own on
one of the longer-playing Open courses.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne was virtually raised on a course, part of a remarkable
golfing family from Dallas. Her oldest brother, Trip, finished
second to Tiger Woods at the 1995 U.S. Amateur. Her 23-year-old
brother, Hank, is the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, and he will
turn professional when he leaves SMU this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne's parents, Ernie and Pam, followed their daughter with
pride Thursday, and smiled with every birdie. ``She put a lot of
pressure on herself last year,'' her father said. ``It was tough
for her. But she's really coming on now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelli admitted as much earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know I still have the same instinct I had during
my amateur days because that's been missing for a while,'' Kuehne
said. ``I've struggled as a pro. The most frustrating thing is that
I have not played to my potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out here, it was great that I had a great amateur
record, but it didn't do anything for me. I needed to earn the
respect of my peers. It's something I had to reestablish this year
by playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne continued to earn that respect Thursday, but with proved
winners like Inkster, Pepper, and Pak lurking in contention, the
tournament was just beginning. Yet Kuehne's round was one to savor.
And she hoped the best was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I wanted to show everyone I belonged out here and
that I could play,'' Kuehne said. ``That dug me into a hole. Then
you realize that you have nothing to prove except to yourself. Last
year wasn't much fun. It was growing pains. But now, I feel great
about my game.''

BOTH SIDES IN CREDIT CARD ABUSE GAME NEED BETTER CONTROLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there are two groups that deserve each other, it's those who
abuse credit cards and the companies that market them
irresponsibly.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Consumer Federation of America survey showed three of
four respondents saying credit card issuers bear at least part of
the blame for the surge of bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   The respondents are right, and so was the federation's executive
director when he called the credit card industry ``shameless'' for
pushing tighter bankruptcy restrictions ``while they aggressively
market and extend credit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aggressively'' is too mild a characterization, though, given
the flood of credit card applications that daily choke most
mailboxes. Hardly a week goes by at Chez Heaster without at least a
half-dozen or so pitches arriving, most with teaser rates of under
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's strictly a numbers game. Send out X jillion applications,
get Y percent acceptances, figure Z respondents will be deadbeats,
and set charges on outstanding balances high enough to recoup the
anticipated breakage. A prominent Kansas City banker likes to call
it ``lending to the telephone book,'' and, as far as can be
determined, his bank has never had much luck with this approach to
marketing credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting, however, that deadbeat credit card users are
just as culpable in this game as the cynical mass merchandisers of
credit cards. While issuers rig the game to ensure that responsible
borrowers often pay outrageous carrying costs to subsidize
deadbeats, equally cynical card users live far beyond their means
with no intention of ever fully paying their debts.
</P>
<P>
   What's really crazy about this arrangement is that the more
lenders complain about the need for tighter bankruptcy strictures,
the more intensely they pursue customers, heedless of credit risks.
This has been the trend since a broad liberalization of bankruptcy
law in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, if lawmakers sincerely want to balance everyone's
interests, including those of responsible credit card users, they
need to go beyond traditional remedies.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed is a law mitigating against the moral hazard
problem as it relates to irresponsible lenders and debtors alike.
This means structuring the relationship to create a canceling-out
effect for reckless behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Don Deadbeat files for bankruptcy as a result of
overwhelming credit card abuse. The legal factor determining how
much relief the lender should be allowed would depend on the
prudence used by the lender during the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   Did the lender use due diligence checking the applicant's
character and capacity to pay? If not, the lender shouldn't be
allowed any relief. If the lender did use adequate due diligence,
was the borrower honest and truthful on the card application? If
not, any relief accorded the bankrupt in any judgment should be
minimal. Moreover, criminal charges should be an option for
particularly egregious cases of dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   The current approach won't solve the problem, because it's a
blame game involving two equally irresponsible parties. Thus, the
real losers are those who get stuck with interest rates higher than
otherwise would be the case in the absence of such
irresponsibility.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was as British Prime Minister Tony Blair posed for the
``family photo'' with European leaders at Thursday's summit in
Cologne, that the news came through from Belgrade that the Serbs
had finally caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two days earlier in Berlin, the last time the fifteen
men had gathered together, the news was equally dramatic: it was
March 24 and the skies over Serbia were darkening with the shadows
of NATO's bombing squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday as he broke away from the group gathered on the steps
outside Cologne's Gurzenich building, the prime minister was
intercepted by his ever-present spokesman, Alastair Campbell, to
hear the news. Blair remained impassive.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Cologne wanted to speak too soon or display
triumphalism but inside the summit the confident mood quickly took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   As Gunther Verheugen, Germany's Europe minister, swept through
the large, modern Maritim Hotel, close to Cologne's historic
cathedral, there was no hiding German relief at the events
unfolding in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He was, the minister told the world's media, proud of the way
that the German government had balanced diplomacy with the military
campaign. ``We have reached a moment where it is fair to say we are
at a turning point,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track had finally won the day, albeit with the
help of NATO's overwhelming military superiority. But if diplomacy
has indeed won out it has been a tortuous road.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-track strategy of bombing and talking kept the Russians
engaged and maintained a vital channel of communication to Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombing dragged on, maintaining unity within the nineteen
NATO allies was also a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most difficult trade-offs were not with Belgrade _
but between the U.S. and its NATO allies over bombing targets and
ground troops, or between Washington and Moscow over the peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track began in the ruins of the Rambouillet peace
agreement, the deal which was supposed to be the basis for a
lasting settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers and negotiators labored at an elegant chateau in the
French countryside to put together a text, but the process had an
air of failure about it from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, the talks collapsed. The result was NATO's decision
to head for war, the first in its 50-year history.
</P>
<P>
   NATO believed that Milosevic would fold as its aircraft
delivered pinprick strikes to show that its threats were in deadly
earnest: this backfired badly.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, it was clear that something else would have to
substitute for Rambouillet, but it took much longer for any
effective process to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's only response to Serb outrages against Kosovar civilians
was to drop more bombs in an increasingly desperate effort to break
Belgrade's resolve. But the bombs also hit hospitals and civilian
convoys, causing international outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure grew on the coalition government in Bonn _ against the
backdrop of huge anti-war demonstrations _ and the need for an end
to the bombing grew ever more pressing. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Western politician has had a more uncomfortable war than
Joschka Fischer, the Green and one-time peacenik who is now
Germany's foreign minister and a central player in the SDP/Green
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to broker an end to the bombing, Fischer's
department of foreign affairs embarked on a concerted push for
peace. Germany was ideally placed to make it.
</P>
<P>
   A member of NATO, Germany holds the presidency both of the EU
and of the other group which has emerged as a forum for diplomacy,
the G8 group of seven wealthy nations plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   From these facts emerged a strategy: Germany would try to align
the positions of all the big players with a path acceptable to
NATO, thereby isolating President Milosevic and robbing him of his
only ally, Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   To this end Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General, was
invited to a special meeting of Europe's heads of government in
Brussels in April.
</P>
<P>
   By now German officials had drafted ideas for a possible route
to peace, including a pause in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction illustrated the difficulties ahead. With early
warning from Blair's entourage that the idea was doomed, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder avoided mention of the specific
proposals but won backing for a broader diplomatic strategy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that emerged relied on a few key foundations.
First, the West would not get into a direct negotiating session
with Belgrade, so any talks had to go through other channels.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had to be kept involved: not just so that a U.N. veto
could be avoided but so that Milosevic realized that he was
diplomatically isolated.
</P>
<P>
   And the United Nations was to be kept at a distance as long as
possible, until it became essential to involve it in drafting a
final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was a constant shuttle between Washington, Bonn
and Moscow for the U.S. Deputy-Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott,
an old Russia hand who had been a journalist for Time magazine for
most of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott had the trust of the president _ Clinton used to make
him eggs on toast and cups of tea when the two shared a house in
Oxford. And he knew Moscow intimately.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian negotiator,
Talbott tried to win over Russia to America's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Although never totally in bed with the Serbs, the mood among the
Russian leadership had been ominous as the air campaign got
underway.
</P>
<P>
   Adamant that Russia had to be taken seriously, President Boris
Yeltsin had warned that NATO was in danger of drawing Russia into a
Third World War. But three weeks into the bombing, in a key turning
point, he decided to appoint a special envoy to negotiate peace in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of the pragmatic Viktor Chernomyrdin marked a
distinct softening in Moscow's position.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister and gas baron had strong ties to the
West, and was less strident in his opposition to NATO than the man
whom he supplanted from the task of acting as Russia's
intermediary, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Only three weeks earlier, on the eve of the war, Primakov had
demonstrated Russia's anger with NATO. In a theatrical gesture
worthy of the Cold War he turned around his aircraft in midair when
en route to Washington for talks over international loans.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, he went to Belgrade for a trip that only served
to underline Russia's pro-Serb sympathies, rousing fears that these
could prompt Moscow to give concrete support to Belgrade, including
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was accompanied on the trip by Russia's hawkish defense
minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, and military and foreign
intelligence chiefs. The West winced as pictures beamed around the
world showing the Russian premier laughing and joking with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Primakov, the new envoy's relationship with Slobodan
Milosevic was cool.
</P>
<P>
   At home his mediator's role was angering Communist and
nationalist opponents in parliament and _ more importantly _ the
Russian military establishment, which remained vigorously opposed
to making concessions to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There were rumblings, too, from within the foreign affairs
establishment; the foreign minister, Igor Ivanov _ another key
player _ was generally perceived to be less conciliatory than
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Matters were further complicated by domestic political upheaval,
triggered by Yeltsin's impulsive decision to throw out Primakov and
appoint a new premier, Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   A failed attempt by the State Duma to impeach the president was
a blow for the anti-Yeltsin Serbs but also deepened the sense of
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the May 6 meeting of G8 foreign ministers in Bonn did
Russia signed up to the principles of a deal. Wide gaps remained on
the timing and nature of a Serbian pullout, but it was the basis
for a deal. &QL;

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _  &LR; by2:The Kansas City Star  &LR; tx:Cardiovascular
Consultants, a doctors group, will operate St. Luke's Hospital's
Mid-America Heart Institute under a management contract that is
expected to be signed around July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physician collaboration is both a basic and historic tenet of
the St. Luke's-Shawnee Mission Health System,'' said G. Richard
Hastings, president and chief executive officer of the system. ``We
believe it is the most effective way of providing quality health
care at an affordable cost.''
</P>
<P>
   No assets will change hands, and the heart institute will
continue to be owned by St. Luke's. David Steinhaus, a cardiologist
and president of Cardiovascular Consultants, said the group would
receive a management fee to operate the institute. Steinhaus will
become the institute's medical director for cardiovascular
services.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes amid rising demand for specialty medical
care. In response to that demand and other market factors,
hospitals around the country have been forging management
agreements with specialty physician groups.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, at St. Luke's midtown campus, opened in 1982. A
record 112 open-heart surgeries were performed there in April, and
the institute expects to perform its 200th heart transplant soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiovascular Consultants is a group of 22 cardiologists who
primarily practice at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhaus said the agreement, which has been under discussion
for about 18 months, would not impede those cardiologists at the
institute who are not part of Cardiovascular Consultants. Patients
who see those doctors should expect to continue seeing them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, our hope is that their practice will be enhanced,''
Steinhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhaus said about 10 key staff members of the institute would
become employees of the doctors group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to concentrate on quality of care, cost
efficiencies and program development,'' he said. ``We hope to make
it more consumer-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinhaus said he hoped cost efficiencies realized from the new
arrangement would lead to more agreements with managed-care
companies.

<P>
   It was as British Prime Minister Tony Blair posed for the
``family photo'' with European leaders at Thursday's summit in
Cologne, that the news came through from Belgrade that the Serbs
had finally caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two days earlier in Berlin, the last time the fifteen
men had gathered together, the news was equally dramatic: it was
March 24 and the skies over Serbia were darkening with the shadows
of NATO's bombing squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday as he broke away from the group gathered on the steps
outside Cologne's Gurzenich building, the prime minister was
intercepted by his ever-present spokesman, Alastair Campbell, to
hear the news. Blair remained impassive.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Cologne wanted to speak too soon or display
triumphalism but inside the summit the confident mood quickly took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   As Gunther Verheugen, Germany's Europe minister, swept through
the large, modern Maritim Hotel, close to Cologne's historic
cathedral, there was no hiding German relief at the events
unfolding in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He was, the minister told the world's media, proud of the way
that the German government had balanced diplomacy with the military
campaign. ``We have reached a moment where it is fair to say we are
at a turning point,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track had finally won the day, albeit with the
help of NATO's overwhelming military superiority. But if diplomacy
has indeed won out it has been a tortuous road.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-track strategy of bombing and talking kept the Russians
engaged and maintained a vital channel of communication to Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombing dragged on, maintaining unity within the nineteen
NATO allies was also a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most difficult trade-offs were not with Belgrade _
but between the U.S. and its NATO allies over bombing targets and
ground troops, or between Washington and Moscow over the peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track began in the ruins of the Rambouillet peace
agreement, the deal which was supposed to be the basis for a
lasting settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers and negotiators labored at an elegant chateau in the
French countryside to put together a text, but the process had an
air of failure about it from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, the talks collapsed. The result was NATO's decision
to head for war, the first in its 50-year history.
</P>
<P>
   NATO believed that Milosevic would fold as its aircraft
delivered pinprick strikes to show that its threats were in deadly
earnest: this backfired badly.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, it was clear that something else would have to
substitute for Rambouillet, but it took much longer for any
effective process to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's only response to Serb outrages against Kosovar civilians
was to drop more bombs in an increasingly desperate effort to break
Belgrade's resolve. But the bombs also hit hospitals and civilian
convoys, causing international outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure grew on the coalition government in Bonn _ against the
backdrop of huge anti-war demonstrations _ and the need for an end
to the bombing grew ever more pressing. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Western politician has had a more uncomfortable war than
Joschka Fischer, the Green and one-time peacenik who is now
Germany's foreign minister and a central player in the SDP/Green
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to broker an end to the bombing, Fischer's
department of foreign affairs embarked on a concerted push for
peace. Germany was ideally placed to make it.
</P>
<P>
   A member of NATO, Germany holds the presidency both of the EU
and of the other group which has emerged as a forum for diplomacy,
the G8 group of seven wealthy nations plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   From these facts emerged a strategy: Germany would try to align
the positions of all the big players with a path acceptable to
NATO, thereby isolating President Milosevic and robbing him of his
only ally, Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   To this end Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General, was
invited to a special meeting of Europe's heads of government in
Brussels in April.
</P>
<P>
   By now German officials had drafted ideas for a possible route
to peace, including a pause in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction illustrated the difficulties ahead. With early
warning from Blair's entourage that the idea was doomed, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder avoided mention of the specific
proposals but won backing for a broader diplomatic strategy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that emerged relied on a few key foundations.
First, the West would not get into a direct negotiating session
with Belgrade, so any talks had to go through other channels.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had to be kept involved: not just so that a U.N. veto
could be avoided but so that Milosevic realized that he was
diplomatically isolated.
</P>
<P>
   And the United Nations was to be kept at a distance as long as
possible, until it became essential to involve it in drafting a
final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was a constant shuttle between Washington, Bonn
and Moscow for the U.S. Deputy-Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott,
an old Russia hand who had been a journalist for Time magazine for
most of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott had the trust of the president _ Clinton used to make
him eggs on toast and cups of tea when the two shared a house in
Oxford. And he knew Moscow intimately.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian negotiator,
Talbott tried to win over Russia to America's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Although never totally in bed with the Serbs, the mood among the
Russian leadership had been ominous as the air campaign got
underway.
</P>
<P>
   Adamant that Russia had to be taken seriously, President Boris
Yeltsin had warned that NATO was in danger of drawing Russia into a
Third World War. But three weeks into the bombing, in a key turning
point, he decided to appoint a special envoy to negotiate peace in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of the pragmatic Viktor Chernomyrdin marked a
distinct softening in Moscow's position.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister and gas baron had strong ties to the
West, and was less strident in his opposition to NATO than the man
whom he supplanted from the task of acting as Russia's
intermediary, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Only three weeks earlier, on the eve of the war, Primakov had
demonstrated Russia's anger with NATO. In a theatrical gesture
worthy of the Cold War he turned around his aircraft in midair when
en route to Washington for talks over international loans.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, he went to Belgrade for a trip that only served
to underline Russia's pro-Serb sympathies, rousing fears that these
could prompt Moscow to give concrete support to Belgrade, including
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was accompanied on the trip by Russia's hawkish defense
minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, and military and foreign
intelligence chiefs. The West winced as pictures beamed around the
world showing the Russian premier laughing and joking with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Primakov, the new envoy's relationship with Slobodan
Milosevic was cool.
</P>
<P>
   At home his mediator's role was angering Communist and
nationalist opponents in parliament and _ more importantly _ the
Russian military establishment, which remained vigorously opposed
to making concessions to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   There were rumblings, too, from within the foreign affairs
establishment; the foreign minister, Igor Ivanov _ another key
player _ was generally perceived to be less conciliatory than
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Matters were further complicated by domestic political upheaval,
triggered by Yeltsin's impulsive decision to throw out Primakov and
appoint a new premier, Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   A failed attempt by the State Duma to impeach the president was
a blow for the anti-Yeltsin Serbs but also deepened the sense of
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the May 6 meeting of G8 foreign ministers in Bonn did
Russia signed up to the principles of a deal. Wide gaps remained on
the timing and nature of a Serbian pullout, but it was the basis
for a deal. &QL;

WORKERS, MINISTERS QUESTION KC MAYOR ABOUT REPORT ON WATER
DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GROMER JEFFERS JR.  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Angry city workers and area ministers
confronted Mayor Kay Barnes on Thursday, demanding that she explain
her relationship and that of her top campaign consultant with a
company that wanted to buy or manage the Water Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded at City Hall by about 100 workers and other
protesters, state Rep. Terry Riley of Kansas City also asked for a
federal investigation and for Barnes to step down as mayor, a
request that Barnes later called ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Barnes campaigned on honesty and integrity,'' Riley
said. ``But after only a few weeks in office she has shown us that
she is not trustworthy. She is not for the poor people of this
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters _ some holding signs that read ``KC's Watergate'' and
``City Hall for Sale'' _ included several black ministers and
activists who supported Barnes during her mayoral campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said she had done ``absolutely nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent deeply any implication by the press or by anyone else
that I have done something wrong,'' Barnes said in an interview
after Thursday's council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said she has never supported selling or privatizing the
Water Services Department. She said she has only supported an
exploration of options for a public//private partnership, which
might extend to the department's management or marketing or other
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water department may be fine just the way it is,'' Barnes
said. ``I have not had any discussions publicly or privately about
selling the water department. If it came up at this point, I would
be opposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   /{The Kansas City Star/} reported last week that political
consultant Pat Gray, while working on Barnes' mayoral campaign, was
working for a St. Louis company to develop a plan to buy or manage
the Water Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   A document outlining a plan for taking over the operations of
the Water Services Department was obtained by /{The Star/}. It
included a strategy to elect a mayor and council that favored
privatization of city services and a plan to discredit the
department's reputation so the public would support a private
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The document obtained by /{The Star/} anonymously through the
mail called for the Water Services Department to be sold or leased
by Nov. 1, 1999, to EA2//Systems, a consortium of three companies
that includes Environmental Management Inc. of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has said the document could have been stolen from his
office or altered, and he declined comment on it. He could not be
reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes acknowledged Thursday that she had a 45-minute meeting
with Gray and officials from EA2//Systems. She said she did not
remember whether Gray set up the meeting, held before she assumed
office on April 10, but maintained that she never discussed the
sale of Water Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no expectation on my part at all,'' Barnes said.
``If such a plan would have come before me, I would have rebuffed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitley, spokesman for U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr.,
said Thursday that his office would examine any information it
received.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always receptive to a citizen or a group of citizens
who want to bring information to our attention,'' Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers calling for an investigation _ all of whom lead
churches in the black community _ said they were worried that the
Barnes administration was focusing on a mostly black city
department for takeover. The Water Services Department has about
1,000 employees, about 600 of whom are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to simply
internalize this?'' said the Rev. Wallace Hartsfield. ``We are the
ones who supported you for mayor, and these revelations affect our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said it would have been more appropriate for leaders of
the protest to bring concerns directly to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one approached me,'' she said. ``That's not the way I
would've handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Williams, a 14-year veteran of Water Services and former
union steward, said he was angered mostly by revelations of a
campaign to discredit the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a plot against city workers,'' Williams said. ``The
workers are doing the best job they can. Something is wrong with
this picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Kelvin Simmons said he supported the call for an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has raised some serious issues,'' Simmons said.
``We need to continue to look at this issue. We also need to make
sure that there are no targets and that no departments are singled
out for privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Barnes and the council have directed City
Manager Bob Collins to study the feasibility of privatizing city
facilities, including Kansas City International Airport and Kemper
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Collins also has been asked to analyze the operations of the
Water Services Department and the Public Works Department in an
effort to cut costs and improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes said Thursday that those two departments were
selected by Collins for study and not by her.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he chose those two departments because they are
among the largest in the city, they affect every citizen in the
city and ``because they both do their jobs very well.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also wanted a contrast between an enterprise fund and
a department funded by the general fund. The water department is an
enterprise fund, meaning it functions like a business: It makes
money and can only spend that money within its own department.

FUEL SUMMIT ENDS WITHOUT CLEAR DIRECTION FOR CLEANER AIR IN KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ No consensus has emerged from this week's
``fuel summit'' on what to do about Kansas City's air pollution
problem.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of debate and testimony, a panel of experts on
fuel and pollution _ from state and federal agencies, private
industry and think tanks _ could not agree on any single
recommendation for Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan and Kansas Gov. Bill
Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Smith, who facilitated the summit at the Jack Reardon Civic
Center in downtown Kansas City, Kan., said nobody really expected a
single plan to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the primary goal of the summit was to exchange ideas
and concerns, and make it possible for Kansas and Missouri
officials to report back to their governors on the full range of
options on how to lower air pollution in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors are going to have some hard calls to make,'' he
said. ``Everyone here agrees that the goal, first and foremost, is
clean air. But how to get there, at least in the short term,
there's no single answer, no clear-cut, silver-bullet solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit was a response to a federal ruling that Kansas City's
transportation plan had failed to conform to its clean-air plan. As
a result, if the governors don't act within about a month to bring
the transportation plan into compliance, millions of dollars in
highway expansions _ such as the new Chouteau Bridge _ may be
placed on hold, perhaps for years.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Randolph, chief air pollution regulator for the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources, said it appeared to him that
reformulated gasoline _ a fuel designed to decrease the production
of harmful ozone _ was the most popular solution to Kansas City's
air quality problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this summit kind of lost sight of cleaning up the air
and protecting the public health,'' he said. ``And the basic issue
here is that Kansas City air is too dirty to protect the public
health. We need to take definitive action that will drive the point
home and put this issue to rest. And the community's best answer
looks to be reformulated gas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fuel also had detractors, including those who cited a
federal lawsuit by the oil industry that claims it is illegal for
Kansas City to receive such fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matson, Kansas Gov. Graves' spokesman, said his office was
eager to hear full reports on what came out of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Gov. Graves won't rush into a decision,'' he said. ``The
whole idea of the summit was to sift through the available options,
and he'll take a good look at what came out of there. But I'm sure
he'll also be looking into other options as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's spokesman said his office was waiting to review a
summary of the summit.

UNION VOTE LOOMS ON TWA CONTRACT OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Most area union employees of Trans World
Airlines will vote Tuesday on whether to accept the company's
contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A morning meeting and an evening meeting will be held Tuesday at
Bartle Hall to accommodate 2,300 employees who work three shifts at
TWA's overhaul base at Kansas City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Also at that time, the workers will vote on whether to authorize
a strike, should it become necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local 1650, said the
company's 73-page proposal to the mechanics group was being copied
this week. The union hopes to distribute it to all its members by
today.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the union, Machinists District 142, have
strongly recommended that its 16,000 TWA members reject the
contract and force the company to return to the bargaining table
with a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   TWA repeatedly has said this is a ``best and final'' offer.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also sent information about the company's contract
proposals to the three worker groups represented by the Machinists:
mechanics, flight attendants and passenger-service workers.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has about 40 area union workers in the passenger-service
group. The union also plans to distribute the contract proposal for
them, with a vote at Machinists Local 1650's union hall in
Riverside. A date for that meeting has not been scheduled, Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants will vote by mail because of their work
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials have said the voting process will not be
completed until late June or early July.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings to vote on the new contract in St. Louis, TWA's
headquarters, will take place Wednesday. Employees voting there
include mechanics, ramp workers, ticket agents and reservations
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said all three employee groups must ratify their
contracts to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the terms of the proposals for the work groups:
</P>
<P>
   {Mechanics:} Raises of 6 percent this year, 4 percent next year
and 7 percent in 2001. Bonuses of $2,200 this year, $1,700 next
year and $700 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   {Ramp workers:} Raises of 3 percent this year, 2 percent next
year and 4.3 percent in 2001. Bonuses of $1,700 this year, $700
next year and $1,700 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   {Passenger-service employees:} Raises of 5 percent this year,
2.75 percent next year and 5.75 percent in 2001. Bonuses of $700
this year, next year and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding benefits, all employees except the flight attendants
would get an increased pension contribution of 50 cents an hour.
All workers would receive $10,000 more in life insurance and a new
dental plan.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said all employees will reach 90 percent of the
industry standard by July 2001 under this proposal. The union has
remained adamant in its position that after more than a decade of
concessionary contracts, TWA employees must be paid the industry
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City meetings to vote on the contract and to
authorize a strike will be held at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. Tuesday at
Room 1203 of Bartle Hall. Nelson said representatives from
Machinists District 142 would be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Updated union cards will be needed to attend the meeting and
vote, Nelson said.

BELMONT IS ALL ABUZZ FOR MAIN EVENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Belmont Park is ready _ from the eight busloads
of extra security people and mutuel clerks shipping in from
Saratoga, to the steeplechase horses jumping and the fillies
running, to the strolling bands and the street festival, to the $2
million in purses, to the parking valets decked out in tuxedos to
greet the customers as they arrive Saturday to see, for the third
consecutive year, if a horse can sweep the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The main event is the 131st running of the Belmont Stakes, and
it will draw New York's biggest sports crowd of the day and the
year, probably between 80,000 and 85,000, to watch 11 colts and 1
filly race in the $1 million Belmont Stakes with a bonus of $5
million if Charismatic completes his sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know it's a chance to see history in the making,'' said
Terry Meyocks, president of the New York Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if they'll set a record for attendance or
betting or not. We do know it has captured people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the history of thoroughbred racing, only 11 horses have swept
the Triple Crown by winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and
the Belmont Stakes within five weeks in the springtime of their
3-year-old seasons. Fourteen who attempted to complete a sweep have
failed, including the last six who tried, and most dramatically the
last two.
</P>
<P>
   So, Charismatic will try where Silver Charm failed by
three-quarters of a length in 1997 and where Real Quiet missed by a
nose in 1998. He will be the centerpiece of months of planning,
marketing and strategy aimed at endowing the Belmont with something
like the impact of the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have momentum in our corner,'' said Bill Nader, the
director of promotions for Belmont Park. ``People left here the
last two years and realized that Belmont Park is more beautiful
than they knew, and the Belmont Stakes more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we turn it into something like the Derby, which draws
100,000 people for the Kentucky Oaks the day before and 150,000 on
Derby Day? One step at a time. We're starting with the day before
the Belmont, the Friday, when we're running the Acorn Stakes to
open the Triple Tiara series for fillies. And we'll go from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has so many more options than, say, Louisville. But
if we can get people to Belmont Park, and they leave with the idea
that it's a lovely way to spend an afternoon, with steeplechase
racing on Thursday and the Acorn on Friday and the Triple Crown on
Saturday, we'll have something going.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest crowd to see a Belmont Stakes was 82,694 in 1971,
when Canonero II shot for the Triple Crown (and missed), and
hundreds of fans climbed the fences to watch him. Since then, the
race has drawn about half as many, something like the 40,787 who
watched Editor's Note win in 1996. But the next year, with the
Triple Crown on the line for Silver Charm, the crowd took a quantum
leap upward to 70,682. Last year, 80,162 watched Real Quiet lose in
the final stride to Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors might influence Saturday's crowd: the weather, which
is supposed to be mostly sunny with temperatures in the 80s, and
the other options that New York offers. By chance, there are two
huge options this year: the Mets at the Yankees in the afternoon,
and the Indiana Pacers at the Knicks in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spirit of things,'' Meyocks said, ``we'll stay open
after the races for the Knicks-Pacers game so that our fans can
watch it on TV. That will also help dissipate the traffic leaving
the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been planning for Belmont Day for months. We went to the
high schools and colleges five months ago to recruit workers, and
we'll have eight or nine busloads of security people and mutuel
clerks coming from Saratoga. We'll use a total of 800 mutuel clerks
to man the windows, and that's more than 100 over the maximum we've
ever had. But after the last two years, people got a taste of the
Triple Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Belmont Park got a running start on Belmont Day when it ran the
$100,000 Meadow Brook steeplechase race Thursday, and it gathers
momentum Saturday with the $200,000 Acorn. In the evening, a
festival will be held in in Garden City to provide what Nader calls
``a Saratoga feel'' on the Hempstead Plains where the first
organized racing on Long Island was held in 1665.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, gates open at 8:30 in the morning, 11 races starting
at 12:30, the main event at 5:27 surrounded by four stakes with
Broadway casts supplying songs between races. The rest is up to
Charismatic. &QL;

AN INTERNATIONAL BANKING PANEL PROPOSES WAYS TO LIMIT RISK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The top global banking regulator introduced proposals
Thursday that would strengthen protections against bad loans and
subject the risk-assessment operations of big international banks
to greater supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, announced in London by a panel of the Bank of
International Settlements of Basel, Switzerland, were not a direct
result of the financial crises in Asia and Russia or of the
near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, banking officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposals by the regulator, wich draws its membership
from central banks, represented an acknowledgment that since the
rules were last agreed to in Basel in 1988, international banking
operations had become far more complex and, as the events of
1997-98 showed, prone to instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last decade,'' said Howard Davies, chairman of
Britain's Financial Services Authority, a supervisory body,
``banks' operations have become increasingly sophisticated and,
particularly in the last few years, we have witnessed considerable
turbulence. The new accord should result in a more efficient use of
capital, better risk management by banks and improved disclosure,
leading to a safer, more efficient financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York and chairman of the panel, told a news conference here
that the new proposals rested on three pillars _ an overhaul of the
rules requiring banks to set aside capital against default, closer
supervisory scrutiny of the way banks assess risks and greater
transparency in banking operations. Such improvements, he said,
would encourage ``safe and sound banking practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules foresee the use of credit-rating agencies to
assess the creditworthiness of governments and corporations seeking
loans. That would mean that borrowing costs for large corporations
rated triple-A by Moody's or Standard &AMP; Poor's could fall, while
the cost of borrowing would increase for corporations with less
solid ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Banks would offset the cost of the capital they set aside by the
interest rates charged on loans. Thus, a high-risk loan would mean
a higher capital commitment and consequently higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said that banks and other financial institutions had
until March 31 of next year to respond to the new proposals, and
banking officials said they were unlikely to take effect before
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1988 agreements, banks must set aside 8 percent of
assets _ or part of that depending on the risks associated with a
particular loan _ to cover the possibility of default. But bankers
have complained that the system makes little distinction between,
say, overnight loans to a blue-chip corporation and medium-term
loans to some governments.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposals would allow banks to use their own methods to
calibrate risk, but only in conjunction with supervisory
authorities. ``The new proposals put much greater emphasis on the
bank supervisory process and consequently a much heavier burden on
the capabilities of bank supervisors,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals could intensify a long-running disagreement
between banking supervisors and bankers, and some bankers
immediately criticized the proposals. ``We are trying to figure out
whether this is a Trojan horse because it outlines a program of
broader and more intrusive oversight and more stringent
supervision,'' an American banker in New York said.
</P>
<P>
   Against that, a governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Laurence
H. Meyer, said Thursday that large banks that engaged in complex
activities needed far more careful supervision and different
capital requirements than the rest of the industry. And Claes
Norgren, a member of the special panel, said the proposals are
intended to make the regulatory requirements proportional to the
risk.

EDITORIAL: MERCHANTS OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton announced an investigation this week into
whether the entertainment industry was irresponsibly marketing
violence to teen-agers and young children, he read aloud a few
promotional slogans to show why such a study might be in order.
``Kill your friends guilt free,'' an advertisement for one video
game promised. Another ad enticed players to ``get in touch with
your gun-toting, cold-blooded murdering side.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, borrowing an idea from Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., has
asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to
examine advertising practices by makers of violent movies, music
and video games, to determine whether the industry is violating its
own codes by marketing violence to children. Since the recent high
school shootings have involved teen-agers who were attracted to
such gruesome entertainment, this is a timely and worthy inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Some entertainment executives have protested that Clinton was
merely seeking a headline. That possibility can never be
discounted, but in this case the president has aimed his criticism
at an industry that has been very generous to him and the
Democrats. One executive told John Broder of The Times that
entertainment moguls were ``furious'' at such a direct assault,
especially since Clinton did not also announce an investigation of
advertising by the gun industry, which is known for its generosity
to Republicans. While the fury of the entertainment industry
actually reinforces the president's effort, it has a point. He
should also examine whether the gun industry is directing its
marketing at children.
</P>
<P>
   The first and best line of defense against such advertising,
whatever its source, is the parent. But parents often need help
sorting out the healthy from the sick in the bewildering virtual
world. Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association, says that video game manufacturers are now
rethinking their rating system, which goes almost unnoticed by
consumers and parents. He said game makers were also considering
limiting ads for their most bloodthirsty products. Since the
Constitution protects advertising as freedom of speech, the way to
deal with violent background noise is to persuade the noisemakers
themselves to dampen it.

SIR CHRISTOPHER COCKERELL, CREATOR OF THE HOVERCRAFT, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Christopher Cockerell, the creator of the hovercraft, who
often came to feel that invention was the mother of frustration,
died on Tuesday at his home in Hythe, Hampshire, England. He was
88.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Francis Airy, said he had been ill for several
months after a fall, but had been mentally alert until the end. As
quoted in The London Telegraph, Mrs. Airy said, ``He was interested
in the state of the world and was very worried about energy
resources on the planet and the population explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cockerell had hundreds of patents to his name, including more
than 50 associated with the hovercraft, which rides on a cushion of
air. Since the launching of his first hovercraft, exactly 40 years
before the day of his death, the technology that he made possible
emerged from what seemed to be science fiction to become a common
means of speedily ferrying passengers across bays and rivers around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although he received great recognition and knighthood, he
consistently vented his frustration at the lack of rewards he
gained. He also criticized British policies that he contended
chronically thwarted technological development and discouraged
inventions and inventors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed life,'' Cockerell said in an interview in 1996.
``But it would have been nice to treat my wife to dinner once in a
while.'' Actually, his patents for the hovercraft and other
inventions did provide what he conceded was a reasonable living,
but they did not make him rich.
</P>
<P>
   Cockerell's penchant for tinkering was developed in the face of
early rejections. His father, Sir Sydney Cockerell, curator of the
Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge University, was a strong figure who
valued arts and letters above applied science. A collector of
medieval manuscripts, Sydney Cockerell had been an assistant to the
Bloomsbury polymath William Morris, was literary executor for
Thomas Hardy and corresponded with Tolstoy.
</P>
<P>
   He was not impressed when his only son produced crystal radio
sets and motorized his mother's sewing machine. He was chagrined
when Christopher, offered a choice of books as gifts, selected
``The Boy Electrician'' rather than a biography of Rembrandt. Once
the father observed that his son was ``no better than a garage
hand.'' Despite such paternal discouragement, which slowly abated,
Cockerell studied engineering at Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, he began working on research for the Marconi Co.. Among
his inventions was an aerial direction finder called ``the drunken
men,'' which in World War II brought many allied airmen safely back
home.
</P>
<P>
   His team at Marconi also produced the equipment that was used to
identify all the German radar stations along the northern European
coast, which were bombed in time for D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sir Christopher recalled that he had developed 36
patents at Marconi. ``All I got was (PS)10 for each (less than
$50),'' he said. ``And mind you, some firms gave as little as (PS)3
for the same.''
</P>
<P>
   He left in the early '50s and moved to Norfolk to manage a
marina on the Oulton Broad. A passionate sailor, he lived in a
trailer and designed cabin cruisers. It was there that he conceived
the idea that even a heavy craft could be supported on a cushion of
air generated by relatively small thrust. Cutting the friction
between boat and water, or boat and marshland, would allow such a
vessel to move swiftly. He ran a vacuum cleaner tube through an
empty can of cat food that he had placed in a larger empty coffee
can and when he turned the switch to reverse to blow air into the
larger can, the smaller one hovered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, he built a two-foot prototype that scooted at the end
of a leash over water and land, and he obtained a patent for a
vehicle that he described as ``neither an airplane, nor a boat, nor
a wheeled land craft.'' He named it a hovercraft.
</P>
<P>
   There was little smooth sailing, however, as Cockerell sought to
turn his idea into a commercial project. At one point he
demonstrated his hovering prototype for British military officials
who responded by classifying his invention as secret, effectively
freezing development.
</P>
<P>
   Cockerell pawned family jewelry to keep his research going, and
in 1957, after he had advised government officials that the Swiss
were working on hovering technologies, he was able to approach the
National Research Development Corp., a government-financed agency
that was supposed to promote inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the agency formed Hovercraft Development Ltd.
to develop the concept for commercial use and solicit investment.
Cockerell became a director and technical adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Hovercraft Development licensed five companies to build
hovercrafts. On June 1, 1959, a small one-person vehicle zipped
across the English Channel in 20 minutes, four hours faster than
conventional crossings. In the next three years, larger hovercraft
built by contractors began to carry passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-60s, as hovercraft began commercial service across
the Channel, Cockerell found himself in disagreement with
management decisions by the Research Development Corp. First he
objected to a decision to license foreign companies, principally in
the United States and Japan, allowing them to produce hovercraft in
exchange for royalties.
</P>
<P>
   That, he felt, only squandered Britain's advantage. He also
opposed a directive in 1966 that fused all British hovercraft
development in one amalgamated company. Saying that move hampered
competition and would ``stultify the hovercraft industry in
Britain,'' Cockerell resigned from Hovercraft Development in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the pitfalls of an inventor's life in Britain
then, he wrote: ``Everything is stacked against you, but for some
reason some silly chaps seem to be driven to it (rather like a
painter of a composer of music), which is perhaps just as well or
we should still be living in the Stone Age. Some of the hovercraft
saga was fun, but most of it was incredibly frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he was knighted, and the next year the British
hovercraft industry dismissed him as a consultant. He continued to
lecture on the technology that he developed and conducted research
at his home. His wife, Elinor Belsham, whom he married in 1937,
died in 1996.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO, Brazil _ On the prestigious Avenida Paulista in Sao
Paulo, only a stone's throw from Brazil's Central Bank building,
sits BankBoston's latest branch office. Housed in one of the few
remaining mansions dating from the coffee boom at the turn of the
century, the lush classic structure symbolizes its desired
customers: rich people. ``We are only going to attend the A-class
customer,'' says Odilon Almeida, the bank's vice president in Sao
Paulo.
 &HT;    In a market plagued with sky-high interest rates and slumping
growth, BankBoston is betting that the bank is far better off
managing rich investors' funds than trying to make money on loans
to companies and consumers. Tough to argue with them. Assets under
management have jumped 35 percent last year to $6.1 billion.
Profits last year were up 29 percent at $102 million, making
BankBoston the second-most-profitable bank in Brazil.
 &HT;    The bank's elitist strategy blossomed under the guidance of
Brazilian native Henrique Meirelles, president and chief operating
officer of BankBoston until its recent merger with New England's
Fleet Financial Group formed the eighth-largest U.S. bank with $180
billion in assets. Meirelles, now head of the new bank's
international division, has said publicly that there will be no
change in strategy, explaining why it works: ``Our customers come
from a small slice of the Brazilian economy, the segment where
incomes and assets continue to grow even in difficult times.''
 &HT;    The target market is the 1 percent of the population that had a
minimum monthly income of 4,000 reais, about US$3,500 before the
devaluation. Starting in August 1997, the bank earmarked $100
million to attack this segment. Last year, it doubled the number of
branch offices to 65 and increased the number of employees by a
third to 4,200. With the market identified and the service coming
online, BankBoston got lucky.
 &HT;    When the economic fallout from troubles in Asia and Russia hit
Brazil last year, BankBoston enjoyed a ``flight to quality'' _
consumers taking their money out of institutions viewed as being
unsafe and depositing them with ``quality'' banks. By the end of
the year, the number of account holders at BankBoston in Brazil
actually had doubled to 110,000. Those customers now represent 44
percent of the bank's revenue, an increase from 31 percent in 1997.
Corporate banking revenue now accounts for less than 40 percent of
revenue; the remainder is derived from treasury operations.
 &HT;    While wealthy Brazilians were expressing their confidence in
BankBoston, Wall Street was decidedly bearish about the bank's
burgeoning exposure to Brazil. Financial analysts were concerned
about the bank's $6 billion commitment in Brazil and another $9
billion invested in neighboring Argentina. The bank's share price
tanked, at one point slicing $6 billion off the bank's market
capitalizations and ultimately pushing the bank into a merger with
Fleet.
 &HT;    While applauding BankBoston on shrewd maneuvering in a very
difficult market, Luis Miguel Mas Santacreu, analyst at financial
consultancy Austin Asis, in Sao Paulo, is not convinced by its
elitist strategy nor by its financial firepower. ``Its strategy
looks right for the moment, but in fact, it is limited,'' he says.
``In the medium term, things will get more complicated. BankBoston
does not have the required funds to acquire another bank in Brazil.
It has to grow on its own. When Citibank launches an offensive in
Brazil, Bank Boston is going to lose customers.''
 &HT;    Citibank has been trying to increase its presence in Brazil
through a major acquisition but so far has failed. Nonetheless, it
is expected to compete fiercely in the upcoming sale of Banespa,
the big government-owned bank in Sao Paulo state.
 &HT;    BankBoston's Almeida discounts the threat. He points out that
the bank has stuck to its customer profile in Brazil, while HSBC,
ABN Amro, Banco Santander, Citibank and other major competitors
have gone after the middle class. ``We are the only bank in Brazil
that made plain it was not going to go for the mass market,'' says
Almeida.
 &HT;    And despite the roller-coaster Brazilian economy, the bank is
not changing course in the region, according to Almeida. ``We have
not altered our planned investment by a cent,'' he says. The bank
still aims to boost to 200,000 account holders by the end of year.
In fact, the bank is spending millions on its marketing efforts and
developing tailor-made services for specific categories of
professionals such as physicians.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO _ En la prestigiosa Avenida Paulista en Sao Paulo, a
tiro de piedra del Banco Central de Brasil, esta la mas reciente
sucursal de BankBoston. Ubicada en una de las pocas mansiones que
quedan de la epoca del auge cafetero de principios de siglo, la
exquisita estructura clasica es un simbolo de sus clientes
preferidos: los ricos. ``Solo prestaremos servicios a los clientes
mas solventes,'' explica Odilon Almeida, vicepresidente del banco
en Sao Paulo.
 &HT;    En un mercado plagado de altas tasas de interes y poco
crecimiento, BankBoston apuesta a que le ira mucho mejor
administrando el dinero de inversionistas ricos que haciendo
prestamos. Y resulta dificil alegar lo contrario. Sus activos
administrados aumentaron un 35 por ciento en 1998, a US$6.100
millones, con ganancias de US$102 millones, el 29 por ciento, lo
que lo hace el segundo banco mas rentable de Brasil.
 &HT;    La estrategia elitista del banco florecio bajo la batuta del
brasileno Henrique Meirelles, presidente de BankBoston hasta su
reciente fusion con Fleet Financial Group, de Estados Unidos, que
formo el octavo banco del pais con US$180.000 millones en activos.
Meirelles, ahora al frente de la division internacional del nuevo
banco, ha dicho en publico que no cambiara esa estrategia, y
explica como funciona: ``Nuestros clientes provienen de un segmento
muy pequeno de la economia brasilena, donde los ingresos y los
activos siguen creciendo a pesar de los malos tiempos.''
 &HT;    El mercado que busca explotar BankBoston es el 1 por ciento de
la poblacion con un ingreso mensual minimo de 4.000 reales (unos
US$3.500 antes de la devaluacion). A partir de agosto de 1997, el
banco dedico US$100 millones a tratar de ganarse ese segmento. El
ano pasado aumento las sucursales a 65 y los empleados a 4.200. Con
el mercado identificado y el servicio a punto de arrancar,
BankBoston tuvo un golpe de suerte: mientras la crisis de Asia y
Rusia dejaba sentir sus efectos sobre Brasil en 1998, BankBoston
disfruto de una avalancha de depositos de consumidores que sacaron
sus activos de instituciones que consideraban poco seguras. Para
finales de ano, los cuentahabientes de BankBoston en Brasil se
habian duplicado a 110.000. Esos clientes representan ahora el 44
por ciento de los ingresos del banco, un aumento del 31 por ciento
en comparacion con 1997. Los ingresos por concepto de servicios
bancarios a empresas significan en estos momentos menos del 40 por
ciento de los ingresos de BankBoston; y el resto lo generan las
llamadas operaciones de tesoreria.
 &HT;    Mientras los brasilenos ricos expresaban con hechos su confianza
en BankBoston, Wall Street se mostro decididamente poco animado
ante la enorme exposicion del banco en Brasil. A los analistas
financieros les preocupaba el compromiso de US$6.000 millones del
banco en Brasil, y otros US$9.000 millones invertidos en Argentina.
El precio de las acciones de BankBoston se desplomo, y en
determinado momento redujo US$6.000 millones a la capitalizacion de
mercado de la institucion, lo que en definitiva obligo al banco a
fusionarse con Fleet.
 &HT;    Aunque aplaude las astutas maniobras de BankBoston en un mercado
muy dificil, a Luis Miguel Mas Santacreu, analista de la firma
consultora Austin Asis de Sao Paulo, no le convence la estrategia
elitista ni el poder financiero del banco. ``La estrategia parece
la adecuada por el momento, pero, de hecho, es limitada,'' dice.
``A mediano plazo, las cosas se complicaran mas. BankBoston no
tiene los fondos necesarios para adquirir otro banco en Brasil.
BankBoston tiene que crecer por si mismo. Cuando Citibank lance una
ofensiva en Brasil, BankBoston va a perder clientes.''
 &HT;    Citibank ha tratado de aumentar su presencia en Brasil mediante
una adquisicion importante, pero hasta el momento no lo ha logrado.
Sin embargo, se espera que compita con fuerza en la proxima venta
de Banespa, el gran banco propiedad del estado de Sao Paulo.
 &HT;    Almeida, de BankBoston, le resta importancia a esa amenaza y
senala que el banco ha logrado llegar a los clientes brasilenos que
le interesan, mientras que HSBC, ABN Amro, Banco Santander,
Citibank y otros competidores importantes, han puesto la mira en la
clase media. ``Nosotros somos el unico banco en Brasil que ha
dejado en claro que no tiene el mercado masivo entre sus
objetivos.''
 &HT;    Y a pesar de los altibajos de la economia brasilena, el banco no
piensa cambiar de rumbo en la region, segun Almeida. BankBoston
todavia apunta a tener 200.000 cuentahabientes para finales de este
ano. De hecho, BankBoston ha decidido invertir millones de dolares
en campanas de mercadeo y para crear servicios especiales para
determinadas categorias de profesionales, como los medicos.

EDITORIAL: CITY BUDGET SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the New York City Council have
reluctantly scaled down an array of proposed tax cuts that seemed
certain to be approved earlier this year. Their action was forced
by the loss of revenues when the state Legislature repealed the
commuter tax last month. Now the mayor and council need to reach
agreement on other issues in the $35 billion budget. They should
first restore Giuliani's proposed cuts in libraries, after-school
programs, cultural institutions and legal services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast with Albany, where the budget is two months overdue,
Giuliani and Council Speaker Peter Vallone are engaged in a
constructive give-and-take on fiscal matters. There is no reason
they should not agree on a budget by the statutory deadline
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   In April Giuliani proposed a reasonably sensible financial plan
using most of the $2 billion surplus this year for expenses in the
next two years. He did propose cuts, knowing that the council would
reject them. Vallone is right to press for full funding of programs
that serve important educational needs and keep the quality of life
at a decent level for New Yorkers of modest means.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is also right to challenge two broad mayoral
initiatives, one setting aside money for sports stadiums and the
other providing vouchers for families with children in private and
parochial schools. No matter how they are structured and
administered, vouchers are not a sound approach to meeting the
educational needs of a majority of students. They also pose
constitutional problems. As for setting aside revenues to help pay
for new stadiums for the Yankees, Mets and perhaps a new football
team, it is premature to put money in the budget for projects that
have not yet been presented to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent ease with which the budget for the next fiscal year
is being adopted belies serious problems ahead. The city is
projecting deficits in the next few years, and Giuliani has laid no
groundwork for demanding changes in labor practices to save money.
Times are good now, but it is not too soon to start thinking of
ways to squeeze more savings from budgets down the road. &QL;

EDITORIAL: AN INSULT TO CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 4:
</P>
<P>
   The latest indication of the GOP congressional leadership's
indifference to cleaning up a corrupt campaign financing system is
its attitude toward an upcoming vacancy on the Federal Election
Commission. Instead of scouring the country for a distinguished
individual with a passion for reform, Senate Republicans are said
to be considering an Ohio law professor whose writings make plain
his hostility to the agency he would be joining and the campaign
finance laws it is supposed to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Bradley Smith of Capital University Law School in
Columbus, has called for repeal of the Federal Election Campaign
Act, which he describes as ``profoundly undemocratic and profoundly
at odds with the First Amendment.'' He also questions the
proposition that money corrupts politics. These views have made him
the first choice of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, campaign
finance reform's main nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Three reform-minded groups _ Common Cause, Democracy 21 and the
Brennan Center at New York University Law School _ have urged
President Clinton to reject Smith should Trent Lott, the Senate
majority leader, submit his name for nomination. Such a show of
backbone would be a departure for Clinton, who has repeatedly
passed up opportunities to transform the Election Commission into a
serious enforcement agency.

HUNDLEY'S INJURY NOT SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ X-rays on Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley's sprained
left wrist were negative Thursday, which is astonishing given how
badly things have gone for the Dodgers of late.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley will probably miss the next three to five days, making
it unlikely he'll play in the three-game series that begins tonight
against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Angel Pena figures to be the only healthy catcher for the
Dodgers over the next few days. Pinch-hitting specialist Dave
Hansen and outfielder Trenidad Hubbard are the Dodgers' emergency
catchers, but general manager Kevin Malone said Hundley may be able
to catch in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did an X-ray and further tests just to make sure since
it's the one he broke (twice before),'' Malone said. ``We think, as
tough as Todd is, we're not going to want to use him for a few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The news is welcome to the Dodgers, who averted a potential
catching disaster. If Hundley's injury was long-term, another
catcher would be needed. But likely call-up candidate Paul LoDuca
broke his right hand Wednesday in a game for Triple-A Albuquerque
when it was hit by a foul tip. LoDuca began the season as Hundley's
backup but was demoted after getting two hits in 36 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hurt his left wrist in the third inning of Wednesday's
8-4 loss in Pittsburgh during a collision at home plate with the
Pirates' Ed Sprague. He left the game after batting in the top of
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   If Hundley's health doesn't progress as expected, the Dodgers
may look to place him on the disabled list and recall catcher Rick
Wilkins from Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek X-rays: Hundley's health is no longer an issue, but
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek's hand swelled up after he punched a
wall in frustration after grounding into a double play Tuesday
against Pittsburgh. Malone said Grudzielanek will have X-rays
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting him checked out just to make sure there's
nothing there,'' Malone said. ``It's precautionary measures. We
don't think anything's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek is hitting .284 but has grounded into a team-high
nine double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Players' agent confident: Gus Dominguez, the agent for a pair of
Cuban minor-leaguers in the Dodgers system, said he's confident the
commissioner's office will rule in favor of the players and declare
them free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Diaz, a first baseman at Double-A San Antonio, and
Josue Perez, an outfielder at Single-A Vero Beach, petitioned Major
League Baseball to become free agents. They claim the Dodgers
signed them illegally and alleged Dodgers officials helped both of
them defect from Cuba on different occasions and forced them to
sign contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the decision will be in our favor,'' Dominguez said.
``When (the commissioner's office) interviewed the guys and spoke
to the guys separately, the kids told the truth. Their stories are
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez said he based his belief ``just by the way (the
commissioner's office) spoke to me.'' Dominguez said he's hoping
the players will become free agents immediately after the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers remained tight-lipped about accusations that Ralph
Avila, vice president of the Dodgers' facility in the Dominican
Republic, Campo Las Palmas, and the complex's general manager Pablo
Peguero, helped orchestrate the defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working with the commissioner's office on the
issue,'' Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano said. ``I can't
speculate at this point as to what will happen. We'll work with
them on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball rules prohibit teams from scouting in Cuba, and the
United States has a trade embargo against communist nations. If the
Dodgers are found in violation of the rule, there could be fines up
to $500,000, suspensions and the loss of picks in the amateur
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Walks, balks and chalk: Malone said the Dodgers will activate
utility infielder Jose Vizcaino from the disabled list and place
outfielder Todd Hollandsworth on the disabled list with a torn
muscle in his side before today's game. . . . If those white mesh
practice caps the Dodgers wear aren't appealing to you, wait until
this six-game homestand when the Dodgers break out their blue
jerseys for Think Blue Week. The Dodgers will wear the uniforms
during the three-game series with Anaheim and the three games with
Texas. The game-worn jerseys will be signed by the player and
donated to a charity auction. The proceeds go to the Dodgers Dream
Foundation. . . . Dodgers right field Raul Mondesi has 18 home runs
in 52 games. He needs two tonight to tie Gil Hodges for the
quickest to 20 homers in Dodgers history. Hodges hit 20 in 53 games
in 1951 when the club was in Brooklyn.

FREEWAY RIVALRY SLOW TO DEVELOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It would be great to say fans this morning are
painting their faces bright blue or periwinkle in wild anticipation
of tonight's opening game of the Freeway Series.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Dodgers pitchers are snarling into the bathroom mirror
saying, ``If Mo Vaughn digs in on me, he's going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Or that there is some neighborhood between L.A. and Anaheim that
has been designated as a no-man's land in this long, bitter
struggle between the Dodgers and Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is there is no border war, no rivalry to press in the
pages of an old scrap book.
</P>
<P>
   As the teams begin the third year of interleague play, they have
played too much bad baseball to wonder who owns Southern
California. You can't throw out the stats on this one, they are not
good enough on either side.
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than the fact that the Angels are in last place
in the American League West and the Dodgers are nothing more than a
.500 team after getting swept by the Pirates in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New York and Chicago, where in-season series between the
Yankees and Mets and Cubs and White Sox quickly have become the
talk of the town, there is little water-cooler debate about the
Dodgers and Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proximity does not create a rivalry,'' Dodgers first baseman
Eric Karros said. ``History creates it. A lot of (the lack of a
rivalry) has to do a lot with the tradition. The fans create it.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York, Chicago _ the cities are different than L.A. They've
been around longer. They're not as transient. Just because you're
playing one another doesn't make it a rivalry. You have to
establish something. You can't just create it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even in corporate America where Fox _ the Dodgers owners _
and Disney, which runs the Angels, are mega media rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox did create some anger in the Angels camp this winter when it
canceled the final two games of the preseason Freeway Series in
favor of a two-game set against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were left with two open dates, forced to play a club
from the Mexican League and a team from Cal State Fullerton, led by
alum Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   In a cross-section of opinion from players and coaches on both
teams, the underlying theme to the nonrivalry is this: The Angels
have never been taken seriously because they haven't been to the
World Series in their 39-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Dodgers have not won a playoff game since 1988,
the franchise has six Series titles. The Angels have played in
three league championship series (1979, '82, '86) and lost them
all. They blew leads in the final two and haven't been back since,
helping to stamp their reputation for futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a feeling on our team when we played the
Dodgers that they were the major leagues and we were the minor
leagues,'' said Hall of Famer Rod Carew, now the Angels hitting
instructor. ``I didn't get caught up in it too much, but it
bothered a lot of guys. Winning a World Series brings a
respectability you can't get any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams really have never gotten close to playing each
other in the World Series. They rarely have been competitive in the
same season.
</P>
<P>
   After winning pennants in 1977-78, the Dodgers faltered in 1979,
the year the Angels won their first division title.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance might have been in 1985, when the Dodgers won
the West _ but the Angels finished one game behind Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Others included 1982, when the Angels won the West and the
Dodgers lost on the final day on a home run by the Giants' Joe
Morgan. In 1983, the Dodgers won the West and the Angels lost 92
games. In 1986, the Angels won the West and the Dodgers finished
under .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were just never lined up right,'' said Hubie Brooks,
who played for both clubs in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think winning a championship would certainly go a long way
toward curing a lot of ill will and wiping away a lot of
shortcomings of the past,'' said Tim Belcher, who broke in with the
Dodgers at the end of 1987 and is now an Angels starter. ``It would
all be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Any bump in enthusiasm has come from Angels fans. The preseason
Freeway Series, which began in 1962, always drew its best crowds at
Anaheim Stadium, including five over 61,000.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds at Dodger Stadium will be good this weekend,
including possible sellouts tonight and Sunday. But fan interest
might be misleading because both are linked to popular promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kahn, who does pre- and post-game shows for the Angels
flagship station KLAC-AM (570), was the Dodgers radio reporter
several years ago when KMPC-AM (710) was an all-sports station.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn says there is a real sense of urgency from Angels callers
that this series is an important statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers haven't really had a rivalry since the Cincinnati
Reds in the late 1970s,'' he said. ``They were the Big Red Machine
and the Dodgers were always looking up at them. Those games sparked
quite an interest. That's the position I see the Angels in right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have not become popular despite using the Dodgers
method of building the club through the farm system. In Los
Angeles, it enabled Steve Garvey, Ron Cey and Davey Lopes to become
long-time fixtures in fans' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Angels' 10 projected opening-day starters (including
designated hitter), eight came through their minor-league clubs.
The first baseman, Mo Vaughn, signed an $80 million free agent
contract last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the home-grown products were upset when the Dodgers
pulled out of the Freeway Series in April, including closer Troy
Percival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they realize we might be stealing some of their
thunder,'' he said. ``I think they know there is another good team
in town. They have the tradition and they've earned it, but we're
starting to step on their toes a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   First they have to get out of last place in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, these are big games with the Dodgers,'' said
Angels manager Terry Collins, who played and managed in the Dodgers
farm system. ``All of a sudden it's not early in the season. We're
into June and these are games we have to win.''

   SAMSONVILLE, N.Y. _ For years, longtime residents and weekenders
from Manhattan treasured this woodsy hamlet as the closest thing to
rustic paradise, a place where the streams made more noise than the
residents, where slender country roads rolled past old stone walls,
where the number of general stores (1) dwarfed the number of
traffic lights (0).
</P>
<P>
   One could sigh, and sigh again, when contemplating the crisp
air, the clear-day vistas of Connecticut and, perhaps most precious
of all, the leisurely and utterly predictable cadence of life.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the rumors about an American Indian casino
turned life upside down, triggering fears that this pastoral
incarnation of ``Ah, Wilderness'' would suddenly turn into
``Paradise Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began late last year, when word got out that a wealthy
landowner here named Harry C. Fotopoulos planned to donate about
one-sixth of his more than 300 acres to the Oglala Sioux of South
Dakota. The goal, Fotopoulos said, was to create a historic theme
park and campground, complemented by a motel and some restaurants,
that would help the impoverished tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 70 years old,'' said Fotopoulos, who during a recent
interview at his cabin here tucked a gun and hunting knife into his
belt. ``Whatever time I have left, whatever good I can do for some
people, that'll be my legacy. This can turn out to be such a
beautiful, beautiful thing for the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is no one here believes him. After all, the Sioux
live about 1,500 miles away and have never had a historic
connection to New York state, much less the Catskills or this
Ulster County hamlet, which is part of the town of Olive. So
instead, many residents say they are convinced that Fotopoulos, a
Manhattan real estate developer, really wants to pave the way for a
casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's insane; never ever has there been anything done to this
pristine land,'' said Harriet Black, who, with her husband, Bob,
splits her time between their sign business in Manhattan and their
weekend house on Haver Road, next to Fotopoulos' property. ``This
is a crime in the deepest sense. It's not man-made crime; it's God
and nature crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the chances for a casino are remote, federal officials
say. Even establishing a sovereign Indian nation on Fotopoulos'
property would not be easy. But the fact that Fotopoulos has
widened roads on his property, submitted a subdivision plan and
declared that he is this close to clinching the transfer has
persuaded many residents that some kind of radical change _ casino,
theme park, commercial enterprise, whatever _ is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the story has evolved into much more than just the
biggest development skirmish in this part of the Catskills since _
well, since never. The fight has been so unexpected, so out of
character, that for the first time, residents are now feeling
vulnerable, and somewhat powerless, about an idyllic world that
they never dreamed would change.
</P>
<P>
   Fotopoulos, in turn, says he has been surprised, and
disappointed, by the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare anybody not want to help the Indians?'' said
Fotopoulos, who bought his property about 40 years ago. ``This is
an absolute disgrace that people are trying to force me to do with
my land what they want to do with the land. Now, I don't want a
casino up there. But if they stop me, then I may transfer the whole
300 acres. And I'll say, `Now let's put a casino.'''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Fotopoulos, who has dabbled in politics in
Manhattan and was once branded (unfairly, he says) by The New York
Post as one of the city's worst landlords, had never evinced any
interest in American Indian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, a group called the Five Feathers Heritage Group
that Fotopoulos said was affiliated with the Oglala Sioux
approached him about donating some land. How and why they picked
Fotopoulos is not clear. But when he learned about the Sioux _ who
have an unemployment rate higher than 80 percent _ he said that,
yes, he would donate a 54-acre parcel.
</P>
<P>
   With the transaction now almost final, work on a five-acre
parking lot could begin this summer, Fotopoulos said. Eventually,
he hopes to invite some Oglala Sioux to live on the land, start a
bottled water business, stage mock battles, dig a new lake, build a
fort with vending booths. Among other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Fotopoulos said he wanted to reap about 45 percent of
the profits. But now, he says he wants only the ability to manage
the project and, perhaps, a small plaque to commemorate his
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money for me,'' he said. ``It's money for the
Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Fotopoulos' intentions, a casino is probably unlikely
because of stringent federal criteria, said Rex Hackler, director
of communications for the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is plenty of fear and loathing to go around here
over whatever the final product will be, because of concerns over
traffic and the environment in a watershed area abutting the
Ashokan Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   The subject has inspired so much concern that longtime residents
and weekenders from the city have shoved aside traditional tensions
over development, forming a rare united front to oppose the
project.
</P>
<P>
   They have planted signs that say, ``No Camp _ No Theme Park _ No
Casino.'' A citizens' group, Preservation of Olive New York ,
published its first newsletter in early May. Some residents even
rented an airplane last winter to fly over Fotopoulos' property to
take photographs of what they suspected was illegal logging
activity. But the pictures were not very good, said Vincent
Barringer, the Olive Town Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unglued a lot of us,'' said Ellen Iwanowski, who
runs the Dream House Bed and Breakfast, just down the road from
Fotopoulos' cabin. ``If he goes and gives this piece of property to
this Indian nation, and they're a sovereign nation, Harry has
nothing to say and neither does anyone else. We're all afraid, I
tell you.''
