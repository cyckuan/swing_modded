<HEADLINE> Gene Experiment Helps Hemophiliacs  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental gene-replacement procedure appears to improve
blood clotting in hemophiliacs without triggering complications,
according to a new study published amid growing controversy over
gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Stanford
University cautioned that their success in treating hemophilia B, a
relatively rare form of the illness, was preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   Just three patients were injected with a healthy gene to
stimulate production of a blood-clotting protein. An expanded trial
with more patients and higher doses is under way.
</P>
<P>
   If the method continues to work, it would be one of the few
successful genetic treatments of any disease since the approach was
introduced a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new gene's effect is ''modest, but measurable,'' said
Stanford geneticist Mark Kay, who led the study. ''It changes from
severe disease to moderate, which really increases the quality of
life for the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The hemophilia study appears in the March issue of Nature
Genetics amid a public backlash against gene therapy. The outcry
was prompted by the death last September of a Phoenix teen-ager who
had volunteered for a different gene experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Gelsinger, 18, was the first person believed to die as a
direct result of a genetic experiment. Researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania had infused his liver with a gene
therapy aimed at reversing a rare metabolic disease. The procedure
triggered an extreme immune-system reaction that caused
multiple-organ failure.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, several leading scientists, including Caltech
president and Nobel laureate David Baltimore, have questioned
whether gene therapy is too risky. And the National Institutes of
Health, which funds gene therapy research, is evaluating 400 trials
conducted with more than 4,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Other geneticists said the study in Nature Genetics, while not
conclusive, is a confidence-builder.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I like is that it was a very low-risk study,'' said
Baylor College of Medicine geneticist Arthur Beaudet. ''There is a
lot of uncertainty in the field now. It's reassuring to see some
positive studies.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 Americans suffer from hemophilia B. They produce
insufficient levels of a clotting protein known as Factor IX. As a
result, blood leaks into their joints. Many patients are disabled
by age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe hemophilia B is suitable for gene therapy
because the factor IX gene is small and a healthy copy can be
easily substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Also, levels of factor IX as low as 1 percent of normal can
improve blood clotting, so the new gene does not have to work
perfectly to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers injected a healthy factor IX gene into the patients'
thigh muscles. The gene had been incorporated into a low dose of a
simple virus that has never been associated with human disease. As
the virus spread, it copied the healthy gene into the patients'
cells.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy gene was producing effective levels of factor IX in
two patients within 12 weeks. Their reliance on clotting medication
was reduced 50 percent 80 percent. The third patient showed no
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In Gelsinger's death, Penn researchers used a different virus --
one that was known to stimulate a more vigorous response from the
immune system. Also, they injected a higher dose directly into the
youth's bloodstream.

<HEADLINE> Study: Pot Eases Tremors in Mice  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marijuana-like compounds ease tremors in mice with a condition
similar to multiple sclerosis, researchers reported today in a
study that appears to corroborate patients who say pot helps them
deal with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The relief apparently wasn't because the mice were stoned, but
because the compounds hit the right buttons in the nervous system,
the British researchers reported in today's issue of the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The compounds tested were synthetic but included the chemical
equivalent of THC, the main ingredient in marijuana. Five of the
six compounds tested reduced tremors and spasticity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lends credence to the anecdotal reports that some people
with MS have said that cannabis can help control these distressing
symptoms,'' said Lorna Layward, one of the study's authors. Layward
heads the research arm of the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Reingold, vice president of research at the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society, said it would be wrong to assume the
results would hold true for humans. He said further research should
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this doesn't tell us is that smoking marijuana is good
for MS,'' Reingold said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 Americans have MS, in which the body attacks
myelin, the sheath that insulates nerve fibers. That can produce
stiffness, tremors, paralysis, loss of vision, numbness and pain.
The cause is unknown, and there is no cure.
</P>
<P>
   In the new work, the compounds injected into the mice stimulated
structures called cannabinoid receptors on the surface of nerve
cells. The work indicates the receptors are involved in the
regulation of muscle tone, said David Baker of University College
in London, who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms were not eased merely by the sedative effect of
cannabinoids, since some of the compounds don't bind with the
receptor known to be responsible for marijuana's high. Other signs
of sedation, such as a drop in body temperature, also were not
found, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the work could lead to compounds that can treat MS
symptoms without the high of marijuana, which can affect memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've tapped into and exposed this natural system,'' he said.
''And that's why this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of marijuana in treating illness has been the subject
of debate, with some states passing laws allowing its use for
medicinal purposes. Some patients with AIDS, glaucoma and cancer
say marijuana can ease pain, nausea and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Layward said other researchers in Britain are planning to test
marijuana derivatives on MS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Lisak, co-director of the Multiple Sclerosis Center
at the Detroit Medical Center, said the mouse disease is not
exactly analogous to multiple sclerosis in humans, but the work is
encouraging.

<HEADLINE> Transplanted Kidneys Now Last Longer  </HEADLINE>
By KATHARINE WEBSTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors have gotten steadily better at preventing organ
rejection in kidney transplant patients, researchers reported
today, raising hopes of someday easing the nation's shortage of
donor organs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems with organ transplants is that the
patient's immune system may attack the donated organ because it is
not a perfect genetic match. Repeated rejections lead to transplant
failure and the need for another transplant.
</P>
<P>
   There are 44,350 people in the United States waiting for a
kidney transplant. Of those, about 18 percent are waiting for
repeat transplants, according to the United Network for Organ
Sharing, the agency that runs the nation's transplant network.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year for which complete figures are available,
12,166 transplants were performed and 2,295 people on the waiting
list died.
</P>
<P>
   A study in today's New England Journal of Medicine looked at all
93,934 kidney transplants done in the United States from 1988
through 1996 and found a steady drop in the rate of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons include better understanding of how to use
immune-suppressing drugs, earlier detection and treatment of
rejection episodes and better control of infections that take
advantage of the patient's suppressed immune system, said Dr.
Charles Carpenter, an immunologist and kidney expert at Harvard
Medical School who was not involved in the study.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the proportion of transplanted kidneys from dead
donors that survived the first year after surgery -- the period when
rejection is most likely -- rose from 79 percent to 88 percent. The
survival of transplants from live donors rose from 89 percent to 94
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The expected, median time of survival of the transplanted
kidneys more than doubled from 17 to 36 years among recipients of
organs from living donors (after patients who died of causes other
than transplant failure were excluded). Among recipients of kidneys
from dead donors, it rose from 11 years to 19.5 years.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for further improvements are good, because the
study did not measure the effects of new anti-rejection drugs that
target specific immune functions instead of shutting down the whole
immune system, Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that we can get better even with fine-tuning the
drugs that we have,'' he said. ''And that's what's going to solve
the organ supply, I think, because it's not likely we're going to
be putting pig organs in people any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. Sundaram Hariharan of the Medical
College of Wisconsin and funded in part by the National Institutes
of Health.
</P>
<P>
   In another study in this week's journal, a new anti-rejection
drug, daclizumab, proved remarkably effective when added to
standard drugs for preventing heart rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center compared
27 heart transplant patients who got three standard anti-rejection
drugs with 28 patients who also got daclizumab.
</P>
<P>
   Daclizumab, which shuts down just one type of immune cell, was
administered during the first three months after transplant, the
period when rejection is most likely. The patients were followed
for one year.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that only 18 percent of the patients on
daclizumab suffered an acute rejection episode during the first
three months, compared with 63 percent of those getting standard
drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   After the daclizumab was discontinued, those patients had nearly
as many first rejection episodes as the control group. But fewer of
them had repeated episodes, and the rejections were much less
severe.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Amish Dwarfism Gene  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have located the gene associated with a form of
dwarfism and related birth defects most commonly seen in the Amish,
a step toward explaining the basics of human growth and movement.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found that mutations in the gene trigger
Ellis-Van Creveld Syndrome, causing skeletal deformities during an
embryo's early stages.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery highlights a growing collaboration between
scientists and the Old Order Amish of Lancaster County, Pa.
Researchers traced 50 cases of Ellis-Van Creveld in Lancaster
County to a couple who emigrated to eastern Pennsylvania in 1744.
</P>
<P>
   The study by researchers in the United States and Europe appears
in the March issue of the journal Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis-Van Creveld was first described by doctors in 1940. It is
most commonly seen in Old Order Amish, whose religious beliefs
require them to live apart from modern society, and other closed
cultures that intermarry.
</P>
<P>
   Babies born with the disorder are characterized by dwarfism,
shortened limbs, extra fingers and toes and mouth deformities. At
least half develop holes between the upper chambers of their
hearts. Many of the problems can be surgically corrected, but there
is no cure for the condition.
</P>
<P>
   The gene's identification provides the basis for premarital and
prenatal testing. But Amish couples would probably not submit to
such tests because of their strict religious beliefs and marriage
customs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They simply accept people with the syndrome as part of the
culture,'' said Dr. Holmes Morton, who runs the Clinic for Special
Children for the Amish in Strasburg, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Implant Brand Safe Enough  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- A brand of saline-filled breast
implants breaks and leaks much too often -- and many patients must
undergo repeated operations -- but the devices should be allowed to
be sold as long women are properly warned of the risks, a federal
advisory panel says.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice for a woman is difficult,'' bioethicist Nancy
Dubler of New York's Montifiore Medical Center acknowledged
Wednesday as advisers to the Food and Drug Administration,
following a tense 13 hours of testimony and debate, recommended 8-1
that Mentor Corp.'s implants stay on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the implants' failure rates ''alarmingly high,'' Dr.
Stephen Li of New York's Hospital for Special Surgery added: ''It's
amazing to me it seems to be tolerated as just something you have
to live with in these implants.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their criticisms, there is no evidence the implants
cause major diseases, so Li and fellow FDA panelists balked at
taking away women's option to choose Santa Barbara, Calif.-based
Mentor Corp.'s saline-filled implants as long as women are fully
warned of the risks and more safety tests are performed.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but
typically follows them. The advisers also will debate the safety of
two other companies' implants, Santa Barbara, Calif.-based McGhan
Corp. and Miami-based PIP/USA, later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 American women received saline-filled breast
implants last year even though the FDA has never declared these
implants safe: They hit the market before the FDA began regulating
medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA recently decided they can only continue selling if
manufacturers prove they truly are safe, and asked its scientific
advisers to evaluate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen implant recipients, some tearful, told the panel
Wednesday that saline implants are defective and dangerous and
should be banned. Some held up implants removed from their bodies
that were blackened with fungus, and blamed them for causing
infections, excruciating breast pain or repeated surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only fools will call these risks acceptable,'' said Patricia
Faussett of Henderson, Nev., who said her illnesses disappeared
once her implants were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants are most women's only option. In 1992, the FDA
banned use of silicone gel-filled breast implants except for a
small number of women in strict clinical trials. No other implants
are sold in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some breast cancer survivors pleaded with the FDA
on Wednesday to keep the option open, saying implants help their
emotional recovery after a mastectomy. ''It has given me back my
self-esteem and sexuality,'' said Jennifer Gardner of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor studied 1,680 saline implant recipients. Up to 27 percent
of the implants were removed within three years of implantation,
most because patients suffered painful scar tissue, an infection,
or the implant broke and leaked, FDA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants are highly prone to deflating as the salt water
leaks into patients' bodies, FDA said. Up to 9 percent deflated
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   And up to 40 percent of breast cancer survivors who had implants
needed repeat surgeries, either to remove an implant for good,
replace it with a new or larger one or to remove painfully hardened
spots of breast tissue surrounding the implant, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer patients were at most risk for complications; they
accounted for the 27 percent implant-removal rate. In contrast, 8
percent of implants used for cosmetic breast enlargement in healthy
women were removed in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor blamed the discrepancy on cancer patients' initial poor
health and need for repeated medical tests and treatments that may
stress an implant, and said most recipients are happy with their
implants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We provide a safe and effective option for women,'' Mentor
Vice President Bobby Purkait said.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA noted that the longer all women have implants, the
more likely they are to suffer a side effect.

<HEADLINE> Congress Passes Iran Sanctions Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia could lose U.S. financial backing for
its space program under an Iran nonproliferation bill the House and
Senate both passed without a dissenting vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which now goes to President Clinton, bars the United
States from making ''extraordinary payments in connection with the
International Space Station'' to the Russian space agency unless
the president confirms that companies linked to the agency are not
helping Iran's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time for the U.S. government to send a clear and
unambiguous message to Russia that we will not tolerate cooperation
with Iranian weapons programs by the Russian government or any
Russian entities,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of
the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the administration has proposed paying Russia $650
million beyond the original amount pledged for Russia's space
station participation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in 1998 vetoed a somewhat stronger Iran sanctions bill,
electing instead to take administrative action against some 10
Russian companies accused of transferring weapons material and
technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said the legislation is not needed and
complicates international nonproliferation efforts, but has not
renewed its veto threat. The House on Wednesday voted 420-0 to
approve the Senate bill passed last week by 98-0.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1998 bill, the legislation gives the president the
authority to impose sanctions on groups from Russia and other
countries that offer Iran weapons material or technology, but does
not require him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It does require him to report to Congress twice a year on
foreign persons or groups identified as supplying Iran with weapons
materials. The president has the power to prohibit U.S. purchases
from that person or country, or bar the sale of items on the U.S.
Munitions List.
</P>
<P>
   In both the Senate and House debates lawmakers said they were
heartened by the success of reformers in the recent Iranian
elections, but stressed that Iran was still a dangerous,
terrorist-supporting state.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., ranking Democrat on the
International Relations Committee, said that ''in no way is this
bill meant to undermine the Iranian people's brave fight for
democracy ... we have no quarrel with the Iranian people; rather,
our disagreements are with the policies of the hardline regime.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Agencies Mull Advertising 'Clutter'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- No need to rush those trips to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial breaks on television are becoming longer and more
frequent, according to a study released Wednesday. In fact, the
number of commercials on prime-time TV are at an all-time high --
something that's even starting to worry some of the advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Each hour of prime-time network television contained an average
of 16 minutes, 43 seconds of advertising last November, a jump of
59 seconds in just a year, according to the American Association of
Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising ''clutter'' was already at an all-time high in 1998.
The amount of ad time has gone up by nearly a minute and a half in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic increase has some advertisers concerned that their
messages are being lost in the flood of commercials, in-house
promotions and public service announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would suggest there is a direct correlation between the
increase in clutter and a diminishment in the effectiveness of our
creative campaigns,'' said Steve Grubbs of the ad firm BBDO
Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Added John Mandel of Grey Advertising: ''If the television
industry doesn't recognize soon that they are killing the golden
goose, they will lose the battle for the attention of consumers to
their content and the attention of advertisers as the major
advertising vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy has increased the number of advertisers wanting
to get on TV. There's been a particular flood of ads by dot-com
companies trying to create an image.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, TV networks are being squeezed by increased
programming costs -- so the extra ad time is a temptation too hard
to resist.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC executive criticized the study, saying it didn't take
into account fluctuations since it measures only one week. Alex
Wallau, ABC's president of network administration and operations,
said the network has kept ad time steady for its most popular shows
over the past two years, although more commercials were added in
some of the lower-rated shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be sensitive to the viewers and we also have to be
sensitive to our buyers,'' Wallau said. ''We cannot create an
environment that becomes too cluttered.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the four major networks stand out as a particular
culprit. ABC had the greatest average ad time, at 16:57 per hour,
and CBS was the least at 16:32. Yet CBS had the most dramatic
increase; it was up 1:47 from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with November 1991, there are now three minutes more of
commercial time on average in prime-time, the ad agencies said in a
report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Except for local news, prime-time is actually the least
cluttered time of day. ABC, CBS and NBC all carry at least 20
minutes of ad time per hour during daylight hours -- over 22 minutes
on average for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   An extra 30 seconds of ad time was also crammed into the
half-hour network evening news programs, the report said.
Late-night and early morning also saw increases.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ''Good Morning America'' averaged 15 minutes, 36 seconds
of commercials last November, roughly a minute more than its
competitors on NBC and CBS.

<HEADLINE> Federal Government To Sell $1 Homes  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is holding a clearance
sale, but this is not the assortment of barrettes, plastic
figurines and other items one might find in a discount store that
sells everything for $1. These are houses for a buck.
</P>
<P>
   The government on Wednesday began selling vacant and foreclosed
homes for $1 to local communities that can put the properties to
use.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new ''Good Neighbor Policy,'' foreclosed single-family
homes will go up for sale to local governments if the Federal
Housing Administration is unable to sell them after six months.
About 3,000 homes will initially be for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Good Neighbor Policy will build better futures for
hundreds of communities and thousands of families across our
nation,'' said Department of Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Andrew Cuomo. ''It will help reverse decades of decline
in our cities by revitalizing neighborhoods, attracting new
residents, and promoting homeownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Communities that buy the vacant homes for $1 could sell or rent
them to low- and moderate-income families, to first-time home
buyers, or to groups that use the homes to provide services like
child care or job training.
</P>
<P>
   If a house is dilapidated beyond repair, HUD will demolish the
building and sell the vacant lot to the local government for $1.
</P>
<P>
   The program is the brainchild of Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, and
as a result, the first home -- a three-bedroom house -- will be sold
to Columbus, Ohio. Kasich said selling the homes for a nominal fee
to local governments is a ''great way to put power in the hands of
local people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer they stay vacant, the greater the chances they'll
deteriorate and be more difficult to put to good use,'' Kasich
said. ''Placing them in the hands of local officials will help cut
red tape and insure that they'll more quickly be used in a way that
meets local needs.''
</P>
<P>
   FHA ensures about 6.7 million mortgages. When homeowners fail to
make their mortgage payments, FHA first attempts to help them stay
in their homes. FHA forecloses if that attempt fails, however.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of FHA-owned homes sell within six months; the
agency has sold about 39,000 homes in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, FHA also sold about 6,500 homes to local governments
and nonprofit organizations under a plan called the ''Direct Sales
Program,'' which offers homes in specified areas that have been
targeted for revitalization. In those cases, the local government
can buy the house at a 30 percent discount off the appraised value.
That program, which sells houses as soon as they become available
to FHA, will continue.

By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breaking an impasse that has held up federal
airport construction money since last October, congressional
negotiators have agreed on $40 billion in federal aviation
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said
Wednesday that Senate negotiators and House Transportation
Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., ''after numerous meetings
and discussions,'' had agreed on the ''correct approach'' to
handling the Federal Aviation Administration budget.
</P>
<P>
   New spending for airport projects has been on hold since the
fiscal year began last October because a dispute over the status of
the Aviation Trust Fund, which takes in some $10 billion a year
from airport fees and taxes, held up passage of legislation to
authorize FAA spending.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, a fierce advocate of spending for highways and
aviation, wanted the trust fund to be put ''off-budget,'' meaning
money coming into the fund could be used only for aviation
purposes. Currently revenues from the many federal trust funds go
into the general treasury, and is available for any federal
program.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators agreed that the trust fund will stay in the
general budget but that funding for aviation programs will at least
equal the amount coming into the trust fund plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   They also decided that the Appropriations Committees that
determine spending every year can assign money from the general
budget to aviation programs, but rejected Shuster's proposal that a
fixed amount of general budget money be set aside to help airports
cope with needs to expand and modernize.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said funding for federal aviation programs will be $40
billion over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   He said that all the money from the trust fund, some $33 billion
over three years, will be guaranteed for aviation programs, and
that another $6.7 billion will be available to be appropriated from
the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   He said the total amount available for airport projects in 2001
will be $12.7 billion, up $2.7 billion over 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said other issues were still on the table, including the
House proposal that airports be allowed to double the passenger
facility charge, a ticket tax that goes to local improvement
projects, to $6.

Pinochet Freed To Return Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Britain's top law enforcement official ruled today that
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet should not be extradited to Spain
to stand trial on charges alleging human rights abuses. The long-awaited
decision by Home Secretary Jack Straw freed Pinochet to return home after more
than 16 months of detention. But Spain and the other parties seeking to block
his release could launch last-minute appeals. Straw had announced Jan. 11 that
he was inclined to let the 84-year-old general return to Chile because a medical
examination by four independent doctors had found him medically unfit to stand
trial.

sought refuge in four days earlier, one of as many as 1 million people made
homeless in this southeast African nation. An hour later, Pedro and her daughter
were rescued after a medic lowered from a helicopter cut the newborn's umbilical
cord and pulled the two to safety. Yesterday's dramatic rescue came as thousands
more Mozambicans remained stranded in trees, on rooftops or on shrinking islands
of land. Thousands more are feared dead in flooding that has devastated one of
the world's poorest countries.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- After red-eye flights from California, Al Gore and Bill
Bradley are shifting their campaign focus to the East Coast and New York's
crucial primary next week. For Bradley, the stakes are especially high
considering his string of losses, including a drubbing this week in Washington
state where he had invested precious days of campaign time. "If he loses New
York, he's out," former New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch, one of Bradley's
best-known New York supporters, said yesterday. He said the odds for a Bradley
win in New York were not good.

Sliding Euro Pressures Europeans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A new low for the beleaguered euro has increased
pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interest rates, but most analysts
predict the bank's governing board will opt to wait when it meets today. The
bank last raised its benchmark rate only a month ago to 3.25 percent from 3.0
percent, saying the weak euro was becoming a flashpoint for inflation. The euro
bounced back to about 99 cents after the Feb. 3 hike, but on Monday it hit a new
low of 93.90 cents before recovering. Yesterday, it hovered at 96.90 cents.

Panel: Implant Brand Safe Enough

	   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- A brand of saline-filled breast implants breaks
and leaks much too often -- and many patients must undergo repeated operations
-- but the devices should be allowed to be sold as long women are properly
warned of the risks, a federal advisory panel says. "The choice for a woman is
difficult," bioethicist Nancy Dubler of New York's Montifiore Medical Center
acknowledged yesterday as advisers to the Food and Drug Administration,
following a tense 13 hours of testimony and debate, recommended 8-1 that Mentor
Corp.'s implants stay on the market.

<HEADLINE> Drug Companies To Donate Vaccines  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heeding a White House call, four major drug
companies are donating millions of doses of vaccines to combat
malaria, hepatitis B, polio and other dreaded diseases in Africa
and other troubled regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The donations, valued at more than $150 million, were to be
announced today after President Clinton meets with leaders of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, foundations and
international organizations and the public health community.
</P>
<P>
   They were invited to the White House for Clinton's campaign to
accelerate the development of vaccines for troubled countries in
Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies also were to pledge to step up research and
development on vaccines for HIV/AIDS and malaria. Clinton has
proposed a $1 billion tax credit over 10 years to encourage the
development of such vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious diseases kill more than 8 million children worldwide
and orphan millions more annually. In Africa, 10 times as many
people died from AIDS last year as were killed in wars.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF executive director Carol Bellamy said last month that
AIDS is turning parts of Africa into ''a killing field,'' leaving
11 million orphans, a figure expected to rise to 13 million within
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges to be announced today, according to an official
familiar with the program, were:
</P>
<P>
   --Merck will donate 1 million doses a year of RECOMBIVAX --HB, a
vaccine to prevent hepatitis B, for five years. The vaccine is
valued at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   --American Home Products Corp. will donate 10 million doses of
Haemophilus influenza type-B conjugate vaccine to UNICEF. Officials
said it should protect more than 3 million children in developing
countries from one of the leading causes of pneumonia and
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   --SmithKline Beecham will expand its malaria vaccine program and
begin vaccine trials in Africa for children, starting in Gambia as
early as next fall.
</P>
<P>
   --Aventis will donate 50 million doses of polio vaccine in Africa
to support the World Health Organization- and UNICEF-led campaign
to eliminate polio in five war-torn African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to direct Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala to convene a meeting of representatives from industry,
government and the academic world to address obstacles to vaccine
development and to strengthen public-private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The president has asked Congress for $150 million for vaccine
research and prevention programs in Africa, where about 2.2 million
people died from AIDS in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In today's meeting, Clinton was to recognize the $750 million
contribution of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the
vaccine purchase fund of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunization. The president also was to acknowledge public-private
partnerships such as the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative,
which is investing more than $10 million this year to triple the
number of AIDS vaccine candidates it is moving toward trials.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Actress To Play Bridget Jones  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britons adopted a wait-and-see attitude when
American actress Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as oh-so-English Lady
Viola in the film ''Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   But some newspaper columnists already are sharpening their
perfectly manicured fingernails over the casting of yet another
beautiful American blonde -- 29-year-old Renee Zellweger -- as
angst-ridden, calorie-counting Londoner Bridget Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a self-obsessed thirtysomething in search of Mr. Right,
is the creation of British author Helen Fielding, whose novel
''Bridget Jones' Diary'' has sold 4 million copies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   So what do calorie-counting, thirtysomething British journalists
think about Zellweger for the film role? Too young, too pretty, too
American.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the clunking, Hollywood idiocy,'' wrote columnist Zoe
Williams in the Evening Standard. ''Casting her as a young and
perfect thing is like remaking 'The Elephant Man' with Jude Law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Zellweger is a clean-living American, so it is unlikely
that she smokes or drinks,'' sniffed Kate Watson-Smyth in The
Independent. ''She is also reportedly on the verge of becoming what
Bridget would call a smug-married.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only good thing, I suppose, is it isn't Meg Ryan,'' added
Suzanne Moore in her Mail on Sunday column.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks New Money Laudering Laws  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration intends to ask
Congress for new power to combat money laundering, including the
authority to ban financial transactions between U.S. institutions
and offshore financial centers, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to tighten money-laundering laws after
authorities said the Bank of New York served as a conduit for about
$7 billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from illegal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers was to detail the proposed
legislation in a speech to bankers today, the Times said, citing
unidentified administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Treasury Department wants the power to
ask American companies to collect data on all kinds of transactions
with an offshore bank or financial company.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where foreign governments shield banks from
investigation, the department wants the authority to cut them off
from the U.S. financial system without seeking Congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials have already begun informing U.S. banks of
foreign banks or nations that repeatedly refuse to abide by
generally accepted standards to protect against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Colombia and Nigeria are identified as being among the
biggest sources of illicit money, according to the speech Summers
was expected to deliver. The islands of Dominica, Antigua and Nauru
were among the biggest destination spots for such funds.

<HEADLINE> Corporate Sponsors Take to Broadway  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If you haven't yet seen the involvement of
corporate America on Broadway, soon you won't be able to miss it.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Roundabout Theater Company will rechristen its
newly renovated 42nd Street home the American Airlines Theater
because of an $8.5 million company gift, spread over a 10-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest in a series of corporate forays onto Broadway
that have led to closer ties to the world of big business and
high-powered marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest theater owner,
is rumored to be considering a deal with General Motors to rename
the Winter Garden, home of ''Cats,'' as the Cadillac Winter Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout, which has 45,000 subscribers, has an annual
budget of more than $20 million. Its successes include the current
revival of ''Cabaret'' and the critically praised production of
''Anna Christie'' starring Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson.
</P>
<P>
   ''This generous investment will provide Roundabout with the
critical financial stability to continue the caliber of work and
programs our audiences have come to expect,'' said Todd Haimes, the
company's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   In return for its gift, the airline will get its name on the
theater's marquee, as well as on tickets and advertising, for the
length of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The theater opened in 1918 and was built and named for producer
Arch Selwyn. It became a movie house in the 1930s and languished
for years until the rebirth of activity in the Times Square area in
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The space, which has undergone a $21 million, two-year
renovation, opens in April with a revival of ''Uncle Vanya,''
starring Derek Jacobi.
</P>
<P>
   The renaming of Broadway theaters is not new, although in the
past it usually has been done with a theatrical connection in mind.
Names of theaters have been changed to honor playwrights (Eugene
O'Neill), actors (Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne), composers
(Richard Rodgers) and even critics (Brooks Atkinson and Walter
Kerr).
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, now-defunct Livent combined two theaters on 42nd
Street, the Apollo and Lyric, and called its new playhouse the Ford
Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a growing trend,'' said producer Alexander Cohen. ''It
will accelerate the marketing, merchandising and even the
politicization of Broadway as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   ''One cannot be too critical of anything supportive of the
theater,'' said Cohen, who was instrumental in getting Broadway
theaters renamed for Rodgers and George and Ira Gershwin. ''At the
same time one has to pay respect to those who created the American
theater. We do not need the Campbell's Pork and Beans Palace.''

<HEADLINE> Discriminatory Rates Investigated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban
Development is investigating whether the two biggest underwriters
of home mortgages discriminate against blacks and other minorities,
The Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of black Americans pay higher mortgage rates or may
not be able to get a mortgage at all because of lending policies at
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The absence of active involvement by Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac in these markets limits the opportunities for African-American
families to get conventional mortgages,'' the Post quoted William
Apgar, HUD's federal housing commissioner, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   HUD is preparing to release a 500-page proposal, possibly as
early as today, with rules to require the companies to do more
business with underserved consumers, the Post said. In the
proposal, the agency says the percentage of loans to blacks that
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy lags behind the percentage of home
loans made to blacks nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spokesmen said the numbers HUD uses
overstate the difference and don't reflect their efforts to expand
the loan market for blacks, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae gives lenders the ability to make
more loans by buying home loans from banks and other mortgage
lenders.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Ship Cos. Cited for Pollution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Six cruise ship operators have been
accused by the Environmental Protection Agency of ''significantly
exceeding'' state and federal air pollution limits in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America Line-Westours Inc., Princess Cruises, Celebrity
Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Lines and World
Explorer Cruises were cited Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA, 13 of the companies' ships violated air
pollution regulations. The companies could be fined up to $27,500
per incident and could be ordered to install pollution control
equipment or take other action.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Elvejord, spokesman for Holland America, said the company
will review its emissions records. Tom Dow, a spokesman for
Princess Cruises, said his company takes the matter seriously and
will also review its records. The companies have 30 days to respond
to the EPA notices.
</P>
<P>
   The citations are the latest in a crackdown on cruise ship
pollution in Alaska. Last year, a federal judge in Anchorage fined
Royal Caribbean $6.5 million for illegally dumping waste oil and
other pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA investigation marked the first time that agency has gone
after the cruise ship industry for air pollution violations in
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was prompted by complaints from the public and
because the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation stopped
monitoring cruise ship emissions in 1996, citing budget cuts, EPA
investigator John Pavitt said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices opened mixed on Thursday. The Dow

</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 16.05; Nasdaq Down 2.73  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today
as investors grew more cautious as they awaited the government's
employment report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 16.05 at 10,153.98.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were slightly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 1.51 at 1,377.68, and the Nasdaq
composite index was down 2.73 at 4,781.35.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart led the Dow higher, rising 2 13/16 to 52 and helping
the blue-chip index extend a three-day streak of gains. In the
first three sessions of this week, the Dow regained 275 of the 357
points it lost last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the interest rate worries responsible for the Dow's plunge
last week clearly are still in the market, traders said. This
morning, most leading retail companies reported robust sales,
suggesting Americans are spending freely despite four rate
increases by the Federal Reserve since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. The Fed has
been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy to a pace that
will allow continued growth without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investors will receive a crucial piece of information
on the economy's strength when the government releases its
employment report for the month of February. The report will
include information on wages and benefits, which should indicate
whether companies are spending heavily to attract and keep
employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at extremely low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which have held up best amid growing worries
over interest rates, slipped back today as investors took some
profits from their recent run. Sun Microsystems was down 1~ at 96
1/16 and Intel fell 1 7/16 to 114 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 177.47 million
shares, behind Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.05 to 587.30.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.1 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.0 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Guns and money are the talk of Clinton, Giuliani campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY COTTAGE, N.Y. (AP) -- She accepted a contribution from a
rap artist charged with gun possession. He accepted a contribution
from the president of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday -- as shootings in Pennsylvania and Michigan
captured headlines -- the rival Senate campaigns of Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani accused each other of hypocrisy on gun
violence. Both candidates support gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The charge from Giuliani's side against Clinton was made after
the first lady led 200 schoolchildren in an antigun pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you know of any guns in your house or in the houses of your
uncles, cousins, friends or neighbors, I want you to promise you
will never, ever go near them,'' she told the fifth-graders at
Valley Cottage Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want you to promise you will never, ever play with anybody
who goes near them, and I want you to promise you will never, ever
pick up a gun with any idea of using it against another person,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the students to tell parents who own guns to lock
the weapons away or remove them from the house for the sake of
young children.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, a Giuliani spokesman, said the first lady was
''sending a confusing and hypocritical message'' since her campaign
accepted a $1,000 contribution from rapper Sean ''Puffy'' Combs in
October. Combs has since been indicted on gun possession charges
following a shooting at a nightclub in December.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson pointed to a
$1,000 contribution the Giuliani campaign took from actor Charlton
Heston, president of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't be lectured to by a campaign that's taken money from
the head of the NRA,'' said Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Valley Cottage school, Clinton did not directly
mention the shooting Tuesday in Flint, Mich., in which a 6-year-old
shot and killed another.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children, however, already knew about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to stop guns because of what happened yesterday,''
10-year-old Kevin O'Donohue said. ''For a little kid to shoot
another was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll released today said Giuliani, riding support
from white women and Jewish voters, has taken the lead over
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute had
Giuliani favored by 48 percent of registered voters with the first
lady backed by 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released by Quinnipiac on Feb. 6, the day Clinton
formally entered the race, had Giuliani favored by 45 percent of
New York voters to 42 percent for the first lady, a statistical tie
given a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The latest telephone poll of 1,842 registered voters was
conducted Feb. 22-28 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor leads 51 percent to 37 percent among white women and
48 percent to 38 percent among Jewish voters.

<HEADLINE> Sen.: State Department Is Top-Heavy  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee complained today that the State Department is top-heavy
with senior policy-makers far in excess of normal needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which is larger, operates with fewer
senior officials, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, told Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright at a subcommittee hearing on the Clinton
administration's request for $23.7 billion for foreign policy
operations in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''That has a lot to do with the funding problems of your
department,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright and other administration officials say the money
spent on foreign operations is only a tiny fraction of overall
spending, various parts of the budget have come under attack on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for instance, Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., chairman
of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the State
Department budget, said the $739 million requested for peacekeeping
operations would fund missions ''which seem to offer little hope
for success.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration is seeking a 220 percent increase, he said.
Rogers told Albright ''You all seem to have Mae West's view of
things: 'Too much of a good thing is simply wonderful,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens lodged his complaint softly. He said the proliferation
of assistant secretaries of state and other senior posts ''is
something we should look at and not get into a political wrangle
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright assured him there was an ongoing review at the
department. She also defended the bureaucracy, noting there are 187
countries in the United Nations. ''This is a large world and we
need officers capable of dealing with these countries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Albright said, ''We often don't have enough foreign
service officers to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   She said significant increases were being requested only for
security and U.N. peacekeeping programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens insisted that the way the department is structured,
''the money is going to the topside too much.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Albright notified the subcommittee that she may
create an undersecretary of state post to deal with security and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, she said, was to have ''a single high-ranking officer
who can speak for the department on security questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a step forward,'' Rogers assured her. ''It's welcome
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton signed a directive for a new $10
million program to train foreign police forces under a new office
at the department.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 51.19; Nasdaq Up 29.67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as investors
continued to buy blue chip stocks that were battered last week as
well as the technology stocks that have led the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 51.19 at 10,189.12.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 4.26 at 1,383.45, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 39.67 at 4,823.75.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T led the Dow higher, rising 4 3/16 to 52. In the first three
sessions of this week, the Dow regained 275 of the 357 points it
lost last week.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believe ''enough was enough'' after last week's
pummeling of Dow and other industrial stocks, said Gregory Nie,
technical analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''This
week, volume has picked up and breadth is better, and the market is
trying to rally. That is encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 3 3/16 to 94 and Exxon Mobil, boosted by the
latest spike in oil prices, rose 2 5/16 to 77 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   But the interest rate worries responsible for the Dow's plunge
last week clearly are still in the market and contributing to
volatility, traders said. This morning, most leading retail
companies reported robust sales, suggesting Americans are spending
freely despite four rate increases by the Federal Reserve since
last June.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. The Fed has
been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy to a pace that
will allow continued growth without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investors will receive a crucial piece of information
on the economy's strength when the government releases its
employment report for the month of February. The report will
include information on wages and benefits, which should indicate
whether companies are spending heavily to attract and keep
employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at extremely low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which have held up best amid growing worries
over interest rates, were also higher today. Radiant Systems soared
39} to 95 after the company said it will work with Microsoft to
develop electronic commerce systems.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Palm Inc., the spinoff of 3Com Corp., had not yet
begun trading on the Nasdaq. Palm shares were priced at 38 late
Wednesday, well above original estimates of 14 to 16 per share.
Parent company 3Com rose 5] to 109{ today.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 404.59 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.46 to 588.81.

<HEADLINE> Rough start for all-female policy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALHALLA, N.Y. (AP) -- Two correction officers at the Westchester
County Jail who were reassigned under a new policy barring male
guards from the women's quarters did not show up for their first
shifts overnight and county officials worried briefly about the
possibility of a job action.
</P>
<P>
   But the day shift went more smoothly and spokesman Terry Kelly
said the county was no longer concerned. A union lawyer said the
two absent officers had ''completely legitimate medical reasons.''
He would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The two guards -- a man who had been transferred out of the
women's unit and a woman who had been transferred in -- claimed
unspecified on-the-job injuries and did not come in for the 11 p.m.
shift Wednesday, the first under the new policy, said county
spokeswoman Susan Tolchin. One reassigned male guard did work, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be watching closely to see if this is the sign of
something bigger,'' she said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. Thursday, six reassigned officers were scheduled in,
and all but one -- a woman who called in sick -- reported, Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 14 male officers and 14 females were reassigned on the
orders of County Executive Andrew Spano after the Jan. 26 arrests
of four male officers for alleged sexual attacks on female inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot allow a climate where this type of behavior can go
on,'' Spano said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Goodstein, attorney for the 754-member Correction
Officers Benevolent Association, had said the new policy would be
obeyed, but called it illegal and vowed a court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sexual discrimination against the men,'' he said. ''This
is guilt by association because they happen to be the same sex (as
the accused men). It is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Pozzi, the county's correction commissioner, insisted that
the change is permitted under the work contract.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, housing posts in the women's jail were assigned on a
seniority basis, and most went to men, since they were the officers
with the most time in.
</P>
<P>
   The jail houses women who are either awaiting trial or serving
sentences of up to one year. It currently holds about 150 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The county and the prison guards union have had contentious
relations for years, with the county claiming that correction
officers abuse their disability and overtime privileges.

<HEADLINE> Religion News in Brief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Eleven influential Orthodox rabbis have issued a
policy ruling urging greater use of prenuptial agreements to solve
a problem in religious law.
</P>
<P>
   The move by senior Talmud experts at Yeshiva University's
rabbinical school is the latest effort to prevent an increase in
''agunah,'' or ''chained'' women, who are caught in unhappy
marriages because their husbands refuse to grant religious
divorces.
</P>
<P>
   In Orthodoxy, religious divorces are mandatory for remarriage
even if a civil divorce has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The prenuptial agreements commit a husband and wife who want to
end their marriage to seek arbitration from a religious court.
Spouses who refuse are fined.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a public outcry for many years, and rabbis are
not insensitive to real situations,'' said Rabbi Norman Lamm,
president of Yeshiva University and one of the signers. ''These
cases of unhappiness and misery moved us to contemplate what remedy
was available in traditional Jewish law.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the rabbis should have acted sooner, but Lamm
explains that rabbis first wanted to be sure such agreements were
being widely used and accepted.

Study: Hispanics segregated within Roman Catholic church
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hispanics are often segregated from other
Roman Catholics in U.S. parishes but those in Southern California
are better integrated than most, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
concluded that Hispanics are twice as likely as other Catholics to
worship in ''separate and unequal settings.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings present serious challenges for the church's future,
said Ronaldo M. Cruz, executive director of the bishops'
Secretariat for Hispanic Affairs. He said the bishops hope that
gradually ''Latinos will be fully integrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is scheduled for release March 15, but advance copies
were obtained by The Los Angeles Times and the National Catholic
Reporter of Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Hispanics also head most of the nation's parishes, according
to the study. Relatively few Hispanics are entering the priesthood
or women's religious orders. The church reported only one Hispanic
priest per 10,000 Hispanic parishioners last year compared with one
priest for every 1,200 faithful overall.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics make up 30 percent of the American Catholic population
of 62 million.

Judge limits size of Mormon steeple
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A Superior Court judge has cropped plans for a
steeple on a controversial Mormon temple under construction in
suburban Belmont. Judge Elizabeth Fahey ruled that a steeple isn't
essential to a church, particularly when it soars higher than local
zoning laws allow.
</P>
<P>
   ''While a spire might have inspirational value and may embody
the Mormon value of ascendancy towards heaven, that is not a matter
of religious doctrine and is not in any way related to the
religious use of the temple,'' Fahey stated.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey also said the church had not proven its claim that the
height limit was unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million temple is to open this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
won the right to put an 81-foot steeple atop of the 58-foot
building though zoning regulations limited total height to 72 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby residents complained that the steeple would cast shadows
on their homes and dominate the skyline. The filed suit contending
that a church is not exempt from town rules though state zoning law
permits churches to bypass local regulations. Fahey agreed.

Yearbook reports small increase in U.S. church membership
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The 2000 edition of the ''Yearbook of
American &AMP; Canadian Churches'' reports a cumulative U.S. church
membership of 158.3 million as of 1998, an increase of 791,000 over
1997.
</P>
<P>
   That was not enough to keep pace with U.S. population growth,
said the yearbook, compiled by the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   The yearbook said stagnation ''may be due more to religious
pluralism than to a decline in overall religious affiliation
rates.'' That is, non-Christian faiths are a growing sector of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to data on churches, the yearbook for the first time
lists organizations for non-Christian faiths. It includes maps
showing locations of U.S. Muslim mosques, scattered nationwide, and
Buddhist temples, largely clustered in the West Coast and the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The yearbook, published by Abingdon Press, contends Protestant
statistics raise doubts about the scenario that conservative
denominations grow while progressive ones decline. For instance,
the Southern Baptist Convention and more liberal Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.) suffered similar annual membership losses of around
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention remains the second largest U.S.
denomination behind the Roman Catholic Church, which grew by 1.3
percent to 62 million.
</P>
<P>
   On finances, 62 denominations that have 50 million members
provided public reports, showing contributions of $26.2 billion.

Presbyterians approve National Council of Churches bailout
</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- After the new chief executive of the
National Council of Churches said he had installed financial
controls and ''stopped the hemorrhaging,'' Presbyterian Church
leaders approved a $500,000 gift to help the council meet a $2
million deficit for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Presbyterian executives said the gift is contingent on other
denominations in the council meeting the rest of the deficit, and a
balanced council budget for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterians also ordered a comprehensive review of the
church council and other ecumenical agencies every three years.
Presbyterian News Service said more than 1,000 communications to
headquarters ran 9-to-1 against the bailout for the church council.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian executives planned to send church members a
''pastoral letter'' explaining the decision, as well as the
financial loss the Presbyterians themselves suffered at a New
Year's youth rally.

Man who can't read spends a year hand-copying Bible
</P>
<P>
   HENDERSON, Ky. (AP) -- It certainly would have been enough of a
challenge if 64-year-old Truman Meredith had merely decided that he
was going to hand-copy the entire Bible. But the semiretired
construction worker's accomplishment is more extraordinary,
considering that he cannot read what he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hour after hour, night after night for the past year, Meredith
sat at the dining room table in his apartment and meticulously
printed the words of the entire Bible onto loose-leaf notebook
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think it would mean that much to a lot of people,''
he said. ''But it means a lot to me. It made me feel good to do
this. It really did.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith copied the Bible to express his newfound religious
faith. He said he hasn't always been religious, but health problems
about a decade ago motivated him to change his lifestyle.

   ''In 1990, I had a heart attack, and I was a sinner when I went
into the hospital,'' Meredith explained. When he was better, he and
his late wife started going to church and became Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith was only a boy when he had to leave school and go to
work with his father to help support their family, which included
16 children.

   ''I know my letters, but I can't read. I want to learn how. It
would tickle me to death to read that Bible,'' he said, pointing to

Methodist panel wants to end mandatory retirement
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Methodists' Committee on Older Adult
Ministries wants the denomination to end mandatory retirement for
the clergy, United Methodist News Service reports.
</P>
<P>
   Under current church rules, clergy must retire no later than age
70 and may do so earlier. Bishops must retire between 66 and 70,
depending on when their terms are completed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church's legislative conference in May
plans to discuss the retirement policy.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 37.23; Nasdaq Up 22.53  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today as investors
continued to buy blue chip stocks that were battered last week and
made room for a highly-anticipated new offering in the technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 37.23 at 10,175.16.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were modestly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 2.51 at 1,381.70, and the Nasdaq composite
index was up 22.53 at 4,806.61.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T led the Dow higher, rising 5 1/16 to 52~. In the first
three sessions of this week, the Dow regained 275 of the 357 points
it lost last week.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believe ''enough was enough'' after last week's
pummeling of Dow and other industrial stocks, said Gregory Nie,
technical analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''This
week, volume has picked up and breadth is better, and the market is
trying to rally. That is encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 3 3/16 to 94 and Exxon Mobil, boosted by the
latest spike in oil prices, rose 1{ to 76\.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Palm Inc., the spinoff of 3Com Corp., soared to
102{ from its offering price of 38 per share. Parent company 3Com,
which has risen sharply in recent sessions, tumbled 14 1/16 to 90
1/16 today.
</P>
<P>
   Companies poised to take advantage of the growth of the Internet
were also higher today. Radiant Systems soared 35 13/16 to 91 1/16
after the company said it will work with Microsoft to develop
electronic commerce systems.
</P>
<P>
   While most stocks were higher, trading was fairly volatile,
indicating that the interest rate worries responsible for the Dow's
plunge last week clearly are still in the market.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, most leading retail companies reported robust
sales, suggesting Americans are spending freely despite four rate
increases by the Federal Reserve since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. The Fed has
been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy to a pace that
will allow continued growth without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investors will receive a crucial piece of information
on the economy's strength when the government releases its
employment report for the month of February. The report will
include information on wages and benefits, which should indicate
whether companies are spending heavily to attract and keep
employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at extremely low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 569.20 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 0.43 to
587.92.

<HEADLINE> One dead after police shooting in the Bronx  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A plainclothes officer shot and killed a paroled
drug dealer during a struggle just three blocks from where
immigrant Amadou Diallo was shot to death by officers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were investigating whether the officer fired
intentionally or if his weapon accidentally discharged Wednesday
night. Malcolm Ferguson, who was unarmed, was shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's acquittal of the four officers who shot at Diallo 41
times provoked a wave of antipolice protests throughout the city.
Police said Ferguson himself was detained Friday for resisting
arrest in one of those protests.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference that
the death of Ferguson, 23, was ''a totally different situation''
from the Diallo shooting, even though both cases involved victims
who were unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson had a record -- nine arrests including several on felony
drug charges -- and had fled after being stopped by officers, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had their shields out,'' said Police Commissioner Howard
Safir said today. ''They said, 'Police officers, don't move!'''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found several envelopes of heroin on Ferguson's
body.
</P>
<P>
   News of the shooting initially drew about 100 angry protesters
to the streets, and two people were arrested for allegedly throwing
bottles at officers.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ferguson was one of three men stopped by four
officers with the department's plainclothes Street Narcotics Unit.
He was chased down by Louis Rivera, an officer with 4{ years of
experience and a clean record, Chief of Patrol John Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said the single, fatal shot apparently was fired at
close range because blood was found on Rivera's gun, but it wasn't
immediately known if the shot was intentional or accidental.

<HEADLINE> Welcome Back, Mr. American Pie  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Starry, Starry Night'' -- familiar words from
singer-songwriter Don McLean's ''Vincent'' -- is the name of his
first-ever TV special.
</P>
<P>
   It comes 29 years after two of McLean's songs, ''American Pie''
and ''Vincent'' (about Van Gogh), became huge hits. They remain pop
standards. ''American Pie,'' inspired by Buddy Holly's death, is
currently back on the charts in a version by Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   McLean performs them both on his concert telecast, ''Don McLean:
Starry, Starry Night,'' which airs during the PBS pledge month,
starting March 4 (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always had an avoidance attitude toward fame, my whole
life,'' the 54-year-old McLean says about why he hasn't made a TV
special before. ''I like to let my music be out there. The songs
are me, the best part of me, other than me as a parent maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean and wife Patrisha have a 9-year-old daughter, Jackie, and
7-year-old son, Wyatt. The family lives on a farm in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   McLean leaves home for one-nighters and sings ''American Pie''
at every concert. The reason is simple: People want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job is to entertain people,'' he says. ''There's a lot of
room left to do other things, whatever I feel like.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, McLean hired a new agent, who began pitching a
PBS special. Terry Lickona, who produces ''Austin City Limits,''
got interested, and the show was produced in Austin last Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-hour-40-minute concert was cut to an hour for TV, and
features two guests: Nanci Griffith, and Garth Brooks, who had
McLean as a guest at his big Central Park concert in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Though many think of his music as folk and pop, McLean says he
writes from a personal point of view in a variety of styles. And he
sings a variety of music written by other people. ''I'm always
experimenting,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On the show, he sings his own ''And I Love You So,'' ''Castles
in the Air,'' ''Dreidel'' and ''Fashion Victim,'' a fairly new one.
There's also the blues-rockabilly ''Crying'' by Roy Orbison and ''I
Never Felt More like Singing the Blues,'' a country song that Guy
Mitchell turned into a pop hit. McLean sings it country.
</P>
<P>
   For a 1973 album, McLean slowed down ''Mountains of Mourne,'' an
Irish drinking song by Percy French, and made it a love song. And
he likes the cowboy songs of Marty Robbins. His soon-to-be-released
album, ''Don McLean Sings Marty Robbins,'' will be one gift for
making a pledge to PBS.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, McLean went through rough times. He had to come to
terms with his father's death when he was young. Working
relentlessly caught up with him. He got divorced. ''I just
shattered,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1975 I put myself back together and never looked back.
Rather than feel sorry for yourself all the time, you finally have
to say, 'I'm not going to do this any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, McLean says he's happy. ''I have more than 30 albums in
print. I own my own songs. I work a good deal at a very nice level.
I don't have people telling me I can't do this and shouldn't do
that. I'm the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do about 60 shows a year now. The reason I don't do 150 is,
I don't want to be a machine. Each time I sing, I want to make it
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, McLean says, ''I've done a lot of things I thought
were successful that weren't successful in a business sense. I
achieved what I wanted to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ''I object to arts being turned into sports. My statistics are
not important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't write as much as he used to. Because he has so many
records available, new songs don't seem as necessary as they once
did. His last album of new songs was ''The River of Love'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But McLean senses a good deal of interest in his music now, as
''American Pie'' and ''Vincent'' near their 30th anniversary.
''I've slowly been rising through the decades and not fading,'' he
says. ''And I'm doing less about it than I ever did before.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: HMO Bill Must OK Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he will veto a
bill governing how Americans deal with their health plans if it
does not allow patients to sue HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not sign legislation ... that is a patient's bill of
rights in name only,'' Clinton said at a White House rally timed to
coincide with the attempt in Congress this week to compromise the
touchy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a real patient's bill of rights if it denies people
the right to see a specialist, if it fails to guarantee access to
the nearest emergency room care, if it denies the right to stay
with the health care provider throughout a course of treatment,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He would also veto a bill ''if it doesn't include a strong
enforcement mechanism to hold the health care plan accountable,''
Clinton said. Clinton has long supported a patient's right to sue,
and the ''enforcement mechanism'' translates to the ability to take
health plans to court if the plan denies needed care.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate passed bills that offer patient
protections, but they differ on liability and who would be covered.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, supported by the White House, Democrats and many
Republicans, allows lawsuits and covers 161 million Americans with
private insurance. The Senate bill, crafted by Republicans, doesn't
allow lawsuits and covers 55 million Americans whose health plans
are exempt from state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of House members and senators came to the
White House today to endorse the House approach. A House-Senate
conference hopes to write a compromise bill by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and corporations vehemently oppose a right to sue,
arguing it will raise premiums. They've conducted their own polls
suggesting many workers would lose coverage because companies,
fearing lawsuits, would stop offering health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that he was ''preaching to the saved'' at
today's rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask you to remember that the work is ahead of us. We need to
all of us, each in our own way, go to work to impress upon that
conference committee their profound responsibility,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Encourages Children To Read  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sporting a ''Cat in the Hat'' necktie, Supreme
Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer joined a national reading promotion
Thursday by leading a group of schoolchildren in a special pledge
to read every day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I promise to read each day and each night, I know it's the key
to growing up right,'' he said as 18 third- and fourth-graders from
Watkins Elementary School in Washington repeated the rhyming, Dr.
Seuss-style pledge after him.
</P>
<P>
   ''OK, you're all first-class readers,'' Breyer told the kids.
''That's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The session in the court building's ornate library was part of
the National Education Association's ''Read Across America''
promotion on the birthday of the late Theodor Geisel, author of the
Dr. Seuss books.
</P>
<P>
   With the children sitting on the floor and wearing large
red-and-white Dr. Seuss hats, Breyer read aloud the book
''Marshall, the Courthouse Mouse,'' a story of a court made up of
nine mice ''justices'' deciding a lawsuit over what kind of cheese
the citizens can eat.
</P>
<P>
   The children seemed to like the story, but most of all they
enjoyed hearing about the private gym on the floor above the
Supreme Court's library.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you keep a secret?'' Breyer said. ''You know what's above
this? A basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Oooh!'' the children responded.
</P>
<P>
   And Breyer told the children how he became one of the nine
justices on the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started out at school just like you,'' he said.
''Eventually, I went to law school and then I became a law
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be quite lucky to be a judge. It depends on other
people who think you would be a good judge,'' Breyer said.
''Eventually, I was appointed to this court. ... That's what
happens throughout life. You try to do as well as you can.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley's wife is a German scholar, freewheeling campaigner  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Bill Bradley visited his Princeton
University pal Dan Okimoto in Tokyo in 1970, he brought along a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   With him was Ernestine Schlant, a German-born professor. She was
eight years Bradley's senior. She showed little interest in his
high-profile career in professional basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Things made sense to Okimoto when he and his wife, and Bradley
and Schlant, took a hike along a lake, discussing the comparative
attributes of German and Japanese literature.
</P>
<P>
   ''She would walk two steps ahead, craning her neck to look back
at who was talking,'' Okimoto said. ''I thought wow, this woman is
a powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ernestine, whom he married in 1974, Bradley found a partner
for his passions. In basketball, then in Congress, Bradley looked
for any chance to study and to see the world. In Ernestine, he
chose a wife who grew up in Germany during World War II and, ever
since, has immersed herself in learning.
</P>
<P>
   On the campus of Montclair State University in New Jersey she is
Professor Schlant, author of three books including, most recently,
''The Language of Silence: West German Literature and the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to English and German, she speaks French, passable
Spanish, and Italian ''if I can speak with my hands.'' That's on
top of six years of Latin in school and two years of Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her husband, who can come across as somber, Ernestine
Bradley sometimes seems downright bubbly. She is 64 but barely
suppresses a girlish giggle as an admirer gives her a glowing
introduction. Her knees act like shock absorbers as she throws
herself into a speech.
</P>
<P>
   She is susceptible to the occasional English-as-second-language
malapropism. At one campaign appearance she urged listeners not to
trust ''pollings'' and criticized the Clinton administration's
''don't talk, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Violating a commandment for political spouses, she also confides
in her audience that she disagreed with her husband's decision to
hold a question-and-answer session on foreign policy rather than
deliver a formal address.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not a politician,'' she says later, explaining her
candor, ''so I can be floating around in the idealistic sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley likes to joke, ''My wife says I like strong women,
which means I really love HER.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Ernestine Misslbeck, she grew up in the Bavarian city of
Passau. During the war, a Nazi slave-labor camp operated just two
miles away -- a fact she says she learned years later.
</P>
<P>
   Her late father, Sepp, worked in ground support with the German
air force -- the Luftwaffe -- but was not, she emphasizes, a member
of the Nazi Party. She says he never revealed his thoughts about
the Nazi campaign against the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   There was some concern her roots would be used against her
husband in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked long ago that this might be an issue,'' said
Ernestine Bradley, an American citizen for 37 years. ''Bill does
not think this would be an issue. And frankly I hoped this would
not be an issue, because if it did become an issue, it would show
that people are not voting for Bill, but for my past. I don't think
people would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A job as ''air hostess'' for Pan Am brought Ernestine to the
United States in 1957. At Emory University in Atlanta she earned an
undergraduate degree in Romance languages, then a master's and
doctorate in comparative literature. She also married Robert
Schlant, had a child and divorced. Her daughter from that marriage,
Stephanie, has four children.
</P>
<P>
   An unplanned second course of study at Emory was her personal
history. In discussions with her adviser, a Jewish immigrant, she
learned more about the Holocaust and how close it had come to her
childhood home in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   On subsequent trips back to Germany to visit family -- her ailing
mother, Erna, and a brother, Sepp, still live there -- she asked
questions about the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically,'' she recalled, ''there was a silence.''
</P>
<P>
   So, she embarked on what has become a 35-year academic career
dedicated to learning about the Holocaust. Ten years of work
culminated in the release last February of ''The Language of
Silence.'' In it, she contends that postwar German novelists
skirted the painful issues and memories left over.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of her. Shortly after the U.S.
Holocaust Museum opened in 1993, she toured it along with Rita
Jacobs, a Jewish friend who lost numerous relatives in the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they cried.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was the best person I could go with,'' said Jacobs, who
also is a professor at Montclair State. ''She understood what it
meant.''
</P>
<P>
   On a break from teaching in 1970, Ernestine was working for a
New York documentary production company and living in the same
Manhattan building as Bradley, a star forward for the New York
Knicks. The company asked Schlant to slip a note under his door
proposing that he interview poet Marianne Moore, a sports fan, for
a documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The project was scrubbed when Moore fell ill, but Bradley and
Schlant began dating. They married in 1974. Their daughter, Theresa
Ann, is 23.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, Mrs. Bradley underwent a
mastectomy and chemotherapy and emerged with the belief that in
cancer, too, language has the power to stigmatize. She now tries to
avoid words like ''victim'' or ''survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   And she remains careful with her words when asked to look ahead
to what she would do as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider my situation right now like walking on a
tightrope,'' she said. ''I'm going every day, one step, and I think
if I looked further down that line I'd get dizzy and for sure would
fall.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley and Gore fly overnight to New York  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Al Gore read to a class of 5-year-olds and
Bill Bradley headed for a hot dog restaurant today as the
Democratic presidential hopefuls shifted their campaigns east to
focus on New York's crucial primary next week.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the stakes were especially high after a string of
losses left even some of his supporters predicting his campaign
wouldn't last long past Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley seemed jovial. After a red-eye flight from
California, where the candidates met Wednesday night in a low-key
debate, he joked with reporters about the grueling pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I slept for two hours -- that's all you need for a hot dog
stand,'' Bradley said before his planned visit to meet, greet and
eat at the popular hot dog spot, Gray's Papaya.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards he was flying to Connecticut -- like New York, a state
where the Bradley campaign believes it has a chance to win Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore picked up an informal endorsement from former Vice
President Walter F. Mondale today, and stopped at the Alfred E.
Smith public school to read to children gathered around his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the conviction of one of his supporters for
arranging illegal contributions in 1996 to the Clinton-Gore
campaign and other Democrats, Gore called Maria Hsia ''a friend and
political supporter.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A jury has rendered its verdict. It's a hard day for her,'' he
said, declining further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's state headquarters tried to remain upbeat -- staffers
answered the phone, ''It can happen in New York'' -- Gore's camp
sought victory and launched radio ads Wednesday specifically
tailored to the state's black and Hispanic communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the importance placed on New York, Gore and
Bradley, and Republican contenders George W. Bush and John McCain,
planned to dart in and out of the state over the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's schedule has him campaigning in New York on Friday and
Saturday with Gov. George Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who is running for the U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham
Clinton. McCain was campaigning here tonight and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the state's importance to his campaign, Bradley, who
became famous playing basketball with the New York Knicks, had been
strangely absent since Feb. 23. Instead, he concentrated on
Washington state where he had hoped a strong showing would
rejuvenate his sagging campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He lost badly.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley has backing from Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
former Mayor Edward I. Koch, most of the state's top elected
Democrats and its powerful labor unions are supporting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Three statewide polls Wednesday showed Gore with huge leads over
Bradley. The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion had the
vice president ahead, 61 percent to 29 percent, among likely
Democratic primary voters in New York. At the end of last year,
Bradley was running even with Gore or leading in New York where 243
delegates are at stake next Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, Mondale told WCCO Radio today he promised Gore
his support recently ''and I guess I'm announcing it now.'' The
1984 Democratic nominee plans to appear with Gore in Minnesota next
week.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, where 93 delegates are up for grabs,
statewide polls have shown McCain slightly ahead of Bush or running
even with the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is counting on his statehouse colleague, Pataki, to
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki warned Wednesday that Bush was in for a ''difficult
fight,'' and the governor appeared intent on avoiding blame for a
possible loss. ''Ultimately, it comes down to the candidates,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers delivered
all of New York's GOP delegates to Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, McCain is hoping to make inroads, especially
among the 46 percent of New York's Republican voters who are Roman
Catholic and may be sympathetic to complaints about Bush's visit to
a South Carolina university whose leaders have expressed
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the potential problem with Catholic voters, Bush wrote
an apologetic letter to Cardinal John O'Connor of New York. Bush
also plans to march in a St. Patrick's Day parade Sunday in
Binghamton and visit Canisius College, a Catholic school, in
Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HIAWATHA, Kan. (AP) -- A teen-age boy fatally shot a deputy
sheriff inside a patrol car and fled, sending officers on a
manhunt. The boy later ran out of a wooded area and died in an
exchange of gunfire with officers, the sheriff said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The officers returned fire, and the suspect was shot and
killed,'' said Lamar Shoemaker, Brown County sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy, Todd Widman 21, apparently was shot inside his car
along U.S. Highway 36 about 7 p.m. Wednesday and radioed for help,
Shoemaker said. He was found outside his car and later died at a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 officers from various area law enforcement agencies
converged on the scene, responding to Widman's call. The boy, who
was armed with his own handgun, was found at 9:10 p.m. near the
parking lot of a Wal-Mart store, and fired several shots on
officers before he bolted, Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, the boy was spotted in a field and
authorities cordoned off the area. He came out of the woods nearby
and fired on three officers. Two of them fired back, killing him,
about 9:45 p.m., Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how many shots were fired at the boy or how
many struck him.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was believed to be in his mid-teens, but his identity
was not known, Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   However, The Buffalo News in New York reported in today's
editions that police were trying to verify if it was the
16-year-old son of a Buffalo police lieutenant. The teen's family
reported him missing Tuesday after he fled in the family's car,
reportedly distraught over bad grades.
</P>
<P>
   The News reported that Kansas authorities contacted Buffalo
police early today after learning the gun he was carrying was
registered to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on the phone with New York authorities right now,'' said
Scott Teeselink, a spokesman for the Kansas Bureau of
Investigation. ''I can't confirm it right now, but we're on the
phone trying to confirm those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Widman, a recent high school graduate who was studying criminal
justice at Washburn University, had responded to a call from a
motorist Wednesday night who saw the teen walking along the highway
in Hiawatha. The city is about 10 miles south of the Nebraska
border and about 35 miles west of the Missouri state line.
</P>
<P>
   The motorist apparently believed the boy was a runaway,
Shoemaker said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Widman also worked part time as a process server and at the
Brown County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like losing a friend,'' Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the businesses in the northeast Kansas town closed
because of the unknown nature of the crime that started when Widman
was shot about 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all of course, appalled and saddened by the situation,''
Hiawatha Mayor James Scherer said. ''In a small community like
this, we don't get many murders.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Joseph, Mo., when acting Police Chief Mike Hirter heard
about the incident, he called the Brown County Sheriff's Department
to offer help from his officers.
</P>
<P>
   A St. Joseph officer was shot and killed a little over a year
ago, and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper was slain near St.
Joseph last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very, very hard to put into words how it makes you feel
when something like this happens,'' said Hirter. ''It's just
something that you hope never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 10, 1998, St. Joseph Officer Bradley Arn was killed
during a shooting spree by William Lattin Jr., who was then killed
by another officer.
</P>
<P>
   Last Oct. 6 Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Robert G.
Kimberling was fatally shot by Jason Friske, a Wisconsin man he
stopped near St. Joseph for driving off from a truck stop in
Fausett without paying for gas.
</P>
<P>
   Friske, whose father reported him missing and said he was armed,
delusional and suicidal, took his own life. An alert to be on the
lookout for him reached the highway patrol shortly after Kimberling
was slain.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Part in Selma Walk  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Every year, John Lewis makes a pilgrimage to
Selma, Ala., to recall the 1965 voting rights march where he was
severely beaten. He's a congressman now, a living symbol of
progress on matters of race.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis says he never imagined going back to Selma with a
president.
</P>
<P>
   This year, almost on a lark, Lewis, D-Ga., invited President
Clinton. He says he is still amazed that Clinton agreed to take
part in Sunday's 35th anniversary trek across the Edmund Pettus
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really wanted to come from the moment I mentioned it to
him,'' Lewis said. ''The highest elected official in America paying
tribute, honoring the brave men and women who marched -- it is
unreal, unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is typical of Clinton, whose symbolic actions on civil
rights and race have become a hallmark of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Clinton apologized to five elderly black men who
were subjects of the government's famed Tuskegee syphilis
experiment. Months later, he personally opened the doors of Central
High School in Little Rock, Ark., for the nine black students who
integrated it in the 1950s. Last year, he gave the Congressional
Gold Medal to those same nine people and to Rosa Parks, whose
refusal to surrender her bus seat was a pivotal moment in the drive
that ultimately brought down segregation in public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also bestowed the Medal of Honor on seven black World
War II veterans in 1997 and on a Hispanic Vietnam veteran last
month. He pinned a long-denied fourth star on Gen. Benjamin O.
Davis Jr., the commander of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, in December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also is the first sitting president to tour Africa. He
moves among people of color with such ease that he once jokingly
declared himself the nation's first black president.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what was expected of presidents in the past, and none
of them would do it,'' said Ben Johnson, director of the White
House office on One America, which Clinton established to handle
racial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled he first heard the slang term for racial profiling --
''driving while black'' -- when Clinton uttered it a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tacked the visit to Selma onto the end of a political
fundraising trip to California. Similarly, in 1996, Clinton flew
overnight from California to South Carolina so he could help
rebuild a black church that had been torched by an arsonist.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7, 1965, Alabama state troopers and sheriff's deputies
broke up the attempt by blacks and white integrationists to march
50 miles to the state capitol in Montgomery to protest the denial
of voting rights to blacks in Selma.
</P>
<P>
   The law enforcement officers, some on horseback, used tear gas,
nightsticks and whips. Some blacks retaliated with bricks and
bottles. Among 17 blacks who were hospitalized was Lewis, then the
chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led 1,500 blacks
and whites from throughout the country in another unsuccessful
effort to march to Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to spend the weekend in California. In order to
take part in the Selma reenactment, he will rise before dawn
Sunday, fly to Montgomery, then hop a helicopter to Selma. He'll
stop by the National Voting Rights Museum there, deliver a speech,
then walk across the bridge with Lewis, members of Congress and
other marchers.

<HEADLINE> Swimming hero had to choose between friend, struggling girl  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY BAIR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- In the chaos of a rescue off New Jersey's
beaches, Dominic McClinton had to pick whose life he would save.
</P>
<P>
   He could rescue his friend since boyhood, a 29-year-old
construction worker who had rushed into the Atlantic Ocean after a
struggling girl despite being unable to swim. Or he could save a
9-year-old girl whom he had never met.
</P>
<P>
   McClinton, who was honored Thursday with 18 others for heroism
by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission of Pittsburgh, said his first
instinct was to push Kelly Thomas toward a wall of rocks that
jutted into the water off Atlantic City, N.J., on July 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, McClinton could see that Andre Corbitt was struggling
with the current. He said he could have reached out and touched
Corbitt and was trying to find a way to save both him and the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told her, 'I am going to push you. Swim to the rocks. You
can make it.' She kept saying, 'Mister, please don't let me go.'
She grabbed onto me,'' said McClinton, also 29, of Germantown, Md.,
and an employee of a Hilton in suburban Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The former lifeguard swam about 50 yards to the rocks with the
girl in his arms and was unable to spot Corbitt when he turned
around.
</P>
<P>
   He ran to the end of the rocks in his bare feet, bloodying them,
to try to find Corbitt but believes he was swept away by the strong
evening tide. A second boy who was swimming with Kelly had been
rescued earlier.
</P>
<P>
   McClinton spent summers in Atlantic City with relatives and
friends including Corbitt, of Pleasantville, whose sister he once
dated and whom he often saw at barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a natural reaction to try to help. What people don't
understand is how close the kids were to the shore. The water just
suddenly drops off out there,'' McClinton said. ''(Corbitt)
probably just thought he could walk out there until the water was
up to his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbitt's body was found three days later. He was also honored
Thursday by the Pittsburgh-based commission, which was started in
1904 by industrialist Andrew Carnegie. The heroes or their
relatives each get $3,500 and a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   Honorees included Todd Williams, 32, an oil driller from Port
Burwell, Ontario, Canada. Williams climbed into the cab of a
runaway tractor-trailer and stopped it at the crest of a hill on a
highway near Guelph on Oct. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The rig had been swerving across the road and nearly hit the car
that Williams' sister was driving.
</P>
<P>
   Williams then perched himself on the window of his sister's car
and saw there was no one at the wheel of the truck. The driver,
Edward McCleod, was lying on the floor of the cab, having a fatal
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Williams next persuaded his sister, who called him ''nuts,'' to
speed ahead. He jumped out and ran, grabbed onto a rail on the
truck's body and was briefly dragged alongside at 30 mph before
pulling himself up to the cab.
</P>
<P>
   ''It peeled the bottoms off my boots,'' Williams said Thursday
from Alberta, where he was placing explosives for a new well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lead a thrilling life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was familiar with trucks from a former job in a plywood
yard, so it was no trouble for him to stop McCleod's
tractor-trailer with the brakes. But he was unable to revive the
trucker despite several minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I sat him up, he gasped for air three times. I said,
'Come on, do it again,' but he didn't. Then I threw him into the
sleeper part of his cab. I did CPR on him to the point of
exhaustion,'' Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 48.47; DowUp 0.31  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as investors
took profits from a recent rise in technology stocks, making room
for new issues like the highly anticipated offering from Palm Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 0.31 at 10,138.24.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 48.47 at 4,735.61 after giving up a gain of as much
as 44 points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.81 at
1,374.78.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq slumped despite an explosive initial public offering
from Palm Inc., the spinoff of 3Com Corp. Shares of Palm soared to
103 from its offering price of 38 per share. Parent company 3Com,
which has risen sharply in recent sessions, tumbled 16~ to 87\
today.
</P>
<P>
   Several other prominent technology companies slipped, suggesting
that investors were selling shares of companies that have performed
well this year to raise cash to buy lesser-known names in the
technology and Internet fields.
</P>
<P>
   Radiant Systems, for example, soared 38 5/16 to 93 9/16 after
the company said it will work with Microsoft to develop electronic
commerce systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrials held up better than the technology-heavy
Nasdaq as investors continued to seek out stocks that fell last
week, when the Dow tumbled 357 points.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T led the Dow higher, rising 5 1/16 to 52~.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believe ''enough was enough'' after last week's
pummeling of Dow and other industrial stocks, said Gregory Nie,
technical analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''This
week, volume has picked up and breadth is better, and the market is
trying to rally. That is encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 2 to 92 13/16 and Exxon Mobil, boosted by the
latest spike in oil prices, rose 1 9/16 to 76 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly volatile, indicating that the interest rate
worries responsible for the Dow's plunge last week clearly are
still in the market.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, most leading retail companies reported robust
sales, suggesting Americans are spending freely despite four rate
increases by the Federal Reserve since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. The Fed has
been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy to a pace that
will allow continued growth without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investors will receive a crucial piece of information
on the economy's strength when the government releases its
employment report for the month of February. The report will
include information on wages and benefits, which should indicate
whether companies are spending heavily to attract and keep
employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at extremely low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 817.99 million
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Profit-taking also hurt the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies, which fell 6.11 to 582.24. That index hit a new record
on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Panel: 2 Implant Brands Safe Enough  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Two brands of saline-filled breast
implants should be allowed to stay on the market if women are
properly warned that implants frequently break and leak and that
many patients must undergo repeated operations, a federal advisory
panel says.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration recommended today
that saline implants made by McGhan Medical Corp. of Santa Barbara,
Calif., should stay on the market. The expected vote came a day
after the same panel backed sales of implants made by competitor
Mentor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice for a woman is difficult,'' bioethicist Nancy
Dubler of New York's Montifiore Medical Center acknowledged
Wednesday during a tense 13 hours of testimony and debate on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Mentor's implant failure rates ''alarmingly high,'' Dr.
Stephen Li of New York's Hospital for Special Surgery added: ''It's
amazing to me it seems to be tolerated as just something you have
to live with in these implants.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those criticisms, there is no evidence that any saline
implants cause major diseases. So Li and fellow FDA panelists
balked at taking away women's option to choose Mentor saline-filled
implants as long as they are fully warned of the risks and more
safety tests are performed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the same panel recommended that FDA allow continued sales
of McGhan's competing implants.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but
typically follows them.
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 American women received saline-filled breast
implants last year even though the FDA has never declared these
implants safe: They hit the market before the FDA began regulating
medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA recently decided they can only continue selling if
manufacturers prove they truly are safe, and asked its scientific
advisers to evaluate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen implant recipients, some tearful, told the panel
Wednesday that saline implants are defective and dangerous and
should be banned. Some held up implants removed from their bodies
that were blackened with fungus, and blamed them for causing
infections, excruciating breast pain or repeated surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only fools will call these risks acceptable,'' said Patricia
Faussett of Henderson, Nev., who said her illnesses disappeared
once her implants were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants are most women's only option. In 1992, the FDA
banned use of silicone gel-filled breast implants except for a
small number of women in strict clinical trials. No other implants
are sold in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some breast cancer survivors pleaded with the FDA
on Wednesday to keep the option open, saying implants help their
emotional recovery after a mastectomy. ''It has given me back my
self-esteem and sexuality,'' said Jennifer Gardner of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor studied 1,680 saline implant recipients. Up to 27 percent
of the implants were removed within three years of implantation,
most because patients suffered painful scar tissue, an infection,
or the implant broke and leaked, FDA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Saline implants are highly prone to deflating as the salt water
leaks into patients' bodies, FDA said. Up to 9 percent deflated
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   And up to 40 percent of breast cancer survivors who had implants
needed repeat surgeries, either to remove an implant for good,
replace it with a new or larger one or to remove painfully hardened
spots of breast tissue surrounding the implant, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer patients were at most risk for complications; they
accounted for the 27 percent implant-removal rate. In contrast, 8
percent of implants used for cosmetic breast enlargement in healthy
women were removed in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor blamed the discrepancy on cancer patients' initial poor
health and need for repeated medical tests and treatments that may
stress an implant, and said most recipients are happy with their
implants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We provide a safe and effective option for women,'' Mentor
Vice President Bobby Purkait said.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA noted that the longer all women have implants, the
more likely they are to suffer a side effect.

<HEADLINE> Drug Companies Donate Vaccines  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heeding a White House call, four major drug
companies today donated millions of doses of vaccines to combat
malaria, hepatitis B, polio and other dreaded diseases in Africa
and other troubled regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we're beginning a partnership to eradicate the leading
infectious killers of our time,'' President Clinton said after
meeting with leaders of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
public health foundations and international organizations in the
Cabinet Room.
</P>
<P>
   The donations, valued at more than $150 million, aimed to
accelerate the development of vaccines for troubled countries in
Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said meeting participants agreed to emphasize ''speeding
the delivery of existing vaccines'' and to address the ''lack of
incentive for private industry to invest in new vaccines for people
who simply can't afford to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   The four companies also pledged to step up research and
development on vaccines for HIV/AIDS and malaria. Clinton has
proposed a $1 billion tax credit over 10 years to encourage the
development of such vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious diseases kill more than 8 million children worldwide
and orphan millions more annually. In Africa, 10 times as many
people died from AIDS last year as were killed in wars.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF executive director Carol Bellamy said last month that
AIDS is turning parts of Africa into ''a killing field,'' leaving
11 million orphans, a figure expected to rise to 13 million within
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Today's pledges:
</P>
<P>
   --Merck will donate 1 million doses a year of RECOMBIVAX --HB, a
vaccine to prevent hepatitis B, for five years. The vaccine is
valued at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   --American Home Products Corp. will donate 10 million doses of
Haemophilus influenza type-B conjugate vaccine to UNICEF. Officials
said it should protect more than 3 million children in developing
countries from one of the leading causes of pneumonia and
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   --SmithKline Beecham will expand its malaria vaccine program and
begin vaccine trials in Africa for children, starting in Gambia as
early as next fall.
</P>
<P>
   --Aventis will donate 50 million doses of polio vaccine in Africa
to support the World Health Organization- and UNICEF-led campaign
to eliminate polio in five war-torn African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton directed Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala to convene a meeting of representatives from industry,
government and the academic world to address obstacles to vaccine
development and to strengthen public-private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The president has asked Congress for $150 million for vaccine
research and prevention programs in Africa, where about 2.2 million
people died from AIDS in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In today's meeting, Clinton recognized the $750 million
contribution of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the
vaccine purchase fund of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunization. The president also acknowledged public-private
partnerships such as the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative,
which is investing more than $10 million this year to triple the
number of AIDS vaccine candidates it is moving toward trials.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Helps Air Base Developer  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon will forgive $103 million of debt
owed to the Air Force by the Greater Kelly Development Authority, a
San Antonio-based group that is redeveloping the soon-to-close
Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said
Cohen announced the decision today in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The authority had agreed to pay the Air Force $108 million for
the land and redevelop it as a business park. Using authority
granted by the Congress last year, Cohen erased all but $5 million
of that debt, Bacon said. It is the first time the Pentagon has
used the debt-forgiveness authority.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's decision is intended to make it easier for local
communities with an economic stake in a military base targeted for
closure to convert it to private commercial use. Many such
communities have complained that the process is too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was among a large number of military bases designated for
closure by the federal government in 1995. The 4,700-acre base is a
military depot and was a major employer in the San Antonio area. It
is due to close by 2001. About half of Kelly's land is being
conveyed to the authority, and the other half is being made part of
nearby Lackland Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cohen told Congress that the Pentagon needs
authority to conduct two more rounds of base closures. At the same
time, however, the service chiefs were sounding a less enthusiastic
note.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the smallest service with the fewest number of bases, I
know of no installation that I would recommend be closed in the
Marine Corps,'' Gen. James Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, told
the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said his view
was ''not far'' from Jones's.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said a round of base closings ''probably needs to
happen.'' He is concerned that in opening up a national debate on
how and where to reduce the military's land holdings, the Navy
could end up losing training ranges or access to airspace or the
sea that it cannot afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot give it away or we will never get it back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, said he would
support a new round of base closings. On a ''cautionary footnote,''
he added that the Army needs to decide whether it needs to increase
or decrease its manpower before it can say with certainty what
should be done about consolidating bases.
</P>
<P>
   Among the service chiefs, only Air Force Chief of Staff Gen.
Michael Ryan vigorously advocated more closings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need it badly,'' Ryan said, not just to save money but to
correct a situation in which communities near Air Force bases are
resisting the service's efforts to consolidate forces because they
fear such moves are setting the stage for an eventual base closure.
This has left the Air Force in ''gridlock,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate appearance before the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, Cohen noted that President Clinton's defense budget
for the coming fiscal year asks for authority to make base closings
in 2003 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Those two rounds of base closings would save $3 billion a year,
Cohen said, from 2008 to 2015. That is the time period when huge
bills will come due for some of the weapons modernization projects
now planned, he said. The Defense Department needs the savings from
base closings to help pay those bills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the past three years Cohen pressed for more base
closings and each time Congress said no. There is little indication
that he will succeed this year, either.
</P>
<P>
   The last round of base closings was approved by Clinton and
Congress in 1995. In all, the independent commission created by
Congress recommended closing 79 domestic bases and realigning 26
others, for anticipated savings of $19.3 billion over 20 years. In
the previous three closure rounds in 1988, 1991 and 1993, the
military was ordered to close 250 bases and realign 152 others.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 18.61; Nasdaq Down 9.86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in a volatile session today as
investors took profits from a recent rise in technology stocks but
continued buying blue chips that were battered last week.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 18.61 at 10,156.54.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 9.86 at 4,774.22 after giving up a gain of as much as 44
points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.91 at 1,382.10.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq slumped despite an explosive initial public offering
from Palm Inc., the spinoff of 3Com Corp. Shares of Palm soared to
101 9/16 from its offering price of 38 per share. Parent company
3Com, which has risen sharply in recent sessions, tumbled 16\ to
87~ today.
</P>
<P>
   Several other prominent technology companies slipped, suggesting
that investors were selling shares of companies that have performed
well this year to raise cash to buy lesser-known names in the
technology and Internet fields.
</P>
<P>
   Radiant Systems, for example, soared 30 to 85\ after the company
said it will work with Microsoft to develop electronic commerce
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrials held up better than the technology-heavy
Nasdaq as investors continued to seek out stocks that fell last
week, when the Dow tumbled 357 points.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T led the Dow higher, rising 5{ to 53 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believe ''enough was enough'' after last week's
pummeling of Dow and other industrial stocks, said Gregory Nie,
technical analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''This
week, volume has picked up and breadth is better, and the market is
trying to rally. That is encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 4 3/16 to 135 9/16 and Exxon Mobil,
boosted by the latest spike in oil prices, rose 2 to 76}.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly volatile, indicating that the interest rate
worries responsible for the Dow's plunge last week clearly are
still in the market.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, most leading retail companies reported robust
sales, suggesting Americans are spending freely despite four rate
increases by the Federal Reserve since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. The Fed has
been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy to a pace that
will allow continued growth without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investors will receive a crucial piece of information
on the economy's strength when the government releases its
employment report for the month of February. The report will
include information on wages and benefits, which should indicate
whether companies are spending heavily to attract and keep
employees while the U.S. jobless rate lingers at extremely low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''That report is responsible for a lot of the volatility we're
seeing,'' said Sam Stovall, senior investment strategist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. Many on Wall Street have begun to believe
that a report of lower-than-expected unemployment could spur the
Fed to raise rates even before its next meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some fear of a pre-emptive rate increase,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 966.54 million
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Profit-taking also hurt the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies, which fell 3.20 to 585.15. That index hit a new record
on Wednesday.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Sela Ward wants society to accept aging
women as they are.
</P>
<P>
   That's the goal of her upcoming documentary, ''The Changing Face
of Beauty,'' scheduled to air March 19 on Lifetime Television.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to embrace whatever age we are and own it,'' Ward told
USA Today. ''We live inauthentically and do violence to ourselves
when we lie about how old we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 43-year-old actress, who plays a divorced mother on
ABC's ''Once and Again,'' says she hasn't ruled out having cosmetic
surgery to look younger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that I have the courage not to have plastic
surgery,'' she said. ''The thing for me is not deciding to have it
or not. It's about how we feel inside -- that strong center of
knowing that I'm OK no matter how old or thin I am.''

<HEADLINE> Theater Owner Urges Valentino Oscar  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rudolph Valentino died three years before the
first Academy Awards. That's not stopping theater operator Charlie
Lustman from wistfully talking up the silent-screen star for an
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Lustman ran a rare Valentino flick, ''The Married Virgin,'' at
his Silent Movie Theatre this week, billing it as a premiere that
potentially could qualify for Academy consideration.
</P>
<P>
   However, an Academy rule put in place after Charlie Chaplin won
an Oscar for a 20-year-old film apparently will scuttle Valentino's
shot at a statue.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed a few years before Valentino's breakout role in ''The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'' in 1921, a version of ''The
Married Virgin'' apparently played in very scant release under the
title ''Frivolous Wives'' in the early 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Lustman said he thinks that version may have been substantially
different and its release so limited that the restored print he ran
might fit Oscar guidelines for newly released movies.
</P>
<P>
   Academy rules require that a movie play commercially in a Los
Angeles County theater for seven consecutive days starting no later
than Dec. 31 of the awards year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that Los Angeles rule, Chaplin's 1952 movie
''Limelight'' became eligible for Oscars in 1972. The movie never
played in Los Angeles in its initial limited release but was shown
there when it was reissued 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin and two co-writers won the 1972 Oscar for musical score.
</P>
<P>
   After Chaplin's victory, the Academy added a rule excluding
films shown commercially anywhere in the United States more than
two years before its qualifying seven-day run in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter if was in Los Angeles or Dayton, Ohio. If it
played even a day before that two-year rule, it isn't eligible,''
said Academy historian Patrick Stockstill.
</P>
<P>
   Citations in trade magazines indicate the ''Frivolous Wives''
version of the movie did play briefly in the 1920s, probably
disqualifying ''The Married Virgin'' under Oscar rules, said
Jeffrey Vance, who worked on restoring the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Vance and film preservationist David Shepard began
reconstructing the movie from film obtained from a private
collector. The project was completed by the Royal Film Archive of
Belgium in 1995, the centennial of Valentino's birth. Valentino
died in 1926 of a perforated ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, any discussion of the silent star's Oscar
potential is probably academic. While Valentino does a nice turn as
a villain in the movie and shows signs of the heartthrob he would
become, it's doubtful Academy voters would consider the role
Oscar-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Valentino fans will get a chance to see ''The Married Virgin.''
A video release is planned this summer, Vance said.
</P>
<P>
   Lustman thinks Valentino's performance would stack up against
contemporary nominees'. Valentino plays an Italian count who
blackmails his way into marriage with a tycoon's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Samantha Morton was nominated for supporting actress
this year for a non-speaking role in Woody Allen's ''Sweet and
Lowdown,'' Valentino's performance might be equally deserving,
Lustman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Valentino would be a strong contender,'' Lustman said.
''There's a lot of facial expressions in this picture that are
really moving. Why shouldn't he be considered?''

<HEADLINE> Californians could know New York outcome before primary pollsclose  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Because of the time difference, Californians
may see balloons falling, banners waving and supporters cheering
for one or another of the presidential candidates in New York
before primary polls even close in the Golden State next week.
</P>
<P>
   What has been a quadrennial general election concern in
presidential races has surfaced eight months early this time around
because of the March 7 Super Tuesday primaries. In New York,
primary polls close at 9 p.m. local time. In California, the
polling places shut their doors at 8 p.m. Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   That two-hour time difference could have an impact on Democrats
Al Gore and Bill Bradley and Republican George W. Bush and John
McCain, according to pollsters and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole Northeast becomes more significant,'' said pollster
Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   ''It has a dampening effect'' on the West Coast vote, said
California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who recently abandoned
Bush in favor McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to New York and California, the March 7 primary
lineup includes the New England states of Maine, Massachuetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut and Vermont as well as Ohio, Maryland,
Georgia and Missouri. All are in the Eastern time zone except for
Missouri which is in the Central time zone.
</P>
<P>
   That two-hour difference between poll closings in New York and
California had the Gore camp trying to figure out this week whether
it would be better for their California chances to have the vice
president in New York on March 7 -- they hope with celebrating
supporters -- or on the other coast.
</P>
<P>
   California's Jones has been a leader in the unsuccessful battle
to get the television networks to stop using exit poll results to
declare winners in eastern states while West Coast polls are still
open.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, then-President Jimmy Carter conceded defeat to former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan an hour before polls closed in
Reagan's home state. Even before that, the TV networks had
proclaimed Reagan's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Among pollsters, the impact of exit poll information is a
subject of some debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they start coloring in the map with one color and it's
McCain's or Bush's, it has a value,'' Marist's Miringoff said.
''The talk of the evening becomes that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 80's when Carter conceded, that probably hurt
Democratic chances (in California), but I don't think there's any
clear-cut cases that this makes a big difference,'' Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center and president of the National
Council on Public Polls, said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Kohut said the media has a responsibility to report the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who wins New York is an important fact and it's certainly
worthy of reporting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican consultant Jay Severin said the biggest impact could
be on McCain and Bradley because they are viewed as insurgents who
appeal to non-traditional primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have a big effect, especially among people who are
not hard-core voters ... They may stay home if they think it
doesn't matter,'' Severin said.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Miringoff said that despite the debate over whether or
not the early results can effect voting in the West, ''I've never
seen any politician not want to win early.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a reason they all want to be on the six o'clock news
saying how things are going their way,'' Miringoff said. ''This
would be much more convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have a knockout punch for say Bush, it could have an
impact in California,'' Nelson Warfield, who served as Bob Dole's
1996 presidential campaign press secretary, said. ''The calendar
has always been a big ally of George W. Bush, now maybe the clock
is too.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to recent polls, it could be Gore who has the
clock advantage, if there is one. Polls show him leading former New
York Knicks basketball star Bradley by a wide margin in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, recent polls indicate Bush and McCain
are locked in a tight race in New York. Also, in New York, there is
no popular vote for Republican candidates and ballots are cast only
for prospective convention delegates. That could slow down the
process of determining a winner in New York, and keep potential
California Republican primary voters in the dark for that extra two
hours.

<HEADLINE> US Eyes Anti-Money Laundering Laws  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is asking Congress
for broad new powers to fight money laundering, including the
authority to ban financial transactions between offshore financial
havens and U.S. banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is seeking to tighten anti-money-laundering
laws in an effort to stanch the flow of billions of dollars from
drug trafficking and other criminal activities through the U.S.
financial system. Money laundering came under the public spotlight
last summer, when federal authorities said the Bank of New York,
one of the country's largest banks, had served as a conduit for
about $7 billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers named
specific countries as leading sources or destinations of illicit
money in a speech Thursday outlining the new legislative proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money laundering risks undermining the integrity of our
financial system,'' Summers told an audience of bankers and
securities industry executives. ''When dirty money finds its way
into American banks, the reputations of all involved suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering around the globe is estimated to absorb nearly
$600 billion annually, or up to 5 percent of the world's gross
domestic product. Profits from drug trafficking, prostitution and
other criminal activities are moved through a series of bank or
brokerage accounts to make them appear to be proceeds of legitimate
business activity.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Summers identified Russia, Colombia and Nigeria
as among the biggest sources of illicit money, and the Caribbean
islands of Dominica and Antigua, Nauru in the South Pacific and
Liechtenstein in Europe as some of the leading money-laundering
centers.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny island of Nauru, for example, has become a popular
refuge for money flowing out of Russia, and Russian mobsters have
taken advantage of its lax financial rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Colombia, Antigua and Nauru are working with the United
States to tighten their financial laws, but the Russian government
''has still not enacted meaningful reforms,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   In the new proposal, the Treasury Department is seeking the
power to ask U.S. financial institutions to collect data on all
kinds of transactions with an offshore bank or financial company.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where foreign governments shield banks from
investigation, Treasury wants the authority to cut them off from
the U.S. financial system without seeking congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the House Banking Committee liked the
administration's proposal so much they said Thursday they would
co-sponsor it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would provide the federal government ''with more
flexible and effective tools than those offered under existing
law'' to fight money laundering, Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach,
R-Iowa, and its senior Democrat, Rep. John LaFalce of New York,
said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Leach and LaFalce proposed a stricter measure that
would have required U.S. banks to collect detailed information on
their customers from countries considered to be money-laundering
havens. The administration's proposal would leave it up to Treasury
to decide whether to impose data-collecting requirements on
particular banks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' proposal had been opposed by the banking
industry. Groups representing the banking and securities industries
had no immediate comment Thursday on the administration's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Clinton proposal is ''a
good first step but it doesn't go far enough'' because it gives
Treasury discretion to decide whether to take actions rather than
requiring they be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diplomacy usually prevails over the domestic need to curb
money laundering,'' Schumer said in a telephone interview. He and
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have proposed their own
money-laundering legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Summers noted in his speech that Treasury officials already have
begun informing U.S. banks about foreign banks or nations that
repeatedly refuse to abide by generally accepted standards to
protect against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Treasury unveiled its first national
money-laundering strategy, a package of proposed new laws and rules
that include requirements that storefront check cashers, brokerage
firms and casinos notify authorities of suspicious activities the
way banks are required to do.
</P>
<P>
   That package, and the new proposals outlined by Summers, will be
submitted to Congress in the coming weeks.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The family of a New Jersey newlywed killed
in a bombing linked to Gen. Augusto Pinochet said Thursday they are
dismayed but not surprised that the British government has released
the former Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate, I think, from the world's point of view ...
it would be good for dictators who murder people for no reason to
have some fear of God put in them,'' Murray Karpen said from his
home in West Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Karpen's daughter, Ronni Karpen Moffitt, was killed 23 years ago
in Washington, D.C., in a car bombing that also killed her boss,
former Chilean Cabinet official Orlando Letelier, a prominent
Pinochet critic.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was freed Thursday after 16 months in custody after
Britain ruled the 84-year-old was mentally unfit to stand trial on
charges of human rights abuses. Spain, Belgium and France sought to
extradite him for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not yet decided whether to seek
extradition, the Justice Department said Thursday. The U.S.
government in the summer asked Chile to supply information on the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is expected to return to Chile, where his opponents
seek a trial. A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were
murdered or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police,
but opponents say the number is far higher.
</P>
<P>
   Karpen, 71, said he doubted the opponents will prevail: ''He'll
live out his years in peace. No one else will have any peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his son, Harry S. Karpen, 47, said they expected the
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to be a road that Britain didn't want to go down,''
the younger Karpen said from his Clifton law office. He noted that
the extradition of a former head of state from another country
could pose risks for other leaders who traveled abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he is angry that the man many believe responsible for
his older sister's death is unlikely to be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at what Britain has done: Using humanitarian grounds for
someone who has never shown humanity,'' he said. ''Just because a
killer has gotten old and infirm, doesn't mean he's eligible for
special privileges''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Moffitt's widower and Letelier's widow, Samuel J.
Buffone, said they are convinced the Washington bombing -- within a
mile of the White House -- went higher than the two secret police
leaders now serving prison terms in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's incomprehensible to us that something of the magnitude of
an assassination in the United States, given the relationship
between the U.S. and Chile, could have been carried out without
Pinochet's active involvement,'' Buffone said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was considered an American ally during the Nixon
administration because he opposed communism.
</P>
<P>
   Buffone's clients seek a ''full and fair trial'' of Pinochet,
preferably in the United States, and have no private claims
pending, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moffitt's widower, Michael Moffitt of Princeton, was riding with
his wife and Letelier on Sept. 21, 1976, but survived the explosion
and later remarried.
</P>
<P>
   He did not immediately return a message left with his lawyer
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ronni Moffitt was 25 when she died, just four months after her
marriage in the back yard of her family home, then in Passaic, her
father said. She had just been promoted to fund-raiser from
secretary at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, where
Letelier was based, Karpen said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet stepped down after 17 years as Chile's leader in 1990.
He was arrested Oct. 16, 1998, while getting medical treatment in
London on a warrant issued by a Spanish investigating judge.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Alcohol Sales Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee approved legislation
Thursday to give state prosecutors more weapons to combat illegal
interstate alcohol sales. Lawmakers first made changes to meet the
concerns of small wineries and Internet sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, endorsed by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a
voice vote, permits the attorney general of a state to file in
federal court for an injunction to stop illegal shipments of
alcohol into the state.
</P>
<P>
   Direct interstate shipments of alcohol ''are increasing
exponentially,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the
committee and sponsor of the legislation. States need to protect
their citizens from consumer fraud, receive their rightful tax
revenues and ''ensure that minors are not provided with unfettered
access to alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the ability to go to federal court, state prosecutors
say they have trouble pursuing charges against out-of-state
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies have voiced concern that the bill could
restrict electronic commerce, and small wineries have viewed it as
a threat to the fast-growing Internet portion of their business.
Direct sales by phone or the Internet now account for an estimated
$500 million of the $17 billion industry, and are crucial to small
wineries with limited marketing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch sought to ease some of the concerns by amending his bill
to make clear that injunctions would be allowed only if a person is
or has been engaged in an act that violates state law. He also
added language stating that the bill does not conflict with the
moratorium on Internet taxation and that Internet providers would
not be subject to injunctive action as a result of users selling
alcohol illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who had previously opposed the
bill, also got Hatch to incorporate language making clear that no
court can enforce a state law that is unconstitutionally
protectionist and discriminates against out-of-state sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Institute, based in San Francisco, said the new version
was an improvement over a bill the Senate passed last year. The
institute, in a statement, said it was important to note that the
bill ''would not in any way impact the direct shipment of wine in
the 20 states that allow interstate shipments or the 30 states that
allow intrastate shipments from wineries or retailers directly to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition-lifting 21st Amendment to the Constitution gives
the states the right to regulate the sale and transport of alcohol
across state borders and many states strictly control shipments,
requiring producers to go through wholesalers. The Internet allows
wineries to bypass wholesalers and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The House last year passed a similar bill sponsored by Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla. The Senate attached its alternative as an
amendment to a juvenile crime bill that failed to emerge from a
House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is S. 577.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Helps Developer With Debt  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon will forgive $103 million of debt
owed to the Air Force by the Greater Kelly Development Authority, a
San Antonio-based group that is redeveloping the soon-to-close
Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said
Cohen announced the decision today in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The authority had agreed to pay the Air Force $108 million for
the land and redevelop it as a business park. Using authority
granted by the Congress last year, Cohen erased all but $5 million
of that debt, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time the Pentagon has used this authority to
modify an existing agreement. Bacon said he could not say how often
it would be used in the future. ''We'll use it as aggressively as
we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's decision is intended to make it easier for local
communities with an economic stake in a military base targeted for
closure to convert it to private commercial use. Many such
communities have complained that the process is too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was among a large number of military bases designated for
closure by the federal government in 1995. The 4,700-acre base is a
military depot and was a major employer in the San Antonio area. It
is due to close by 2001. About half of Kelly's land is being
conveyed to the authority, and the other half is being made part of
nearby Lackland Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cohen told Congress that the Pentagon needs
authority to conduct two more rounds of base closures. At the same
time, however, the service chiefs were sounding a less enthusiastic
note.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the smallest service with the fewest number of bases, I
know of no installation that I would recommend be closed in the
Marine Corps,'' Gen. James Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, told
the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said his view
was ''not far'' from Jones's.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said a round of base closings ''probably needs to
happen.'' He is concerned that in opening up a national debate on
how and where to reduce the military's land holdings, the Navy
could end up losing training ranges or access to airspace or the
sea that it cannot afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot give it away or we will never get it back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, said he would
support a new round of base closings. On a ''cautionary footnote,''
he added that the Army needs to decide whether it needs to increase
or decrease its manpower before it can say with certainty what
should be done about consolidating bases.
</P>
<P>
   Among the service chiefs, only Air Force Chief of Staff Gen.
Michael Ryan vigorously advocated more closings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need it badly,'' Ryan said, not just to save money but to
correct a situation in which communities near Air Force bases are
resisting the service's efforts to consolidate forces because they
fear such moves are setting the stage for an eventual base closure.
This has left the Air Force in ''gridlock,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate appearance before the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, Cohen noted that President Clinton's defense budget
for the coming fiscal year asks for authority to make base closings
in 2003 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Those two rounds of base closings would save $3 billion a year,
Cohen said, from 2008 to 2015. That is the time period when huge
bills will come due for some of the weapons modernization projects
now planned, he said. The Defense Department needs the savings from
base closings to help pay those bills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the past three years Cohen pressed for more base
closings and each time Congress said no. There is little indication
that he will succeed this year, either.
</P>
<P>
   The last round of base closings was approved by Clinton and
Congress in 1995. In all, the independent commission created by
Congress recommended closing 79 domestic bases and realigning 26
others, for anticipated savings of $19.3 billion over 20 years. In
the previous three closure rounds in 1988, 1991 and 1993, the
military was ordered to close 250 bases and realign 152 others.

<HEADLINE> Red-Hot Parisian Fall Fashion  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON, AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A red-hot Parisian, beret and all, is how Sonia
Rykiel sees winter.
</P>
<P>
   Her ready-to-wear collection, shown Thursday, featured models
strutting in layered, wide jersey trouser suits with tunics and
shawls, in tomato red as well as shocking pink, bright acid green
and turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   Striking multicolored striped sweaters with a panel on one
sleeve and bright plaid wide-trousered outfits with nubby wool
jackets were upbeat and fetching. The heavy-knit long beige coat
with a cloche, plus bright pink metallic stiletto shoes looked like
a modern comeback of the ''Roaring Twenties.''
</P>
<P>
   A few tributes to Miss Rykiel's favorite black came out in
sequined dresses, nearly-nude net numbers with bikini pants and a
bias-cut black and white satin gown.
</P>
<P>
   A fake fur spotted pantsuit was out of tune with the usual
Rykiel style, but fit the current mood here.
</P>
<P>
   In this season of glitz and logo-mania, Rykiel didn't hesitate
to put her name in spangles on some pretty, bright sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenzo collection by Gilles Rosier had something for
everyone, from biker pants to folklore galore.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful result was a success for Rosier. He took over for
Kenzo, who decided to retire for other pursuits. Rosier had worked
several years for Kenzo and understands the philosophy: fun,
picturesque clothes that will sell.
</P>
<P>
   The silhouette this time had its Japanese touch, with wide
obi-style hip belts in leather or satin.
</P>
<P>
   In dresses, tights and long or abbreviated trousers,
animal-stripe and spotted prints abound, and even look good with
wispy chiffon outfits.
</P>
<P>
   An idea: pants split at the hip to show what's underneath,
whether a patch pattern of sequins on the thigh or a crochet
bodysuit.
</P>
<P>
   Blazing colors from turquoise to pink came out in full long
skirts, but sequined moments were rare, though seen in sparkly
motifs on a bosom under a tuxedo jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Gaultier's collection should be a commercial success,
despite his showtime gimmick. He stuffed over 1,000 people into an
ancient firetrap dance hall, the Salle Wagram, to watch models
smoking as they paraded to a voice telling them ''Smoking is bad
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The show had an Andes air to it, with some big shawl wraps,
beautiful short or high boots, and little brimmed trilby hats in
all colors.
</P>
<P>
   The girls in slinky skirts, bright tights and high heels also
looked like ''Paris Apaches,'' that avant-garde set from the
Thirties, sometimes adorned with furs on their jacket or coat
collars.
</P>
<P>
   Great lean leather pants in every autumnal shade, from chocolate
to khaki green or sienna, came out topped with neat boleros, long
sweaters in luminous knits or trench coat styles. Dressy tops in
light fabrics went well with the super hard-edge pants.
</P>
<P>
   The touch of class? In furs and smooth leathers in colors like
burnt orange or sienna.
</P>
<P>
   Some complained that Gaultier had abandoned his wild and crazy
ways with Madonna-style corsets and other skin-baring fare.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a costume party, but a fine collection from the
fashion upstart-turned couturier.
</P>
<P>
   The team designing for Guy Laroche turned in an honorable
effort. A leather teal-blue suit with a low waist and skirt below
the knee looked salable if not exactly world-shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting here were the true leathers and leather-like
synthetics with patterns like circular mosaics, in colors from
black to butterscotch and caramel. Mohair and taffeta in a fitted
light beige coat looked attractive with swirly patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes in the intriguing, supple fabrics were easy to wear,
and well cut. But a big name like Guy Laroche might look for a guru
to give more pizzaz to the collections.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Farmers' Insurance Cut  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators from the Plains states pushed
legislation through a committee Thursday that would sharply reduce
the premiums that farmers pay for federally subsidized crop
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which is similar to legislation approved by the
House last year, would likely cost taxpayers at least $1.5 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee split along regional lines in
approving the bill 10-8, as some southern and northeastern members
complained that it wouldn't do enough for farmers in their states.
The insurance is most popular on the Great Plains, where farmers
are especially vulnerable to drought and hail. Many producers in
the East and South say the policies aren't worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's supporters insisted it will help farmers
everywhere in the country by making the coverage more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers ''want a crop insurance system that works and provides
an adequate return on their investment,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts, a
Kansas Republican who cosponsored the bill with Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   The government currently pays from 13 percent to 57 percent of a
farmers' premium, depending on the level of coverage. Under the
Senate bill, the government's share would range from 45 percent to
60 percent. Under the House measure, the government would pay from
31 percent to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures also would improve coverage for farmers who have
had a series of losses and expand coverage to more specialty crops.
But the Senate legislation omits a provision sought by southern
lawmakers that would allow grower cooperatives to sell the policies
in competition with insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills are in line with what the Agriculture Department has
suggested Congress do.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate committee, Indiana Republican Richard
Lugar, held up the legislation for months, warning that deep cuts
in premiums would encourage farmers to step up production of crops
that are already in surplus.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed to give cash directly to farmers to spend as they
choose, but he was unable to muster much support for his idea on
the committee. The bill approved by the committee did little to
help farmers on the east or west coasts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress agreed to set aside $6 billion in 2001
through 2004 for improving the insurance system. That spending
authority could end, however, if the insurance legislation is not
passed by the time Congress revises its budget plan later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Farm groups are pushing lawmakers to finish work on the bill
before the money is spent on other purposes. ''There's $6 billion
sitting out there. We're afraid someone is going to nab it,'' said
Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.

<HEADLINE> Census Director: U.S. Is Changing  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first big run of census forms being
delivered Friday, Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt says this
year's survey will document a dramatic change in the country's
make-up and show that America is on its way to becoming a
''microcosm of the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, he urged
people to fulfill ''a civic duty'' and complete the forms, ensuring
a more accurate snapshot of America in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more people on the move, more people in irregular
housing, a higher percentage of foreign born and more disinterest,
more cynicism, more disengagement,'' Prewitt said. ''So if we can
actually turn it around, I think it will be a serious and big
story.''
</P>
<P>
   The first forms are being hand-delivered to rural households.
Getting responses is the key, Prewitt said, whether by mail or --
for the first time this year -- through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mail response rates have declined from 78 percent of households
in 1970 to 70 percent in 1980 and 65 percent in 1990. Census
officials estimate that rate will dip to 61 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau launched a $167 million advertising campaign
last year, the first time it has paid to promote the census. That
effort, combined with a more aggressive outreach to traditionally
undercounted minority populations, has Prewitt optimistic the
response rate will increase despite more apathy and concerns over
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt is so confident, in fact, that he wagered a pessimistic
friend $25 that the response rate will go up. ''And the check goes
to a charity,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the message of confidentiality cannot finally be
carried by just some government bureaucracy,'' he said. ''The only
people who can really make that message are people that they trust,
like their ministers, schoolteachers, and community advocates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau already has forecast that the number of
foreign-born will more than double between now and 2050, from 26.0
million to 53.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, he said, is the first country in history
''which is going to have to reinvent itself as a microcosm of the
entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   To account for the diversity, this year's census allows people
to indicate if they are of more than one race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents charge that may water down the power of minority
groups because those who consider themselves multiracial will not
be statistically counted as, for instance black and white, but be
placed in a separate multiracial category.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is turning a corner in terms of how it's going to
deal with itself along racial categories, and the Census Bureau is
simply a reflection of that,'' Prewitt said. ''The people who have
that as their experience don't want to be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said this year's census has become the most scrutinized
and politicized ever. Census data is used for redrawing political
boundaries as well as redistributing billions of dollars in federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau must compile two sets of data -- one from raw
numbers, a second that is statistically-sampled -- for release to
the states.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 Supreme Count decision mandated that the federal
government use non-sampled data for the purposes of redistributing
aid. States will determine which set of numbers to use for drawing
new political lines.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials estimate 1.6 percent of the population, mostly
minorities and inner-city residents who tend to vote Democrat, were
undercounted in 1990, and Prewitt said sampling methods provide
more accuracy. Republicans fearing unfavorable redrawings of
district lines oppose sampling.
</P>
<P>
   But Prewitt said the political battle will matter little if
people do not do their ''civic responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It drives big money, power, reapportionment, redistricting,
and private investment. It has consequences,'' Prewitt said. ''You
have to make a proactive statement that you care enough about your
country, yourself and your community to fill out the form and send
it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt attributes the decline in mail response rates as well as
voter participation rates to the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. While
the political process was opening up to women and minorities, they
grew disillusioned by the Vietnam War, riots in cities and
Watergate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't give them a civic life or political life that they
could be proud of, committed to, or engaged with, because at the
same time you were struggling with this bad patch in American
politics,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we had another bad patch, obviously in the issues
surrounding the Clinton administration, and that was a bad patch in
terms of confidence and so forth.''

<HEADLINE> Russian mob allegedly joined Italian crime families in stockscheme  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Russian mobsters teamed up with four Italian
organized crime families in New York to infiltrate Wall Street in a
stock scam that earned them up to $60 million in profits,
authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual combination of forces led to millions in profits
before the FBI stumbled upon documents in a storage locker that
revealed the large-scale stock fraud and money laundering plot,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year probe culminated in an indictment unveiled Thursday
in Brooklyn. In all, 19 people were charged, including six alleged
mobsters or associates of crime families, all of them accused of
participating in the scheme between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those charged had been captured earlier in a similar
prosecution in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. That case involved
stock manipulation by small brokerage houses protected by the mob.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch said the case ''illustrates the
continuing relationship of organized crime in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The mob, she said, ''sought to extend its reach into the lives
of ordinary citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she estimated the scheme made at least $40 million in
illegal profits, Lewis Schiliro, the FBI's assistant director in
charge of the New York office, said actual profits could easily
exceed $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   He said the case proved once again that Italian organized crime
families, closed off from traditional avenues of income through
aggressive prosecutions, had looked elsewhere for new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ''A recurrent theme in our investigations has been that the mob
goes where the money is,'' he said. ''We intend to be there when
they get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian gangsters used their expertise in money laundering
and offshore bank accounts while the New York mob families lent
their skills at muscling their way to money through threats and
intimidation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities refused to divulge exactly how the organized crime
families protected the scheme or if anyone was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said help from the mob was welcomed by two now-defunct
brokerage firms in downtown Manhattan -- White Rock Partners &AMP; Co.
and State Street Capital Markets Corp.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, top executives at the two companies
joined other brokerage firms and brokers to create fraudulent
securities schemes and then launder tens of millions of dollars of
illicit profits.
</P>
<P>
   The firms allegedly acquired control of tiny companies by
quietly buying enough stock in them, then artificially boosted
their value by paying unscrupulous brokers to persuade unwitting
investors that they should buy stock in the same companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the stock value rose six or seven points, the firms cashed
in by selling their secretly held shares, causing the value of the
stocks to plummet, the indictment alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The profits were laundered by transferring money several times
through off-shore bank accounts until it had the appearance of
having been legitimately earned.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said one company whose securities were manipulated by the
mob was essentially dormant until it became part of the scheme.
Three companies, she said, were listed on the NASDAQ exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Among those indicted in the case were a captain in the Bonanno
crime family, a soldier in the Genovese family, an associate in the
Colombo family and an associate and a soldier in the Gambino
family.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said the companies who solicited help from the mob
learned over time that organized crime had become part of their
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they're in, they're in for good,'' Schiliro said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Vaccine Donations  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday he will work
to get more money for vaccines and drug research at home and abroad
to ''eradicate the leading infectious killers of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The president welcomed leaders of pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, public health foundations and
international organizations to the White House, where he announced
the private sector donation of millions of doses of vaccines. The
drugs will go to fight malaria, hepatitis B, polio and other
diseases that kill more than 1 million people each year, mostly in
the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we're building a partnership to eradicate the leading
infectious killers of our time,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Four major drug companies also pledged to speed research and
development on vaccines for HIV/AIDS and malaria. Clinton has
proposed a $1 billion tax credit over 10 years to encourage the
development of such vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very important beginning,'' Clinton said. ''It will
save lives and make it clear we're serious. But all of us agree
there is more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appealed for support in Congress for his tax credit
plan, as well as funding increases for the National Institutes of
Health. He also wants $50 million toward a global vaccine bank, and
more loans from the World Bank devoted to improving health in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton said he will ask America's economic allies to make
similar commitments when he attends the G-8 summit in Okinawa,
Japan in July.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious diseases kill more than 8 million children worldwide
and orphan millions more annually. In Africa, 10 times as many
people died from AIDS last year as were killed in wars.
</P>
<P>
   Although sub-Saharan Africa contains a tenth of the world's
population, the region is home to 70 percent of those infected with
the AIDS virus worldwide, and 13 million children there have lost
one or both parents to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A persistent problem in fighting AIDS and other diseases in the
Third World is the lack of a profit motive for drug companies,
since the very poor cannot afford vaccines that are extremely
costly to develop and manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting in the Cabinet Room was intended to draw
attention to that problem, and to solutions that do not necessarily
involve government.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates Sr., father of the Microsoft billionaire, attended
Thursday's meeting in the Cabinet Room because the Gates family
foundation has donated $750 million to help buy vaccines for poor
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a 21st century problem we have what I think is, for the
first time, a 21st century solution,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said after attending the meeting, ''the coming together of
governments, of the private sector, of the philanthropic foundation
community to address this common problem.''

<HEADLINE> Archivists Try To Salvage Records  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Archivists are using hot air and blotting
paper to salvage hundreds of thousands of pages of government
records damaged in a fire at a National Archives storage center
just outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The fire occurred Tuesday at the Washington National Records
Center in Suitland, Md., which stores more than 3.7 million cubic
feet of records. Archives officials said 3,000 cubic feet of
records were stored in areas where sprinklers activated, but fewer
than 300 cubic feet -- approximately 700,000 pages -- were actually
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the records were from the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are inactive files of deceased veterans who previously
made claims for benefits,'' said Robert Knode, records officer for
the veterans benefits administration. ''Sometimes we recall these
files when somebody wants a copy for genealogical or other
purposes, but there should be only a minimal effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the records were from District of Columbia
government offices, Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Labor
Department's hour and wage division and the U.S. Patent and
Trademark office. The patent and trademark records were scheduled
for disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret the loss of a single page, but we're not sure yet
what the loss is,'' said Gerald George, communications director for
the archives. ''We have some record damage and we regret that, but
on the other hand, our fire system contained the fire so that it
didn't do widespread damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation work is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, dry air is being blown into the storage stacks and
blotting paper is being used to extract moisture from pages, said
Susan Cooper, a spokeswoman for the archives. Drying chambers have
been set up and refrigerated trucks are being used to store records
that are very wet.
</P>
<P>
   ''They keep the records cold to prevent mildew from forming on
them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Considers Education IRAs  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring a veto threat, the Senate moved
closer Thursday to passing a bill that would expand tax-free
savings accounts for elementary and secondary school education,
including private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, most of whom oppose the measure, tried to add several
amendments, including an unsuccessful attempt to spend $1.7 billion
to train and recruit more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Senators were expected to tackle several other Democratic
amendments throughout the evening and hoped to vote late Thursday.
Pending proposals include measures to force the Senate to commit to
a timetable to act on gun control -- a response to this week's
shooting of a 6-year-old girl at a Michigan school and a provision
to increase federal money for Pell grants which go to needy college
students.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the underlying battle over the bill stemmed from concerns
by Democrats that the education accounts will hurt public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill is going to shortchange our public schools,'' said
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. ''When we say we're going to provide
our citizens with an option, the option is more or less to abandon
the public school systems, particularly in our urban centers which
are struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that the time for education accounts' had
come, and accused Democrats of trying to dilute the measure with
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main effect (of the amendments) is to cancel the education
savings account,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., and chief
sponsor of the bill along with Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of
New Jersey. ''You're saying to 14 million American families, 'Sorry
Charlie, we're not going to let you create an education savings
account.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would also make savings in prepaid tuition plans
tax free and expand tax breaks for employer-provided educational
assistance, is a mainstay of the Republican agenda for improving
K-12 education.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has not yet come up in the House, where its
prospects are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Education savings accounts have existed since 1997 to help
families save for college, but Republicans want parents to have the
option of using the funds to pay for secondary and elementary
education also.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is opposed by teachers unions, and President Clinton
vetoed a similar bill in 1998. He said the benefits mainly go to
richer families and that the plan would drain money away from the
public school system. Last year, education savings accounts were
part of the Republican's $792 billion tax cut plan that the
president vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are really fundamentally asking ourselves how we can
improve education, it's not through a tax credit. ... It's
investing in teachers in our public schools,'' said Sen. Jack Reed,
D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The Coverdell-Torricelli bill would increase the contribution
level from the current $500 to $2,000 and allow the tax-free
earnings to be used for expenses, including transportation and
tutors, associated with any school -- public, private or parochial --
from kindergarten through the 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans added provisions to raise the income levels a
married couple could earn and still participate in the program from
a $160,000 maximum to $220,000. Lawmakers also passed a proposal by
Delaware Sen. William Roth, the Finance Committee chairman, to
allow the budget surplus to pay for the proposal, estimated to cost
less than $10 billion over 10 years. Roth's amendment also makes
the program permanent; it was originally scheduled to last until
2003.

<HEADLINE> Campaign finance advocate says PACs aren't the problem  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Connecticut congressman who once advocated
banning PAC money in federal campaigns took donations from
political action committees in the last election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, a seven-term Republican, said he changed
his mind because ''I found out PACs weren't where the problem
was.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that he never promised to forswear PAC money
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Shays said, is ''soft money'' -- unregulated
donations to political parties -- and so-called ''issue
advertisements'' paid for by special interest groups but clearly
aimed at supporting or damaging a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not accepting any support from soft money and I have never
been part of an issue advertising campaign. If people did them for
me I would ask them to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent in the GOP primary, high school teacher Jim
Campbell, said Shays has ''broken his word and violated our
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays, who represents Connecticut's 4th District, was a lead
sponsor of a 1996 sweeping campaign finance reform measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have banned PAC contributions, created voluntary
spending limits, limited lobbyist contributions and banned soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   A later version of the bill would have limited PAC contributions
to the same amount as individual contributions, $1,000 per
election. Now PACS can give up to $5,000 per election.
</P>
<P>
   The current version focuses mainly on soft money and issue
advertisements. That measure passed the U.S. House of
Representatives in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When the legislation banning PACS was pending, Shays said he
felt he clearly needed to make a point in his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But in the course of participating in debates on campaign
finance he said he became convinced that PACS were nothing more
onerous than a group of like-minded people coming together around
an issue.
</P>
<P>
   From July to the end of December 1999 Shays accepted $2,279 from
four political action committees, including a group that supports
pro-choice Republicans and an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the $178,794.05 he raised that period was from
individual donors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., Shays' campaign finance reform
co-sponsor, said he promised never to take PAC money. He says he
agrees with Shays that PACs are not the real problem, in part
because ''it's easy to trace where the PAC money comes from.''

<HEADLINE> In New York, Gore reads to children, Bradley plays serves hot dogs  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Beneath a colorful alphabet board, Vice
President Al Gore drew a lesson on loyalty Thursday from ''A Friend
for Little Bear,'' before excoriating the Republicans' education
agenda as ''an afterthought.'' Bill Bradley played native New
Yorker at a hot dog joint.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic presidential candidates raced full tilt toward
New York's March 7 primary -- perhaps Bradley's last best hope for a
comeback -- but on little sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving from Los Angeles just as dawn broke, Gore had two hours
at his hotel before he spent another two hours with The New York
Times editorial board, courting the newspaper's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   He netted an informal nod from former Vice President Walter F.
Mondale, who told WCCO radio in Minneapolis that he recently
promised Gore his support ''and I guess I'm announcing it now.''
The 1984 Democratic nominee plans to appear with Gore in Minnesota
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley met Thursday with editors at the Spanish-language daily
newspaper El Diario and sat for interviews with three New York TV
stations. On his own red-eye flight from California, where he and
Gore debated Wednesday, a jovial Bradley imitated the body
contortions of reporters curled up in sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''I slept for two hours,'' he said. ''That's all you need for a
hot dog stand.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gray's Papaya, a popular juice and hot dog eatery in lower
Manhattan, Bradley donned a red employee jersey, plucked hot dogs
from the grill, nestled them in buns and laid them on the counter.
He downed his own sauerkraut-and-mustard topped hot dog in three
bites before flying on to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he planned to mine Maine and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 163 on the city's Upper West side, Gore read to
5- and 6-year-olds about a stuffed bear who forsook his playmate,
Wooden Horse, for a pile of material goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's more important, things or a friend?'' Gore asked the
two dozen children at the foot of his rocking chair. ''You
shouldn't leave a friend alone or take a friend for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   To parents in another classroom, Gore blasted Republican
presidential rivals John McCain and George W. Bush for supporting
private-school vouchers that Gore said would drain funds from
public schools. ''They seem to think that just because schools in
New York begin with P.S., that education is just an afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore never mentioned Bradley, and campaign aides likewise looked
beyond the primary fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we secure the nomination in a timely manner so we can
move on to other priorities,'' said campaign manager Donna Brazile,
with an eye on Gore's strained budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's daughter, Karenna, was hosting a Washington fund-raiser
Thursday night while her dad, who took the night off after stopping
at a Maryland school, was playing babysitter to Karenna's infant
son, Wyatt, according to aides. At Francis Scott Key Elementary
School in District Heights, Md., Gore read the Dr. Seuss classic,
''Green Eggs and Ham'' to about 50 children. He also used the visit
to press his plans for universal preschool, and expansion of Head
Start and early childhood education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was returning to New York on Saturday for another pair of
fund-raisers. A top campaign official estimated that, by Bradley
remaining in the race at least through next Tuesday, Gore would
spend $5 million he could otherwise save for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In a Friday trip to Jacksonville, Fla., Gore was picking up an
endorsement from Sen. Bob Graham, who can help carry Florida for
Gore in the fall campaign, campaign officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has lost every nominating contest yet to Gore, is
banking on a resurgence in the Northeast, where the former New
Jersey senator and New York Knicks basketball star is better known
than anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the final days before the March 7 ''Super Tuesday''
primaries potentially decide the nominee, Bradley hoped to pump up
his appeal with a five-minute paid prime-time appearance Thursday
night on CBS. In the ad, Bradley says he wants to be president ''to
use the power of that office to do good.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, where Bradley was running even or ahead just
eight weeks ago, polls released this week showed Gore leading
2-to-1. New York's Tuesday ballot offers 243 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's state headquarters remained determinedly upbeat, with
staffers answering the phones, ''It can happen in New York!''

<HEADLINE> Patriots pays $2.4 million to settle state claims  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The National Football League paid
Connecticut $2.4 million Thursday to settle the state's claims over
the New England Patriots' aborted move to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland said the money will reimburse the state for
the legal and planning costs incurred during negotiations with the
football team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made the decision that instead of making up some number and
applying something for punitive damages or emotional stress ... the
best thing to do was to ask for just the reimbursement for the
costs we incurred,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said $2.4 million was the only settlement figure ever
proposed to the league.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said pursuing legal action
against the NFL or Patriots owner Robert Kraft could have cost
''hundreds of thousands of dollars and have a very uncertain
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this brings us closure, and it's a very satisfactory
outcome,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, this chapter of all of our lives is
concluded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement comes almost a year after Kraft announced he was
pulling out of a deal to move his team from Foxboro, Mass., to the
Adriaen's Landing development site in downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced in late 1998. Kraft backed out on April
30, 1999, saying he feared a stadium might not be ready until 2003
because of environmental problems at the site along the Connecticut
River.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, the Massachusetts Legislature approved $70
million in state funding for a new Foxboro stadium, leading
Connecticut officials to suspect the team was negotiating behind
the state's back.
</P>
<P>
   According to Connecticut's contract with the Patriots, the team
was not allowed to negotiate with anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew from Day One that maybe we were being played against
other states,'' Rowland said. ''But it was a risk worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots spokesman Stacey James said Kraft and would not comment
on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the NFL, said every team in the
league will incur some cost of the settlement, but refused to say
how much the Patriots would have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state of Connecticut pursued its stadium proposal fairly
and we are pleased that all remaining issues have been resolved,''
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ''We appreciate the state's
participation in the good-faith negotiations that achieved a fair
compromise of the interests of all concerned.''

<HEADLINE> $500M Indian Trust System Flawed  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Interior Department says it will take much
longer than anticipated to come up with a computer system to
properly manage a $500 million trust system for American Indians,
meaning more financial uncertainty for many of the 300,000 account
holders.
</P>
<P>
   In a court-ordered report, the agency said a $60 million
computer system to track account information has run into such
severe development problems there no longer is a timetable to have
it up and running nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Original plans had called for the Trust Asset and Accounting
Management System, or TAAMS, to be available by the end of this
year, and agency officials consistently have said the project was
on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Hackler, a spokesman for Bureau of Indian Affairs, did not
return calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said efforts to collect all of the records
related to the accounts and check their accuracy have run into
roadblocks and will not be finished until 2003, and attempts to
draft policies and procedures for handling the trust system will
not be done until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're left once again with the feeling of empty promises,''
Keith Harper, a Cherokee lawyer representing account holders, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds hold proceeds from leases for grazing, logging
and oil drilling on Indian land. They were set up as part of a
since-rejected federal policy to divide reservations into small
plots held in trust for individual Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Indians sued the federal government in 1996, claiming
the accounts have been mismanaged. Their lawyers say they plan to
seek more than $10 billion to compensate for lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth gave the
federal government ''one last opportunity'' to correct more than a
century of mismanagement of the trust funds. He ordered periodic
updates and the Interior Department issued the first report on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency previously has acknowledged its record-keeping is so
poor it's unclear how much money should be in each trust account
and that it does not have current addresses for more than 46,000
account holders. But it insisted efforts to correct the problem
were on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Harper said the problems outlined in the agency report mean that
account holders face ''continued uncertainty about whether they're
getting the right amount. They're going to continue to lose money
with a broken system.''

<HEADLINE> Letterman Makes Ratings Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The return of convalescing heart patient David
Letterman and an appearance by the reluctant bride of a
multimillionaire steered two perennial second-place TV shows to
ratings milestones last week.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's CBS ''Late Show'' had its best ratings in five years
and its largest margin of victory over Jay Leno's ''Tonight Show''
on NBC since the week of July 7, 1995, Nielsen Media Research said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ABC's ''Good Morning America'' had its highest
ratings since 1997 last week, a surge almost solely attributable to
its coup in booking ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire'' bride
Darva Conger.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman made his first appearance on ''Late Show'' since his
January heart surgery on Monday, Feb. 21. The show drew an
estimated 12 million viewers. He appeared again on Wednesday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The homecoming enabled Letterman to average 7.13 million viewers
last week, compared to Leno's 5.86 million, Nielsen said. It was
Letterman's most-watched week since January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The true test is whether Letterman can carry over the audience's
warm feelings. In weeks without special events, Leno consistently
beats him.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman is working three days again next week, with Janeane
Garafalo filling in on Tuesday and Dana Carvey subbing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good Morning America'' averaged just over 5 million viewers
last week, still behind NBC's first-place ''Today'' show, which had
6.1 million. But it was the closest those two shows have been in
the ratings since December 1996, and ''GMA's'' most-watched week
since the week after Princess Diana died.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC morning show beat its rival with Conger's
heavily-promoted first interview after her honeymoon on Feb. 23.
That show drew an average audience of 6.1 million people, Nielsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conger didn't appear on the ''Today'' show until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   More important for ABC, it kept some of that audience the next
two days, averaging 5 million viewers on Thursday, when Conger's
husband, Rick Rockwell, appeared, and 5 million on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Louima jury focuses on Turetzky testimony  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury deliberating in the trial of three police
officers charged with conspiring to conceal one's role in the
bathroom torture of Abner Louima focused Thursday on the testimony
of an officer who helped break the case.
</P>
<P>
   Before ending their second day of deliberations in Brooklyn
without a verdict, jurors sent U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
Nickerson a note asking to be read a transcript of the
cross-examination of Eric Turetzky. The jury was to resume
deliberating on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Turetzky -- now a detective in the police Internal
Affairs Bureau -- testified that as a Brooklyn patrolman he helped
arrest Louima during a street disturbance in the summer of 1997; an
assault charge against Louima was subsequently dropped. He
identified Charles Schwarz as the officer who led the handcuffed
prisoner toward a bathroom in the 70th Precinct station.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors used that identification last year to help convict
Schwarz, 34, of violating Louima's civil rights by leading him into
the bathroom and holding him down while another officer, Justin
Volpe, sodomized the Haitian immigrant with a broken broom handle
in a fit of rage. Schwarz faces a possible life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The government claims that while Turetzky broke a supposed
''blue wall of silence'' -- the unspoken code among officers not to
''rat'' on each other -- Schwarz and two other officers were engaged
in a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have relied on records showing Schwarz and
codefendants Thomas Bruder, 33, and Thomas Wiese, 36, made a flurry
of phone calls to each other as investigators zeroed in. The
pattern and timing of the calls proved the officers were trying to
''get their stories straight'' to protect Schwarz by saying he was
never in the bathroom, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense tried to convince the jury there was no conspiracy
by arguing the alleged cover story was indeed true. Volpe, who
pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving 30 years in prison,
emerged as a key defense witness. He testified that Wiese -- not
Schwarz -- was there with him, but did not participate in the actual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz himself testified last week that during Volpe's attack,
he was outside the building, inspecting his patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Turetzky was confronted with a 1997
statement in which he said he had seen Schwarz enter the bathroom
with Louima -- a detail later dropped from his account. He blamed
the discrepancy on a ''poor choice of words on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, eight women and four men, began deciding the
defendants' fate Wednesday after Nickerson told them that by law
they ''need not determine the extent of any role the defendant
Schwarz may have played in the sexual assault.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants face terms of up to five years if convicted on
obstruction of justice charges.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Sen. To Block FEC Nominee  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Democratic senator said Thursday he would
block action on a Republican-backed nominee to the Federal Election
Commission who has been an outspoken opponent of laws that restrict
campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said he was putting a ''hold'' on
the nomination of Bradley Smith, a Senate parliamentary tactic that
can effectively prevent a confirmation vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know where Bradley Smith stands and that is far out of step
with the desire of Americans to clean up our political system,''
Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, professor at an Ohio law school, has been at the center
of controversy since last year when Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., temporarily delayed confirmation of Richard
Holbrooke as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations to protest
President Clinton's delay in naming Smith to the FEC post.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was the choice of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the
Senate's most tenacious foe of legislation to restrict campaign
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC, which enforces federal campaign finance law, is made up
of six members, three chosen by Senate Republican leaders and three
by Democratic leaders. The president traditionally goes along with
the decisions of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last month announced he would nominate Smith, but
stressed that he did so with great reluctance. ''There's a reason
they wanted Bradley Smith on the FEC,'' Clinton said of his
Republican sponsors. ''You know, he hates campaign finance
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has argued that current campaign finance law has failed to
rid the system of corrupting influences while unconstitutionally
infringing on free speech, and says he would prefer a system with
no limits on how much candidates can raise and spend.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also said that if confirmed by the Senate he would
work within the law.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic candidates for president, Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, have condemned Smith's nomination and
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said this week
that ''Mr. Smith's complete disdain for federal election law
renders him unqualified for the role of an FEC commissioner.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Combat Money Laundering  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Thursday it
wants broad new powers to fight money laundering, including the
authority to ban financial transactions between offshore financial
havens and U.S. banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to stanch the flow of billions of
dollars from drug trafficking and other criminal activities through
the U.S. financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the House Banking Committee liked the
administration's proposal so much they said they would co-sponsor
it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering came under the public spotlight last summer,
when federal authorities said the Bank of New York, one of the
country's largest banks, had served as a conduit for about $7
billion in Russian money, some of it believed to be from criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Outlining the new proposal in a speech, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers identified Russia, Colombia and Nigeria as among
the biggest sources of illicit money, and the Caribbean islands of
Dominica and Antigua, Nauru in the South Pacific and Liechtenstein
in Europe as some of the leading money-laundering centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When dirty money finds its way into American banks, the
reputations of all involved suffer,'' Summers told an audience of
bankers and securities industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   Money laundering is estimated to absorb nearly $600 billion
annually, or up to 5 percent of the world's gross domestic product.
Profits from drug trafficking, prostitution and other criminal
activities are moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts
to make them appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, the Treasury Department is seeking the power to
ask U.S. financial institutions to collect data on all kinds of
transactions with an offshore bank or financial company. In cases
where foreign governments shield banks from investigation, Treasury
wants the authority to cut them off from the U.S. financial system
without seeking congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and the
panel's senior Democrat, Rep. John LaFalce of New York, proposed a
stricter measure that would have required U.S. banks to collect
detailed information on their customers from countries considered
to be money-laundering havens. The administration's proposal would
leave it up to Treasury to decide whether to impose data-collecting
requirements on banks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' proposal had been opposed by the banking
industry. Groups representing the banking and securities industries
applauded the administration's plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Clinton proposal
''doesn't go far enough'' because it gives Treasury discretion to
decide whether to take action, rather than requiring it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diplomacy usually prevails over the domestic need to curb
money laundering,'' Schumer said in a telephone interview. He and
Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., have proposed their own legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Summers noted in his speech that Treasury officials already have
begun informing U.S. banks about foreign banks or nations that
repeatedly refuse to abide by generally accepted standards to
protect against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Treasury unveiled its first national
money-laundering strategy, a package of proposed new laws and rules
that include requirements that storefront check cashers, brokerage
firms and casinos notify authorities of suspicious activities the
way banks are required to do.
</P>
<P>
   That package, and the new proposals outlined by Summers, will be
submitted to Congress in the coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 26.99; Nasdaq Slips  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in a volatile session Thursday
as investors took profits from a recent rise in technology stocks
but continued buying blue chips that were battered last week.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market was nervous in advance of Friday's
scheduled release of the government's employment report.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 26.99 at 10,164.92.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
ended down 29.57 at 4,754.51 after rising as much as 44 points in
early trading. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 2.57 to
1,381.76.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's gains were led by AT&AMP;T, which rose 6 5/16 to 54 3/16
after Goldman Sachs reminded investors that the company remains on
its list of recommended stocks. AT&AMP;T was also helped along by the
latest flurry of takeover talk in the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom shares headed higher amid rumors that Germany's Deutsche
Telekom wants to acquire a U.S. company -- perhaps Global Crossing.
Deutsche Telekom's U.S.-traded shares rose 8 13/16 to 97 1/16, and
Global Crossing gained 3 7/16 to 54].
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications and BellSouth, which are believed to be
discussing a combination of their wireless businesses, also rose.
SBC, a Dow stock, was up 3 to 45 and BellSouth rose 1~ to 44~.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was also boosted by blue-chips that tumbled last week
amid worries over interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believe ''enough was enough'' after last week's
pummeling of Dow and other industrial stocks, said Gregory Nie,
technical analyst at First Union Securities in Chicago. ''This
week, volume has picked up and breadth is better, and the market is
trying to rally. That is encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM rose 3 to 103\ and General Electric gained 3~ to 135\.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq slumped despite an explosive initial public offering
from Palm Inc., the spinoff of 3Com Corp. Shares of Palm soared
from its offering price of 38 per share to 57 1/16. Parent company
3Com, which has risen sharply in recent sessions, tumbled 22 5/16
to 81 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Several other prominent technology companies slipped, suggesting
that investors were selling shares of companies that have performed
well this year to raise cash to buy lesser-known names in the
technology and Internet fields.
</P>
<P>
   Radiant Systems, for example, soared 28[ to 83] after the
company said it will work with Microsoft to develop electronic
commerce systems.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was fairly volatile, indicating that the interest rate
worries responsible for the Dow's plunge last week clearly are
still in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, most leading retail companies reported robust
sales, suggesting Americans are spending freely despite four rate
increases by the Federal Reserve since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. The Fed has
been raising rates in an effort to slow the economy to a pace that
will allow continued growth without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investors will receive crucial information on the
economy's strength from the Labor Department's employment report
for the month of February. The report will include information on
wages and benefits, which should indicate whether companies are
spending heavily to attract and keep employees while the U.S.
jobless rate lingers at extremely low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''That report is responsible for a lot of the volatility we're
seeing,'' said Sam Stovall, senior investment strategist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. Many on Wall Street have begun to believe
that a report of lower-than-expected unemployment could prompt the
Fed to raise rates even before its next meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some fear of a pre-emptive rate increase,'' Stovall
said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE composite volume totaled 1.45 billion
shares, compared with 1.54 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.31 to 584.04.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.1 percent.
European indexes were sharply higher after the European Central
Bank left interest rates unchanged. Germany's DAX index rose 2.8
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 1.1 percent, and France's
CAC-40 rose 3.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Gun Safety Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking momentum on gun control from the
Michigan school shooting, President Clinton summoned leaders of
Congress to the White House next week, hoping to break an impasse
on mandatory gun safety locks and gun show background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe this tragic death will help,'' the president said
Thursday, referring to Tuesday's fatal shooting of a 6-year-old
girl by a classmate using a stolen .32-caliber semiautomatic gun in
Mount Morris Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, there was talk of compromise between
Republicans and Democrats after months of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll take whatever we can agree on -- gun shows, clips, safety
locks,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ''We're
currently doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said, ''We have a reasonable gun bill. If the Democrats
want a bill, we can do it. If they want the issue, we'll have the
issue.'' He said he was open to compromise. ''I think the country
wants legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to leave the door open on whether he might
accept a bill that lacked a requirement for background checks at
gun shows. Asked if he would veto such a bill, he said, ''Well, I
don't know. I think they'd have a very hard time explaining why
they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said later that Clinton was not trying to
signal flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Always an emotional issue, the gun control debate has even more
prominence because of the Michigan school shooting and the
approaching one-year anniversary of the tragedy at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., last April 20. Tensions also have been
heightened by the struggle between Democrats and Republicans for
control of the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Republican-run House and Senate of ignoring
gun control legislation for eight months. ''They have done nothing
and meanwhile ... every single day there are 13 children who die
from guns in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Democrats walked
away from a bill last year that included child safety locks and
other restrictions but did not go as far as Clinton wanted in
background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the House Democrat leadership drops its obstructionist
tactics and agrees to work with us to pass common-sense gun
legislation,'' said Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining of the congressional impasse, Clinton said, ''I
don't think most Americans have any idea what a stranglehold the
NRA (National Rifle Association) has had on this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputing the NRA's contention that the Justice Department is
lax about prosecuting criminals, the president said, ''We have a
higher percentage of people in jail than all the other advanced
countries, and they have a lower gun death rate. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   ''That's because they don't have an NRA in their country and
they take sensible steps to protect children and society as a whole
from people having guns who shouldn't have them, doing things they
shouldn't do with them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, said
Clinton could have had an NRA-backed bill last year that would have
required safety locks, instant gun-show checks and other
provisions. But he said Clinton insisted on restrictions that even
some key Democrats revolted against.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's being marketed as a safety-lock bill and gun-show-check
bill when actually what it is is a phone-book volume of federal
regulation that only hits the law abiding, not the criminal,''
LaPierre said in an interview. ''That's our problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said gun manufacturers already are providing
safety locks. ''All you're doing is codifying existing practices,''
LaPierre said. ''Its all just politics. It has nothing, in my
opinion, to do with making America safer and that's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke about guns during interviews with Katie Couric of
NBC's ''Today'' show and with CBS anchor Dan Rather. He also raised
the issue during a Cabinet Room meeting dealing with vaccines for
Africa and other needy regions.

<HEADLINE> Diallo protest targets Justice Department  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black activists and the parents of Amadou
Diallo met Thursday with the No. 2 official at the Justice
Department and urged him to file civil rights charges against four
New York City police officers acquitted in the shooting death of
the West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, nearly 2,000 demonstrators marched around the
Justice Department building chanting, ''No justice! No peace!'' and
waving placards and flags. Many protesters were bused in from New
York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, former New
York City Mayor David Dinkens, National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People leader Kwesi Mfume and others,
expressed optimism following the two-hour meeting with Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting was very great and fruitful and we have very high
hopes,'' said Saiko Diallo, the victim's father.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the Diallo case is a priority, but he made no
guarantee the Justice Department would pursue civil rights charges
against Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are difficult cases to prosecute. The standard that we
have to meet on the federal side is a high one, but we will look at
the case,'' Holder told reporters in a news conference before the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a conviction, federal prosecutors would have to show
the officers intended to deny Diallo his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the early hours of Feb.
4, 1999, in the narrow vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
The officers testified they were looking for a rape suspect and
fired when Diallo reached for what they thought was a gun. It was
his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were acquitted last week of charges ranging from
second-degree murder to reckless endangerment by a racially mixed
jury.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, some jurors laid blame for the acquittals on
a lackluster prosecution by Bronx District Attorney Robert
Johnson's office. One juror said she was surprised when prosecutor
Eric Warner declined to cross examine the final witness, an expert
on police practices. Some activists have called for Johnson, who is
black, to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said Diallo supporters raised
questions with Holder over whether the case was vigorously
prosecuted and whether the judge was too supportive of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors that can be considered in reviewing the trial
with an eye to civil rights charges are incompetence, corruption,
intimidation or undue influence, according to Justice Department
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has an ongoing investigation into the
patterns and practices of the New York Police Department. That
probe was expanded to include the Street Crimes Unit after Diallo's
shooting. All four police officers in the Diallo shooting were
members of the unit, a roving group of plainclothes officers.

<HEADLINE> Fire Harms National Archives Files  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Archivists are using hot air and blotting
paper to salvage hundreds of thousands of pages of government
records damaged in a fire at a National Archives storage center
just outside Washington. Among them were veterans' records and
papers connected to a lawsuit over mismanagement of American
Indians' money.
</P>
<P>
   The fire occurred Tuesday at the Washington National Records
Center in Suitland, Md., which stores more than 3.7 million cubic
feet of records. Archives officials said 3,000 cubic feet of
records were stored in areas where sprinklers activated, but fewer
than 300 cubic feet -- approximately 700,000 pages -- were actually
damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the records were from the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are inactive files of deceased veterans who previously
made claims for benefits,'' said Robert Knode, records officer for
the veterans benefits administration. ''Sometimes we recall these
files when somebody wants a copy for genealogical or other
purposes, but there should be only a minimal effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 60 boxes of damaged records were involved in a lawsuit
over brought by American Indians charging government mismanagement
of a $500 million system of trust accounts for American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The water damage to those records was just the latest problem
with documents in the case; other Indian trust records have been
inadvertently shredded or found dumped in a trash-strewn shed on a
North Dakota reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Also damaged were records were from District of Columbia
government offices, the Labor Department's Hour and Wage Division
and the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. The patent and trademark
records were scheduled for disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret the loss of a single page, but we're not sure yet
what the loss is,'' said Gerald George, communications director for
the archives. ''We have some record damage and we regret that, but
on the other hand, our fire system contained the fire so that it
didn't do widespread damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation work is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, dry air is being blown into the storage stacks and
blotting paper is being used to extract moisture from pages, said
Susan Cooper, a spokeswoman for the archives. Drying chambers have
been set up and refrigerated trucks are being used to store records
that are very wet.
</P>
<P>
   ''They keep the records cold to prevent mildew from forming on
them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Panel OKs Breast Implant Brands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal advisory panel recommended Thursday
that a second major manufacturer of saline-filled breast implants
be allowed to stay on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration backed the implants
made by McGhan Medical Corp., one day after making a similar
recommendation that competitor Mentor Corp. be allowed to continue
selling its brand of saline implants.
</P>
<P>
   The two Santa Barbara, Calif., companies are the largest makers
of breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA advisers recommended that women getting saline
implants be warned that they can deflate and require repeated
operations. The FDA panel was to spend Friday determining just how
the government should word those warnings.
</P>
<P>
   And in another action, the FDA advisers voted unanimously late
Thursday that a small implant maker, PIP/USA of Miami, did not
prove its brand of saline implants were safe and effective.
Panelists rejected PIP's implants largely because the company's
study of the product is incomplete, an FDA spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 130,000 American women received saline-filled
breast implants last year even though the FDA has never declared
these implants safe: They hit the market before the FDA began
regulating medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA recently decided saline implants can continue
selling only if manufacturers prove they truly are safe, and asked
its scientific advisers to evaluate the issue. The FDA is not bound
by advisory panel recommendations but typically follows them, and
is scheduled to make a decision on the three manufacturers'
products by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the FDA banned most use of silicone gel-filled breast
implants.

<HEADLINE> Liggett: Reynolds discount cigarette pricing violates antitrustlaws  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Liggett Group Inc. on Thursday charged that
fellow cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. broke federal
antitrust laws by paying retailers to raise the prices on discount
cigarettes sold by RJR competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett claimed that in return for RJR's payments under its
''Every Day Low Pricing'' program, retailers agreed that no
discount cigarettes would be sold for less than an RJR discount
brand.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here, Liggett said
''this is accomplished, not by lowering the price of the RJR
product, but by raising the prices of other competing products.''
</P>
<P>
   RJR's contracts are an unreasonable restraint of trade that
prohibit retailers from lowering the prices of competing products
''even if RJR's competitors offer substantial discounts to the
retailer for the purpose of lowering the retail price,'' the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The program has led to nationwide cigarette price increases and
reduced Liggett sales, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   RJR spokesman John Singleton said the company had not yet
reviewed the lawsuit but maintained, ''R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Company's pricing policies are well within the limits of all laws
and regulations that cover pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither company could immediately say when the ''Every Day Low
Pricing'' program started.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Herzog, a tobacco industry analyst at CS First Boston,
questioned whether such a pricing program is really in place.
</P>
<P>
   She said the typical retailer programs by RJR and other tobacco
companies are similar to those in other industries, in which the
companies reduce prices for prime shelf placement and signage. In
return, the retailer can sell for less and increase volume.
</P>
<P>
   RJR has said it has raised prices 82 cents a pack over the
previous two years to offset costs from the 1997 $206 billion
settlement with 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett claimed the program has ''no legitimate business
justifications,'' allows RJR to fix the price of its competitor's
products, and prevents competitors from entering the market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Liggett is unable to maintain or increase sales not because of
weakened consumer demand but because of the chokehold that RJR has
placed at the retail level of the relevant market, preventing
Liggett from competing on price and substantially reducing the
volume of Liggett's sales and profits,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett declined to give figures.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring RJR from using the
pricing program, and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   RJR, the nation's No. 2 cigarette maker, is based in
Winston-Salem, N.C., but is incorporated in New Jersey, where it
has a sales office in Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Liggett, the fifth-largest tobacco company, is part of
Miami-based Brooke Group Ltd. It sells Pyramid brand discount
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   RJR markets the top-selling discount brand, Doral, shipping 26.6
billion Doral cigarettes in 1999, down 13.5 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Doral's retail market share slipped from 6.24 percent in the
first quarter last year to 6.20 percent in the fourth quarter,
according to Marlin retail-market share figures, the industry's
leading retail-market source.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Doral remained RJR's top-selling cigarette in 1999 and held
the second-best market share among all domestically sold
cigarettes, behind Philip Morris' premium brand Marlboro.

<HEADLINE> Report: HMOs Paid for Dead Patients  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare has paid $4.2 million to HMOs for
patients who were dead, according to a new report federal auditors.
</P>
<P>
   About $1.2 million of the misspent money so far has been
recovered by the program, said Health and Human Services Department
Inspector General June Gibbs Brown, in a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays HMOs a monthly fee for each beneficiary enrolled.
The fees are supposed to stop with the month following the month in
which someone dies. However, the Inspector General's report said
Medicare does not always find out about the deaths or stop payments
in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the program paid HMOs $3.1 million through April
1999 for 102 beneficiaries who died before February 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials said they have taken steps to improve
computer systems to better track deaths and are trying to recover
more of the lost money.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a follow-up check, the auditors found that as
recently as September, Medicare was still paying HMOs for some
patients who died after February 1998. Those payments had amounted
to another $1.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Bush backers Pataki and Giuliani battle over McCain criticism  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Five days before New York's presidential
primary, George W. Bush's best-known supporters in the state -- Gov.
George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- are battling each other.
</P>
<P>
   The infighting comes at a bad time for Bush, with polls showing
him running neck-and-neck with John McCain in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every top New York Republican has endorsed the Texas
governor's candidacy. But Giuliani, who is running for the Senate
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, has refused to join Pataki in
criticizing McCain. In fact, he has repeatedly said nice things
about the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pataki and his political allies launched a
coordinated attack against McCain, citing his Senate voting record
as being ''as anti-New York ... as anybody's in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refused to allow his name to be used on a mailing
criticizing McCain. And he balked at attending a news conference
Thursday with other mayors from across New York, also meant to
attack McCain's voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's spokeswoman and one of his top political
advisers, said Thursday of Giuliani, ''If you're going to be
defending the state in the Senate, you have an obligation to point
out another senator's votes against your interests and those of the
constituency you want to represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani political aide Bruce Teitelbaum, after consulting with
the mayor, said there would be no harsh words from his boss against
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mayor Giuliani believes that it should be possible in American
politics to strongly support someone, as Mayor Giuliani does George
W. Bush, and not bash their opponents with negative attacks,''
Teitelbaum said. ''For Mayor Giuliani, it's a matter of principle
and it's rooted in his respect and friendship with both
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been bad blood between Pataki and Giuliani since the
mayor crossed party lines in 1994 to endorse then-Gov. Mario Cuomo
over Pataki. Among other things, Giuliani questioned Pataki's
ethics. Pataki won the election.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush's intervention last year that led to Pataki's
backing for Giuliani's Senate campaign. At the time, Bush was
looking for a peaceful New York scene in which he could coast to
victory in any GOP primary. That notion disappeared with McCain's
resounding victory in the New Hampshire primary and rising poll
numbers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Giuliani and Pataki said both still planned to
accompany Bush on a campaign trip across the state on Friday and
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is hoping to make inroads in New York, especially with
the 46 percent of Republican voters in the state who are Roman
Catholic and may be upset by Bush's visit last month to Bob Jones
University in South Carolina as part of his appeal to the religious
right. Some school leaders are known for anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   In something of a surprise, the Bush camp scrapped plans
Thursday for a visit to Fairfield University in Connecticut on
Friday and one to Canisius College in Buffalo, N.Y., on Saturday.
Both are Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush had two stops scheduled
in each of several areas and any events that have been moved or
canceled were only because ''we're trying to hit more media
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Bush visited a Catholic Charities site early in
the week in Cleveland and on Wednesday went to St. Louis
University.

<HEADLINE> Detained Librarian Addresses House  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A librarian detained by the Chinese government
for nearly six months told a House subcommittee Thursday that his
experience shows the need for more outside pressure on China to
improve human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Song Yongyi, a Chinese-born librarian at Dickinson College in
Carlisle, Pa., who became an American citizen last month, said he
learned firsthand that the Chinese legal system still has ''so many
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Song was doing research for a book on China's Cultural
Revolution when he and his wife were arrested Aug. 7. Chinese
authorities eventually freed his wife but accused Song of spying
and kept him in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''I argued with those policemen in every interrogation on every
charge and I won every time. However, these secret agents told me
they would still sentence me,'' he told the House subcommittee on
international operations and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities freed Song on Jan. 28. Chinese Ambassador Li
Zhao Xing said the move came after Song showed ''repentance'' for
his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Song says he never admitted any wrongdoing. He told lawmakers
that after the Chinese released him an official told him they did
so because they feared U.S. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses told the subcommittee that Song's experience was
not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activist and former political prisoner Harry Wu
described China as a ''government that does not know the meaning of
individual dignity.'' He said the government still uses forced
labor and penalizes people who have more babies than the government
allows.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said because of these abuses, Congress should not grant China
permanent most favored nation trade status this year. The Clinton
administration backs the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee Chairman Chris Smith, R-N.J., said ''the already
despicable behavior of the Chinese communist regime has gotten
worse in every category of human rights concern.'' Because of those
conditions, granting most favored nation status ''ought to be
unthinkable at this point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney agreed and said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright is ''dreaming'' when she argues that the
United States can only maintain leverage if it gives China the
trade status.

<HEADLINE> NRC says corrosion from inside is likely cause of leak  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
Thursday that last month's accident at the Indian Point 2 power
plant was probably caused by superheated, highly pressurized water
corroding a nickel-alloy tube from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan emphasized that an official finding
is weeks away and ''there are other pieces of that puzzle that we
still have to look at.'' But based on a videotape from a
remote-controlled camera sent into the tube, ''it's probable that
this was stress corrosion cracking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, radioactive water heated in the reactor leaked from
one of the generator's 32,000 tubes into the clean water that
surrounds them. As a result, there was a small discharge of
radioactive steam into the atmosphere. There were no injuries and
the increase in radioactivity was too small to be measured,
officials said. Still, it was the worst accident in the plant's
26-year history.
</P>
<P>
   If corrosion does turn out to be the cause, it could draw into
question the industry's inspection practices. Con Edison, which
operates the plant 35 miles north of Times Square, said its last
inspection in 1997 showed no suggestion of a crack in the tube that
leaked. The plant has had less than two years of operating time
since then, and the NRC granted Con Ed's request for a year's
postponement of an inspection scheduled for June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   NRC investigators suggested at a Wednesday night meeting with
Con Ed that if the crack could appear, deepen and break open
between inspections, the inspection schedule might have to be
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   ''If necessary, we will re-evaluate our own standards,'' said
Brian Sheron, the NRC's associate director for project licensing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lesson clearly is that it doesn't make sense to relax the
inspections. They should be more stringent,'' said Edwin Lyman,
scientific director of the Nuclear Control Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed Vice President Stephen Quinn said a decision on more
frequent inspections should be made ''on sound, technical
knowledge'' not passion and should await the completion of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the water in the tube starts out in a highly purified
state and is much less corrosive than ordinary tap water. But
because it is heated to 500 degrees and pressurized to 2,200 pounds
per square inch, it can stress the tube that carries it.
</P>
<P>
   David Lochbaum, nuclear safety engineer for the Union of
Concerned Scientists in Washington, said that ''even though the
water is very close to pure, the fact that you have such high
temperatures and pressures makes any amount of impurities gain a
foothold and propagate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan also noted that the leak occurred in a U-shaped portion
of the tube, which imparts additional stress, and that water flows
through it at rates up to 70,000 gallons per minute. The tube's
inside diameter is seven-eighths of an inch and the thickness of
its walls is one-twentieth of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wanted to have it as thin as possible to get a good
transfer of heat and the belief was that this material would hold
up very well over time to those sort of pressures and temperatures,
but they have been more susceptible to corrosion than initially was
believed,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   James Riccio, senior analyst at Public Citizen in Washington,
said the alloy in the tubes, called inconel 600, has been shown to
be subject to stress problems even when exposed to pure water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem isn't the water,'' he said. ''The problem is Con
Ed has water-soluble steam generator pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the utility should be forced to install replacement
generators they have owned since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Lochbaum said that if the current inspection finds other tubes
in the generators have been corroded and stressed, they should be
replaced or there could be another tube rupture.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers hear from family members of inmates shipped to Virginia  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Family members of Connecticut inmates
moved to a Virginia prison slammed the relocation plan Thursday,
saying it has unfairly added to their punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Arroyo of Hartford said her son has become depressed and
suicidal in the three months since he was moved to Wallens Ridge
State Prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very stressing, and he's getting worse,'' Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her son, Armando Arroyo, has a mental illness and isn't
getting any help for it at the super-maximum security prison in Big
Stone Gap, Va. She said her son -- who is serving a 10-year sentence
for convictions on drug charges -- is rarely allowed to make phone
calls or receive mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to visit him every week,'' said Betsy Burgos, Armando
Arroyo's girlfriend. ''But now it's too far. I don't know when
we'll ever see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Gumbus said guards at Wallens Ridge have denied her son
access to religious materials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bad enough they moved him away from me,'' the Stamford
woman said. ''Now they won't let him have a bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the state's Public Safety, Judiciary and
Appropriations committees heard testimony Thursday on a bill
calling for a study of the prison transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, 480 prisoners have been moved to Wallens Ridge.
Gov. John G. Rowland has said transferring prisoners saves money
because the per-inmate cost is cheaper at in the Virginia prison
than in Connecticut. The transfers also allow the state to manage
the size of Connecticut's crowded inmate population while weeding
out troublesome prisoners, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's contract with Virginia's Department of Correction
allows 500 inmates to be housed at Wallens Ridge for $11 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some key lawmakers say the transfers may be unnecessary, and
want to study whether some offenders in Connecticut can be put in
treatment or rehabilitation programs rather than taking up needed
prison cells.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot more mentally ill people filling jails in
Connecticut than we need there,'' said Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East
Haven. ''There are people in our prisons who would be better served
in other environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Fabian agrees.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years he was locked up in a Connecticut prison
for stealing a leaf blower out of a garage, he said he never got
treatment for his drug addiction, attention deficit disorder and
short-term memory problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very hard to get help, and I never got what I needed in
prison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some cautioned against having too much sympathy for jailed
drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is incarcerated because they're a drug addict,'' said
Rep. Robert Farr, R-West Hartford. ''They're incarcerated because
of what they did when they were drug addicts.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation being considered by lawmakers would also
increase the state's oversight of Connecticut inmates at Wallens
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have accused guards at the Virginia prison of
racial intolerance. Their complaints that the warden of Wallens
Ridge displayed prints of Civil War battle scenes featuring the
Confederate flag prompted the pictures to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing comes as the FBI investigates allegations of abuse
made by New Mexico inmates who were shipped to Wallens Ridge.

<HEADLINE> State guide details banking fees  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Customers tired of paying high banking fees
now have a resource to steer them toward cheaper banks.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Banking and Insurance on Thursday
released the first Consumer Guide to Bank Fees, a comprehensive
listing of fees charged on 649 accounts by 158 banking
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The guide, which is also available on the Internet, lists fees
imposed on consumers who use ATMs, bounce checks, purchase cashier
checks, or conduct other banking business.
</P>
<P>
   The guide shows that most, 97 percent, of New Jersey banks allow
customers free use of ATM machines at their own bank. A smaller
ratio, 85 percent, impose no monthly service charge for ATM cards.
</P>
<P>
   But most banks charge non-customers a token fee of $1 or $1.50
per transaction. A handful of banks charge $2, including First
Morris Bank and Trust, St. Edmond's Federal Savings Bank, Sun
National Bank and Valley National Bank, according to the guide.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for other services, such as overdrafts, general service and
checking accounts, vary from bank to bank, according to the guide.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said consumers can use the information to
shop around for the best rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the best things we can do is give consumers the tools
to make intelligent decisions and this Web site and consumer guide
are two tools that will enable them to make informed decisions,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   If enough consumers act on the information, they may be able to
put pressure on banks that charge high fees to lower them, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The marketplace reacts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said she is reluctant to place government controls
on the banking industry to reduce or eliminate ATM or other banking
fees.
</P>
<P>
   But a Whitman critic said the data call into question Whitman's
hands-off policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's survey and guide is a non-solution that only
allows consumers to pick their own ATM fee poison,'' Sen. Wayne
Bryant, D-Camden, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no leadership from an administration that is
effectively saying, ''Here's an ATM survey - it shows how banks are
ripping you off,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is the result of a December survey conducted by
department officials of every bank in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the survey will be repeated and the guide updated
twice a year to provide the most recent information to consumers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes FSU to White House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed the Florida State
University Seminoles to the White House on Thursday and hailed the
reigning national champions as ''team of the decade in American
football.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank you for giving the rest of us who just watched from
the stands or on TV a magnificent season,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The undefeated Seminoles beat Virginia Tech 46-29 in the Sugar
Bowl to end the school's first perfect season. University President
Talbot ''Sandy'' D'Alemberte and Coach Bobby Bowden joined Clinton
at the podium in the East Room.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled that the Seminoles were the first collegiate
football team he welcomed to the White House after they were
national champions in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''That team was 12-1; this team is undefeated,'' said Clinton,
who leaves office in less than one year. ''I came in with you, and
I'm going out with you.''
</P>
<P>
   He told graduating seniors who wouldn't be going on to the
professional ranks to remember the teamwork that led them to
victory. ''what it takes to win on the football team -- hardwork and
discipline and devotion to a common effort -- give you a pretty good
lesson for life.''

<HEADLINE> Shoe expert says print on slain suspect's shirt similar toofficer's boot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A pattern found on the back of the
bloody shirt worn by a slain suspect is consistent with the print
of a boot worn by the New Milford officer charged in his murder, a
renowned forensic expert testified on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI agent William Bodziak took the stand for nearly two
hours as the prosecution wrapped up its case against Scott Smith,
the first police officer in the state ever charged with murder for
an on-duty incident.
</P>
<P>
   Bodziak, a footwear impressions specialist, has testified at the
O.J. Simpson trial and the Oklahoma City bombing trial.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that the imprint was made by a Timberland boot like
those Smith was wearing the day of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 28, has said he shot Franklyn Reid to death during an
arrest on Dec. 29, 1998 when Reid made a sudden move from knees, as
if reaching for a weapon. But prosecutors contend that Bodziak's
testimony backs up an account from a passing motorist who said she
saw Smith standing over Reid as the suspect lay face down. Reid was
shot in the back at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney John Connelly has called several expert
witnesses this week in an attempt to show that Reid was on his
stomach and not on his knees as Smith claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Virginia Maxwell, a state forensic scientist testified
Wednesday that grass and soil stains on Reid's clothing were
consistent with the prosecution theory. She said she did not find
heavier stains at the knees.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, a firearms expert testified that the gunshot
could not have been an accident.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to his attorney, Smith said he fired to kill. And
state firearms expert Edward McPhillips said the Hoechler&AMP; Koch
handgun has a safety mechanism to prevent accidental discharge.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must squeeze the cocking device on the grip to cock it and
dislodge the safety mechanism,'' he explained, holding the small
black handgun. ''The trigger cannot be pulled without squeezing the
grip.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense is expected to begin its case on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Cost of N.M. Ranch Said Too High  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The $101 million Congress set aside to buy a
New Mexico ranch is up to 2{ times more than the property is worth,
auditors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the purchase criticized the General Accounting
Office report even before its formal release, which could come
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This ranch has been called the Yellowstone of the Southwest.
It's a magnificent resource,'' said Rep. Tom Udall, D-N.M., whose
district includes the ranch. ''We need to get it into public hands
so all the people of New Mexico can use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress must approve the purchase and a new management plan for
the 95,000-acre Baca Ranch by April 30. Supporters fear the report
could derail the purchase agreement with the Texas family that owns
the land.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO review, called for under the law setting aside about
$1,060 an acre for the ranch, said comparably sized ranches in the
Southwest had sold for $400 to $670 an acre. That range would put
the price tag for the Baca Ranch between $38 million and $63.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the GAO to respond, the U.S. Forest Service said last
week the review came to the wrong conclusions. The GAO auditors did
not even visit the ranch, which is ''widely considered one of the
most spectacular natural and scenic areas of the nation still in
private ownership,'' the Forest Service said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we pay $101 million, we are paying the fair market value
of a property that is special and which cannot be duplicated
elsewhere in the market place,'' the Forest Service said.
</P>
<P>
   The Baca Ranch deal was the largest single component of $651
million Congress set aside to buy and preserve open space this
year. Udall and other supporters say the GAO ignored the land's
special value for recreation and conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch in the Jemez Mountains north of Santa Fe is home to
thousands of elk and other wildlife and includes an extinct
volcano, the Valles Caldera. The ranch also features hot springs,
sulfur pools and six valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch is owned by the Dunigan family of Abilene, Texas. It
is almost completely surrounded by the Santa Fe National Forest and
the Bandelier National Monument.

<HEADLINE> Parents of SIDS victims push for standards on infant autopsies  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS MARTELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Their voices quivered, and tears welled up.
The hearing room grew quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Then four young parents looked into the eyes of strangers and
talked about the most personal and horrifying moment of their
lives: when they discovered their seemingly healthy babies had died
in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter Heather was 20 months old, and we had put her down
for a two-hour nap,'' said Robin Alda, 33 of Howell. ''She woke up
that morning healthy, smiling and happy ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our son passed away during the night, and so did a piece of
us,'' said Jim Adams, 32, of Flemington. ''I'll never forget my
wife's bloodcurdling scream ...''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on the Assembly Health Committee listened intently
Thursday, then passed a bill that would set standards for the
autopsies of babies who die without explanation. The bill, A-1984,
now advances to the full Assembly. It has already passed the state
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For parents whose children died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
or other causes, the loss is made worse when authorities cannot
shed much light on why they died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Losing a child is the most tragic event you can ever
experience,'' said Alda. ''Not knowing what happened is a
double-whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say setting a uniform standard for autopsies could
provide some answers for parents, and add more reliable scientific
data that can be added to the national research on SIDS. Sponsors
said autopsies now focus primarily on the potential of crime, to
rule out child abuse. They said medical questions should be probed
and recorded. The bill would set a strict autopsy protocol for
babies who die of SIDS and require all county medical examiners to
follow it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all come from different circumstances,'' said Laura
Crandall, 31, of Montclair. ''But all our children were healthy
until the moment they died. And we all want peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Crandall said more than two years after her 15-month-old
daughter, Maria, died, she still has no answers. An initial finding
of a heart attack was later ruled out. She said by the time she was
supplied with samples of her daughter's tissue for another opinion,
they could not be studied.
</P>
<P>
   Such unanswered questions have an impact beyond parents'
emotions. Because they don't know what happened to their babies,
their other children are often subjected to medical testing to rule
out a wide range of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Alda said her 8-month-old daughter has gone through ''countless
tests. We don't know what it was. We don't know if it was genetic,
or what.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents showed photographs of their smiling babies, some
taken hours before they died. They also brought their other
children: some recently born; others who remember the younger
sibling who left them too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just before I came up to talk to you, my 6-year-old daughter,
Jen, whispered to me,'' Marriane Gonzalez, 37, of Berkeley Heights,
told the committee. ''She said, 'Mommy, other babies went to sleep
and didn't wake up, just like Matty. I'd like to know what
happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   When she heard her name, young Jennifer jumped out of her chair
and nodded her head. Gonzalez, who couldn't see Jennifer, continued
to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told her, 'We'd all like to know,''' Gonzalez said. ''We'd
all like to know.''

<HEADLINE> Work Begins on HMO Legislation  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from the House and Senate started
work Thursday on compromise legislation that would afford Americans
some rights when dealing with HMOs and health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate passed bills last fall that contain many of
the same patient protections. But the two bills differ on two
touchy issues -- whether Americans should be allowed to sue HMOs and
whether a federal patient protection law should apply to everyone
or only to those whose plans are not already regulated by states,
many of which have already passed their own patients' rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that patients need protections from HMOs and
managed care plans, which control costs by eliminating unneeded
care. Republicans say lawsuits will drive up health care costs and
force employers to drop coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But with patient rights a popular issue among voters, GOP
lawmakers in the House joined Democrats last fall to pass a
bipartisan patients' rights bill that allows lawsuits and applies
to all people with private insurance. The Senate bill, crafted by
Republicans, doesn't allow lawsuits and applies to fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan committee appointed to draft a compromise was
meeting for the first time today. Here, in question and answer
format, are key aspects of the debate:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What proposals are on the table?
</P>
<P>
   A: The House and Senate both have bills giving patients a
variety of rights, including:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ability to appeal HMO care decisions to an outside panel.
</P>
<P>
   -- A guarantee of access to reasonable emergency room care.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ability to see pediatricians and obstetricians without
permission from primary care doctors.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting timely access to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   -- A requirement that plans not prohibit doctors from telling
patients about all their medical options.
</P>
<P>
   -- Coverage of care associated with clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills would also allow anyone to buy medical savings
accounts, which let people set aside money, tax-free, to pay for
routine care, and would let self-employed people deduct from their
taxes what they spend to purchase their own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the main differences between the two proposals?
</P>
<P>
   A: They differ on two issues -- who is covered and whether health
plans can be sued.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would apply to every American with private health
insurance -- an estimated 161 million people. Most provisions of the
Senate bill would apply to people insured through employer-based
plans that are exempt from state regulation -- about 55 million
people. One exception is a requirement that plans let patients
appeal to an outside review panel if care is denied -- that would
apply to everyone with private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would allow patients to sue HMOs, the Senate bill
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is working on the compromise and how long will it take?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are 20 Republican and 13 Democratic members of Congress
on the committee working on a compromise. They have set a tight
deadline of March 31.

<HEADLINE> AM-NY Senate, 1st Ld-Writethru, a0806,0459  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani, riding support from white
women and Jewish voters, has taken the lead over Hillary Rodham
Clinton in their Senate race, a statewide poll reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute
had the Republican New York City mayor favored by 48 percent of
registered voters, with the Democratic first lady backed by 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released by Quinnipiac on Feb. 6, the day Clinton
formally entered the race, had Giuliani favored by 45 percent of
New York voters to 42 percent for the first lady, a statistical tie
given that poll's margin of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac's polls over the last six months have shown the race
extremely close, and often the gap between the two has been within
those polls' margins of error. Some other statewide polls have
shown Giuliani in the lead, but routinely by single digits.
</P>
<P>
   The latest telephone poll of 1,842 registered voters was
conducted Feb. 22-28 and has a margin of error of 2 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp said the latest poll results were a reflection
of concerns many New Yorkers have about Clinton's move to New York
to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We New Yorkers can tell the difference between authenticity
and a script,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager.
''He's direct, he's real, he's authentic. He's New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Schwartz, director of the Hamden, Conn.-based Quinnipiac
College Polling Institute, said the mayor had developed solid leads
among white women and Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''White women have been a bellwether, voting for the winner in
every statewide race in New York since 1990,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor leads 51 percent to 37 percent among white women and
48 percent to 38 percent among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the poll findings Thursday night, Clinton said she
has work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have an obligation to earn the vote of every New Yorker,
which I intend to do, and talk about the issues that are important
to me and to my friends and to women that I know here in New
York,'' Clinton said. ''It's a question of having people get to
know me and what I stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''I'm a very well-known, unknown person.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz noted that the mayor's favorability rating among New
York voters had reached its highest point since the institute began
charting the race in February of last year. In the latest poll, 42
percent of voters had a favorable view of the mayor. Thirty-four
percent of voters had a favorable view of Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Diallo's Bronx neighborhood mourns another police killing  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Just blocks from the doorstep where Amadou
Diallo died, neighbors mourned Thursday for another unarmed man
killed by police and said his death confirmed their belief that
officers are too quick to use force.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers and candles sat outside the building where Malcolm
Ferguson, 23, was shot in the head Wednesday night, and several of
his friends cried and hugged on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's mother, Juanita Young, said that her son had
problems, but was moving forward with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were straightening him out. He was not a bad kid,'' Young
told WCBS. ''What they say about him is a lie, it's a stone,
bare-faced lie.They abused him and they killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ferguson, a parolee, was carrying heroin and fleeing
police when he was shot in the head during a struggle with an
officer of the Street Narcotics Unit. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called
Ferguson ''a serious criminal.'' Police said he was a convicted
drug dealer with nine prior arrests.
</P>
<P>
   But those who knew Ferguson described him as friendly and
easygoing, and placed blame for his death on police, who they said
were routinely rude to neighborhood residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts,'' said Yolanda Jones, 34, who lives a block away
from 1045 Boynton Ave., where Ferguson was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got away with Diallo,'' she said. ''Now, all of a sudden,
they think they just have the right to pull out and shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers were angered by the acquittal last week of the
four officers who fired at Diallo 41 times, and Ferguson was
detained Friday for resisting arrest at a protest of the verdict,
according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The Soundview section, where both killings happened, was quiet
Thursday, but residents said Ferguson's death was more evidence
that police were too violent, particularly with black and Hispanic
people. Diallo and Ferguson were both black.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's real bad,'' said Anthony Carty, 43, who lives next door
to the Ferguson shooting scene. ''It's not right at all. Something
has got to give, because they're going to continue doing it again
and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Saifr took pains to
distinguish the Ferguson shooting from Diallo's death, although
both men were unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police have to arrest drug dealers,'' the mayor said. ''If
police officers act in the line of duty to protect a community from
violent criminals and drug dealers, then that community should
stand up and support them when police officers' lives are in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But friends of Ferguson -- who did not live in Soundview, but
often visited friends at 1045 Boynton -- were baffled by his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the teenagers know each other here, all the fellows,''
said Juan Valdez, 19, who was lighting candles at a makeshift
shrine. ''Not everybody's a suspect. This is a rough
neighborhood,'' he said. ''But not everybody deserves to die. He
died for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Renaldo Landers, 49, who works in a nursing home and lives in
the neighborhood, worried that Ferguson's past would be used to
justify his killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not no gangster or nothing,'' Landers said. ''He just has
a little drug problem. He's not an armed robber or a serial
killer.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers approve broader version of Megan's Law notifications  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Assembly members are looking to overhaul
Megan's Law by listing all sex offenders in public registries
available for free in the mail and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And Gov. Christie Whitman appears to be on board with expanding
sex offender notifications in some way, though she is undecided on
the specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee in a 7-0 vote on
Thursday approved legislation to make sex offenders' names,
addresses, employment and photos available to all for the asking
with no restriction on how they could use them.
</P>
<P>
   The current Megan's Law provides for community notification of
neighbors or of local schools and day care centers on convicted sex
offenders who have been released from prison and who pose some risk
of repeating their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But judges in a series of rulings in state and federal courts
have placed strict limits on how these notifications are to be
conducted and who is to receive them. In New Jersey, a person who
gets a sex offender notification and shares the details with others
is violating a court order and faces sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the new bill, A-432, acknowledged that their
proposal could shatter the delicate legal construction supporting
the current law.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the published registry would be available to all,
including community groups, businesses, real estate offices and the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   Further, while the current law has different degrees of
notification for offenders according to whether they pose a high
risk or a moderate risk, the registries would list them all.
</P>
<P>
   ''More people than the immediate neighbors are in need of this
information,'' said the sponsor, said Assemblyman Joel Weingarten,
R-Essex.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman James Holzapfel, R-Ocean, the committee chairman,
said, ''These are people who have forfeited their right to be
anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's spokesman, Peter McDonough, said the governor ''is
foursquare behind the idea of expanding Megan's Law to provide New
Jerseyans greater protection from dangerous sex offenders,'' but
she is awaiting advice from Attorney General John Farmer on what
form it should take.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Rep. Dick Zimmer pressed for the original Megan's
Law and authored a federal version. He testified Thursday in
support of the proposed change.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said he believes a tougher law will survive federal court
challenges, perhaps not at the lower levels but certainly before
the U.S. Supreme Court. Zimmer said the nation's highest court has
approved similar sex-offender notifications in other states.
</P>
<P>
   A number of advocates for Megan's Law said the existing law has
proven to be too limited. Among these is Maureen Kanka, who
recently told The Associated Press that she would push for the
Internet listing. It was her daughter, Megan, who became the
namesake of these laws here and across the United States after her
1994 murder at the hands of a convicted sex offender who lived
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   A sponsor of the 1995 law, Sen. Peter Inverso, R-Mercer, said he
is willing to help Kanka with an Internet registry law in the upper
house. Kanka said she has met many frustrated parents in her visits
to schools and PTAs who question why they are not informed about
the whereabouts of sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten, a candidate for Congress in the 7th district, said
while the 1995 ruling by the state Supreme Court required tight
limits on the information, the personnel of the high court has
changed and a different view on the issue might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   The current chief justice, Deborah Poritz, was New Jersey
attorney general in 1995 when she presented the state's case on
behalf of Megan's Law before the high court. The landmark Megan's
Law ruling bears her name, Doe v. Poritz.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1995 ruling was 6-1, all seven justices favored strict
limits on notifications to balance them with the privacy rights of
the ex-convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Of these seven justices, four have left the court including the
author, former Chief Justice Robert Wilentz, who died in 1996. A
fifth justice, Daniel O'Hern, is set to retire within two months.

<HEADLINE> Report: WTO Good Deal for U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Clinton administration report sent to
Congress on Thursday concludes that after five years, the World
Trade Organization has proved a good deal for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The WTO has been at the leading edge of our strategy to
capitalize on American technological leadership as we build the
economy of the 21st century,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The 400-page report from Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky was required by Congress, which will likely debate the
future of U.S. membership in the global trade regulating body this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, quickly denounced the document for not
highlighting what they contend are the considerable failings of the
Geneva-based organization that sets the rules for world trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton administration is trying to paper over the WTO's
record of weakening environmental, food safety and labor standards,
but it is long on spin and short on facts,'' said Lori Wallach,
director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, one of the groups
that organized massive protests against the WTO in Seattle last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The report finds that in the five years since the WTO was
founded, the number of jobs supported by U.S. exports has increased
by 1.4 million to 11.7 million. It also calculates that in the same
period the number of U.S. jobs grew by 14 million and unemployment
dropped to its lowest point in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Also, U.S. exports rose by more than a third between 1994 and
1999, despite a financial crisis in Asia and other economic woes
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the administration report concluded that commitment to
open markets under the WTO has yielded lower prices on everyday
goods and increased Americans' purchasing power by as much as
$4,000 annually for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   ''The WTO has been an institution of great practical economic
benefit to Americans and to our trading partners,'' Barshefsky said
in a speech Thursday highlighting the report.
</P>
<P>
   The progress report was a condition of the Uruguay Round
Agreements Act, the legislation that created the WTO in 1995. The
WTO governs trade among all member nations, and its decisions are
binding.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the report, any member of Congress can propose
withdrawing support for continued U.S. membership in the WTO.
Congress then has 90 days to act.
</P>
<P>
   Given the amount of opposition to some WTO decisions, the
administration expects a vote this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not highlighted in the administration's report, but certain to
be cited by critics, is the soaring U.S. trade deficit over the
past five years. The deficit hit a record $271.3 billion in 1999,
more than $100 billion above the previous mark of $164.3 billion,
set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The administration blames the supercharged U.S. economy and
strong consumer spending for drawing in record imports. Critics
contend the widening deficits are a sign of the failure of the
administration's trade policies, which have emphasized big
market-opening trade deals with other countries, such as the trade
agreement with China now pending before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the administration's report, supporters of the WTO
said that U.S. farmers and businesses had benefited from U.S.
membership in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''History tells us that no major advances in trade were made
this century without the leadership of the United States,'' said
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. ''And
if American farmers and workers are to compete and win in the
international marketplace, we must have a seat at the table and
continue to play an active role in setting the rules every trading
partner will follow.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Didn't Plan To Fight Waco Blaze  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Ten days before the deadly inferno at the Branch
Davidian compound, the FBI told prosecutors it had no plans to
battle any blazes, The Dallas Morning News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A motion filed Wednesday by attorneys in a wrongful death
lawsuit over the raid cited FBI records of two exchanges as plans
were being finalized to assault the compound near Waco with tanks
and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page FBI summary of an April 9, 1993, briefing,
Assistant U.S. Attorney LeRoy Jahn asked FBI leaders in Waco ''if
there was a fire truck available in case the Davidians attempted to
torch the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   A second document, described as a telephone report filed at the
FBI's Washington headquarters that evening, said ''there would be
no plan to fight a fire should one develop in the Davidian
compound,'' according to the News.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys filed the motion to convince U.S. District
Judge Walter Smith that the FBI's on-scene commanders, Jeffrey
Jamar and Richard Rogers, should be reinstated as defendants in the
wrongful death suit. They were two of several defendants that Smith
had previously dismissed from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jamar has told Congress that he held fire trucks back from the
compound for more than 40 minutes after it caught fire because he
feared sect members would endanger firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died at the
compound after the FBI assault began April 19. Some inside died
from the fire, others from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys also released a report by their fire
investigator, Patrick Kennedy, who said adequate firefighting
equipment on the scene could have saved many lives.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rides Gun Control Momentum  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking momentum on gun control from the
Michigan school shooting, President Clinton summoned leaders of
Congress to the White House next week, hoping to break an impasse
on mandatory gun safety locks and gun show background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe this tragic death will help,'' the president said
Thursday, referring to Tuesday's fatal shooting of a 6-year-old
girl by a classmate using a stolen .32-caliber semiautomatic gun in
Mount Morris Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, there was talk of compromise between
Republicans and Democrats after months of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll take whatever we can agree on -- gun shows, clips, safety
locks,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ''We're
currently doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said, ''We have a reasonable gun bill. If the Democrats
want a bill, we can do it. If they want the issue, we'll have the
issue.'' He said he was open to compromise. ''I think the country
wants legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats failed on a 49-49 tie vote Thursday night to get the
Senate to adopt a resolution calling for final congressional action
on new gun control measures by April 20. Had he been there, Vice
President Al Gore could have broken the tie, as he did last year on
a key vote before the Senate passed gun restrictions to Clinton's
liking. The legislation has been stalled since then.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to leave the door open on whether he might
accept a bill that lacked a requirement for background checks at
gun shows. Asked if he would veto such a bill, he said, ''Well, I
don't know. I think they'd have a very hard time explaining why
they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said later that Clinton was not trying to
signal flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Always an emotional issue, the gun control debate has even more
prominence because of the Michigan school shooting and the
approaching one-year anniversary of the tragedy at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., last April 20. Tensions also have been
heightened by the struggle between Democrats and Republicans for
control of the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Republican-run House and Senate of ignoring
gun control legislation for eight months. ''They have done nothing
and meanwhile ... every single day there are 13 children who die
from guns in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Democrats walked
away from a bill last year that included child safety locks and
other restrictions but did not go as far as Clinton wanted in
background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the House Democrat leadership drops its obstructionist
tactics and agrees to work with us to pass common-sense gun
legislation,'' said Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining of the congressional impasse, Clinton said, ''I
don't think most Americans have any idea what a stranglehold the
NRA (National Rifle Association) has had on this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputing the NRA's contention that the Justice Department is
lax about prosecuting criminals, the president said, ''We have a
higher percentage of people in jail than all the other advanced
countries, and they have a lower gun death rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, said
Clinton could have had an NRA-backed bill last year that would have
required safety locks, instant gun-show checks and other
provisions. But he said Clinton insisted on restrictions that even
some key Democrats revolted against.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's being marketed as a safety-lock bill and gun-show-check
bill when actually what it is a phone-book volume of federal
regulation that only hits the law abiding, not the criminal,''
LaPierre said in an interview. ''That's our problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said gun manufacturers already provide safety locks. ''All
you're doing is codifying existing practices,'' LaPierre said.
''It's all just politics. It has nothing, in my opinion, to do with
making America safer, and that's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke about guns during interviews with Katie Couric of
NBC's ''Today'' show, with CBS anchor Dan Rather and during a
Cabinet Room meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, Clinton noted that the estimated 200 million handguns in
circulation pose ''a practical problem'' for an effective licensing
program covering only new gun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think if we would begin the process of making handgun
owners get a license before they can buy a gun, pass a Brady
background check, and then have a gun safety course, I think it
would make a difference,'' said Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Slip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Friday,
carrying over much of its strength in New York. Japanese stocks
slipped.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.78 yen, up 0.43 yen from late Thursday but
lower than its late New York level of 107.83 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 98.56 points,
or 0.49 percent, to 19,966.55 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Thursday, the average closed down 16.56 points, or 0.08
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar gained some ground amid renewed
concern that Japanese finance authorities may intervene to stop the
yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Japan's government has expressed concern about
gains by the yen, as a higher yen makes this country's exports less
cost-competitive abroad and decreases the value of overseas
earnings when repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.84 yen, down
from 104.97 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices were lower early Friday as many
players sold export-related shares because of the stronger yen.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last few days, the yen has appreciated, which is not so
good for export-related issues,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a
strategist at Daiwa Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.99 points
to 10,164.92 points at Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 13.38 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,705.10.
The TOPIX had closed down 6.76 points, or 0.39 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in early trading. On Thursday, it settled at 1.7800
percent and its price stood at 100.16.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Mobil Sells Calif. Refinery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. announced Thursday it has
reached a deal to sell a refinery and 340 service stations in
California to Valero Energy Corp. for $895 million.
</P>
<P>
   The giant oil company had agreed to sell the refinery and
stations as a condition for winning regulators' approval of last
year's merger between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators had asked Irving-based Exxon Mobil to sell the
refinery in Benicia, just northeast of San Francisco, to an
independent oil company in order to avoid further concentrating the
refining industry in California, which is burdened by gasoline
prices above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Other bidders for the refinery had included Ultramar Diamond
Shamrock Corp. and Tesoro Petroleum Corp. Like Valero, both are
based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to imagine a better strategic investment for Valero
and its shareholders,'' said Bill Greehey, Valero's chairman and
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ''The retail business is a natural growth area for Valero
because retail margins tend to be counter-cyclical to those in
refining,'' he said. ''And, our strategic plan has been to enter
the retail business through a major acquisition where we could also
acquire an experienced management team in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Greehey said the acquisition position would immediately add to
both earnings and cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Valero has five other refineries with a combined daily capacity
of 735,000 barrels. With four plants in Texas and Louisiana, Valero
is the largest independent refiner on the Gulf Coast. The Benicia
refinery has a capacity of 130,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission required Exxon Mobil to sell the
refinery and 2,431 service stations and other assets. In December,
Exxon Mobil sold 1,740 stations in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
states to Stamford, Conn.-based Tosco Corp. for $860 million.

<HEADLINE> $5.5M to Woman in Unisys Bias Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A federal jury has awarded $5.5 million to a
former Unisys Corp. employee who claimed the computer company laid
her off because she was a woman with children.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Morton, 44, of Troy sued Unisys in 1996, two years
after she and 124 other Detroit employees lost their jobs in a
companywide restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Morton worked as a consultant for Unisys and was an ''absolute
top-notch performer'' for her 17 years with the Blue Bell,
Pa.-based company, said her attorney, Raymond J. Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was told by the (personnel) director at their Chicago
regional office that she had been let go because she was a woman
with children,'' Sterling said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Morton and her husband, also a Unisys employee, had three
children when she lost her job. They now have four.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys ''stereotypically and illegally thought'' that Morton
would not be able to handle increased travel as Unisys moved from
being a mainframe computer supplier to a consulting company,
Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys spokesman Brian Daly denied the company discriminated on
the basis of sex when it laid off Morton and indicated an appeal
was likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unisys vehemently disagrees with the jury's verdict,'' Daly
said. ''Our attorneys will consider all avenues for review of this
decision and then take appropriate vigorous action.''
</P>
<P>
   Unisys has 36,000 employees worldwide and had 1999 revenues of
$7.54 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to fair employment, regardless of sex, race,
sexual orientation, religion,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   The case went to trial Feb. 10 before U.S. District Judge Denise
Page Hood. The eight jurors deliberated for less than a day before
reaching the verdict Wednesday, Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Morton $294,000 for lost wages and fringe
benefits from 1994 until now, $3.1 million for future losses of
wages and benefits and $2.1 million for emotional distress and
damaged reputation, Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's just elated that the jury say that it was the company's
fault and not hers,'' Sterling said. ''She hopes that this is a
victory for working mothers everywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Democrat Fund-Raiser Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal jury Thursday convicted a friend and
political supporter of Vice President Al Gore for arranging more
than $100,000 in illegal donations during the 1996 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated less than two days before finding Maria
Hsia, who started raising money for Gore more than a decade ago,
guilty of five felony counts, each carrying a five-year maximum
prison term. No date has been scheduled for sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict resonated on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called Hsia ''a friend and political supporter'' and said
''it's a hard day for her,'' but the vice president declined
further comment when asked about the verdict while campaigning in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans expressed surprise, suggesting that the Justice
Department has failed to pursue the fund-raising scandal
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, who has made campaign finance a central theme
of his presidential bid, said: ''She was a low-level accomplice. We
will never know the extent of the corruption that took place in the
1996 campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who is more surprised -- me or the Justice
Department,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who headed up the
Senate campaign fund-raising probe and has criticized Attorney
General Janet Reno for not seeking an independent counsel to
investigate administration higher-ups in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Reno defended the department's work, saying there have been
prosecutions of a corporation and 21 people besides Hsia.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Nancy Luque, who has motions pending before the
judge seeking an acquittal in the Hsia case, said: ''The thing's
still alive. It's not dead yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged that Hsia tapped a Buddhist temple and some
of her well-to-do business clients for money to reimburse straw
donors who were listed as the contributors in campaign records.
Hsia was charged with causing false statements to be filed with the
Federal Election Commission. According to evidence presented in the
case, $109,000 in reimbursed donations went to Clinton-Gore '96,
the Democratic Party and the campaign of Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Video footage was played at the trial showing the vice president
attending the now-infamous donor event at a Buddhist temple in
Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, a Clinton appointee, ordered
that the courtroom tape -- likely attack fodder on the campaign
trail -- be kept out of the public domain until the trial's end.
</P>
<P>
   When controversy erupted after the event, the vice president
said he hadn't known he was attending a fund-raiser, that he
thought it was community outreach. After documents turned up
referring to the event in advance as a fund-raiser, Gore modified
his characterization, saying he had thought it was finance-related.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson said it's
time for the ''Clinton-Gore Justice Department ... to get beyond
the small-fry and take on the major players like Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, former Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang,
the central figure in the campaign fund-raising scandal, testified
that Hsia handed him an envelope containing $100,000 the day after
he and Hsia discussed the fact that the event hadn't raised much
money, despite Gore's appearance. Much of the money was illegally
reimbursed from temple funds.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented evidence that the alleged reimbursement
scheme extended to contributions for Kennedy's House campaign.
Witnesses testified that Hsia got five blank checks from the
Buddhist temple and reimbursed five donors, including herself, in
connection with a temple fund-raiser that Kennedy attended.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia's lawyers said there was no evidence that Hsia was aware of
the reimbursements from the Gore fund-raiser, but prosecutors
introduced canceled checks suggesting that on three instances from
1993 to 1996 Hsia used temple funds to reimburse her own political
donations. Hsia did not testify at the trial, but her lawyers said
the money was for public relations work Hsia had done for the
temple.

<HEADLINE> Whitman threatens state colleges with aid loss for fire violations  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- State colleges and universities risk losing
millions of dollars in state aid if they do not make
''substantial'' progress in correcting fire code violations, Gov.
Christie Whitman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman wrote letters to the college presidents a month after
the Jan. 19 fire at Seton Hall University that claimed three lives
and critically injured six others.
</P>
<P>
   In the Feb. 18 letter, which wasn't publicly released until
Thursday, she warned the college officials of the potential monthly
penalties if they do not correct their fire code violations within
30 days. They range from $3.6 million for Montclair State
University, to $1.5 million for Ramapo College.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a concern we obviously have,'' she said. ''The state
is going to be monitoring and will be withholding funds if they
don't come into compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Community Affairs, which inspects state
institutions for fire code compliance, has found more than 1,000
violations at publicly funded colleges and universities. None of
them are considered major enough to trigger immediate closure,
according to Bill Cane, director of the department's Division of
Fire Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The violations were found during inspections of classroom and
dormitory buildings conducted at various times over the past year,
Cane said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 389 violations were found at Ramapo, 368 at Montclair,
189 at William Paterson University, 124 at Kean University, 43 at
The College of New Jersey and 14 at The Richard Stockton College of
New Jersey. There were at least four found at Rowan University, but
Cane said he did not know the total.
</P>
<P>
   The number of violations for the remaining state colleges and
universities was not available. County colleges were not included
because they don't have dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Seton Hall, a private school, was cited for 825
violations, none of which were classified as posing imminent
danger, Cane said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the violations are common throughout the college system,
according to Department of Community Affairs spokesman E.J.
Miranda. They include overuse of extension wires, improper use of
cooking devices in dorm rooms and inoperative smoke detectors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to deny aid payments may involve some judgment
calls, said Cane and Whitman's spokeswoman, Jayne O'Connor. For
example, the state may withhold partial payment for partial
compliance, or may release full funding if officials believe the
college is making ''substantial progress'' toward making their
facility safe.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's directive applies only to the state institutions
because, unlike private colleges and universities, the state cannot
fine the state schools for fire code violations, O'Connor
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed some sort of hammer to make sure all the violations
are addressed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shelly, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of State
College and Universities, said he would have ''no comment on the
negative sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the wake of the Seton Hall tragedy, our colleges are making
every effort to fulfill the spirit of the law and adhere to the
regulations to the extent possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda said the colleges had a mixed record of correcting
violations prior to the governor's letter. In the two weeks since
it was sent, they have improved their performance, he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Education IRAs  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring a veto threat, the Senate passed a
bill Thursday that would expand tax-free savings accounts to
include elementary and secondary school education and allow parents
to use the money for private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed the measure, which passed 61-37, as an
assault on the nation's public school system and the beginning step
towards school vouchers. The vote was six shy of the two-thirds
that would be needed to override a veto. Administration officials
said last week they would recommend that President Clinton veto it,
as he has twice in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly what this bill is, is a shined up version of vouchers
that is going to steal money from public tax dollars to go to
private schools,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would increase the contribution level from the
current $500 to $2,000 and allow the tax-free earnings to be used
for expenses, including transportation and tutors, associated with
any school -- public, private or parochial -- from kindergarten
through the 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Robb, D-Va., said Congress continues to ''play this
game that diverts resources that could be used in the public school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get to the point where we are fully meeting our
obligations with respect to public education, I think it would be
great to help education in all areas but not until we have fully
met our responsibilities,'' Robb said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hailed the measure as the first step in giving the
nation's education system a much-needed boost. A few Democratic
supporters contended the measure was worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   ''No senator can come to this floor with any proposal solving
every problem,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, the
Democratic co-author of the bill. The education savings accounts
are ''the opening shot in a revolution in American education.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., sponsor of the bill with Torricelli,
said the bill was ''historic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents new ideas in education reform for the new
millennium,'' Coverdell said. ''I only hope that President Clinton
will join the Senate in its rejection of the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to attach several amendments
dealing with teacher quality, school construction and social
promotion. One that did pass, 91-7, by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.,
would establish a $7 million grant program to educate students and
parents about the dangers of gun violence, including safe gun
storage. The measure was prompted by this week's shooting of a
6-year-old girl at a Michigan school.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would also make savings in prepaid tuition plans
tax-free and expand tax breaks for employer-provided educational
assistance, is a mainstay of the Republican agenda for improving
K-12 education.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has not yet come up in the House, where its
prospects are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Education savings accounts have existed since 1997 to help
families save for college, but Republicans want parents to have the
option of using the money to pay for secondary and elementary
education also.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is opposed by teachers' unions, and Clinton vetoed a
similar bill in 1998. He said the benefits mainly go to richer
families and that the plan would drain money away from the public
school system. Last year, education savings accounts were part of
the Republican's $792 billion tax cut plan that the president
vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans added provisions to raise the income levels a
married couple could earn and still participate in the program from
a $160,000 maximum to $220,000. Lawmakers also passed a proposal by
Delaware Sen. William Roth, the Finance Committee chairman, to
allow the budget surplus to pay for the proposal, estimated to cost
less than $10 billion over 10 years. Roth's amendment also makes
the program permanent; it was originally scheduled to last until
2003.

<HEADLINE> White couple go to court to get back the black baby born to them  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A white couple has asked a state appeals court
to let them regain custody of a black baby boy that was born to
them because of an embryo mixup in a Manhattan fertility clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Donna Fasano of Staten Island want the infant back
because they say the boy's genetic parents have broken an agreement
that guaranteed that the birth mother, Mrs. Fasano, could visit the
boy periodically.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was born to Mrs. Fasano, 37, along with a white boy on
Dec. 29, 1998. Fasano had the black baby because she was
accidentally implanted with the embryos of a black woman, as well
as with her own embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning that Mrs. Fasano had given birth to their
biological child, Deborah Perry-Rogers and husband Robert Rogers of
Teaneck, N.J., sought custody of him. The Fasanos relinquished
custody after several meetings and an agreement that provided for
frequent visits between the child and Mrs. Fasano.
</P>
<P>
   In July, State Supreme Court Justice Diane Lebedeff made the
agreement a court order. She also gave the Rogerses custody of the
baby -- born Joseph Fasano and renamed Akeil Rogers -- and ordered
that his birth certificate be changed to name the Rogerses as his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Rogerses asked the State Supreme Court's
Appellate Division to void the agreement and stop the visitation.
They contended that Lebedeff never had the authority to order the
visits, and in any case, the two couples did not get along with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the appeals court stayed Lebedeff's order, stopping
the visitation until a full five-judge panel can hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Fasanos petitioned the same court, asking to
regain custody of the baby. They say Lebedeff erred and abused her
discretion when she gave the Rogerses custody.
</P>
<P>
   The Fasanos are relying on a procedural technicality. They say
that because the Rogerses had officially dropped all legal action
against them after they gave up physical custody of the baby in
May, Lebedeff had no case before her in which to order any changes
in the baby's status.
</P>
<P>
   The Rogerses lawyer, Bernard Clair, said, ''This appeal signals
that the Fasanos, having been thwarted in their visitation
attempts, are now seeking to throw this case into a full-blown
custody fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Their chances of prevailing are poor,'' Clair said of the
Fasanos. ''We doubt the Rogerses needed the Fasanos consent for
custody at all once the DNA tests revealed that they were Akeil's
genetic parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fasanos lawyer, Ivan Tantleff, was unavailable for comment.

<HEADLINE> Abduction ends in suspect's surrender  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)-- The alleged armed abduction of two women
ended peacefully early Thursday evening after the suspect turned
himself in to state police.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Bennefield, 22, of Buffalo faces charges including two
counts of kidnapping, one count of unauthorized use of a motor
vehicle and criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Bennefield allegedly used a shotgun to force two women from
their car into a stolen car about 9 a.m. He then drove on
Interstate 190 from Buffalo to Grand Island, where one of the women
jumped out, state police said. She was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   State police said the second woman was also not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Police described Bennefield as an acquaintance of one of the
women, whose identities were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were able to establish contact with Bennefield and
arrange for him to turn himself in with the help of his family and
his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Bennefield will be arraigned in Buffalo City Court Friday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Japan's GDP Picking Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's gross domestic product shrank in the
October-December quarter but economic activity has since increased,
the head of the Economic Planning Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taichi Sakaiya said he believes GDP figures for the quarter that
ended in December will be negative, but did not give a specific
estimate. The official figures are to be released later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (GDP data) will be negative,'' he told a regular news
conference. ''The figure will be low, but I have a feeling that the
situation after that is quite strong,''
</P>
<P>
   Sakaiya cited consumption as recovering ''strongly'' in January
from its slump late last year, and noted that wage-earner spending
increased 2.3 percent in January from the prior month.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile sales were up from a year ago, net exports were a
source of strength in January, and data released earlier this week
showing there were 52 jobs available for every 100 people seeking
work in January also indicated there were bright signs in the labor
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is struggling to emerge from its worst slump in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government expects GDP -- the sum of all goods and
services produced in the economy -- to grow 0.6 percent for this
fiscal year, which ends March 31.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first GDP increase in three years.
