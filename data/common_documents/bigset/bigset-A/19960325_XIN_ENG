ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish foreign ministry
spokesman today hinted that Ankara would normalize its relations
with Belgrade by sending a new ambassador there once the situation
in the region becomes calm.
</P>
<P>
Omer Akbel, the spokesman, told a press conference that Turkey
intended to develop its relations with all countries in the
Balkans, including the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that Turkey would upgrade its relations
with Belgrade, Akbel said he would "neither deny nor confirm"
the reports.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency
reported that Turkish president Suleyman Demirel planned to visit
Sarajevo, Belgrade and Zagreb at a suitable time, probably this
summer.
</P>
<P>
To pave way for such a visit, Ankara would first send a new
ambassador to Belgrade, said Anatolia.
</P>
<P>
During the conflicts in former Yugoslavia, Turkey has sided
with Bosnian Muslims, thereby bringing about a low ebb in
bilateral relations between Ankara and Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Rural Namibia Gets Solar Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A rural electrification
program using solar energy was launched today in Windhoek,
capital of Namibia, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to serve people in remote areas where
low energy demand makes them uneconomical to connect up to the
national electricity grid.
</P>
<P>
The pilot phase of the project, aimed to provide revolving
credit to 1,000 rural households over the next few months, is
financed by the Namibian government and the American
non-government organization, Renewable Energy for African
Development (REFAD).
</P>
<P>
A total of 100,000 households are scheduled to be supplied
during the full phase of the project that runs to 1999. The
Norwegian donor agency, Norad, is also expected to make a
contribution to the project.
</P>
<P>
A team of 40 local technicians has been specially trained to
install and maintain the systems.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, a country of 824,000 square kilometers with a
population of 1.58 million, enjoys 327 sunny days a year,
according to statistics.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Timely Police Deployment in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali called on contributing governments to
provide qualified personnel for the U.N. operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council available here today, the
secretary-general noted that more than three months after it began
recruiting an international police force for Bosnia, only 650
police officers, or less than half of the total of 1,721, have
been deployed there.
</P>
<P>
"Because many member states were unable to make police officers
immediately available, deployment of the task force was delayed,"
he reported.
</P>
<P>
"One of the major problems encountered in the deployment of the
task force has been the availability and professional suitability
of police personnel offered by member states," he noted.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 10 percent of the police officers were rejected
because they failed a driving test or had a poor command of
English -- the working language of the police force.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which promised to send 200 police officers,
has sent 33 only.
</P>
<P>
Following the peace accords reached in Dayton, Ohio of the
United States, last November, a NATO-led force replaced the United
Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia. The United Nations was
assigned an international police force to help train, advise and
monitor local police.
</P>
<P>
As some NATO officers suggested that the U.N. police would have
guaranteed the safety of Serbs in and around Sarajevo,
Boutros-Ghali stressed that it is not feasible to assign the task
of enforcing law and order in a country awash with weapons to the
U.N. police which is an unarmed, monitoring and advisory force.

<HEADLINE> WHO Says Health Situation in Iraq Alarming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The health situation in Iraq is
deteriorating at an alarming speed as a result of sanctions, the
World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The resources for the United Nations humanitarian assistance
programs there are not sufficient, said WHO, which thought the
situation would be improved if Iraq's frozen assets could be used
to pay for food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Five years after the 1991 Gulf War, said WHO in a report, the
majority of the Iraqi population are living in a state of
quasi-starvation due to lack of food and money to buy it.
</P>
<P>
Food prices increased sharply, most of them on the free market
being several hundred times those in the past, it added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, malnutrition among children is very common; so are
nutritional anaemia and vitamin A deficiency. There was in 1991 a
re-emergence of Kwashiorkor and marasmus, the most alarming forms
of protein-energy mulnutrition, which have almost disappeared from
most developing countries.
</P>
<P>
War and its aftermath have pulled the country's health care
level back to at least 50 years ago. The country's enlarged
vaccination program collapsed. Malaria, cholera, typhoid fever and
other epidemics occurred.
</P>
<P>
During 1990 to 1994, an intense outbreak of malaria attacked
three Northern governorates in the country, occurring in 2,600
among per 100,000 persons, compared to the pre-war level of 95 per
100,000, and expanded to other regions free of the disease prior
to war.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, mortality for children under five
increased six-fold, according to Iraq's official data covering 15
of its 18 governorates.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Bagdad, mortality for children doubled, while
a similar increase was estimated in maternal mortality though
specific data were not available.
</P>
<P>
The number of underweight newborn babies was nearly six times
that before, with one among every five babies below the standard
weight, said the WHO report, which is based on Iraq's official
data and information collected by WHO and other U.N. agencies as
well as non-governmental organizations.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua)-- The Lesotho government will
this week ask the international donor community for about 580
million Rand (about 153 million US Dollars) to finance the
development projects over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Maseru before the forthcoming
international donor meeting, Lesotho's Finance and Economic
Planning Minister Moeketsi Senoana said, his government would
submit to the meeting sectoral programs on health, population,
agriculture, environment and tourism, which were crucial for
promoting sustainable growth and alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
Senoana said the ''financing gap'' of about 153 million US
Dollars between the five sectors would be closed through
mobilization of resources from several sources, but mainly from
foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting was aimed at gaining donor's financial and
technical support.
</P>
<P>
Senoana also said the Lesotho government wanted to strengthen
bilateral relationship with its development partners and broaden
consensus between the government and the donors on sectoral
politics, priorities and strategies.
</P>
<P>
The international donor meeting was a follow-up of the recent
conference between the Lesotho government and the international
donor community in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled to be opened by Lesotho Prime
Minister Ntsu Mokhele on Tuesday in Maseru and co-chaired by Anne

MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A record increase of unemployment
was recorded in Russia in February, with the total number of
jobless reaching 2,58,000 by the end of the month, the Press
Center of the Russian Employment Service (FES) said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed grew by 149,800 only in February, the
FES said, adding that the figure means an increase of 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to FES experts, the scope of unemployment differs by
regions. It is much easier for Muscovites to find jobs and the
unemployment level is minimal in Moscow, they added.
</P>
<P>
The FES did not specify the reasons for the growing
unemployment rate. However, some economists here link this problem
to difficulties in the country's economy which is facing reforms.

LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua)-- Zambian Home Affairs Minister

laws to fight the drug trafficking and money laundering in Zambia
and the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Sampa said the creation of an independent professionally-run
drug enforcement commission in the country was a clear testimony
of the government's desire to win such a battle.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while officially opening a 10-day drug
enforcement regional workshop here.
</P>
<P>
The government had put in place very tough legislation to
enable the commission to investigate and prosecute suspects
effectively, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances act of
1993 contained adequate provisions to empower the judiciary system
to mete out deterrent sentences against offenders.
</P>
<P>
The regional workshop came at the most appropriate time when
the need for international liaison was greatly required to stem
the threatening tide of the notorious trade in narcotic drugs, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The workshop has drawn participants from Botswana, Namibia,
Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia.

AMMAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti met here today with visiting Israeli Minister at
Prime Minister's Office Yossi Beilin and discussed continued
closure of Palestinian territories and its impact on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also touched upon scopes of bilateral economic
cooperation as well as economic agreements signed between Jordan
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister told reporters after the meeting that
Israel understood the strains caused by its blockade of West Bank
and Gaza Strip following a wave of suicide bombings in Israel
since February 25, adding that his country would ease the measures.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that once the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
takes effective measures to put an end to terrorism, the closure
will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Israel planned to expel the Palestinians to
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The PNA had asked for Jordan's good office to lift the Israeli
closure which has caused thousands of Palestinians unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, also held talks
with the visiting Israeli minister.

<P>
ATHENS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece today rejected a Turkish
proposal for bilateral talks to solve the disputes between the
two countries, insisting Ankara should first show moves of peace
instead of threats.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said Greece's past efforts
to sit down at the negotiating table with Turkey had borne no
results and it would be pointless to resume such a course of
action unless self-evident prerequisites had been met.
</P>
<P>
These were respect for international law and conventions,
renunciation of violence, and referral of disputes to the
international court at the Hague, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz proposed Sunday in Ankara
the holding of negotiations without preconditions with Greece.
</P>
<P>
"I invite greece to begin negotiations without preconditions,
with the aim of facing the questions of the Aegean as a whole," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a dispatch by the semi-official Athens news agency
from Ankara today said Yilmaz has sent a message to Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis explaining more fully the policy outlined
at his press conference Sunday. Ankara reportedly stressed in the
message that the Turkish policy is not linked to the Turkey-EU
Association council meeting scheduled for Tuesday, but is part of
a long-term procedure.
</P>
<P>
Athens has vowed to block the EU aid to Turkey at Tuesday's
association council meeting unless Turkey renounces the use of
force, respects existing borders and refers any disputes with
Greece to the international court at the Hague.

MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A new round of tripartite talks on
the settlement of the conflict in and around Nagorno-Karabakh
started her today, focusing on the disputed region's status and
security.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, the process of which was on the whole
proceeding with great difficulties, are mediated by the
co-chairmen of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) Minsk conference in Nagorno-Karabakh representing
Russia and Finland, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The delegations from Armenia and Azerbaijan are led by their
deputy foreign ministers -- Vardan Oskanian for Armenia and Tofik
Zulfugarov for Azerbaijan. Arkady Gukasian leads the team from
Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president's envoy to the talks, Ambassador Vladimir
Kazimirov, said today, "The participants in this meeting will
continue to discuss the text of the agreement on the termination
of the armed conflict and the key problems associated with the
settlement -- the problems of Lachin, Shusha, Shaumian district as
well as Nagorno-Karabakh's status and security."
</P>
<P>
The Azeri side has accused the Armenia of seizing its regions
such as Lachin, Shusha and Shaumian and of backing
Nagorno-Karabakh (populated mainly by ethnic Armenians) in efforts
to declare independent from Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Kazimirov said he had recently visited the conflict zone
together with Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris
Aastukhov for talks with representatives of the parties to the
bloody conflict, which has lasted several years.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "Russia's shuttle diplomacy is fully coordinated and
combined with our work in the negotiating process in our capacity
as co-chairmen of the Minsk conference."
</P>
<P>
"The parties with difficulty depart from their starting
maximalistic positions and are highly reluctant to meet one
another halfway," Kazimirov pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks scheduled to end on March 29 will be
followed by consultations within the framework of the OSCE Minsk
group for Nagorno-Karabakh without the participation of the
conflicting sides.

<P>
"I basically believe that defining whether this operation will
be in Lebanon or in another place and defining the kind of this
operation is impossible," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
On a Tuesday visit by former U.S. President George Bush to
Lebanon, Boueiz announced that the former U.S. president comes to
Lebanon "on an invitation which I delivered to him from President
of the Lebanese Republic (Elias Hrawi) during my presence in New
York one year and a half ago."
</P>
<P>
"He visits Lebanon within a framework of his trip in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And it is undoubted that his visit is important since it
proves the (U.S.) concern for Lebanon and proves a possibility
for an (American) president or an official to visit Lebanon
without a fear of his security," the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Washington still refuses to lift a ban on American citizens'
travel to Lebanon on the grounds that the security of
U.S. interests in this country can not be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration imposed the travel ban in the middle of
the 1980s following a series of terrorist attacks on Americans,
including kidnapping, killing and hijacking airplanes, by radical
Lebanese and Palestinian militant groups in the darkest days of
the Lebanese civil war.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Secretary General of the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry Taher Al-Hassan, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Richard
Jones announced that Bush's one-day visit to Lebanon Tuesday is
"private" and he will meet the Lebanese president and other
members of the government.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States guarantees an Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon and the Golan Heights, the
U.S. diplomat answered, "I did not understand well this question."
</P>
<P>
"But I believe that the United States does not guarantee
anything at this moment and the peace process should be activated
before anything else," he added.

<HEADLINE> Power, Water In Short Supply In Luanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Continuous power and water supply
cuts in the Angolan capital in the present hot rain season has
posed great difficulties for the residents' normal life.
</P>
<P>
Today is the eighth day after water supply stopped, because
the water plant in the suburb of Luanda cannot supply water as
its power lines have been interrupted by heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Although almost households in Luanda have their own water
storage equipment, lack of water for such a long time has caused
their storage water running out, which has posed great challenges
to people's life here.
</P>
<P>
Water and power cuts are very common in the capital, because
the power and water supply facilities are easy to break down,
especially in rain season annually, as they are poor and have
long been out of repair.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Peace Process Depends on Israeli Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here today that the future of the Middle East peace
process, to a large degree, hangs on the Israeli general
elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the remarks at the 45th general assembly of the
International Press Institute (IPI), which held its opening
session today in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if the Labor Party wins in the elections,
scheduled to be held on May 29, it will continue its peace talks
with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres criticized the policies of Likud, main
opposition party in the current Knesset (Israel's parliament),
toward the Middle East peace process, warning that Likud would
stop negotiations with Israel's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On the four-week long closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Peres said the closure is one of the security measures to prevent
terrorist attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a total closure on the Palestinian autonomous
areas following a series of suicide bombing attacks since February
25, which left more than 60 dead and over 150 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been pressing the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) to crack down on Palestinian extremist military groups
operating inside the Palestinian self-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials stressed that the closure will continue
until the heads of terrorist groups, which claimed responsibility
for the suicide attacks, are caught by the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to more than 300 editors from the IPI, Peres noted
that the PNA "started to recognize that Hamas and Jihad are
dangerous to them" and had acted seriously against terrorists in
the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the PNA will get rid of terrorists
in order to continue the peace process between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peres pointed out that the Islamic fundamentalism is a main
danger to the world peace, and called for a global sanction
against the regimes that support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The IPI will continue its assembly on "the Future of the
Mideast Peace Process" this week with addresses from Israeli
senior officials and top Arab diplomats to Israel.

<HEADLINE> 36 Violent Crimes Every Hour in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Violent crime rose by 7 percent
last year, to a rate of 36 crimes every hour in Britain, the
tabloid Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The statistics, quoted by the newspaper, which will be released
by the Home Office Tuesday, show an inexorable increase in violent
crime up by 5,000 to 316,500.
</P>
<P>
In England and Wales, violent robberies have gone up by 7
percent to more than 64,000, against just half that number 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The danger seems to be even greater in some areas. People in
London, for example, have a one in four chance of becoming a
victim of car crime and a one in 45 chance of becoming a victim of
violent crime.
</P>
<P>
In order to crack down on the mounting crimes, Britain's Police
Superintendents' Association will convene a meeting Tuesday, which
is expected to make a series of recommendations on gun controls to
the government.
</P>
<P>
It is increasingly urgent to strengthen gun controls since
March 9, when six children and a woman teacher were killed in a
massacre in a primary school in Dunblane, a small town in central
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at least three million illegal firearms are
circulating across the country.
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed that they have revoked gun licenses held by
gun owners suspected of being mentally unstable.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Medical Workers' Strike Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The medical workers in Angola's
capital area have ended their 30-day strike and returned to work
today.
</P>
<P>
Outpatient departments of major hospitals in Luanda are open,
with more medical workers and patients than in the past few days.
Some hospitals also restarted to receive inpatients.
</P>
<P>
Only after the Health Ministry met their demands for salary
rise and improvement of living and working conditions after
negotiations, did the medical workers agree to return to work.
</P>
<P>
The medical workers went on strike because the Health Ministry
had not met their aboved demands. During the strike, all
departments of the hospitals in the area stopped their work
except for only few departments, such as emergency departments,
dispensaries.
</P>
<P>
Angola is deficient in medicine and medical workers. At
present, it is a rain season during which malaria and cholera are
easy to spread. Therefore, the strike of the medical workers in
the capital has caused great difficulties for patients.

<HEADLINE> No Danger Of Mad Cow Disease In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government moved
fast on Monday to diffuse a latest health scare over the mad cow
disease and assured the nation of total protection from the
scourge threatening to ground British beef industry to a halt.
</P>
<P>
Veterinary Services Department Deputy Director Welbourne
Madzima said today several measures including strict import
controls had been effected to rule out chances of the disease
spreading to Zimbabwe from Britain.
</P>
<P>
''There is no need for people to start panicking, we are
monitoring the situation,'' Madzima said.
</P>
<P>
The move came in the wake of reports that neighboring South
Africa which is Britain's most valuable export market outside
Europe, last Friday joined other countries banning import of the
meat because of fears of the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is a net exporter of beef and does not import the
commodity.
</P>
<P>
Madzima said Zimbabwe also did not import live cattle from the
UK, but semen and embryos subjected to strict veterinary import
controls.
</P>
<P>
''We emphasize that the beast from which the semen of the
embryo is extracted must be free of any infectious disease,''
Madzima said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Madzima said local cattle which died from any
nervous disorders were thoroughly examined to rule out the bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) mad cow disease. ''to-date our
tests have ruled out any suspicions of the BSE locally,'' Madzima
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he would unveil his plans to end the 15-month-long
Chechen war on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The decision-making Russian Security Council on March 16
adopted a final plan for the settlement of the crisis in the
breakaway Chechnya. Yeltsin said that he would reveal the details
in a TV address on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the statement earlier this morning before he left
here beginning a two-day visit to Norway.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, Russian troops have speeded up their
operations in Chechnya, particularly in its southern and
south-western regions, to wipe out armed Chechen rebels loyal to
separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev this morning flew to the
Chechen capital of Grozny, the second trip for the minister to the
breakaway republic this month. No reasons for his trip were given
today.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people, who were mostly civilians, have been
killed since Russian troops poured into separatist Chechnya in
December 1994 to reassert the Kremlin's control.

<HEADLINE> New 100 U.S. Dollar Note Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The issuance of newly designed
100-U.S.-dollar notes, with more security features, was officially
launched here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The occasion was marked by a satellite press conference
conducted by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve,
together with the U.S. Ambassador to Russia, a major publication
effort about the new note, which will reach local banks Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The note carries eight major features which are expected to
enhance security against advancing technologies which could be
used for counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
The most visible feature is that the portrait of Benjamin
Franklin, the American philosopher and inventor in the 18th
century, has been enlarged significantly and positioned
off-center.
</P>
<P>
Color-shifting ink has been used in the lower right corner on
the front of the note which makes the number "100" looks green
when viewed straight on, but appears black when viewed at an
angle.
</P>
<P>
Microprinting is another feature which has managed to print
"United States of America" onto the coat of Benjamin Franklin and
"USA 100" within the number in the lower left corner.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a "more secured" security thread and watermark
have been used to guard against counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
"Today we do have a secure currency, but we must stay ahead
of the rush of technology," Robert Rubin, secretary of the
Treasury, said at the satellite press conference.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will not recall the currency now in
circulation. New notes will replace the older series notes as they
are returned to the Federal Reserve, said William McDonough,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials said the total cost of developing the new
design was approximately 765,000 U.S. dollars. More than 850
million of the 100 U.S. notes have been printed and the new
series will be printed at the rate of about 150 million notes
per month.
</P>
<P>
The smaller denominations -- 50 dollar, 20 dollar, 10 dollar, 5
dollar and 1 dollar -- will be introduced into circulation at the
rate of about one a year.

<HEADLINE> Latin American 1995 Economic Growth Slows Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in Latin
America and the Caribbean region slowed sharply in 1995, falling
to only 0.6 percent as compared with 5 percent in 1994, the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) said.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report 1995 made public here today, the IDB said
the decline reflects recessions experienced by Argentina and
Mexico. Excluding these two countries, the rate of growth for the
region was 4.2 percent, down only slightly from the 4.9 percent
recorded in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Chile grew most rapidly in 1995, at or in excess of 7
percent while El Salvador and Guyana are estimated to have grown
at more than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican economy is estimated to have contracted by 7
percent, while Argentine growth is estimated to have fallen 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports for the region rose about 7.5 percent, but real
consumption fell, the IDB noted.
</P>
<P>
The median rate of inflation fell from 12.8 percent in 1994 to
10.5 percent in 1995, lower than in any year since 1978.
</P>
<P>
Total capital flows to the region dropped to 30 billion U.S.
dollars as against 44 billion dollars in 1994. Capital flows to
Argentina and Mexico declined sharply, while capital flows to
other countries of the region increased slightly.

MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Russian presidential aide today
stressed that Russia and Belarus are not making efforts to build

Before departure for visit to Norway today, Yeltsin told

<P>
However, he admitted that Belarus "has gone much further than
the other CIS (the Commonwealth of Independent States) countries
along the road of integration, practically advancing towards the
unification of the two states."
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow, Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko declared on Saturday that Moscow and Minsk will create
a "union" linking the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there will be in the union a single flag and
a single anthem, a single monetary system and superleading bodies,
but Russia and Belarus will maintain their own independent
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the statement, Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin's
spokesman Sergei Medvedev later Saturday explained further details
of the union-creation plan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's news conference, Ryurikov also confirmed
that the presidents of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzia
will sign in Moscow a package of documents on integration on
March 29.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the documents to be signed do not provide for
the formation of a military union but for the formation of a
single economic space on the territory of the CIS, which came into
being after the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Seeks Poll Boycott in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), wants republican parties to boycott
the Northern Ireland elections to a negotiating forum designed by
the British government.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, Sinn Fein held its
annual party conference in Dublin last weekend. Although delegates
at the conference left the decision on whether the party will
contest the elections to the leadership, Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams and the party's chief strategist Martin McGuinness both
stressed that Sinn Fein should boycott the elections.
</P>
<P>
Adams told the conference that the election situation remained
problematic and that this issue had to be fully discussed by the
party leadership.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness frankly said, "Our preference is for
non-participation in both the elections and the elected body."
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein seems to be seeking a concerted action with
the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP), the largest Catholic
party in Ulster which favors reunification of the whole island of
Ireland but opposes the campaign of violence by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that if the SDLP decided to take part in the
elections, Sinn Fein would probably go along them to contest the
poll.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Financial Times newspaper, Sinn
Fein showed no mood for compromise at its party conference and the
party leadership seemed to have agreed that an imminent restoration
of the IRA cease-fire was not on the cards.
</P>
<P>
A poll showed that 85 percent of the delegates backed the
resumption of violence by the IRA, while 70 percent opposed any
move to reinstate the cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> UK Criticized Over Handling of BSE Crisis </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) agriculture
commissioner Franz Fischler has launched fierce verbal attacks
upon the British government's handling of the Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg,
Fischler expressed his anger over Britain's lack of consultation
with the EU Commission while announcing the public statement on
BSE or "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the British government of failing to prepare
adequately for the reaction to its statement on a possible link
between BSE and it human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(CJD).
</P>
<P>
"If the new findings of your scientists are as troubling as
they sound, then measures you announced seem insufficient," the EU
commissioner said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
The abrupt announcement had made the EU commission to act
"without the benefit of results of additional research on the
matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 10 EU countries and a growing number
of other countries have announced bans on British beef as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
The British government is considering to slaughter all the
cattle herds aged over 30 months in an effort to root out the BSE
disease.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in
U.S. shot up 6.5 percent in February as buyers took advantage of
low mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said today that the
sales of existing homes, or previously-owned homes, reached a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, up from 3.72
million in January when they declined by 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In February, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.08
percent, up slightly from 7.03 percent in January but well below
the 8.77 percent rate in the same month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Realtors said low mortgage rates were driving the market.
Realtors economist John A. Tuccillo said for every percentage
point drop in rates, an additional 250,000 to 300,000 families can
afford to buy a home. He predicted the slight increase in rates in
February was temporary and the rates would bottom out around 6.8
percent this summer.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales surged 11 percent to a 910,000 annual rate in
the west, and the figures jumped 9.4 percent to 1.51 million in
the south. They were up 3.6 percent to 580,000 in the Northeast
while sales rose 1.1 percent to a 960,000 rate in the midwest.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves Record $7.3 Billion Funding in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Lending by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) in 1995 reached a total of 7.3 billion U.S.
dollars, the highest level in its history, according to the bank's
annual report 1995 made public here today.
</P>
<P>
The funding represented critical support for many countries in
Latin America and the Caribbean in areas such as financial reform,
social investments and infrastructure as well as a number of new
areas such as judicial reform and lending for private
infrastructure projects without sovereign guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's Board of Governors will review the report at its 37th
annual meeting which opens in Buenos Aires, Argentina, today. The
meeting will also analyze the evolution of the region's economies
and their financial needs.
</P>
<P>
The record lending in 1995 was 38 percent higher than that of
1994, making the IDB the largest multilateral development lender
to the region for the second consecutive year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Concessional lending, with terms of up to 40 years at very low
interest rates, reached a record 769 million dollars from the Fund
for Special Operation, which provides financing for projects in
the five poorest nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Disbursement of funds for loans in execution reached an
all-time high of 4.8 billion dollars in 1995 as compared with 3
billion dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The IDB offered strong support for Mexico with 1 billion
dollars and Argentina with some 750 million dollars to beef up
domestic financial systems and institutions, and each country
received more than 1.5 billion dollars in total loans during the
year.
</P>
<P>
The social sector absorbed large loans from the bank last year,
which included 500 million dollars for essential social services
in Mexico, 450 million dollars for social sector reforms in
Argentina, and 250 million dollars for Colombia's Social
Solidarity Network.
</P>
<P>
Loans for sanitation and urban development totaling 474 million
dollars were approved for Brazil. Besides, the IDB was the leading
international organization in providing financing for the economic
recovery in Haiti, approving four loans totaling 181 million
dollars.

BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- For Philips Electronics N.V.,

At the annual general meeting of shareholders held in

Moreover, lower demand from the personal computer (PC) industry

<HEADLINE> Israel Joins In EU Non-Nuclear Research Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) signed
today an agreement for scientific and technological cooperation
with Israel which allows the participation of this country in the
EU's fourth research and technological development framework
program.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a non-EU country is associated with
all EU non-nuclear research activities.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed today will allow Israeli research
organizations and enterprises to participate in all the
non-nuclear specific programs of the fourth framework program
(1994-1998) of the EU. There are a total of 16 such research
programs.
</P>
<P>
Reciprocally, EU researchers will have access to Israeli
projects and results in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The association of Israel with the EU framework program means
that it will contribute to the budget of the fourth framework
program and that Israeli scientists will be eligible to receive
financial support from the EU.
</P>
<P>
The first cooperation agreement between the European Community
and Israel was signed in 1975.

91 joint research projects in the fields of material engineering,
opto-electronics and neuro-sciences.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Meets with New GCC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa al Thani today met with visiting new Secretary-General of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil al Hojeilan in Doha,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad congratulated Hojeilan on his appointment of as
the new chief of the regional organization, expressing hope that
he will succeed in making contribution to the development and
cooperation process of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Hojeilan, a Saudi Arabian career diplomat, arrived in Doha
Sunday on a two-day visit to Qatar. Earlier this month, he
visited other GCC member states including Kuwait, Bahrain, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Qatar originally objected to the appointment of Hojeilan as
secretary-general of the GCC and boycotted the final session of a
GCC summit in Muscat in December 1995 due to the issue. Relations
between Qatar and other GCC members became tense.
</P>
<P>
But Qatar's relations with other GCC member states begun to
thaw following the GCC foreign ministerial meeting held in Riyadh
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber al
Thani said after the meeting that his country "has approved the
appointment of the new GCC Secretary-General following a proposal
made by Oman."

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Resumes Trial of Two Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korean today resumed the
trial of former Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo with
testimony from their closest followers.
</P>
<P>
In the third trial session today at the Seoul District Court,
prosecutors, who questioned the two ex-presidents in the previous
two sessions, questioned nine former generals for their roles in
the military mutiny on December 12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
At two previous sessions, Chun and Roh both denied any
wrongdoing in the 1979 coup that brought them to power and in a
crackdown on an uprising in the southern city of Kangju the
following year.
</P>
<P>
In the questioning today, the nine followers of the two
ex-leaders, including Chang Se-dong, the then commander of the
30th security group, argued that their arrest of then Army Chief
of Staff Chung Sung-hwa and several other loyal generals was not a
mutiny, but a legitimate and unavoidable action needed to
investigate the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors focused their questioning on the illegal nature of
their action, which led Chun, then a major general leading an
investigation into Park's assassination, to seizing power in
August 1980.
</P>
<P>
They also tried to bring to light the illegal nature of Chun
and his group's May 17, 1980 role in forcing the cabinet to
approve to expand the already declared martial law, which
disbanded the National Assembly and touched off a civil uprising
in Kwangju, Capital of South Korea's Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who ruled the country between 1980 and 1988, said in the
second trial session on March 18 that it was he who had decided to
arrest Chung and other generals, adding that only he was
responsible for the action.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former army officers including Chun and Roh have
been indicted for mutiny and treason. Thirteen of them have been
indicted on charges of mutiny or treason, or both. Treason charges
stem from their roles in the bloody crackdown of the Kwangju civil
uprising on May 18-27, 1980 that killed about 150 people and wounded
2,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Three others have been indicted for treason only, and therefore
they did not stand today's trial.
</P>
<P>
The SDPO will start the questioning on the military crackdown
on the Kwangju civil uprising on April 1. Chun, Roh and six others
are charged with both mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, have been also
indicted for graft charges as they received bribes from
businessmen while in office. Roh replaced Chun as president in
February 1988 and stepped down in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chun has stood trial once and Roh three times respectively
already on the graft charges.

<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Vice-Mayor Jin Renqing
said here today China's capital planned to open its doors even
wider to the outside world during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Mayor said that Beijing will open still wider to the
outside world during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Jin made the remark at a panel discussion in Beijing involving
Hong Kong and Macao members of the Beijing Municipal Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a top
adversary group in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan investors, and
foreigners should not doubt Beijing's resolve to step up reforms,
and open wider to the outside world, merely because a few corrupt
officials in Beijing have been exposed.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing will always unswervingly persist in the reform and
opening up, and more friends are welcome to invest in Beijing, and
seek common development," he told Hong Kong and Macao members.
</P>
<P>
"Opening Beijing to other parts of China, and the rest of the
world is indispensable to expanding Beijing's economy," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Decision on Setting up HK SAR Provisional Legislative Council Important (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The provisional legislative council is to shoulder the
responsibility of handling concrete matters concerning legislation
at the beginning of the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The council will formulate and amend laws, especially formulate
laws for the effective operation of the Hong Kong SAR in
accordance with the stipulations of the Basic Law and the legal
procedure.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the provisional legislative council,
composed of entirely permanent Hong Kong residents, is the most
appropriate way to reflect the principles of "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong", and "a high-degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the provisional legislative council has
taken into full consideration the Hong Kong people, and will be
entirely beneficial for them. Those who allege "the provisional
legislative council is illegal" are merely disregarding the power
of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the second article of the "Decision of the
National People's Congress on the Method for the Formation of the
First Government, and the First Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region", the Preparatory Committee
shall be responsible for preparing the establishment of the Hong
Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
That's to say, the matters concerning the preparing of the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR are all within the power of the
Preparatory Committee. The establishment of the provisional
legislative council obviously belongs to these matters concerning
the preparation for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee, as an organ of power established by
the NPC, has been authorized to make decisions on matters within
its functions and power, including the establishment of the
provisional legislative council.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the provisional legislative council,
therefore, is by no means illegal, but of sufficient legal and
theoretical base.
</P>
<P>
Though the provisional legislative council will not work for a
long time, it is an important reflection of the principle of "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong", and will surely play an
important role in ensuring the effective operation of the Hong
Kong SAR.

<HEADLINE> Decision on Setting up HK SAR Provisional Legislative Council Important (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A decision on the establishment
of the provisional legislative council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) approved by its Preparatory Committee
session Sunday was of great importance to the smooth transition of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is also a significant move to ensure the normal operation of
the future Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Second Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee, after the British Hong Kong government
clung to the wrong stand and sabotaged the "through-train"
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the Chinese government had always
adopted a sincere attitude towards the Sino-British talks on the
arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong, and tried its
best to make talks successful.
</P>
<P>
But, the British side created various obstacles, and suspended
the negotiations unilaterally, in disregard of the fundamental
interests of Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
It forcefully practised a constitutional package violating the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the relevant
understandings and agreements reached between the two sides, thus
making the "through-train" arrangement impossible.
</P>
<P>
It is under such a circumstance that the Standing Committee of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) approved a decision
during its Ninth Session in August 1994 that the last Legislative
Council of the British Hong Kong authorities will end on June 30,
1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Decision of the National People's Congress on
the Method for the Formation of the First Government, and the
First Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region" adopted in April 1990, members of the first legislative
council of the Hong Kong SAR must be selected by direct elections
in districts.
</P>
<P>
As this election cannot be conducted under the British rule,
nor it can be fulfilled in a short time after the establishment of
the SAR on July 1, 1997, it will definitely appear that there will
be a "legislature vacancy" after the establishment of the SAR, if
no special measures are adopted.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstance, it is necessary for the Preparatory
Committee to establish the provisional legislative council,
considering the needs of making preparations for the establishment
of the HK SAR, and ensuring Hong Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
In fact, in the process of establishing the Hong Kong SAR and
after it is founded, the legislative departments will be
responsible for, and handle, many important and complicated
issues, including measures to examine and approve government
budgets, to approve taxation and public expenditure, to endorse
the appointment of the judges of the Court of Final Appeal and the
Chief Judge of the High Court, while formulating laws to ensure
the smooth transition, and normal operation of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the decision on establishing the provisional
legislative council is the best choice to deal with "after
effects" caused by the lack of the "through-train".

<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today outlined his expectations for the forthcoming
inter-governmental conference (IGC) of the European Union (EU)
leaders.
</P>
<P>
In an article published today by the French newspaper
Liberation, Chirac voiced his hope that the special summit, to be
held on Friday in the Italian city of Turin, would address three
issues: pursuing a joint diplomatic and security policy, making
the bloc more efficient and democratic, and allowing some
countries to integrate further and faster than others.
</P>
<P>
The EU should develop a partnership with Russia so that the
expansion of both the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) could be possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac suggested the post of a supreme EU representative be
created to better defend the EU's interests in the international
arena.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for reforms of the Council of Ministers, the EU
commission and the European Parliament to improve the bloc's
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chirac reiterated the confidence of France and
Germany in the Economic and Monetary Union and called for more
attention on the issues of unemployment and drug abuse across the
continent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Privately-built homes increased
sharply in Hungary last year thanks to government incentives.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25,000 homes were built in 1995, up 18 percent over
the previous year. Meanwhile, 39,000 building permits were issued
in the year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, as many as 98,000 housing units are under
construction, a building boom unseen since the 1950s, local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Up to 95 percent of the privately-built homes are houses, each
having a floor space of nearly 100 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The private building spree came after the government issued a
decree in November 1994 offering substantial subsidies for those
building their own homes. The boom is likely to continue over the
next few years, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen to Re-enter Philippine Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Leading German carmaker
Volkswagen, encouraged by the buoyant economic prospects in the
Philippines, will re-enter the country's car market after more
than two decades of absence.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen will join several European automotive companies,
including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, that have established
footholds in the local market through assembly and marketing
partnership with Philippine firms.
</P>
<P>
In its comeback bid, Volkswagen is tying up with Proton
Pilipinas Corp., (PPC) which is partly owned by Malaysia's Proton
Wira Berhad, to locally assemble and market three models: Audi,
Caravelle and Polo Classic.
</P>
<P>
PPC executive vice president Paul Rodriguez said today that
around 120 million pesos (4.8 million US dollars) would be
invested in the project, which Proton will wholly own and operate.
</P>
<P>
Noel de Leon, PPC's senior manager for marketing services, said
that all the three models would be assembled at Proton's plant in
Alaminos, Pangasinan.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 units of Polo Classic, of which 85 percent are
completely-knocked-down units, will be assembled this year.
</P>
<P>
Proton will also import 500 completely-built-up units of the
Caravelle for distribution in the local market.
</P>
<P>
Assembly of CKD Caravelle vans are planned after six months.
</P>
<P>
Sales of both models are forecast to grow at least 10 percent
yearly, de Leon said.
</P>
<P>
Company executives also hope that the Polo Classic would snare
five percent of the market, and Caravelle, another 30 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is weighing
reports of cattle afflicted with "mad cow disease" before it
decides to ban beef exports from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said today,
"It's a very technical issue that must be studied carefully before
any action, such as banning imports of British beef, could be
taken."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British embassy spokesman Matthew Gould noted that
Britain had taken "several protective measures" since 1989 to
prevent the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"There are no possible grounds to doubt the safety of British
beef," he said, citing the lack of scientific evidence that the
disease spreads from one species to another.
</P>
<P>
Recent cases of a fatal disease, believed to be caused by
eating meat infected with mad cow disease, have sparked alarms in
capitals around the world.
</P>
<P>
The reports have led 10 members of the European Union and an
increasing number of other countries to impose precautionary bans
on British beef.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office (SDPO) said today that Chang Hak-ro, a former secretary for
South Korean President Kim Young-sam, collected about 1.27 million
U.S. dollars in graft from businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, was arrested on March 23 on charges of of receiving
180,000 dollars from three businessmen operating small firms in
exchange for administrative favors he arranged for them.
</P>
<P>
The SDPO said that it plans to confiscate the entire fortune
illicitly acquired by Chang.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to apply for a court order that allows us to seize all
of the assets Chang has accumulated through illicit means," an SDPO
official said.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition party, the National Congress for New
Politics (NCNP), alleged on March 21 that Chang had built up an
illicit fortune of some 4.76 million dollars, which had been
hidden under the names of his girl friend and her brothers.
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors said that they have yet to find evidence
that Chang is the actual owner of all of the 4.76 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who became the assistant minister-level secretary in
February 1993 when President Kim took office.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time President Kim's inner circle has been
touched by charges similar to those that have put ex-presidents
Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan on trial.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Earns 444 Million US Dollars Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe earned 444 million US
Dollars last year by exporting its tobacco, making it the largest
foreign currency earner, the First Merchant Bank (FMB) said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an analysis of economic trends released here today, the FMB
said tobacco farmers had another good season in 1995, during
which 198 million kilograms were sold.
</P>
<P>
''Farmers received more than 389 million US dollars from their
tobacco cops in 1995, and the country's earnings exceeded 444
million US dollars,'' fmb said.
</P>
<P>
This year, farmers are expected to produce about 200 million
kg, slightly down from the target of 210 million kg, mainly due
to wet weather which affected the early planted crop, the FMB
said.
</P>
<P>
Still, this year's output will be a record, and farmers expect
to receive in excess of 433 million dollars at the auction
floors, which open in Harare on April 23, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, of concern to farmers is the government decision,
approved by parliament last week, to impose a five percent levy
on tobacco sales, which growers estimate will result in lost
revenues of 33 million dollars. enditem

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China has always actively

Some progress has been registered in the negotiations on

</P>
<P>
As the first step towards the nuclear tests ban, China holds
that all nuclear powers should undertake not to be the first to
use nuclear weapons, and not use or threaten to use, nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear countries, he stated.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of the first step will benefit the further
relaxation of the international situation," Qian said.

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's policy
on Taiwan remains unchanged, namely, "peaceful reunification and
one country, two systems", Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
In talks with visiting UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros
Ghali, Qian said the 8-point proposal raised by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin in January last year won extensive understanding and
support among people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
However, Qian noted, there is a force in Taiwan attempting to
work for "Taiwan independence", while in some countries there is
also a force that supports and connives with the splittist
activities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This, Qian stressed, is the obstacle to the peaceful
reunification effort.
</P>
<P>
"Some people in Taiwan assert that we are opposed to their
action to practise 'democracy'. this is totally groundless," Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
"What we oppose is the splittist activities in the Taiwan
island, and the force working for "Taiwan independence," Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
 Qian appreciated Ghali's stand of upholding the one-China
policy.
</P>

<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Australia and
Malaysia thawed further tonight as Australian Minister for Foreign
Affairs Alexander Downer met with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamed in Darwin.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Mahathir ever visited Australia.
Downer said that Australian-Malaysian relations had passed its
coolest point following former Australian Prime Minister Paul
Keating's comment that Mahathir was "recalcitrant."
</P>
<P>
"The meeting I had with Dr Mahathir was a very positive, warm
and easy meeting," Downer said at a press conference after the
45-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting has provided very good foundations for the
bilateral relations between Australia and Malaysia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir did not make any public comment about the informal
meeting with Downer. But Downer said that Mahathir expressed
interest in discussions on Australia's entrance into the East
Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC).
</P>
<P>
Downer also told Mahathir that Australia hoped to update the
trade agreement with Malaysia. He also confirmed the Howard
Government's commitment to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir stopped over in Darwin on his way to New Zealand
tonight. He will visit Brisbane in Queensland of Australia and
hold talks with Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has explicitly opposed Australia's entrance into
regional forums such as the EAEC and the Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM). He has also ruled out the possibility that Australia and
New Zealand could become members of the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"There have been some differences, of course at the political
level and we clearly have a task to improve the political
relationship and I think we have made a good start at that
tonight," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir will fly to New Zealand tonight.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone's Firstever Peace Talks Held In Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's outgoing
military leader, Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio, is today
holding the country's first ever peace talks with rebel leader
Foday Sankoh in Cote d'Ivoire's tourist center of Yamasoukro.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, brokered by the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) and the government of Cote d'Ivoire, is
aimed at giving a momentum to the efforts to put an end to the
five-year-old war in the West African state.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone' state radio today gave a graphic account of the
arrival of Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary Untied Front
(RUF), on Sunday in Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio report, Sankoh was picked up in his
bush headquarters in the far eastern part of Sierra Leone on
Sunday, and flown to a border town in neighboring Guinea before
being taken by light plane to Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was accompanied all the way on the flight by the Cote
d'Ivoire's Foreign Minister, Amara Essy, "for security reasons".
</P>
<P>
Political observers said this is the first time Sankoh has
left his jungle hideout in Sierra Leone's interiors during the
five-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Bio is scheduled to hand over power to the civilian government
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bio's delegation included Dr. Sama Banya and another official
of the incoming ruling Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP).
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sama Banya, former minister of the toppled government
headed by Joseph Momoh, is likely to become the foreign minister
of the civilian government soon to be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reaction to the talks from many sierra Leoneans is
one of hope for peace.
</P>
<P>
Messages of sincere wishes are being made on newspapers while
the press itself have welcomed the talks as "the beginning of the
end of the struggle".
</P>
<P>
The biweekly Standard Times says: "The meeting has been the
dream of all peace-loving Sierra Leoneans."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the meeting is taking place at a time when a
new head of state is to be installed, is very crucial to this
nation's forward push to a new democratic era," it added.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned Daily Mail writes: "It is a hush moment
while we await the result of today's talks."
</P>
<P>
The Expo Times Weekly sees the talks as "a readiness for peace
on both sides and for the war to end".

<HEADLINE> Moslem Leader Bomb-Attacked In Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The residence of the highest
Moslem leader in Somalia, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Muhidin, last
night received a bomb attack in North Mogadishu, local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack came after the Islamic Court of North
Mogadishu has ordered the detaining of a man carrying weapons,
including a mortar launcher and rocket propelled grenades and
rounds of ammunition, in the street.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Muhidin has attributed the attack to a group of angry
relatives of the detained man.
</P>
<P>
People in North Mogadishu have been facing serious
attacks since the court has detained the politicians opposing the
North Mogadishu faction leader, Ali Mohdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Insecurity is growing in North Mogadishu ever since a splinter
group from the United Somali Congress of North Mogadishu joined
the South Mogadishu government led by General Aidid last month.

28-strong squad for the Atlanta Olympics, including a surprising
name Janine Belton.
</P>
<P>
Belton will compete in a five-strong group for the women's

the 200m freestyle final at the Olympic trials ended in Sheffield
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old has been called up to provide cover for Sarah
Hardcastle, who is facing a clash of events in Atlanta.

</P>
<P>
The others are Mark Foster, Mike Fibbens, Helen Slatter and
Alison Sheppard, the the first Scottish swimmer to achieve an
Olympic hat-trick for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The oldest member of the squad is Caroline Foot, who made the

BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan investors were today
assured that the Chinese government will protect their
investments, legal rights and interests in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was issued in Beijing by Wang Zhaoguo,
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, and head of United Front Work
Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when he met with a delegation from the Hong

</P>
<P>
Extending his welcome to the Hong Kong visitors, Wang said that
Hong Kong has played an important role in entrepot trade between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits for a long time.

He said that compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan still
maintain a favorable investment momentum in the mainland, hoping
that they will continue to invest in the mainland, and develop
economic and trade exchanges across the straits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met with visiting Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li extended his welcome to Banharn, and
expressed his appreciation for the warm reception he received at
the end of last year, when he visited Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Thailand, two neighbors with the two
peoples enjoying long and traditional friendship, have been
experiencing a smooth development in bilateral relations since the
two countries established diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
China, said Li, is doing its best to maintain social stability
and provide enough food and clothing for its people. He added that
development was not so easy in a country with a population of 1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
 So, Li said, the Chinese Government and people sincerely hope
for good relationships with all countries in the world, as well as
understanding and support from more friends worldwide, in a bid to
create a better international environment for its domestic
construction.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China is unwilling to create any friction with
any country, and China will never trade principles.
</P>
<P>
Li also thanked the Thai Government for its support to China on
many important issues.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the just-concluded sessions of China's National
People's Congress (NPC), and the National Committee of the CPPCC,
deliberated and adopted the Outline for the Ninth Five-Year Plan
on National Economic and Social Development, and the Long-Range
Goal for the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
In the next 15 years, Li said, China will expand economic and
technological cooperation with overseas partners in many fields,
thus providing opportunities for companies all over the world.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Thai businessmen, who have many contacts with
their Chinese counterparts and have accumulated rich experiences
during their cooperation with the Chinese side, will score more
achievements, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his pleasure at meeting Li again in Beijing, after
they met in Bangkok, Banharn said that the whole world is watching
China's reform and opening-up, and its economic construction. He
described China's great changes as remarkable to the world.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that bilateral friendly relations have
entered the third decade, and the two countries should not only
strengthen cooperation in politics, economy, trade, and science
and technology, but also further develop multilateral and regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he is glad to know that the NPC has adopted a very good
economic and social development plan, adding that Thailand has
also mapped out a two-decade development program, which is
conducive to furthering bilateral economic, trade, and scientific
and technological cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Adtranz China Starts Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Adtranz (ABB Daimler-Benz
Transportation GmbH), one of the world's major providers of
railway systems, announced the inauguration of its local
subsidiary, Adtranz China Ltd, here recently.
</P>
<P>
The group's business in China has seen the fastest growth rate
among its worldwide total in recent years. The subsidiary's
inauguration is considered as a move to strengthen the group's
presence in the world's biggest market for railway equipment,
Kaare Vagner, the group's president, said.
</P>
<P>
The past five years have seen the fastest-ever period of
expansion of China's railway network, with 11,800 km of tracks
laid. The brisk growth of China's railways is expected to continue
to the end of this century, local observers said.
</P>
<P>
However, despite this rapid growth, railway transportation
still remains a "bottleneck" for the country's economy. This is
also why the overseas railway equipment producers are keen to get
a foothold in China.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the country will build some 8,100 km of new
railway lines in the 1996-2000 period, which will boost the
nation's total railway length to 68,000 km, of which 2,000 km will
be electrified.
</P>
<P>
Thus the country needs a large amount of railway equipment,
including high-speed trains, and computerized signal and traffic
control systems.
</P>
<P>
What is urgently needed is the rolling stock manufacturing
technology that Adtranz can provide, Vagner said, and the group
is pursuing a long-term engagement in China.
</P>
<P>
The group is currently evaluating eight possible joint ventures
in China. Just two weeks ago, the group's first joint venture with
Chinese partners was set up in Shenyang, the capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The group will soon sign agreements for its second venture in
China with the Changchun Railway Car Works, in the capital of
northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
It has delivered 96 carriages for the Shanghai subway system,
and will deliver 120 for the Guangzhou subway project
early next year.
</P>
<P>
The group's ventures' local content will reach 50 percent
by the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Deaths From Breast Cancer Start to Fall in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) - Deaths from breast cancer have
begun to fall in Britain and many other Western countries,
according to a report released today by the British Imperial
Cancer Research Fund.
</P>
<P>
The charity's cancer epidemiology unit in Oxfordshire analyzed
death rates from 1950 to 1992 in 20 countries in Europe and North
America. Also under survey were Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The findings showed that although rates have been increasing
for many decades, there has been a leveling off or even a fall in
the overall death rates in 16 out of the 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
England and Wales still lead the international league table
with breast cancer deaths exceeding 50 per 100,000 women, down
from nearly 58 per 100,000 in the 1980s. However, the rate is high
as against that of 45 in Germany and of below 40 in France.
</P>
<P>
Countries showing a recent drop in breast cancer mortality are
generally the ones with the highest death rates, such as Britain
and Canada, while those countries with the lowest rates, such as
Spain, tend to be the ones where the relevant mortality rate is
rising, the report added.

<HEADLINE> 15 People Killed On Convoy Ambush In Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were killed
and 34 others wounded last night when a convoy of three lorries
were ambushed by militiamen near Baidoa, a southern Somali town
to the west of capital Mugadishu.
</P>
<P>
The Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA), which fights against
South Somalia's most powerful warlord General Mohamed Aidid, said
they ambushed the convoy, which is transporting militiamen and
military equipment to Aidid's troops, at Manyafulka Village, 30
km to the west of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The RRA spokesman, Mohamed Nur Jilkey, said the RRA forces
failed to capture any of the vehicles which managed to flee back
to Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
However, an eyewitness said the ambushed lorries were
transporting civilians instead of troops or war logistics stock
as claimed by the RRA.
</P>
<P>
Commuters in the area said the lorries were heavily fired upon
by the RRA guerrilla fighters before they were identified.
</P>
<P>
The RRA has already declared the areas as a war zone and no
civilians are allowed to pass.
</P>
<P>
RRA leader Abdulkadir Zoppe admitted today that his troops
had received a large quantity of ammunition assistance from the
breakaway Republic of Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people are believed to have died in the armed
clashes between troops of the RRA and General Aidid in the past
few month.

<HEADLINE> HK Retail Sales Drop in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Hong Kong
slackened in the first month of 1996, partly due to the timing of
the Chinese Lunar New year that fell in mid February.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales value, estimated at 19.1 billion HK dollars
(2.45 billion US dollars), dropped by 8 percent in January this
year compared with the same period of 1995, according to the
figures released today by the Census and Statistics
Department. Retail sales decreased by 13 percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that retail sales tend to show
considerable fluctuations in the first two months of the year
because of the timing of the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival, which occurred in later January in 1994,
came in the middle of February this year. The year-on-year rate of
change in retail sales in January this year was distorted by the
high base of comparison in January last year.

WELLINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has lifted its
ban on high-level contacts with France after three Western
nuclear powers signed the South Pacific Nuclear-free Zone Treaty
today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger said ministerial contacts with France can
now be re-established and restrictions on military contacts will be
removed in due course.
</P>
<P>
NZ now can also buy French military equipment, he said.

NZ imposed the ban last year following France's announcement it
would conduct a number of nuclear tests in the South Pacific. France
ended its tests two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and the United States signed the treaty in Suva,
Fiji, this morning. They agreed not to make, store or test nuclear
weapons in the region.
</P>

the course of its political destiny without external
interference, says a noted u.s. publiser, Ms. Torothy R. Leavell.
</P>
<P>

Ms. Leavell, Presidet of the National Newspaper Publishers
Association of the United States, made the remarks in Kaduna,
northern Nigeria, yesterday when she led a US group to visit the

that there was relative peace in Nigeria, just contrary to
various media reports of political instability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Leavell, an African American, said that since her arrival
in Nigeria, the group members did not witness any sign of
repression.
</P>
<P>
The group, she said, was also impressed with the local
government elections on a non-party basis conducted in free and
fair atmosphere, just as it obtained in any democracy.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Leavell also said that the Afro-African Association saw it
as a duty to visit Nigeria in order to report back to Americans
and their government on the true situaion in Nigeria.
</P>

<HEADLINE> PLA Military Exercises in Taiwan Straits Successful (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the successful landing, the PLA's main force, using
flexible tactics and with cover provided by the air force and
ground artillery, concentrated its assault and fire power on the
"enemy troops."
</P>
<P>
Air attacks, artillery barrages, and electronic interference
were employed by the attacking force that consisted of airborne
assault and mechanized infantry.
</P>
<P>
The "enemy" defenses were penetrated, the "enemy" surrounded,
and destroyed in the rapid strike.
</P>
<P>
Rear echelon units provided the essential and powerful
technical and materiel to support the joint military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated technology and equipment played a crucial role in
the exercises. The three branches were able to coordinate their
efforts well, overcoming adverse weather conditions and
complicated marine manoeuvres. The Chinese military's ability to
fight as a unified force under the conditions of modern warfare
was greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Nanjing Area Command said they are ready at
any time to accomplish the sacred mission of defending China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and safeguarding the
reunification of the motherland, under the command of the Central
Committee of the Party of China and the Central Military
Commission both with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the soldiers at the finish of the
exercises, Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission Zhang
Wannian said that China has always stood for and been persistently
working for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, but will
never commit itself to renouncing the use of force.
</P>
<P>
"And, if foreign forces interfere in China's reunification, or
assist Taiwan to go 'independent', we shall resort to all means
necessary, including military means, to safeguard the unity of the
motherland, and defend the country's state sovereignty and
territorial integrity," he pledged.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Governor Ordered to Sign U.S. Base Lease Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese court today ordered
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota to sign documents needed for the
continued forced rental of land to the U.S. military, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court came on
the heels of a petition filed by Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's predecessor, Tomiichi Murayama, last December, after
Ota rejected his instructions to sign the documents.
</P>
<P>
Ota is the first prefectural governor to be taken to court by a
prime minister for refusing to execute an order of the central
government under Japan's Local Autonomy Law.
</P>
<P>
Ota has maintained that his refusal follows the will of the
Okinawan people, claiming that the concentration of U.S. military
facilities on the nation's southernmost main island infringes on
their constitutional rights to live in peace and local landowners'
property rights.
</P>
<P>
Ota's refusal came against the backdrop of a surge in public
outcry over the U.S. military presence in Okinawa since the rape
of a 12-year-old local schoolgirl last September by three
U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of Japanese land for U.S. military use is
concentrated in Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of
the Japanese territory about 1,600 kilometers
southwest of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> PLA Military Exercises in Taiwan Straits Successful (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nanjing Military Area Command
successfully conducted joint ground, naval, and air military
exercises in the Taiwan Straits from March 18 to 25.
</P>
<P>
The exercises tested combat readiness of the following: control
of sea and air; high-speed ferrying of troops; landing of armoured
infantry; establishing a beachhead; mechanized parachute assault;
multi-layer artillery barrage; breakthrough by strong assault
force; three-dimensional deep-thrust; breaking resistance and
attacking in depth.
</P>
<P>
The success in the exercises demonstrates the military and
political qualities as well as the determination of the ground,
naval and air forces, and indicates that the Chinese armed forces
are resolved and able to safeguard the unity of the motherland and
defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission, who watched the exercises, conveyed the greetings of
Chairman Jiang Zemin to the officers and enlisted personnel of the
ground, naval, and air forces, and units of the Second Artillery
Force. Prior to this, Zhang watched joint live-firing exercises of
the naval and air forces in the East and South China Seas.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the PLA has studied the principles of joint
combat of the three branches under the conditions of modern
warfare and using sophisticated technology. As a result, its
combat effectiveness has been dramatically improved.
</P>
<P>
This exercise is believed to have tested the outcome of reforms
in training and research on theory and practice in tactics, and
further improved its overall combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
The landing exercise was conducted in inclement weather in
choppy seas. With strong support from the air force, the ground
forces' air wing, destroyers, guided-missile destroyers, escort
vessels, minesweepers, submarine chasers, landing ships, and
support vessels, the assault force and troops landed were able to
break the resistance of the "enemy" repeatedly.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Begin Aviation Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese and U.S. aviation
negotiators today kicked off their three-day Tokyo negotiations in
a last-ditch attempt to resolve the dispute over "beyond rights"
by the March 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth round in the current series of talks that began
last September, Japan will monitor the U.S. response to a
compromise proposal it made at the previous round in Washington
between February 28 and March 1, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Japan proposed freezing for three years discussion on "beyond
rights," over which the two countries have been divided.
</P>
<P>
It insists on limiting the use of the right which allows
carriers to fly beyond Japanese or U.S. cities to third countries,
while Washington argues that the right should apply without limits
and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
In return for the compromise offer to freeze the debate, Tokyo
called for the United States to award Nippon Cargo Airways with
privileges under the 1952 Japan-U.S. aviation treaty in order to
help equalize Japanese and U.S. aviation interests.
</P>
<P>
Japan Airlines (JAL) is the only privileged Japanese cargo
carrier, whereas two U.S. cargo carriers -- Federal Express and
Northwest Airlines -- are entitled to privileges that are wider
ranging than those enjoyed by JAL, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
It said if the U.S. agrees to the compromise, Japan is expected
to offer two more routes under "beyond rights" and new landing slots
to Japanese airports.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. side is unlikely to climb down and accept the
Japanese proposal, the news service said. Both the U.S. government
and Federal Express claim that "beyond rights" are their vested
interests and they should be allowed to exercise them
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Japanese negotiators, on the other hand, say there is no room
for discussion if the U.S. side does not accept the equalization
of aviation interests, according to Kyodo.

<HEADLINE> Soft Music Helps Heart to Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Soft music helps recovery from
heart attacks and is now a serious adjunct to cardiac
rehabilitation, the Heart Care Foundation of India (HCFI) sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Soft music can be used for anything from reducing the duration
of stay in intensive care units to aiding anesthesia during
surgical procedure. Heart patients around the world are now
benefiting from soft background music, played at outpatient
departments, operation theaters and intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
Soft music also acts as a preventive against stress and those
exposed to it would do well to devote some part of each day
relaxing to the sound of music, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Soft music not only restores the body's natural rhythms but
has also been found to increase the body's capacity to combat
diseases and stimulate the flow of good body enzymes," HCFI said.
</P>
<P>
For music to be effective in combating heart problems it should
approximate the natural rhythm of the heart and should not be
jarring or be loud. The rock music has been found to raise the
heart beat and blood pressure, HCFI added.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Seek Jordan's Help to Lift Israeli Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti said that the closure and collective punishments stand in
the way of the creation of a suitable atmosphere for the peace
process to succeed, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said here Sunday the resumption of
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue and the implementation of existing
autonomy accords were the best ways to respond to attempts to
sabotage the peace process, commenting on the Israeli sealing off
the West Bank and Gaza Strip since February 25 at the start of a
spate of suicide bombings, Jordan Times" reported.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, a senior advisor to
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, during which the Palestinian
official asked for Jordan's help to secure a lifting of Israel's
four-week-old closure of the Palestinian self-rule areas,
Kabariti said the closure is also causing frustration among the
Palestinians and creating feelings of hatred.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli measure has thrown 60,000 people out of work and
increased the unemployment rate in the self-rule area to about 80
percent and led to severe hardship for those in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Abbas told reporters after the meeting that he asked for
Jordan's good office to lift Israeli blockade of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip imposed by Israeli authorities due to security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked for the help and support of our brothers in
Jordan to put pressure on Israel to relieve the suffering of our
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced welcome to "the Jordanian government's support for
the Palestinian position on this issue."
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on accusations by the Israeli Likud
Party that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) had reached a
secret agreement with Hamas to carry out suicide bombings, Abbas
said such reports are baseless.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the PNA had been holding dialogue with Hamas in
a democratic manner but this dialogue was disrupted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the PNA "strongly condemns these bombings."

<HEADLINE> Indian Government likely to Allow Import of Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Passenger cars and some other
consumer durables are likely to be removed from the negative list
of imports in the export-import (EXIM) policy, to be announced
later this month, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
An inter-ministerial committee has recommended allowing import
of passenger cars, washing machines, refrigerators and electronics
items with high import tariffs. The committee has stressed on
countervailing duty to keep the import duty high for protecting
domestic manufacturers against cheap imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, passenger cars imports are allowed only under a few
select category which carry a customs duty of 50 percent and a
countervailing duty of up to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at regulating imports through fiscal controls
as physical controls were against the spirit of liberalization. It
could be utilized to bring in price competitiveness in the
domestic market, industry ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government is reported to have assured the World
Trade Organization that it would open up its consumer goods market
in phases following pressure from the multilateral agency. This
new move is part of steps to be taken by the government in this
direction, the official added.

NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Children from India's middle
class families have become the new target of a surging consumer
industry as they are influencing decisions in the sale of products
from toothpaste to TV sets, said a study conducted by the
Operations Research Group.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of India's population is below 14 years and analysts
said that this population consumes over 10 billion rupees (290
million US dollars) worth of the sales.
</P>
<P>
Indian children eat 70 million US dollars worth of ice creams
annually, motivate the sales of over 600,000 color TV sets and
sustain 70 percent of the health foods industry, the study said.
</P>
<P>
"We found that children in urban India are getting a lot of
pocket money these days and are becoming decisive consumers," said
Ms sujatha Rakhra, vice-president of the Operations Research
Group, who headed the study.
</P>
<P>
The study found that children were increasingly dictating
purchases in the Indian household. Parents want to buy for their
children the very best, whether they are clothes, toys or other
consumer goods, the study said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Thirty political parties have
registered ahead of tomorrow's deadline for participating in
Israel's general elections due to be held on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The current list includes five Jewish religious parties, five
Arab parties and three immigrant parties, in addition to Labor
and Likud, the country's two major parties. But the actual
number of parties competing in the elections will drop because
several are running together, such as Likud, Tsomet and Gesher.
</P>
<P>
Labor is expected to fire the opening shot in its election
campaign tonight at its primaries' tabulating center at the Tel
Aviv Fair Grounds, with the slogan "A strong Israel with (Prime
Minister Shimon) Peres." Some 284,000 Labor Party members will
vote in the primaries today, in 1,300 poling stations spread at
800 locations throughout the country. But Labor's full-fledged
campaign will officially begin after the primaries.
</P>
<P>
The Likud primaries will start tomorrow. More than 170,000
party members will be eligible to pick from among 118 Knesset
(parliament) candidates, 73 in nationwide races and 45 in
regional ones.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz Party held its primaries yesterday. Some
41,000 party members, braving a winter storm, voted for their
candidates at 205 polls throughout the country. Some 30
candidates are contending for Meretz's Knesset list.

JERUSALEM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Eleven noted Palestinian
figures have signed a proposal for a reconciliation between the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the Islamic Jihad and the
Palestinian Authority (PA), according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem, today.
</P>
<P>
The notables, including top faction leaders, intellectuals and
Islamic activists, appealed to the PA to stop its arrest and raid
campaigns and to set free its political prisoners. They likewise
called on Hamas and Islamic Jihad to put an end to their military
activities and to help the PA to continue on the peace track.
</P>
<P>
The initiative called for activating a comprehensive national
dialogue in a way that it becomes institutionalized. "This is to
preserve positive reconciliation between all Palestinian forces, to
guarantee sacred national unity," it said.
</P>

It stressed that all Palestinian forces must "commit to stop
military activities" and continue the coordination and
consultations for the success of the current political track.

Referring to the current crackdown campaign, the personalities
urged the PA to preserve human rights under the law, stop arrests
and raides and release all prisoners and detainees held without
reason or legal justification.

A commitment must be made to freedom of expression and
assembly under the law, they said. "The national lines should not
be crossed in media activities, as this shakes the unity of the
Palestinian house," it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling coalition and the
leading opposition party in the Diet (parliament) agreed today to
cap within the day the prolonged deadlock over the fiscal 1996
budget, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came at a meeting of top officials in charge of
Diet affairs from the three ruling parties -- the Liberal
Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, New Party Sakigake
-- and the largest opposition Shinshinto, or New Frontier Party,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the heads of the ruling parties met and confirmed
their support for House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi in
ending the Diet stalemate, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Doi had urged the ruling camp and Shinshinto to resolve the
Diet impasse by Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Diet debate over the 1996 budget has been stalled since
early March when the largest opposition Shinshinto began an
open-ended sit-in in front of the lower house's budget committee
to block its passage.
</P>
<P>
Shinshinto has said it would not end the blockade unless the
use of 685 billion yen (6.85 billion U.S. dollars) in taxpayers'
money for the write-off of bad loans at the mortgage firms is
removed from the budget.
</P>
<P>
But the party has agreed to speedily pass a 50-day stopgap
budget as well as several other outstanding pension-related
bills.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- New Secretary-General of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil al-Hojeilan is currently
visiting Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Hojeilan, who arrived in Doha Sunday for a two-day visit to
Qatar, has also visited other GCC states, including Kuwait,
Bahrein, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Qatar originally objected to the appointment of Jamil al
Hojeilan as Secretary-General of the GCC. It boycotted the final
session of a GCC summit held in Muscat, Oman's capital, in
December 1995 due to the reason. Relations between Qatar and other
GCC members became tense since then.
</P>
<P>
However, the relations between Qatar and other GCC states began
to thaw following the March 17-18 GCC meeting held in Saudi
Arabian capital Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al
Thani said after the meeting that his country "has approved the
appointment of the new GCC Secretary-General following a proposal
made by Oman."
</P>
<P>
A final communique passed by the GCC Foreign Ministers said
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrein, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) approved an Omani proposal that the future GCC
head "will be alternately appointed according to the alphabetical
order of the names of member states."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad is currently
visiting Saudi Arabia. He held talks with crown Prince Abdulla on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official Saudi Press Agency said the Minister carried two
messages from Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to
Saudi Arabian King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and to Prince Abdulla.
However, no details were given.

<P>
URUMQI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 100 million cu m of
water was poured into the former dry Tarim River recently to save
more than 66,000 ha of diversiform-leaved poplar along the river.
</P>
<P>
It is one of a series of effective measures to rebuild forests
in deserts in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
and thus to improve the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, located in the inland area, always suffers from
drought and water shortage. The oases only accounted for 3.5
percent of the region's total acreage.
</P>
<P>
Between the oases and the deserts there exist patches of desert
plants. Because of excessive human activity, the plant coverage
rates dropped to two percent to ten percent and the varities of
the plants decreased to 65 from previous 106.
</P>
<P>
To improve ecological environment around the oases and proceed
to raise the living standards of the people, the local government
adopted a series of measures, such as building plants protection
zones, irrigation and transforming damaged forest, to resume the
desert plants living environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 only, the local government planted 20,000 ha of trees
and grass, irrigated 66,000 ha of diversiform-leaved poplar and
transformed nearly 1,000 ha of damaged forest.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the autonomous regional forests
department, several hundred ha of forest has been resumed in the
region over the past few years, thus protected the oases in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Nagasaki to Withdraw Nanjing Massacre Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Nagasaki has decided to withdraw
photos on the 1937 Nanjing Massacre from a city atomic bombing
library to be opened on April 1, following opposition from
assembly members of the liberal Democratic Party (LDP), according
to a recent Kyodo News report.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government had planned to exhibit those photos
in the library to demonstrate Japan's history of invasion and
aggression in Asia, so that Japan can look at the reality of World
War II in terms of both the aggrieved and aggriever while calling
for a complete abolition of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, LDP members are opposed to the exhibition of the
photos, saying that "if Japanese atrocities are underlined,
people would think that (Japan's) being A-bombed was an of-course
matter," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki was A-bombed just three days after the world's first
atomic bomb flattened Hiroshima 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government argued that it had made the decision
not to exhibit the photos after listening to various kinds of
viewpoints, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Thai PMs on Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng held
talks with visiting Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa in the
Great Hall of the People here this morning, with both men agreeing
on promoting friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li met with Banharn earlier this month in Bangkok during the
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM).
</P>
<P>
In welcoming the Thai prime minister, who arrived here Sunday
for a six-day official visit, Li said that China and Thailand are
close neighbors and are like "relatives" in their friendship. He
said that Sino-Thai relations can be called a model of neighborly
relations.
</P>
<P>
Since diplomatic ties were established 21 years ago, Li said,
they have grown steadily. Leaders of the two countries have
exchanged frequent visits and bilateral cooperation in the
economy, and science and technology is developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, Sino-Thai trade volume reached 3.3
billion US dollars' worth last year and two-way investment has
increased remarkably. Scientific and technology exchanges and
cooperation are also going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Li told his guest that China attaches importance to friendly
relations and cooperation with Thailand and is willing to work
together to improve the relations on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that the first ASEM was a success and has
received favorable comments from the international community, and
has opened up new channels for Asian-European cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the outcome of the meeting and we
congratulate the Thai government for successfully hosting the
meeting," Li said.
</P>
<P>
This is Banharn's first visit since he assumed the premiership
last July. He said the frequent meetings between Thai and Chinese
leaders are a proof of "close, friendly relations", and spoke
highly of China's contribution to ASEM, saying that Li's presence
contributed to the success of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said that relations between Thailand and China are
very good and their cooperation in various fields has seen
remarkable progress. Now Thai-Chinese relations are in their third
decade, he said, and that he hopes the two countries will make
joint efforts in order to usher in a new period of bilateral
cooperation, particularly in the economy, trade, science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
He congratulate the success of the Fourth Plenary Session of
China's Eighth National People's Congress and the approval of the
Ninth Five-Year-Plan and the long-range objectives for the year
2010. He said this creates favorable conditions for the
development of Thai-Chinese economic and trade ties and scientific
and technological cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chain Stores Mean Convenience for Beijing Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has seen fairly
rapid development of chain stores and mini-super markets in its
urban area, which are bringing a greater degree of convenience to
people in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
The number of chain stores has risen to 980, with about half
that number mainly dealing in such necessities as grains, edible
oils, meat, eggs, vegetables, and daily-use household wares,
according to the Fourth session of the Eighth Municipal Political
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Branches of discount houses and fast food outlets are another
part of the same development that are experiencing phenomenal
growth.
</P>
<P>
To attract more customers, these stores often allow customers
to pick up items themselves and have longer business hours than
ordinary stores do. Various other things such as laundry services
and public telephones are also provided for customers.

<HEADLINE> Silk Road's Jiaohe Ruins Get More Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
donated 83,000 US dollars for the Jiaohe Ruins in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region for a museum to display relics that have
been found there.
</P>
<P>
Located 10 km west of Turfan, Jiaohe was first built by the
Jushi people in the 2nd century BC, and prospered during the Tang
Dynasty (618-907), but was destroyed by wars during the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
In 1961, the Chinese government listed the Jiaohe Ruins as an
important historical site to be given special protection.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, archaeologists excavated two tombs of the ancient
Jushi People with many funerary horses.
</P>
<P>
An official from Xinjiang has said that a museum would provide
better protection for items that are discovered and would increase
local tourism.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, UNESCO and the State Bureau of Cultural Relics,
backed by one million US dollars from the Japanese government,
have carried out a program to protect the ruins.
</P>
<P>
The ancient city played an important role in cultural and
economic exchanges between the East and the West, a Japanese
official explained, noting that protecting cultural heritage is
every person's responsibility.

SHANGHAI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of over 1,650 gallstones
were removed from a woman in the Shanghai Chinese Medicine
Hospital here in China's largest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
After the gallbladder operation, doctors said that finding so

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Tourism is playing an
increasingly important role in economic expansion in northwest
China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The province has featured cultural relics, its mountains and
rivers, and unique folklore, playing host to 487,000 overseas
tourists, and bringing in 68.94 million US dollars' worth of
foreign currency earnings during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
Domestic tourism earnings hit 822 million yuan for the
five-year period, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial tourism officials, Gansu had spent a
total of 576 million yuan on improving tourist facilities during
the period, mainly for developing tours from Lanzhou to Dunhuang,
Jiuzhaigou, and Tianshui. There are also 108 scenic spots in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven better hotels and 116 travel agencies are the
mains assurances of improved service and assistance, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The province has also sent people abroad annually to compete
for a market share. Statistics show that the number of tourists
from Japan, France, Germany, the United States, Britain, and
Singapore accounted for more than 60 percent of the province's
total.

<HEADLINE> Super pig Faces Live-or-die Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A genetically engineered pig
that has a human gene in its body is at a crucial stage of its
existence, either to be approved to enter the market or be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The new breed was developed by Australian scientists to provide
consumers with a pig that grows faster, larger and leaner.
</P>
<P>
Today's Sydney Morning Herald reported that the super pig
carried an extra gene to make it grow faster, namely a growth
hormone called pig somatotropin, or "PST."
</P>
<P>
Researchers inserted a piece of human genetic material into the
PST gene to control the release of hormone. The "modified human
MTIIA" serves as a switch to the gene. In response to increased
amount of zinc content in feed in the pig's final two months of
life, it switches on the gene to make the pig grow larger and
leaner.
</P>
<P>
The pig produces 10-15 percent less body fat and 10-15 percent
more meat than conventional pigs, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But the use of human genetic materials in food production has
raised concern of consumers. The Genetic Manipulation Advisory
Committee, the government advisers group on bio-technology, has
extensively reviewed the data on the super pig and conceded that
there was no conceivable health hazard.
</P>
<P>
John Smeaton, managing director of BresaGen company which
developed the pig, said that people should not be alarmed about
eating the genetically engineered pork, because many animal
species shared similar genes with human beings.
</P>
<P>
However, release of genetically engineered plants and animals
do have risk. New crops with insecticides built in their genes may
accelerate the development of chemical-resistance among pests,
while anti-herbicide plants may become mixed with weeds and
produce super weeds that is hard to destroy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian society is facing a major debate on the
introduction of genetically designed food. Relevant safeguard
standards have yet to be developed.
</P>
<P>
While intensive public debate is still some time away, the new
breed of pig has been a growing concern of its developers.
Smeaton's company shoot 146 of the pigs in January because it has
yet to receive governmental approval to market the super pig. They
will have to destroy more unless the company succeeds in
applications for commercial breeding.

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed in Violence in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- At least five Bangladeshis were
killed and 50 others injured in violence across the country
Sunday, the 16th day of the indefinite non-cooperation movement
enforced by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The violent incidents mainly occurred in Dhaka, Narayanganj and
Chittagong. Two local opposition leaders and a helper of a truck
driver were killed in Chittagong while a senior bank officer in
Dhaka and a local opposition leader in Narayanganj were injured.
</P>
<P>
Bomb blasts, chase and counter-chase between supporters of the
opposition and members of different law enforcing agencies and a
number of motor vehicle-damaging incidents marked the day in
different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In Dhaka, police backed by paramilitary forces and army men
fired teargas shells and rubber bullets at the sleeping
demonstrators in front of the National Press Club. The
demonstrators hurled brickbats and exploded bombs and crackers.
At least 12 people were injured and a police sergeant was
seriously beaten.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition party, the Awami League (AL), had called
the sit-in from a huge citizens rally Saturday evening to
intensify their on-going non-cooperation movement and declared
that it would continue till the fall of the "illegal" government.
</P>
<P>
Since March 9, the mainstream opposition parties have enforced
the indefinite movement to press their demand for cancellation of
the ruling party-held February 15 parliamentary elections,
resignation of the present "illegal" government and holding of
fresh general polls under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the police action against the sleeping
demonstrators, Dhaka Mayor Mohammad Hanif, who is also the AL
leader of the city, last night called a dawn-to-dusk strike in the
capital today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a move agreed at a joint meeting of opposition
leaders, port users and officials of the Chittagong Port Authority
(CPA) Sunday to resume partial operation of the port from March 27
failed at the last moment following intervention by the state
minister for port and shipping who issued a telephone instruction
barring the CPA chairman to sign any such agreement.

<HEADLINE> Spending by Thai Travelers Abroad to be Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is to tighten
its customs procedures to curb spending by Thai travelers
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said today that beginning on April 1, Thai
travelers who bring back goods worth more than 5,000 Baht (200 US
dollars) from abroad will face import duties imposed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers will check one of every 10 Thais returning
from abroad and the goods exceeding the 5,000-baht limit will be
taxed.
</P>
<P>
The new procedure is designed to bring down the country's
spiraling current account deficit, which hit 335 billion baht
(13.4 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said that some 1.82 million Thai travelers
spent nearly 80 billion baht (3.2 billion dollars), or an average
of 43,550 baht (1,742 dollars) per person.

<HEADLINE> Third Mutiny Trial of Former Presidents Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The third trial session on mutiny
charges involving former South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and
Roh Tae-woo as well as 11 former Army generals opened at the Seoul
District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, who questioned Chun, Roh and two other
co-defendants in the previous two sessions, will question nine
others for their roles in the military mutiny on December 12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Like the first four, the remaining co-defendants are also
likely to allege that their arrest of then Army Chief of Staff
Chung Sung-hwa and several other loyal generals was not a mutiny,
but a legitimate and unavoidable action needed to investigate the
assassination of President Park Chung-hee.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors will focus their questioning on the illegal nature
of their action, which led to Chun, then an Army major general
leading an investigation into Park's assassination, seizing power
in August 1980.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to bring to light the illegal nature of
Chun and his group's May 17, 1980 measure forcing the government
cabinet to approve to expand the already declared martial law,
which disbanded the National Assembly and touched off a civil
uprising in Kwangju, Capital of South Korea's South Cholla
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was South Korean president 1980-1988, said in the
second trial session on March 18 that it was he who had decided to
arrest Chung and other generals, adding that only he was
responsible for the action.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former Army officers including Chun and Roh have
been indicted for mutiny and treason. Thirteen of them have been
indicted on charges of mutiny or treason, or both. Treason
charges stem from their roles in the bloody crackdown of the
Kwangju civil uprising May 18-27, 1980 that killed about 150
people and wounded 2,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Three others have been indicted for mutiny only, and therefore
they are not standing today's trial.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors plan to start the questioning on the military
crackdown on the Kwangju uprising next month after questioning on
the mutiny is completed. Chun, Roh and six others are charged
with both mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted for graft charges as they received bribes from
businessmen while in office. Roh replaced Chun as president in
February 1988 and stepped down in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chun has stood trial once and Roh three times respectively
already on the graft charges.

HANGZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.7 billion US dollars
were earned from exports of machinery and electronic products by
east China's Zhejiang Province in 1995.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fujian Uses Law to Protect Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite bordering on massive
oceans many parts of coastal China suffer water shortages.
</P>
<P>
Southeast China's Fujian Province is using the law to protect
its water resources, according to Zhang Guisheng, deputy director
of the provincial bureau of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Since New China was born in 1949, Fujian has formed a network
of water systems, consisting of more than 380,000 water
conservancy projects, 2,800 reservoirs with a storage capacity of
ten billion cubic meters, and 230,000 water diversion and pumping
projects, able to supply 14.2 billion cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that although Fujian's per capita water resources
are higher than the country's average, the coastal areas are still
short of water, due to the uneven distribution of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Water resources in ten coastal counties average less than 600
cubic meters per capita, accounting for one fourth of the national
average. Water has become a bottle-neck problem in the economic
development in these areas.
</P>
<P>
To protect and develop water resources, the provincial
government has issued 15 local laws and regulations, and 517
directives. The supervision and administration work in all aspects
concerning water has been greatly strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Coalition Boosted in Three Regional Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition
government received a boost as his Christian Democrats (CDU) and
its partner the Free Democrats (FDP) both made a good showing in
three regional elections today.
</P>
<P>
An exit poll released at 7 p.m. local time by ARD state
television showed that the CDU won the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg
with 41.6 percent of the votes, up two points over last election
in 1992, while the FDP scored 9.4 percent, up four points.
</P>
<P>
Votes for the opposition Social Democrats' (SPD) shrank 4
percent to 25.6 percent. The Greens won 11.7 percent, while the
far-right Republicans returned to the state's legislature with 7.5
percent, according to the exit poll.
</P>
<P>
In the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the SPD won 41 percent of
the vote, down from 1992's 44.8 percent, while the CDU's share of
the vote increased to 39 percent, up 1.7 percent. The FDP won 8.7
percent, up 2.2 percent, and the Greens scored 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SPD lost its monoply on power in the state of
Schleswig-Holstein as its share of the votes shrank to 41 percent
from 46.2 percent in the last election, while the CDU's share rose
to 37 percent from 33.8 percent. The FDP scored 6 percent, a
slight gain from 1992's 5.6 percent, and the Greens won 7.5
percent, up 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Based on the results, the SPD-FDP will maintain their coalition
in Rhineland-Palatinate state, but the governments in the other
two states will likely be changed.
</P>
<P>
In Baden-Wuerttemberg, the CDU is expected to end its coalition
with the SPD and unite with the FDP. In Schleswig-Holstein, the
SPD will possibly form a coalition with the Greens or FDP.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's elections were regarded as a crucial mid-term test for
Kohl's coalition government which is struggling for survival in
the face of economic stagnation and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Another defeat for the FDP, which has suffered consecutive
defeats in the last 12 state elections, would have led to the fall
of the coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Gold Industry Seeks Thai Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Peru, with its resurgent gold
industry, is seeking investments from Thai entrepreneurs to
develop its gold mining and fine jewelry manufacturing industries,
according to Oscar Maurtua de Romana, the Peruvian ambassador to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Peru will sharpen its promotional focus among Thai investors
during the Second International Gold Symposium in Lima from May
7-10, Maurtua was quoted by today's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will cover all aspects of gold mining, financing
and technological processes. It will be an ideal forum for Thai
investors to find out the strong potential Peru offers, he said.
</P>
<P>
With abundant supplies of gold in Peru, Thai manufacturers
could set up joint ventures there to produce jewelry, Maurtua
said.
</P>
<P>
Thais would find even greater opportunities in gold mining,
which has proved to be very profitable in recent years, and the
recent conclusion of a bilateral agreement for protection of
investments gave Thai investors another strong incentive to look
at Peru, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay
Viravan during his visit to Peru in January.

<HEADLINE> hke --U.S. Courts Urged to Focus on Juvenile Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno today called on the nation's courts, especially at the state
level, to do more to combat the growing problem of juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
Judges "can be an absolutely key player in getting children off
on the right foot," the Associated Press quoted Reno as telling a
conference of judges, lawyers and other legal professionals.
</P>
<P>
The conference, in Williamsburg, Virginia, drew about 350
judges, court administrators, lawyers and law professors from
around the country to discuss the future of the nation's judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
Reno urged the development of a pilot program that would
combine courts and various community services to combat youth
violence. The program would include police, prosecutors, judges,
educators, public health officials and employment counselors, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department estimates that the juvenile arrest rate
for violent crimes might double in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, children under 18 are also more likely to be
victims of crime today and in the future, especially at the hands
of their peers wielding guns, according to "Juvenile Offenders and
Victims: A National Report," released in last September.

<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the fire that
swept the Ozone disco in Quezon, Manila last week rose to 156
after two more died on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two were 18-year-old Michael Miranda, who died from
third-degree burns and heavy smoke inhalation, and Marian
Bejandre, 17, who died due to complications and heart failure.
</P>
<P>
Both of the young men suffered 95 percent burns in different
parts of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the death toll is likely to rise as some victims
are still fighting for their lives.
</P>
<P>
So far, 64 other victims remain in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals are keeping the victims in intensive care units to
prevent them from developing infections. Most of them are said to
be suffering from cough, pneumonia, and smoke-inhalation injuries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relatives of the victims are still trying to
identify the burned bodies of their loved. At least 37
unidentified bodies are kept in seven funeral parlors.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Major Development Strategies in 1996-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has five major
strategies for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) to improve
industrial development, local government sources told Xinhua
recently.
</P>
<P>
The five strategies are:
</P>
<P>
-- Changing the industrial structure. Beijing will devote
efforts to developing automobile manufacturing, electronics, and
machinery and improving metallurgy, chemistry, and building
materials industries. More efforts will be put into developing
tertiary industry.
</P>
<P>
-- The city will try to establish 10 conglomerates with each
having annual sales of more than 10 billion yuan and 20 groups
with each having annual sales of five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
-- The city will make use of scientific and technological
advantages to improve technology in enterprises. By the year 2000,
its high-tech output value is expected to account for 20 percent
of total industrial output value, up from the current 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- The city expects to develop five to 10 brand-name products
and some 100 types of products with an annual sales of more than
100 million yuan each, 20 of which will have annual sales of at
least one billion yuan each.
</P>
<P>
-- It will open wider to both domestic and overseas markets. By
the year 2000, the city's industrial exports are expected to reach
60 billion yuan, accounting for 25 percent of Beijing's total
industrial sales. Total overseas investment in the city's
industries is expected to reach two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local economists predict that the five strategies will allow
Beijing's industries to develop at an average annual rate of 10
percent during the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the city's total annual industrial output
value will reach 210 billion yuan and the figure will be doubled
by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Beijing had about 126 billion yuan in total industrial
output value, an increase of 10.2 percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> "Mad Cow" To Boost Australian Beef Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The outbreak of "mad cow"
disease in Britain is expected to boost Australia's beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer said local producers
might not be able to export more beef to Britain, but they would
expand sales to countries that were affected by the diversion of
European supplies to Britain.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as the British Government is considering
wiping out some of the country's 11 million cattle herd under the
threat of "mad cow" disease, a deadly virus that may kill people
who eat contaminated meat.
</P>
<P>
Britain's beef industry has already been hit by the outbreak,
with over 20 countries in the world banning imports of British
beef and local food companies shifting to overseas supplies.
</P>
<P>
This will affect the beef exports of Europe as a whole, which
is competing with Australia, the United States and South America
in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Britain's one billion Australian dollar (775 million US dollar)
a year beef exports are set to wind back dramatically in the year,
while European countries such as the Netherlands and Germany will
divert their exports from other destinations to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Australia exports a total value of 2.34 billion Australian
dollars (1.83 billion US dollars) of beef in 1995-96. Its major
markets are in Asia, the United States and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Demand for Australian beef grew fast in some increasingly
affluent areas in Asia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. Besides
the traditional market in the Middle East, Australia's live
cattle exporters have found rapidly growing market in southeast
Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
However, Australian exports faces the competition from the
subsidized US beef industry, especially in the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
The latest price review released by Australia's National
Farmers' Federation showed that beef prices fell in March as a
result of a sharp rise of US supplies.
</P>
<P>
"There is no joy in the agony arising from mad cow disease, but
Australian beef exporters stand ready to export where proper
opportunities arise," Fischer said.

<HEADLINE> EU-Aided Agriculture Project Benefits Farmers in Gansu Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua)-- A European Union-backed project
that started more than a year ago, is helping peasants in 14
townships and 20 villages in Gansu build a dairy product
distribution system, ensure quality of dairy products, and train
technicians.
</P>
<P>
Peasants who keep milk cows in northwest China's Gansu Province
had per capita annual income above 800 yuan in 1995 even though
there was an increase in the price of fodder and Gansu was hit by
the worst drought in 60 years. Areas aided by the project still
saw a big increase in both the number of milk cows and the total
volume of milk production while the rest of the province suffered
great losses.
</P>
<P>
Along with the project, local governments have provided 4.9
million yuan, along with free tools, to help peasants keep milk
cows.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has also supplied the largest dairy products
factory in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province, with a 400,000-yuan
loan, to improve facilities and invite foreign experts for
training courses.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Foreign Financial Institutions in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many leading banks in the world, such as Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank,
the Citibank, Lyon Credit Lyonnais, the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, and the Standard Chartered Bank, have
transferred their centers for China-related operations to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of other foreign banks, insurance companies, and
securities firms, have applied to enter Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
As China requires that each foreign-funded bank has at least
300 million yuan-worth of freely convertible foreign exchange in
registered capital, and its deposits attracted in China does not
exceed 40 percent of the total, the foreign banks have put much
more foreign capital into China than joint venture enterprises,
analysts point out.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen International Bank has arranged loans for a project
producing sensitive materials. In Shantou, a special economic zone
in south China's Guangdong Province, foreign financial
institutions extended nearly 60 million US dollars in loans to
joint venture firms, foreign trade corporations, and other
export-oriented companies, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Bank of Japan has not only financed the
construction of infrastructure facilities in the Pudong New Area
but introduced Japanese businessmen to invest in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial institutions have also imported into China,
business practices in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
The Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited of Hong Kong organized an
international seminar on international settlement and accounting
in foreign exchanges for joint ventures in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen International Bank helped their Chinese counterpart
understand changes in inter-bank lending interest rates, and
foreign exchange quotations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-Paris International Bank, the only joint venture
bank in Shanghai, has trained many personnel in international
finance for the local branch of the Industrial and Commercial
Bank, and the Pudong Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign financial institutions have sponsored the training
of staff members of Chinese banks in other countries.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, business exchanges and cooperation between Chinese
and foreign financial institutions have become a common
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Courses, training classes and seminars in this regard are often
held in the city.
</P>
<P>
In Fujian, where there are more than 3,000 enterprises funded
by Taiwanese entrepreneurs, officials have suggested that the
Taiwanese establish financial institutions in order to better
serve those enterprises. Experts have also proposed that
Taiwanese-funded enterprises, and local financial institutions
join hands to set up financial firms.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreign Financial Institutions in East China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign financial institutions
have built up an expanding momentum in China's booming coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the foreign financial institutions
which have ventured into China are found in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's financial hub, has 38 foreign-funded banks,
financial firms and insurance companies, and 119 representative
offices of foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
It means that around a quarter of foreign financial financial
institutions in China have bases in Shanghai, and their assets
exceeded nine billion US dollars at the end of 1995, with loans,
deposits, both in foreign exchanges, and profits jumping by 90
percent, 74 percent, and 55 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Southeast China's Fujian Province has 23 branches,
headquarters, and representative offices of foreign-funded
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Fujian opened China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen
International Bank, in 1985. In 1993, the first wholly
foreign-funded foreign bank operating in China, Xiamen Commercial
Bank, was launched in the scenic city of Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen International Bank has expanded its business volume
and profits by more 20 percent annually, positioning itself among
the top 500 banks in Asia.
</P>
<P>
This month, the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
unveiled regulations allowing branches of foreign-funded banks
meeting certain conditions, to open sub-branches, and wholly
foreign-funded banks, or joint venture banks to open branches in
Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a wave of subsidiaries of foreign-funded
financial institutions being set up in the coastal regions," said
an analyst.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales for New Zealand's
manufacturing industry fell in the December 1995 quarter, ending
five years of continuos growth, show figures available here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to an analysis of the manufacturing industry issued
by the Trust Bank today, total sales volumes of the industry
dropped 0.7 percent in the quarter compared with the same period
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the December 1994 quarter, sales had seen an annual increase
of 11.1 percent, but the growth slowed down last year and turned
into decline by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Reduced export sales volumes are the main cause for the decline
in sales, partly because of the higher NZ dollar. Export volumes
in December 1995 went down 2.3 percent on those of the 1994.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration was due to a decline in forest-based
exports, reflecting the slowing in Australian building and
construction good  exports.
</P>
<P>
There were also lower methanol exports and a 3.5 percent
decline in exports from general manufacturing industries, the
analysis shows.

BELGRADE, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb authorities turned
down today a proposal by a representative of the international
community on a partial release of prisoners of war, demanding that
all prisoners be released at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency said Bosnian Serb parliament speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik and Mihailo Steiner, assistant to High
Representative Carl Bildt, met in the Serb stronghold of Pale to
discuss the issue of the release of remaining prisoners, who
should have been released by all three sides by January 19 under
the Dayton accord.
</P>

At the meeting, Krajisnik rejected a partial settlement of the
POW issues proposed by Steiner and insisted that all prisoners,
including those Serbs jailed in neighboring Croatia, be released
in line with the Dayton accords and the agreement of Saturday's
ministerial meeting in Moscow, according to Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb prisoners are held in Croatian prisons and the
International Committee of the Red Cross has registered them.
</P>
<P>
An appeal to all sides to release all remaining prisoners of
war was issued by foreign ministers from the five-nation Contact
Group and from Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, at a meeting in Moscow
Saturday. The Contact Group comprises Russia, the United States,
France, Germany and Britain
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ICRC and Carl Bildt's bureau said today that
Muslim authorities had only partially fulfilled obligations in the
Dayton accord by releasing 109 Serbs from a prison in Tuzla
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Bildt's spokesman Colum Murphy told a news conference in
Sarajevo that Muslims were still detaining 26 Serbs in Tuzla, a
city in northeastern Bosnia.

Meanwhile, Muslim authorities released today a Bosnian Serb
journalist, Ninko Djuric, who had been detained since

<HEADLINE> OAU Secretary-General Arrives In Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, has
arrived in the Ghanaian capital Accra for a four-day visit, said
a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Ghana, Salim will discuss developments in
the continent, especially the Liberian conflict with the current
Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival on Sunday, Salim said that he was happy that
the 16-nation ECOWAS under the leadership of Rawlings has
brokered a peace agreement which is expected to herald "better
things to come" in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest skirmishes by Liberia's warring factions,
and the attack on the West African Peacekeeping Force in Liberia
known as ECOMOG, and inadequate logistics for ECOMOG have stalled
the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the OAU views attacks on the peacekeepers as a
serious threat to peace in Liberia and called on all Liberians to
live up to the spirit of the peace accord signed in Nigerian
capital Abuja last August, to end the six-year civil war in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We have always believed that the Liberian issue is a test
case for Africa in her effort in conflict resolution and we have
asked the international community to support ECOWAS in sustaining
the peace achieved," he added.
