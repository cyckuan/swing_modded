DAMASCUS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met here Saturday with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa who conveyed to him a message from Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak about the Mideast peace process and its prospects.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Moussa told reporters that his talks
with the Syrian leader centered on the arrangements for the
upcoming Assad-Mubarak summit meeting in Damascus soon.
</P>
<P>
Moussa termed his meeting with al-Assad as quite good, saying
that the meeting was aimed at co-ordinating the Egyptian-Syrian
stance regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the serious movement towards peace should be
based on the land-for-peace principle, and efforts should be made
to push forward the peace talks on all tracks so as to achieve
permanent and stable peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Resuming the peace process on all tracks requires an Arab
co-ordination, specially a Syrian-Egyptian one, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa left here after a few-hour visit.

BAGHDAD, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday called on
Pakistan and India to show restraint in the territory disputes
over Kashmir, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after a cabinet meeting chaired by
President Saddam Hussein recalled the two letters sent by Saddam
last June to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and then Indian
prime minister Bihari Vajpayee after the two countries tested
nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
It is not wise to push the Indian-Pakistani relations to a
level of tense and explosion, said Saddam in the letters.
</P>
<P>
Disputes between India and Pakistan over Kashmir have escalated
into military conflicts since Wednesday as Indian warplanes began
bombing targets in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir on
account of Pakistan's infiltration attempts.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have fought two wars over Kashmir since they
won independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, the United Nations arranged a ceasefire and set up a
truce line, leaving the northwestern third of Kashmir under
Pakistani control and the rest under Indian control.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects No Initiatives From G-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said on Saturday that one should not expect the Group
of Eight, which includes the seven most industralized nations
plus Russia, to make any initiative on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the G-8 will only include a paragraph in their joint
declaration "calling on the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides to
respond to an invitation by the United Nations secretary-general
to resume negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to settle the Cyprus issue hit a stalemate after the
Turkish Cypriot side demanded recognition of "the Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus," unilaterally declared in 1983 and recognized
only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on his return from a trip to the Netherlands and
Demark, Kasoulides said that he has concluded a round of talks
with his counterparts on Cyprus' accession to the European Union
(EU).

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Women Wish to Learn Skills from China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian women wish to learn
 production and sales skills from their Chinese counterparts, Mary
Nagu, the Minister of Community Development, Women Affairs and
Children, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During talks with a delegation of All-China Women's Federation
in her office here, Nagu said Tanzanian women want to learn the
skills of making handicrafts from their Chinese sisters with local
resources such as bamboo.
</P>
<P>
She also said China could introduce the technology of cooking
with coal to Tanzania so that women in the east African country
are able to reduce dependency on charcoal consumption and save
time to develop rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee women's rights, the minister said,
Tanzania has provided training to women and launched projects to
generate income for them.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to keep contact with foreign
organizations to learn their successful experience in developing
agriculture, mining, industry, trade and health, she said.
</P>
<P>
Nagu, who is also a member of parliament, said women of the two
 countries have enjoyed a long history of friendship and that the
 friendship is still developing. She expressed thanks to the
great assistance extended by Chinese sisters, especially the
All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the delegation, Gu Xiulian, who is vice-chairman
of the federation, said there exists possibilities for women in
the two countries to expand cooperation and promote traditional
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Gu said she will discuss with relevant departments at home
about Nagu's proposals.
</P>
<P>
It is important for women to learn knowledge and develop
economy, she said, adding that in China, a number of women have
grasped special skills in raising chicken and cattle, planting
flowers and vegetables, which have economically empowered them and
improved their status in family.
</P>
<P>
The six-member delegation later visited an exhibition of
products made by Artisan Development Agency of Tanzania, a
non-profit organization which provides training to women and help
them produce textiles.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived Friday for a six-day visit, will
meet well- known women activists Biti Titi and Gertrude Mongella,
pay a courtesy call on Tanzania's first lady Anna Mkapa, and tour
Zanzibar.

International Trade Rafidah Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told reporters after the meeting that they discussed
means of increasing the trade volume and investment ventures
between the two countries
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries stood at 233 million
U.S. dollars in 1997, with 10 million dollars of Egyptian exports,
which included chemicals, glass and aluminium products.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who arrived here on Friday, said that he and El-Ganzouri
also tackled ways of exporting more Egyptian goods to the Asian
market and Malaysian products to the Arab and African markets.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Hope for Peace Process in Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda, one of the seven foreign
states militarily involved in the 10-month-long armed conflict in
Congo (K), has proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire there, infusing
a fresh ray of hope for the rocky peace process in the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday in Kigali, the Rwandan capital,
Foreign Minister Amri Sued said Rwanda has decided to declare a
unilateral cessation of hostilities in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
This marks a big stride forward in the efforts aimed at
bringing everlasting peace to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the eruption of the rebellion in the DRC on August 2
of 1998, the rebels quickly controlled the eastern part of Congo
(K). It is reported that at lease one third of the mineral-rich
country was in their hands and what is more, rebels were
reportedly winning battles on the front line.
</P>
<P>
The deepening crisis in former Zaire raised deep concern from
its neighbors and the whole international community.
</P>
<P>
Regional leaders and the international society have made a
series of painstaking diplomatic efforts to push for a negotiated
settlement of the conflict which has been expanding to a regional
war.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila has invited troops of
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad to help fight the Tutsi rebels
while the anti-Kabila forces have been backed by Uganda, Rwanda
and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Just one month after the breakout of the rebellion, a regional
summit was held at Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe on September 18 of
1998. Tutsi rebels fighting to oust Kabila demanded direct talks
with the government, but they were refused a chance to address the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
On October 18, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and his Ugandan
and Tanzanian counterparts Yoweri Museveni and Benjamin Mkapa met
in Nairobi to discuss the Congo (K) issue, calling for immediate
withdrawal of all foreign troops deployed in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, in spite of his age,
did not spare his efforts to try to broker a cease fire in the
DRC. He met leaders of countries involved in the conflict and
tried to persuade them to trade war with peace, using political
and diplomatic means in stead of military approach.
</P>
<P>
Another regional summit was soon held in Lusaka, Zambia with
the Congo (K) issue topping the agenda. However, the
representatives of the Tutsi rebels were, for a second time,
denied access to the meeting attended by foreign ministers and
defense ministers of the 14-member South African Development
Community.
</P>
<P>
As the diplomatic efforts were in full swing, both the
Congolese allies and the rebels were busy preparing for more
intensified offensives and defensives, making the crisis
deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
Though with no breakthrough in sight, the regional leaders did
not give up their quest for a final peaceful resolution to the
worsening conflict.
</P>
<P>
On February 27 of 1999, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
arrived in Uganda for a two-day official visit. Museveni and the
visiting president talked extensively about the crisis. At the
same time, Kabila began to show his willingness to hold direct
talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, brokered by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Kabila
and Museveni finally signed a cease-fire accord in Sirte, Libya.
The accord agreed in principle to a cease-fire. It also called
for withdrawal of foreign troops and deployment of neutral African
peace-keeping forces in the DRC to supervise the withdrawal of
troops and guarantee the security of Congo's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, leaders of Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda signed a joint
 communique in Dodoma, Tanzania, pressing for an immediate
cease-fire and an end to the prolonged regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts gradually began to bear fruit. Shortly after
the Sirte meeting, Chad began to pull out its troops stationed in
the northern part of DRC. Then on May 28, the Rwandan government
decided to cease fire unilaterally in the vast central African
country, agreeing to address its security issue by deploying
African peace-keeping forces along its border to keep away attacks
by Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
This is a clear indication that the parties involved in the
conflict have a strong desire for peace and stability because they
know that without peace, there will be no development and they
cannot rise out of backwardness and poverty.
</P>
<P>
With the peace process being slowly but surely brought back on
the right track, a peaceful settlement of the 10-month-long
conflict is likely to come in sight in the near future, and this
will bring along with it hard- earned chances of development to
the volatile Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Urged to Be Patient with New Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new President Olusegun
Obasanjo Saturday urged his country men and women to be patient
with his government and promised to give "purposeful, forthright
and honest leadership".
</P>
<P>
In his inauguration speech delivered here at the hand-over
ceremony, the new president, who sworn in as Nigeria's second
elected executive president, noted that "I am not a miracle
worker," adding: "it would be foolish to under-rate the task
ahead."
</P>
<P>
Tracing Nigeria's chequered political history, especially
during the last but one military regime, Obasanjo pledged to put
some programs in place for quick restoration of public confidence
in the government.
</P>
<P>
He promised that "within a year of my inauguration, I will
ensure that the impact of our efforts are felt and all negative
impact of the past government will be immediately removed."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo who returns to Nigeria's state house through the
ballot box said, "in the past you have been asked to exercise
patience and make sacrifices, this time the result of your
patience and sacrifice will be glaring for all to see."
</P>
<P>
The new president promised to fight social malaise, notably
corruption, which he described as a cancer that has stalled
national growth.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no sacred cows," he said, adding that "no one
will be allowed to get away with breaking the law of the land
while all efforts will be made to encourage transparency."
</P>
<P>
For Nigeria to regain its past glory, Obasanjo, who had ruled
the country as military head of state from 1976 to 1979, said, "we
must change our ways of governance, of doing business" on the dawn
of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation of the nation's infrastructural decay, combating
of violent crime, stemming of cultism in higher schools, tackling
the debt problem and resolution of crises in the oil-producing
communities were among the priorities of the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Promising to run an all-inclusive government, the new president
said he would stretch his hands of fellowship to all Nigerians
irrespective of their political persuasion.
</P>
<P>
On foreign relations, he said Nigeria would honor all
international obligations and seek closer cooperation with the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He urged western nations to help Nigeria sustain democracy and
reduce its debt burden.
</P>
<P>
At the sub-regional level, he said, Nigeria would seek a quick
resolution through dialog and diplomatic means of the crisis in
Sierra Leone, where his country is leading the west African
peacekeeping force of ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> UK Study Lifts Nuclear Industry Cancer Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Children of workers at nuclear
plants are no more likely to develop cancers, British scientists
have concluded.
</P>
<P>
A new study, published in the latest issue of the British
Medical Journal, found that the incidence of cancer and leukaemia
among children of nuclear industry employees is similar to that of
the general population in England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, from the leukaemia Research Fund based at the
University of Leeds and from other British institutions, have
studied 46,107 children of male and female employees at nuclear
establishments.
</P>
<P>
Overall, they found the proportion of these children who
developed leukaemia was the same as in society at large.
</P>
<P>
The research discovered some evidence that children whose
parent had been exposed to relatively high doses of radiation
before their conception had a higher risk of developing cancer.
</P>
<P>
However, this involved just three cases out of 111, and was
dismissed as "statistically insignificant" by the researchers, who
described their study as "very reassuring findings".

<HEADLINE> Findings: Raw Garlic Tackles Bowel Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in New Zealand have found
eating as little as half a clove of raw garlic per day may protect
people against bowel cancer, New Scientist magazine reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Best known for helping people avoid heart disease, garlic also
has been shown to protects against bowel cancer.
</P>
<P>
To find out how much garlic people needed to benefit,
researchers at New Zealand government's Ruakura Agriculture
Research Center, fed rats a substance in garlic called diallyl
disulfide.
</P>
<P>
Diallyl disulfide, thought to have the most anti-cancer
properties in garlic, causes the gut to produce enzymes that purge
it of cancer-causing particles.
</P>
<P>
After gaving rats for five days a time with varying doses of
disulfide, the researchers found that it increased levels of the
enzyme by up to 60 percent at doses matching modest intakes in
humans.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies had implied that people would have to eat
their own body-weight of garlic to achieve beneficial results.
</P>
<P>
But the new study showed that in rats the beneficial daily
doses of disulfide were between 0.075mg and 0.3mg of disulfide per
kilogram of body weight, which is equivalent to about half a clove
for humans.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Early Five-Way Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordan said on Saturday that it hopes
a proposed five-way Arab summit would be convened soon to attain
the aspired goal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio over telephone
from Amman, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh
expressed the hope that the summit would take place as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He voiced confidence that such a summit meeting would overcome
obstacles facing the peace negotiations between Arab countries and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process is stalled due to outgoing
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intransigence.
However, a hope seems to have come back after Ehud Barak, leader
of Israel's Labor Party, was elected the country's next prime
minister in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
Following the election of Barak, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak called for a summit attended by Egypt, Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon and the Palestinians in an effort to forge a unified Arab
stance on the peace talks with Israel.
</P>

AMMAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
arrived in Amman Saturday for a visit, the first by a Lebanese
head of state to Jordan since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein met with Lahoud and they
discussed economic and political issues of mutual concern, the
situation in south Lebanon and other regional issues, Jordan's
Petra news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the coordination of Arab efforts
in the Middle East peace process after Israeli Labor Party leader
Ehud Barak emerged as the prime minister-elect in the May 17

<P>
Ties between Jordan, Syria and Lebanon soured in 1994 when
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel.

After Abdullah's visit to Damascus, Jordan has reiterated its

<P>
MOSCOW, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
complained Saturday that Russian efforts for a political
settlement of the Yugoslav crisis "have not met understanding and
proper support from the NATO leadership".
</P>
<P>
"The NATO leaders continue to insist, in the form of
ultimatums, that Belgrade unilaterally accept its demands", Ivanov
told reporters following his meeting with his visiting Japanese
counterpart, Masahiko Komura.
</P>
<P>
"We do not understand on what grounds NATO dares claim
sometimes that it acts on behalf of the international community
while it acts only on its own behalf", Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He called for an end to the NATO bombing, which entered the
67th day Saturday, "in the interests of all nations, including the
peoples in the NATO member countries."
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov stressed that "a political settlement is
possible, but it will require all parties to the conflict to show
political will."
</P>
<P>
"There is such will in Belgrade and Russia," but some of the
NATO capitals lack it, which makes Moscow work with even more
vigor to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis, the
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Ivanov as saying.

<HEADLINE> Jubilant Event Marks Start of Nigeria's Civil Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Song Li)
</P>
<P>
ABUJA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo was sworn in Saturday at a ceremony at Eagle Square in
capital Abuja, ending 15 years of military rule in the western
African country.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, which started on 7:15 local time (0615GMT) and
last for above five hours, marks the official launching of
President Obasanjo's civilian government under a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over began when the outgoing Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar gave a last-time inspection of the armed
forces he had served for his entire life as they march around the
square twice.
</P>
<P>
Planes of Nigerian Air Force flew past the square saluting to
the army's outgoing command-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, who is going to retire to his hometown, not far from
the capital, also inspected a jubilant march by voluntary
organizations and students.
</P>
<P>
He later handed over the Constitution, which was passed earlier
this year, and other insignia of government to the new president
who won the general election on February 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
"This day, May 29, 1999 must rank second only to October
1,1960, the day of our independence from Britain," Abubakar said
in his farewell speech.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony culminated when President Obasanjo and his deputy
was sworn in by Nigeria's Chief Justices at about 11:30 a.m. local
time.
</P>
<P>
"I will defend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria," Obasanjo said at the hand-over ceremony administered by
Chief Justice Mohammed Uwais.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo made an inauguration speech outlining his
government' s main policies near the end of the event.
</P>
<P>
Despite many challenges he must address, President Obasanjo has
shown his confidence and determination on many occasions that
Nigeria should and can undertake the leadership on African
continent by reforming and rehabilitating its battered economy and
inefficient governance.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's hand-over could be a start for Nigeria to make a
real difference, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Christen and Moslem Church Leaders also provided prayer service
at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony concluded when Abubakar and President Obasanjo got
a around in the square in a jeep waving hands to the people on the
watching platforms.
</P>
<P>
There will be an all-night dancing Saturday in the capital to
celebrate the return of government to civilian hands.
</P>
<P>
Around 5,000 people attended the ceremony, among whom were
around 30 Heads of state or government. Chinese State Councillor
Ismail Amat, special envoy of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, South
African President Nelson Mandela, British Prince Charles, and U.S.
Human Rights Envoy Jesse Jackson were also sitting behind the
newly-built bullet-proof glass screen shielding Nigerian and
foreign dignitaries.

JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (Xinhua) -- At least one member of the
United Democratic Movement (UDM) was believed dead and six other
members wounded during a shooting in northern KwaZulu-Natal
Province Saturday morning, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The UDM members were apparently on their way to a rally in
Umtata to be addressed by party leader Bantu Holomisa, SAPA quoted
Sifiso Bengu of the party as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bengu said the men were waiting at a bus stop to catch a bus to
Umtata when they were approached by a group of men who allegedly
opened fire on them.
</P>
<P>
He claimed the attackers were well-known members of the ruling
African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
However, a UDM official in Empangeni said that the men had in
fact been putting up posters when the attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
UDM regional leader Bongani Msomi told SAPA that 12 UDM youths
were attacked as they were returning from putting up party posters
in H Section, Esikhawini.
</P>
<P>
They apparently knew their attackers. They talked to them and
as soon as they parted ways, the attackers opened fire on them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Msomi said the seven youths who were wounded were taken to the
Ngwelezane Hospital near Empangeni, where one youth died around
noon.
</P>
<P>
ANC leader in the area, Bheki Ntuli, said they were not aware
of the incident, adding that "we are still trying to confirm the
report."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we are unable to comment further," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- After six hours of detention,
Fereydoun Verdinejad, managing director of the official Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA), was freed on bail on Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported that Verdinejad, also managing direcor of the
pro-moderate newspaper Iran Daily, was freed at 19:00 local times
(1430 GMT) at a bail of 180 million rials (about 60,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The IRNA chief was summoned to the press court Saturday
morning and was put into the Evin prison in northern Tehran after
he failed to provide a bail determined by the court.
</P>
<P>
Before going to prison, Verdinejad rejected the charges raised
against him by the press court judge.
</P>
<P>
"The charges raisedd against me are unfounded, untrue and
baseless and for this reason I protested to the ruling of the
court as not being consistent with press offenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 complaints were filed against Verdinejad by the
Iranian state-run television, 20 members of parliament, the
judicial organization of the armed forces and the police, IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
IRNA and Iran Daily, widely believed to be close to moderate
President Mohammad Khatami, have been under strong attacks by the
conservatives since Khatami came to power in 1997.

The conservative critics accused IRNA and the newspapers
published by IRNA for siding the moderates in their publications.

WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British fighter jets
attacked three Iraqi military sites in southern Iraq, U.S.
military authorities said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. A-10 and F-16 jets and a British GR-1 used
precision-guided munitions to strike two Iraqi anti-aircraft
artillery sites near Al Amarah and An Nashriyah, about 190 miles
from Baghdad, a statement from the U.S. Central Command in Florida
said. the planes also struck a radar site near As Samawah, about
150 miles southeast of Baghdad, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.S. and British jets struck Iraqi
military sites because they were fired upon by Iraqi troops while
patrolling the so-called the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones over both northern and southern Iraq were
imposed by the United States and Britain after the 1991 Gulf War.
but Iraq would not recognize them as the imposition was
obviously the intrusion of its sovereignty of air space.

WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Saturday
shrugged off a report that Yugoslavia may be shifting toward
accepting the peace demands of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>

Meanwhile, Navy Captain Mike Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman,

"We have seen no action that indicates that has occurred. At

campaign," Doubleday said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen any signs of an end to the fighting. We have
not seen any signs of (Serb) troops moving out of Kosovo. We have
not heard from him (Milosevic) in a very direct way indicating
that he is looking forward to an international peacekeeping force
built around NATO command and control that would enforce the peace
there," Doubleday added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a call by France and Germany for G8 talks on the
reports, Doubleday said Washington welcomed any efforts to end the
violence.
</P>
<P>
"I think that everybody is open to any kind of diplomatic
efforts that could bring an end to the fighting that is going on
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. But I don't have any
details of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said Belgrade appeared to have taken a step forward by
announcing its agreement in principle to the peace demands laid
down by the G8 nations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Emphasizes State-Owned Enterprise Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned enterprises need
dynamic management systems and operation mechanisms and should
keep improving themselves to face the challenges of the socialist
market economy, President Jiang Zemin told a two-day symposium on
reforms and development in state-owned enterprises which closed
here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that reforms and development in these enterprises
play a key role in the country's economic restructuring efforts
and should get the attention of the Party and all government
departments.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, held in Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province in
central China, focused on reforms and development in Henan, Hunan,
Hubei, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces and in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the international situation is undergoing
profound changes and developing new characteristics and China
needs to keep improving the its national strength to safeguard its
state security and the people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade, efforts should be made to help large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises get out of difficulties,
initially build a modern system in most of them in three years,
and basically complete the strategic adjustment of them in a
longer period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only by accomplishing this task can the country achieve greater
progresses in the development of the state sector and give full
play to its leading role in the national economy in the next
century, Jiang added.

national economy and make them the main force of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The president urged state-owned enterprises to improve their
technological level and develop a technological innovation

<HEADLINE> I'm Closing Up to Top Form, Says Star Diver Fu Mingxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WENZHOU, May 30 (XInhua) -- China's former world and Olympic
diving champion Fu Mingxia said that she is now about seventy
percent up to her top form, after she won the women's three-meter
springboard title at the China Open Diving Meet here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fu won the event's final with 355.47 points. This is her third
international victory ever since her come-back from retirement
last year. She won in two earlier legs of the 14-leg FINA Diving
Grand Prix series. The China Open in Wenzhou is the eighth leg of
the Series.
</P>
<P>
Fu had obviously put aside her glamorous past when she entered
the interview room for a post-event press conference.
</P>
<P>
"No, I am now not the world's best springboard diver. Every
diver, no matter who, has to take every event and every dive very
serious and victory could entirely depends on who she executes the
dives," she said.
</P>
<P>
And the two-time world champion and two-time Olympic gold-
medalist declined to predict her chance to qualify for or even win
in the 2000 Olymic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the first Olympic qualifying event (for Chinese).
The Olympic Games are still too far away and I can not make any
predictation," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the age of 14, Fu became the world's youngest world champion
at the 1991 world swimming championships in Perth. she staged a
come-back at the national diving champions meet earlier this year,
more than two years after her retirement from active competitions.
</P>
<P>
Fu, now 22, is a student of economics in the Beijing-based
Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Fu admitted that she did not even know how to start when she
competed in her first event late last year, just about six months
after she resumed serious training.
</P>
<P>
"Now I have got used to the atmosphere inside the arena and
I've recovered the feeling I usually had during my career," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a lot for me to improve, for example, my entry
in the execution of dives," Fu added.

<HEADLINE> Williams Upset, Graf, Hingis Advance in French Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams became the surprising
loser when she blew three match points and was ousted from the
French Open by a player ranked 125th in the world on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fifth-seeded Williams, in her worst showing in the last
seven Grand Slam appearances, lost 2-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 in the
fourth round to Austrian qualifier Barbara Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
"There's no need to be sad or depressed because it's only a
small part of life," said Williams.
</P>
<P>
Also eliminated at Roland Garros was Jennifer Capriati, her
exceptional comeback run ending with a quick 6-2, 6-3 loss to
second-seeded Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
Capriati won three matches in Paris just a week after she
captured her first title in six years.
</P>
<P>
"I've come a long way just in the last month,'' Capriati said,
"I never would have thought in a million years that I'd be at this
point. I definitely exceeded my expectations."
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis had a better day when she defeated Ruxandra
Dragomir of Romania, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), to move into the quarters to
face Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf fought off a second-set surge by Anna Kournikova to
win in straight sets 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), setting up a quarterfinal
meeting with Davenport.
</P>
<P>
Graf looked headed for an easy win when Kournikova broke her in
the second set for 5-5. Two games later, Graf saved three set
points to force a tiebreaker, which she won after Kournikova hit
her last forehand wide.
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be back," said Graf, a five-time champion here, "
I've had some memorable matches on center court."
</P>
<P>
In other women's actions, Mary Joe Fernandez, who upset Serena
Williams in the third round in one of the tournament's big
surprises, withdrew with a groin injury during doubles, giving
defending champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario an easy sailing into
the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Among the men, Chile's Marcelo Rios, one of the favorites, came
from two sets down to beat Alberto Berasategui 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
Rios will meet Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia, who defeated Marat
Safin of Russia, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Lion's Share of Golds for China at FINA Diving Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WENZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Two veteran Chinese divers back
from lay-off or retirement from active competitions led an almost
clean sweep of gold medals by the Chinese as the China Open Diving
Meet closed here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese won five out of the six gold medals on offer in the
three-day event, which is the eighth leg of the 14-leg 1999 FINA
Diving Grand Prix serie. The only non-Chinese winner was
Australia's Chantelle Michell, who took the women's one-meter
springboard title.
</P>
<P>
China's former world and Olympic champions Fu Mingxia and Xiong
Ni demonstrated surprisingly high level of performance, winning
their springboard events.
</P>
<P>
Fu, 22, won the women's three-meter springboard title while
Xiong, 25, took the men's three-meter event.
</P>
<P>
Fu's teammate Guo Jingjing won the silver and Australian
Chantelle Michell took the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese Wang Tianling took the second place in the
men's three-meter springboard and Tomoaki Nishikawa from Japan has
to settle for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Fu has won two world championship titles and three Olympic
titles in springboard and platform events, before retiring from
active competitions after the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Fu resumed serious training last year, more than two years
since she was enrolled as a student of economics in Beijing-based
Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
The star diver from central Chinese city of Wuhan said she is
now about seventy percent up to her top form. But poolside
experts thought she did even better.
</P>
<P>
However, the veteran diver declined to predict her chance to
qualify for or even win at next year's Olympic Games. "It's still

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Wins Spanish Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Mika Hakkinen won the Spanish Grand
Prix in Barcelona on Sunday, as his McLaren-Mercedes teammate
David Coulthard finished second to close the gap in the drivers
season standings.
</P>
<P>
Chief rival Michael Schumacher was third followed by his
Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine in the 65-lap race over the 4.738-
kilometer Circuit de Catalunya.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen won by 6.2 seconds over Coulthard with Schumacher 10.8
behind the winner. It was the second victory of the season for
Hakkinen, 11th of his career.
</P>
<P>
However, Hakkinen still trails Schumacher by six points 30-24
after five races of the season.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher who won his first race in Barcelona for Ferrari in
1996, took the Monaco Grand Prix two weeks ago to become the
biggest Ferrari driver with 16 victories and had a two-race
winning streak coming into Spain.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Ferrari was no match for the McLarens on the fast circuit
after Schumacher lost time in the first 20 laps trailing behind
Jacques Villeneuve as well as the two McLarens.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen and Coulthard, who started first and third, pulled
away with Villeneuve slipping into third, and increased to 16.1
seconds ahead of Schumacher after 10 laps and 27 seconds after
another 10 laps.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen pitted on the 23rd lap to give up the lead to teammate
Coulthard and Schumacher came in a lap later followed by
Villeneuve.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher passed Villeneuve in the pit lane after a fast
change of tires and adding fuel, but was still 27 seconds behind
Hakkinen after 30 laps.
</P>
<P>
Although he cut the deficit to 15 seconds by the second pit
stop after 44 laps, Schumacher was still behind Hakkinen and
Coulthard and could not claw back further.
</P>
<P>
The McLarens eventually held the top two spots with the
Ferraris finishing the third and fourth places.
</P>
<P>
Ralf Schumacher, Michael's brother, came in fifth in a Williams-
Supertec. Jarno Trulli of Italy came in sixth in a Prost-Peugeot.
</P>
<P>
The next race is the Canadian Grand Prix on June 13.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom Expanding Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China United Telecommunications
Corp. (China Unicom), China Telecom's chief rival, kept growing
quickly this year, after China Telecom was broken up.
</P>
<P>
According to PC World Daily, the Information Industry Ministry
granted China Unicom exclusive access to the code division
multiple address (CDMA) business and the company plans to spend
seven billion yuan on a CDMA network with a two million mobile
phone line capacity this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of CDMA phone users is expected to increase to 10
million next year and 160 Chinese cities will be covered by the
CDMA network.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom is also making an effort to increase its GSM (
global system for mobile phones) business and expects to get 12
percent of the market by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Guoxin Paging Corporation, previously a China Telecom
subsidiary with 13 billion yuan worth of assets, has been
integrated into China Unicom and this will help strengthen its
position.
</P>
<P>
Guoxin Paging Corporation's revenue amounted to 2.25 billion
yuan in the first quarter of this year, nearly three times of
China Unicom's total for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom is also busy experimenting with Internet phone
services and will begin commercial IP services in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other Chinese cities next month.

<HEADLINE> EU, Germany Keen on Advancing Mideast Peace March: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and Germany
in particular are keen on helping advance the Middle East peace
process, head of a German parliamentary delegation said here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, Moos Bauer, whose country is holding EU's
rotating presidency for the first half of this year, voiced hope
that the deadlock in the peace march would be broken soon.
</P>
<P>
Bauer, head of the German-Egyptian Parliamentary Group in the
German Parliament, called on the next Israeli government to work
to push forward the peace talks with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in the Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations since 1996 when hardline Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu came to power.
</P>
<P>
Hope seems to have prevailed the peace drive after Ehud Barak,
moderate leader of Israel's opposition Labor party, was elected
the country's new prime minister on May 17. Barak has pledged to
push the peace talks with the Palestinians forward and resume the
negotiations with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Bauer underlined that the 15-nation European organization is
committed to the Berlin declaration, which supports the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
An EU summit held in Berlin last March issued a statement that
the Palestinians have an "unqualified right to self-determination,
including the option of a state." The statement voiced EU's
readiness to "consider recognition for a Palestinian state in due
course."
</P>
<P>
The EU supports all efforts aimed at realizing peace in the
region, the German parliament member stressed.
</P>
<P>
The EU and some of its members, including Germany, France and
Britain, want to play a key role in the Mideast peace process
and keep close contacts with Egypt, the first Arab country to sign
a peace treaty with Israel and an active mediator in the
Arab-Israeli talks.

<HEADLINE> San Antonio Beats Portland 80-76 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Rasheed Wallace's emotions were
not enough to overcome Tim Duncan's cool.
</P>
<P>
Wallace scored a playoff career-high 28 points but missed an
open 6 meters jumper in the final seconds as the Portland Trail
Blazers came up short in an 80-76 loss to the San Antonio Spurs in
the opener of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
After an early outburst that earned him a technical foul and a
scoling from coach Mike Dunleavy, Wallace settled down and carried
the offense of the Trail Blazers. He continued to score in the
second half when he spent more time guarding Dundan, an MVP
condidate.
</P>
<P>
"It's a real challenge to go against Timmy," Wallace said. "We
go back to our college days."
</P>
<P>
"Wallace is a monster," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich admitted. "
He has size, strength, quickness and touch. He's handful. He's a
great player. If you want to stop him you have to really go after
him."
</P>
<P>
With the Blazers trailing 78-76, Wallace had an open look from
the left wing with about seven seconds to play. But the forward
missed and the shot bounced over the backboard, giving the Spurs
possession.
</P>
<P>
Duncan presented his usual powers with 21 points, 13 rebounds
and five blocks. Isaiah Rider scored 13 points for the Blazers,
who shot 46 percent but committed 16 turnovers and went to the
line only nine times, making eight.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S.Lanka Claims Progress in Cutting Rebels' Weapons Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan delegation led by
Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar Sunday successfully wound up
their 10-day diplomatic offensive aimed at hitting Tamil rebels'
weapons buying networks in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The tour which took the 10-member delegation to Laos, Vietnam,
Cambodia and Thailand is part of Colombo's efforts to nudge the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) towards
entering into negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the tour would mark a turning point in Sri
Lanka's 16-year-old civil war by securing promises to halt the
LTTE's arms shipping through the four countries.
</P>
<P>
"If weapons stopped coming from this part of the world, it
would starve the LTTE of supplies," said Ravinatha Aryasinha,
spokesman for the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Kadirgamar said Colombo was even considering
joint intelligence and security operations with authorities in
Cambodia and Thailand to cut off any arms supply routes to the
LTTE guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Besides the diplomatic offensive to cut rebels' weapons link,
the Sri Lankan government has tasted success in world isolation of
the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
India and Malaysia have banned the LTTE. The United States has
designated it as a terrorist organization, and Canada,
Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands have launched legal action
against LTTE activists.
</P>
<P>
Despite the success, the Sri Lankan government seems still
unrelieved to find that the LTTE is still able to rely on its
extensive and advanced overseas logistics operations to continue
their armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
According to regional intelligence reports, the LTTE's weapons
buying is now centered in Southeast Asia where arms can be bought
relatively cheaper and easily.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the Tiger rebels were still using the
southern Thai holiday island of Phuket as a staging point for
movement of arms and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Other sources of LTTE weapons are reported to include Pakistan
and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Aryasinha said LTTE networks were shopping in the region for
supplies ranging from fuel to SAM anti-aircraft missiles. These
supplies are then shipped to waters off the coast of Sri Lanka and
collected by Tiger speedboats.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is leading a drawn-out campaign for independence since
1983 in the island's northern and eastern regions where the
minority Tamils are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka spends about six percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP) in its bloody war against the Tigers. Past
initiatives to bring about peace between the two sides have
failed.
</P>
<P>
The government troops had succeeded in driving the Tigers out
of their former stronghold of the Jaffna peninsula in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, the LTTE has lost about 80
percent of its territory by the end of 1998, and 85 percent of the
three million Tamils now live in government-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the LTTE has been suffering more loss of land
and manpower, although the rebels continue to throw guerrillas
into combat with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka says the LTTE gets financial support from some Tamils
living abroad. Most of the LTTE's money comes from Europe, the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
According to Sri Lankan estimates, the LTTE's worldwide income
is believed to be about 2 million U.S. dollars a month, some of
which goes to humanitarian causes, but most of which funds a
sophisticated war machine.
</P>
<P>
More than 450,000 Sri Lankan Tamils live abroad, many of them
victims of ethnic riots. They are thus believed to be inclined to
support armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
While the Sri Lankan foreign minister said assurances have been
given by the four Southeast Asian countries, analysts here say
Colombo's forces are likely to face Cambodian-sourced weapons for
some time.
</P>
<P>
Buying weapons and shipping is easy from countries such as
Cambodia, where corruption in law enforcement and customs controls
remains a widespread and accepted practice, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believed that in the long run the
diplomatic tour would help bring an early end to the civil war and
restore lasting peace in the island country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- "Xiushuijie", the popular clothing
lane near Yabaolu on the east side of Beijing, will be rebuilt,
amidst worries of losing its original flavor, or even worse, its
customers.
</P>
<P>
Yabaolu, which is known as "Russian Street" opened in 1985, is
widely known among tourists and business people from the former
Soviet Union's republics, as a venue for unique clothing styles
and low prices.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 to 10,000 people visits Xiushuijie every day,
nearly 70 percent of them foreigners, and Beijing's garment
exports to Eastern Europe over the past few years have been
estimated at about a billion U.S. dollars worth and to Russia at
about 800 million U.S. dollars worth. But, the wild business scene
quieted down quite a lot during the recession period in Russia.
</P>
<P>
According official sources, the new Xiushuijie will have a
traditional Chinese style that is in line with neighboring stores
and there will be more trade and telecommunications facilities.

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cable television customers
are expected to want 5 million receivers a year for satellite-
transmitted TV programs by the year 2000, as a result of the
rapidly expanding cable TV network.
</P>

According to official statistics, China has 40 million families
using cable TV services. The number of cable TV stations is
estimated at 2,000. By the year 2000, more than 30 percent of
Chinese families with TVs will have cable TV.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Dismisses Indian Claim on Pilot Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani military Sunday
dismissed India's claim as "rubbish and malicious" that an Indian
pilot was killed by Pakistani troops after he was captured in
Kargil sector.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian claim is false, malicious, concocted and a move to
cover up its brutalities and mislead the world opinion," a
military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that any prisoner of war, especially a pilot
is an important asset and no man of conscience could even think to
kill him.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Air Force Sunday condemned what it called the
"cold-blooded murder" of one of its pilots after he bailed out of
his crippled jet and was allegedly captured by the Pakistani army.
</P>
<P>
The body of the pilot, Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja, which was
handed over to the Indian army by Pakistan late Friday, bore three
bullet wounds, Indian sources told journalists in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Ahuja ejected out of his Mig 21 fighter jet after it was hit by
a surface-to-air missile during airstrikes against what New Delhi
calls "infiltrators" holed up in the high reaches of the Kargil
sector in Kashmir on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is holding as a prisoner of war another Indian air
force pilot, Flight Lieutenant K. Nachiketa, who was captured
alive after ejecting from a second Mig shot down the same day.

<HEADLINE> Decline Seen in S'pore Wholesale Trade in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's overall domestic and
foreign wholesale trade indices in the first quarter of 1999
plummeted by 10.4 and 13.8 percent respectively compared to the
same period of 1998, Singapore Department of Statistics (SDS) said
in a press release Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the petroleum, the domestic and foreign wholesale
trade indices slipped by 13.3 and 14.9 percent respectively, SDS
said, noting that the foreign wholesale trade declined for the
sixth consecutive quarter.
</P>
<P>
SDS said the plunge in the wholesaling of household equipment
and furniture as well as general wholesale trade were main factors
contributing to the decline in the domestic index, as their
turnover fell by 38.8 and 37.1 percent year-on-year respectively
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Sales of timber, paints and construction materials and that of
electronic and electrical components fell by 16.7 percent and 10.3
percent respectively while the category of petroleum and petroleum
products and that of office equipment and computers and
accessories picked up by 3.9 and 16.1 percent year-on-year
respectively, SDS said.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign wholesale trade, SDS said general wholesale
trade registered the largest sales slump in the first quarter 1999
as sales of household equipment and furniture, textiles, wearing
apparel and personal effects fell by 26.3, 20.0 and 17.6 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
SDS also noted that wholesale of electronic and electrical
components was the only activities that saw a positive growth of
6.1 percent in the first quarter.

<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China Telecom plans to issue 200
million integrated-circuit cards by the year 2000, making it the
largest IC card market in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Datang Telecom Technology Co., Ltd and Qinghua University
developed China's first integrated circuit designed for a
telephone IC card and tested it in Beijing and in Heilongjiang and
Jiangsu provinces,
</P>
<P>
China has produced more than 100 million IC-cards since it
first introduced them in 1995. They were made with imported chips
mainly from Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that by 2000, Chinese will buy more than 250
million IC-cards for use on 700,000 public telephones across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The IC-card uses an integrated circuit, or computer chip, to
store information. It is more reliable and secure than magnetic
telephone cards and China expects to stop using the 60,000
magnetic card phones now in use in three or four years.

YINCHUAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's machine tool giant Mazak
opened its first overseas joint venture today in the city of
Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Mazak provided 25 percent of the total investment for the new
joint venture, which is expected to start production next year.
The other 70 percent came from the Ningxia Great Wall Machinery
Group.
</P>
<P>
Major products of the joint venture will include precision CNC
lathes and vertical machining centers, according to an executive
of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
Mazak is the world's leading producer of high precision machine
tools, while China is the world's fourth biggest machine tool
market with an annual demand estimated at 3.5 billion U.S. dollars.
Due to the low technological level of its machine-building
industry, China has to have 70 percent of its market share taken
by foreign machine builders.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new joint venture is expected to help
boost technological upgrading of the machine-building industry in
Ningxia and that of the country as a whole, said Sun Wenqing,
chairman of the venture's board of directors.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Submarine's Sinking Seems Not Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Two days after the remains of a
lost Israeli submarine were found, a senior Israeli official said
on Sunday that the submarine's sinking seemed not to be caused by
an enemy action.
</P>
<P>
Gedo Raz, head of the Israeli team searching for the submarine,
was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that initial findings showed
that the submarine might not be sank by a torpedo.
</P>
<P>
Raz added that the probable cause of sinking appeared to be a
technical malfunction or a collision with another vessel on the
water.
</P>
<P>
The submarine, named as Dakar, mysteriously disappeared with
69 sailors on board in 1968 while on its maiden voyage from
Britain to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Its remains were eventually found last Friday by a joint
American-Israeli team at a depth of 2,900 meters, between the
island of Crete and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Raz, who just returned to Israel from the searching site on
Sunday morning, said that two main parts of the submarine were
found on the sea floor with small pieces scattered in a radius of
200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens said on Sunday
that Israel has not spared its efforts to find the Dakar during
the last 31 years, and the new technology developed in recent
years led to the finding.
</P>
<P>
Arens also said that if possible Israel will try to bring the
sailors' bodies back for a military funeral.

-- The civilian at the top of the American military, Secretary

and gave Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander in the field,
more firepower than he wanted.
</P>

JERUSALEM -- Israel's Mekorot water company manager Meir
Epstein predicted over the weekend that toward this fall Israel's
actual water supply will fall at least 80 million cubic meters,
short of the national supply plan.
</P>

JERUSALEM -- A report to be submitted to the Tel Aviv
University's board of trustee on Sunday shows that over the past

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Passes Anti-China Bill on Tian'anmen Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. congress adopted a bill
recently on the 10th anniversary of the Tian'anmen incident,
wantonly attacking China's human rights conditions and interfering
in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The bill that does not have a binding force was passed by the
House of Representatives on May 25 and by the Senate two days
later.
</P>
<P>
Based on American concepts of "democracy" and "human rights,"
the bill accused the Chinese government of "suppressing dissent."
It made indiscreet criticisms of the Chinese government, demanding
that it set up an "investigation Committee" to make inquiry into
the matter; "release all prisoners of conscience, including those
still in prison"; and "allow those exiled" to return.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the U.S. congressmen who submitted the bill
have recently smeared the protests launched by Chinese people
against the May 7 U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade. They also called for a change in the U.S. policy on
China.

China has worked out new measures that it hopes will help it
attract more high-calibre people who have studied abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the recently passed regulations, these people will
be allowed to choose the institutions or state-owned enterprises
they want to work for and can also set up various kinds of
economic entities or research and development institutes. They can
work as government consultants.
</P>
<P>
The regulations give them access to a series of preferential
treatment policies that are similar to those enjoyed by overseas-
funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
If they bring new technology to local enterprises, that
technology can be traded for shares in the company that are worth
up to 35 percent of its registered capital.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Abubakar Military Govt Widely Praised in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The former Head of State General
Abudulsalami Abubakar was widely praised in Nigeria for keeping
his promises by handing over power to democratically-elected
government on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Agriculture Shetima Mustapha commended
General Abubakar for ensuring the success of the transition
program, and for the maintenance of peace, unity and stability in
the country during his 11- month in power, the New Nigerians
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated the out-going head of state for the successful
handing- over of power to President Olusegun Obasanjo, and called
on Nigerians to cooperate with the new government with a view to
ensuring the success of the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Mamuda Yantumaki, gubernatorial candidate of the All
People's Party (APP) for Katsina State, expressed appreciation
to the out-going head of state for fulfilling his promise and
handing over to a civilian on May 29 as earlier scheduled.
</P>
<P>
He called on President Obasanjo to be just and fair so that
every section of the country would have a sense of belonging, and
to initiate measures that will strengthen the value of the
country's currency.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of State on Petroleum Alhaji Umaru Baba told
the media that General Abubakar had proven to Nigerians that he is
sincere and was truly committed to the return of civil rule to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Mussafir Hotel, general manager of a Total filling station,
also commended the Abubakar administration for moving the nation
forward democratically after past regimes had wasted billions of
the country's hard earned resources in executing transition to
civil rule programs.
</P>
<P>
"But the Abubakar administration during its short span of
reign, executed the shortest transition program ever in the
history of the country, he deserves commendation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Yazid Ibrahim, a foremost member of the People's Democratic
Party (PDP) in Kaduna, said the Nigerian governments had spent
time and resources tackling political problems with total neglect
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to him, key macro-economic policies of government
must as a matter of urgency focus on employment creation and
protection of a process to ensure appreciation of local currency
Naira exchange rate and eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Isah, secretary of Kaduna Chapter of the Keffi Old
Boys Association, said that for the first time in the history of
the country, a military man had kept faith it promises,
attributing the success of the transition to democratic rule to
the steadfastness of General Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> Price Fall Hits Bangladesh's Frozen Food Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A sharp fall in frozen food prices in
the international market has severely hit the frozen food industry
in Bangladesh, resulting in a huge quantity of products
stockpiled.
</P>
<P>
Frozen food worth about 4 billion taka (83.3 million U.S.
dollars) has remained stockpiled due to a price fall by 30 to 35
percent in the international market since the beginning of this
month, exporters here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Prices of frozen foods, mainly shrimp, fell by as much as 23.6
percent in a number of importing countries, including the United
States, Japan and European nations, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is no guarantee that we will get better prices as our
competitors lowered their prices and devalued their currency,"
said an official of the Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters
Association.
</P>
<P>
In September and October last year, frozen food prices shed 40
percent forcing the country's exporters to stockpile a huge
quantity of frozen foods in the southwestern Khulna and the
southeastern Chittagong regions.
</P>
<P>
S.M. Amjad Hossain, a major exporter of frozen foods, demanded
15 percent cash incentives from the government on export earnings
from July 1997 to June this year to enable the industries to
weather the crunch.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the help extended to exporters in Vietnam, India
and Thailand by their governments, he said that subsidy would
better suit the local exporters than devaluation to compete in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The drop in prices has already hit the frozen food sector hard
and if the trend continues, the 35 to 40 shrimp processing
factories now operating in the country may face closure, according
to Habibur Rahman, one of the major exporters.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.5 million professional fishermen in
Bangladesh, and the export of frozen food, both fish and shrimp,
contributes about 8.7 percent to the country's total foreign
exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Confirms Reports on Secret Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday confirmed reports that Israel and Syria
had conducted secret talks through various channels in the last
two years, saying progress had been made in security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said the fact that the
talks were held was itself an important achievement of his
government because Damascus had claimed that it would not enter
negotiations with Israel unless Israel first promised to withdraw
from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaretz revealed Friday that Israel and
Syria conducted secret negotiations 1997 and 1998 through at
least three different channels.
</P>
<P>
The report said Netanyahu had agreed in principle to a
significant Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights as part of
a peace agreement and security arrangements, but he repeatedly
backed away from a written commitment at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Involved in the mediating efforts were Oman's Foreign Minister
Yusuf Ben Alawi, the European Union Middle East envoy Miguel
Moratinos, and Netanyahu's friend and U.S. cosmetics tycoon
Ronald Lauder.
</P>
<P>
Former Mossad secret service chief Danny Yatom and Netanyahu's
foreign policy adviser Uzi Arad took part in the talks, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
A variety of drafts had been drawn up in the talks, but none
was formally signed because Netanyahu refused to commit in writing
to a comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan, it said.
</P>
<P>
All the efforts were stopped when the Israeli parliament
voted in December to move ahead the election to May 17,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Ehud Barak trounced Netanyahu in the prime
ministerial race.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian negotiations had not been officially resumed
since they broke off in early 1996 because the two sides disputed
over how the talks should be restarted.
</P>
<P>
Damascus said the talks should be reopened from where they
were left off under the former Labor government, which Syria
said had made a verbal promise to a full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu denied the existence of such a promise and insisted
the talks be resumed from scratch.
</P>
<P>
During the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said he would pass on to
Barak the details on the security arrangements made in the secret
talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised that he will restart negotiations with
Syria after he forms a government and will be ready to make
necessary territorial concessions, although he did not mention to
what extent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister-elect, who is being engaged in coalition
talks with various parties in the parliament, has until early July
to put together a government.

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the General
Staff of China's People's Liberation Army, said here today that
China and Argentina have a similar stance on major international
issues although they differ from each other in social systems.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Joint Chief of Staff of Argentina's Armed
Forces Carlos Maria Zabala and his party, Fu said China takes a
positive attitude toward developing exchanges and cooperation
between the two armed forces at all levels and in all fields at a

Fu said the heroic strength of the Argentine people and armed
forces in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity
and in developing the national economy has won a great deal of
praise.
</P>
<P>
Fu also reiterated China's solemn and just stand against the U.
S.-led NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, which
killed three, wounded more than 20 and destroyed the embassy
premises.
</P>
<P>
Zabala expressed the hope that he can better understand China
through his trip.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine guests expressed their shock over the NATO attack
on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and said they hope that the U.S.
-led NATO will give a satisfactory reply to the four-point demands
of the Chinese government.

NEW DELHI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- India continued its air strikes

<HEADLINE> Limited Access Allowed to Egyptian Pyramid After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Limited visitors will be allowed
inside a famous Egyptian pyramid after its reopening in a bid to
protect the ancient monument, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Only 300 people will be permitted to enter the Pyramid of
Cheops, the largest of Egypt's Giza trio, each day when it reopens
after more than a year of repair work, Director of the Giza
Antiquities Zahi Hawas said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided that 150 people will only be allowed in during
the morning and 150 in the afternoon" in a bid to preserve the
pyramid, Hawas said.
</P>
<P>
Before the restoration work began in April 1998, an average of
800 people visited the pyramid in an hour during the winter and
600 per hour in the summer.
</P>
<P>
Every visitor who enters the pyramid leaves behind about 20
grams of micro particles of water from breathing and perspiring,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
This moisture forms corrosive salts that nibble away at the
limestone, cracking and eventually dissolving it, the newspaper
quoted Hawas as saying.
</P>
<P>
The repair work of the Pyramid of Cheops included the
installation of a ventilation system, which will reduce humidity
and carbon-dioxide levels inside the monument and change the air
every 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The official did not specify a date, but said the pyramid will
open again "soon."
</P>
<P>
When Cheops reopens it will have a new lighting system, cracks
will be patched and tourist graffiti removed, Hawas said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government and medical
bodies will soon declare war on tobacco manufacturers and
consumers in an effort to curb the risks of heart disease and lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Director Julius Meme of Medical Service under the Health
Ministry said here Saturday that a Tobacco Act was being drafted
and will soon be tabled in Parliament, the Sunday Standard quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
When passed, Meme said, the act will protect the country
against multi-national tobacco companies which have moved to
developing countries following tough tobacco laws in Europe and
America.
</P>
<P>
Meme made the remarks when he opened the second free heart week
 of the Kenya Cardiac Society (KCS).
</P>
<P>
The director noted that tobacco advertisements, smoking by
minors, tobacco farming and penalties to the tobacco
manufacturers are some of the areas that will be targeted by the
new act.
</P>
<P>
The KCS Chairman P. A. Odhiambo urged the Health Ministry
officials to address the tobacco and health issues "squarely,
boldly and urgently" in the country.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Singer Wins Eurovision Song Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Swedish singer Charlotte Nilsson
won the 44th annual Eurovision Song Contest Saturday night in
Jerusalem with a song whose style was reminiscent of the famous
Swedish supergroup Abba.
</P>
<P>
Her English song "Take me to your heaven" was awarded 163
points by telephone polls conducted among 300 million TV viewers
in the 23 European countries participating in the contest.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth time that Sweden won the Eurovision song
contest. It was also the first year since 1974 that the entrants
were allowed to sing in languages other than their native tongues.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the contest, Nilsson admitted that
her song sounds like Abba, the popular group which won the
Eurovision song contest in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Iceland's Selma, who had been favored to win before the
contest and was neck-and-neck with Nilsson throughout the
45-minute vote after the contest ended at midnight, came in
second with 146 points.
</P>
<P>
The annual contest, which began in 1956, was designed to bring
European countries closer together.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Anti-China Resolution Slammed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of the Chinese
National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee today made a
statement on an anti-China resolution adopted by the U.S. Congress
recently.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the statement:
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate adopted anti-China
resolutions on May 25 and 27 respectively with the excuse of the
so-called "the 10th anniversary of June 4 Incident", wantonly
distorting historical facts, attacking China's human rights
conditions, inciting a new anti-China wave by using the incident
on which a final conclusion has long been made, attempting to
undermine China's stability, and obstructing the development of
the Sino-U.S. relations. We are firmly opposed to that.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that some people with ulterior motives in and
out of China made that political disturbance in Beijing at the
turn of the spring to the summer in 1989, in an attempt to
overthrow China's legitimate government and subvert the socialist
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government of course took immediate, correct and
resolute measures and successfully stopped the disturbance, thus
maintained social stability and ensured the smooth development of
the reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The experience of the past ten years fully proves that if there
were no such correct decisions made by the Chinese government at
that time, there would be no political stability and today's
remarkable economic and social progress and generally-recognized
achievements in China.
</P>
<P>
The anti-China forces in the United States and some other
Western countries played an inglorious role in that disturbance.
They took an active part in it, by not only making and spreading a
host of horrifying rumors by using their media to cheat and
hoodwink the international community, but also directly
masterminding schemes and giving money and goods to support those
making the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
After the abortion of the disturbance, the anti-China forces,
disregarding the international law and Chinese laws, provided
shelter for the major criminals, and helped them flee China, and
kept them, and instigated them to continue activities against the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Now, the U.S. congress brazenly and peremptorily interfered in
China's internal affairs in its anti-China resolution, flagrantly
demanding that the Chinese government set up a certain "
investigation committee" and "reevaluate" the incident, in an
attempt to reverse the conclusion of the incident, which is
extremely domineering. This is doomed to failure.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the U.S. Congress, there are always some people who pose as
"guardians of human rights", and advocated "human rights above
sovereignty" out of parochial political prejudice or out of
hegemonic mentality of using the strength to bully the weak.
</P>
<P>
Under the signboard of "democracy", "freedom", and "human
rights", they wantonly interfered in internal affairs of other
countries, trampled on the sovereignty and human rights of other
countries, in an attempt to force their social system and value
concepts on other countries and to realize their ambition of
dominating the world exclusively.
</P>
<P>
What the United States has done in Yugoslavia is a good
illustration of the above-mentioned opinion.
</P>
<P>
The indiscriminate bombing of Yugoslavia by U.S.-led NATO in
the past two months killed many innocent civilians and made nearly
one million people leave their native places and become homeless.
</P>
<P>
In disregard of the United Nations Charter and other
universally acknowledged international norms and conventions, they
recklessly attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7,
causing casualties of Chinese journalists and staff members and
heavy loss of property.
</P>
<P>
The biggest human rights and humanitarianism disaster they made
in Yugoslavia since the end of the Cold War has fully exposed the
hypocrisy of the human rights concepts advocated by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always valued the protection of
human rights and has introduced effective measures to steadily
improve the human rights conditions in China, and has scored eye-
catching achievements in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people now enjoy unprecedentedly extensive human
rights. China respects the universal principle of human rights,
and has persistently and actively participated in international
activities in the field of human rights, going all out to advance
a healthy development of the international human rights cause.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China firmly opposes using the issue of human rights
to impose pressure on other countries. All attempts of using the
pretext of human rights to interfere in China's internal affairs
are doomed to failure.

<HEADLINE> Some 152 Kenyans Die of Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death toll of malaria, a tropical mosquito-borne disease
and top killer in Africa, reached 152 on May 29 from 108 on May
26, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Julius Meme, director of Medical Services in the ministry,
expressed the fear that the spread of malaria could threat new if
the trend can not be reversed.
</P>
<P>
Meme said Saturday that climate change has made malaria "tricky
 and tricky to handle", according to The Herald weekly published
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Kissi district, who live near Lake Victoria and
have not developed immunity against malaria like residents in the
Indian port Mombasa, are vunerable to malaria, Meme said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that if the cases had been reported earlier, some
people would have been saved.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has dispatched drugs to the area and taken
 preventive measures to ensure the spread does not get out of
control.
</P>
<P>
Meme said that with the development of vaccine, the government
would be close to solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
However, some international medical experts believe so far
there is no effective vaccine.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Positive Economic Growth in Sight             in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economic growth in
the second half of the year would be much better than that in the
first, and the forecast average annual growth rate of 0.5 percent
is likely to be achieved despite some difficulties, local analysts
have predicted.
</P>
<P>
Government Economist K. Y. Tang said that there have been signs
of economic recovery for Hong Kong, which will enjoy positive
growth rate in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts, either from local or international institutions,
hold the similar view, Tang said. However, they differ in the
extent of the recovery and how long people need to wait before the
positive growth emerges, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
This compares with the corresponding forecasts of -1.3 percent
put out by the International Monetary Fund, -1 percent by the
World Bank, -0.5 percent by the Asian Development Bank, and zero
percent by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
</P>
<P>
As to the corresponding forecasts by local analysts, the more
recent revisions are all upward. Their latest forecasts range from
-1.5 percent to +1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lok Sang Ho, head of the Economics Department of the
Lingnan College, said that a recovery in the second half of this
year is very likely, but he's not so optimistic for the average 0.
5 percent growth for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government said on Friday in its First Quarter
Economic Report that Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
decreased by around 3.5 percent in real terms in the first quarter
of 1999 from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
This was much smaller than the decline of 6.9 percent in the
third quarter and 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, GDP in the
first quarter of 1999 was down by around 0.4 percent in real terms,
likewise smaller than the declines of 1.4 percent in the third
quarter and 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
said that the worst of Hong Kong's economy has been over and if
this trend continues, his estimates that a 0.5 percent growth for
1999 as a whole is achievable.
</P>
<P>
The driving force for the recovery would come from the external
demand for Hong Kong's products and services and local spending as
well, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the high unemployment rate at present, the local
spending would still be weak, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 6.2 percent
in the first quarter of 1999 (6.3 percent in the three months
ending April) while the underemployment rate stayed at 3 percent
in the first quarter (edging down to 2.8 percent in the three
months ending April 1999).

<TEXT>
<P>
Vincent Kwan, senior economic research director of the Hang
Seng Bank, said that the overseas situation is very important for
Hong Kong's recovery considering the openness of Hong Kong's
economy.
</P>
<P>
In general, exports continued to fall amid a still difficult
trading environment. But exports to some of the East Asian markets
have rebounded visibly as the regional economic situation
stabilized. The rate of decline in total exports is becoming
smaller than in the earlier periods.
</P>
<P>
On invisible trade, exports of services have recovered further
along with the pick-up in inbound tourism in the first quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is a notable surplus in the invisible trade
account, more than offsetting the much reduced visible trade
deficit to give a sizable surplus in the combined visible and
invisible trade account.
</P>
<P>
The spending of overseas tourists in Hong Kong would stipulate
the local retail industry.
</P>
<P>
However, investment spending continued to be overshadowed by a
generally cautious attitude of banks towards corporate lending,
uncertain business outlook, and high interest cost in real terms.
</P>
<P>
And the potential interest rate increase in the United States
would be slim and there is still room for the local interest rate
in real terms to reduce.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has lowered Hong Kong's business
cost and prices significantly to a more reasonable level and the
long term overseas investment will increase later this year, the
analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
Actually, sentiment had turned better in Hong Kong recently,
upon a more stable financial situation, improved bank liquidity
along with successive cuts in nominal interest rates, higher share
prices, and resumed pick-up in the residential property market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the financial secretary has pointed out there are
areas of uncertainty in the external environment.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the trade figures continued to be quite
disappointing, which is largely due to the reduced exports and re-
exports from China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, there has been no significant improvement in the
Japanese economy which would then affect the liquidity and the
rate of improvement and the recovery of the whole of the Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
Then there are also signs of somewhat over-heating in the
economy of the United States, Hong Kong's largest external market.
If there were any major correction in that market it would affect
the rate of recovery in the whole of the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Among the "four tigers" in Asia, Hong Kong has lagged behind
the other three in recovering. The Republic of Korea, Taiwan and
Singapore have all recorded positive growths in the first quarter
this year.
</P>
<P>
Kwan said that to grow fast or slowly is not important. Now
what's important is how Hong Kong can keep its economy growth in a
sustainable way.
</P>
<P>
Tang said as Hong Kong has good economic fundamentals, the
sustained recovery can be kept.

<HEADLINE> No Race to Build Relations With Iran: GCC Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Jamil Al Hujailan,
secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), has
denied a race is going on among GCC members to build relations
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
A number of factors, including geographical location and
common interests, demanded the coming togetherness of the
countries of the region, which includes Iran, Al Hujailan told the
Dubai-based Arabic daily Al Bayan published on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"But there is not a race to build relations with Iran,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the only obstacle to the relation-building is the
dispute between the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a GCC member, and
Iran over the three islands of Abu Moussa and Greater and Lesser
Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, which are located near strategic shipping
lanes in the Gulf, are claimed by both countries but occupied by
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Al Hujailan said all other five members of GCC, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, have reiterated their commitments
to supporting the UAE on the islands issue and to resolving the
issue through peaceful negotiations or international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami made
historic visits to Saudi Arabia and Qatar, clearing the way for
better relations with its former foes.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, which calls for unified actions among GCC countries in
dealing with Iran, has been feeling uneasy about the
rapprochement.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Boost Information Technology Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that it will boost the growth of the information technology
(IT) industry by establishing a special economic zone for computer
and electronics-related firms.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the presidential palace said that
the IT zone concept is an expanded version of an earlier proposal
for the establishment of a Silicon Valley-type economic zone for
investors in computer software development.
</P>
<P>
The IT zone hopes to develop a hub that will nurture the growth
of the IT industry by capitalizing on the country's advantages in
the field of software development and other computer applications,
it said.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to be the primary zone that will attract
foreign and local entrepreneurs to invest in information
technology, the palace said.
</P>
<P>
The activities to be supported by the IT zone, according to the
palace, will include software and content development for
business, education electronic commerce, and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Prospective developers such as the Megaworld and Filinvest have
already submitted proposals to the government identifying possible
sites and suggesting development strategies for the IT zone, it
said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies to Be Part of Peace-keeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has denied the
report that it will join some African countries to deploy a
peace-keeping force in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keeping force, sponsored by Libya, reportedly will
include troops from Nigeria, Namibia, Eritrea and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Marco Boni, spokesman for the South African Foreign Affairs
Department, said at the weekend that Libya had told South African
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad that it would send 40 observers
to the DRC, but no mention was made of South African involvement.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to be part of the peace-keeping force it would not
be announced by Libya," Sunday World newspaper quoted Boni as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It has been noticed that Libya is trying to be active in
dealing African affairs since the United Nations recently lifted
its sanctions against Libya following the extradition of two
Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of an aircraft over Scotland.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, chairman state of the Southern African
Development Community and the Non-Alignment Movement, has been
trying to play a mediation role since the DRC crisis was erupted
in August last year.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa has so far made no significant progress
in stopping the DRC civil war.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Unified Arab Stance on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Sunday called on Arabs to
further join efforts in forging a unified stance toward the coming
stage of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The history of the past five decades "has amply showed that
inter-Arab fragmentation has played into Israel's hands," an
editorial carried by the Egyptian Gazette newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The official Egyptian newspaper urged Arab countries to
"discard their squabbling and project a cohesive image."
</P>
<P>
Observers in Cairo said the call was made after Syria's failure
to respond positively to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
invitation to a five-way summit attended by Egypt, Syria, Jordan,
Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Syrians are still keeping a distance with the Palestinians due
to the Palestinians' signing of interim peace accords separately
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
To persuade Syria to take part in the proposed summit, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa was flown to Damascus on Saturday and
held talks with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa and
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette welcomed the "nourishing signs" that the
Arabs "have learned the lesson" of disintegration by exerting
"serious efforts" to close ranks and formulate a unified stance
vis-a-vis peace.
</P>
<P>
Only cohesiveness can help the Arabs achieve "the hoped-for
vigorousness" of the Middle East peace process, the newspaper
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in the Arab-Israeli peace talks
since 1996 when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to
power due to his intransigence.
</P>
<P>
A hope seems to have come back to the event now that Ehud
Barak, moderate leader of Israel's opposition Labor party, has
been elected the country's next prime minister. He has pledged to
push the talks with the Palestinians forward and resume the
negotiations with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian newspaper, meanwhile, warned that without Arabs'
acting in unison, Israel, no matter who is at the helm, would
continue foisting agenda on the Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Hope for Peace Process in Great Lakes Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda, one of the seven foreign
states militarily involved in the 10-month-long armed conflict in
Congo (K), has proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire there, infusing
a fresh ray of hope for the rocky peace process in the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday in Kigali, the Rwandan capital,
Foreign Minister Amri Sued said Rwanda has decided to declare a
unilateral cessation of hostilities in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
This marks a big stride forward in the efforts aimed at
bringing everlasting peace to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the eruption of the rebellion in the DRC on August 2
of 1998, the rebels quickly controlled the eastern part of Congo
(K). It is reported that at lease one third of the mineral-rich
country was in their hands and what is more, rebels were
reportedly winning battles on the front line.
</P>
<P>
The deepening crisis in former Zaire raised deep concern from
its neighbors and the whole international community.
</P>
<P>
Regional leaders and the international society have made a
series of painstaking diplomatic efforts to push for a negotiated
settlement of the conflict which has been expanding to a regional
war.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila has invited troops of
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad to help fight the Tutsi rebels
while the anti-Kabila forces have been backed by Uganda, Rwanda
and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Just one month after the breakout of the rebellion, a regional
summit was held at Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe on September 18 of
1998. Tutsi rebels fighting to oust Kabila demanded direct talks
with the government, but they were refused a chance to address the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
On October 18, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and his Ugandan
and Tanzanian counterparts Yoweri Museveni and Benjamin Mkapa met
in Nairobi to discuss the Congo (K) issue, calling for immediate
withdrawal of all foreign troops deployed in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, in spite of his age,
did not spare his efforts to try to broker a cease fire in the
DRC. He met leaders of countries involved in the conflict and
tried to persuade them to trade war with peace, using political
and diplomatic means in stead of military approach.
</P>
<P>
Another regional summit was soon held in Lusaka, Zambia with
the Congo (K) issue topping the agenda. However, the
representatives of the Tutsi rebels were, for a second time,
denied access to the meeting attended by foreign ministers and
defense ministers of the 14-member South African Development
Community.
</P>
<P>
As the diplomatic efforts were in full swing, both the
Congolese allies and the rebels were busy preparing for more
intensified offensives and defensives, making the crisis
deteriorate further.
</P>
<P>
Though with no breakthrough in sight, the regional leaders did
not give up their quest for a final peaceful resolution to the
worsening conflict.
</P>
<P>
On February 27 of 1999, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
arrived in Uganda for a two-day official visit. Museveni and the
visiting president talked extensively about the crisis. At the
same time, Kabila began to show his willingness to hold direct
talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, brokered by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Kabila
and Museveni finally signed a cease-fire accord in Sirte, Libya.
The accord agreed in principle to a cease-fire. It also called
for withdrawal of foreign troops and deployment of neutral African
peace-keeping forces in the DRC to supervise the withdrawal of
troops and guarantee the security of Congo's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, leaders of Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda signed a joint
communique in Dodoma, Tanzania, pressing for an immediate
cease-fire and an end to the prolonged regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts gradually began to bear fruit. Shortly after
the Sirte meeting, Chad began to pull out its troops stationed in
the northern part of DRC. Then on May 28, the Rwandan government
decided to cease fire unilaterally in the vast central African
country, agreeing to address its security issue by deploying
African peace-keeping forces along its border to keep away attacks
by Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
This is a clear indication that the parties involved in the
conflict have a strong desire for peace and stability because they
know that without peace, there will be no development and they
cannot rise out of backwardness and poverty.
</P>
<P>
With the peace process being slowly but surely brought back on
the right track, a peaceful settlement of the 10-month-long
conflict is likely to come in sight in the near future, and this
will bring along with it hard- earned chances of development to
the volatile Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Women Wish to Learn Skills from China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian women wish to learn
production and sales skills from their Chinese counterparts, Mary
Nagu, the Minister of Community Development, Women Affairs and
Children, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During talks with a delegation of All-China Women's Federation
in her office here, Nagu said Tanzanian women want to learn the
skills of making handicrafts from their Chinese sisters with local
resources such as bamboo.
</P>
<P>
She also said China could introduce the technology of cooking
with coal to Tanzania so that women in the east African country
are able to reduce dependency on charcoal consumption and save
time to develop rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee women's rights, the minister said,
Tanzania has provided training to women and launched projects to
generate income for them.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to keep contact with foreign
organizations to learn their successful experience in developing
agriculture, mining, industry, trade and health, she said.
</P>
<P>
Nagu, who is also a member of parliament, said women of the two
countries have enjoyed a long history of friendship and that the
friendship is still developing. She expressed thanks to the great
assistance extended by Chinese sisters, especially the All-China
Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the delegation, Gu Xiulian, who is vice-chairman
of the federation, said there exists possibilities for women in
the two countries to expand cooperation and promote traditional
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Gu said she will discuss with relevant departments at home
about Nagu's proposals.
</P>
<P>
It is important for women to learn knowledge and develop
economy, she said, adding that in China, a number of women have
grasped special skills in raising chicken and cattle, planting
flowers and vegetables, which have economically empowered them and
improved their status in family.
</P>
<P>
The six-member delegation later visited an exhibition of
products made by Artisan Development Agency of Tanzania, a
non-profit organization which provides training to women and help
them produce textiles.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which arrived Friday for a six-day visit, will
meet well- known women activists Biti Titi and Gertrude Mongella,
pay a courtesy call on Tanzania's first lady Anna Mkapa, and tour
Zanzibar.

<HEADLINE> Power Supply Benefits Ethiopia's Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Electric Power
Corporation announced that 146 towns in the country have became
beneficiaries of power supply over the last eight years following
the construction of various projects.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian Herald" quoted Sunday Sendequ Araya, public
relations manager of the corporation, as saying that his
corporation has spent about 290 million U.S. dollars on the power
projects.
</P>
<P>
Araya said that installation of hydro-electric plants that
generate 34 mega-watt on Fincha River has been finalized and hydro
power stations on Kora, Tis Abbay and Awash II projects are being

<HEADLINE> Iranian Daily Refutes U.S. Charge against China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian newspaper Iran Daily
Sunday scorned the recent U.S. ballyhoo propaganda against China ,
terming the theft charges against Beijing as "a Republican
publicity gambit."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. allegation of Chinese theft of its nuclear secrets
has the makings of the biggest setback in the quarter-century of
the two nations' renewed relations, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted, for many foreign observers, the question
looks an awful lot like a Republican publicity gambit and it is
designed to make the most of the coming presidential election
season.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the Americans are prepared to make an accounting of
what went missing and how, and are ready to have outside expert
opinion assess the claims, their protestations will not suffice to
sway international opinions on China's supposed culpability," the
daily pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It said that "it was a bit hard to digest that Taiwan-born
U.S. citizen Mr. Wen Ho Lee, the primary suspect, has been under
some form of surveillance for two decades, and though he was fired
from his job at Los Alamos in March, he still has not been charged
with any wrongdoing."
</P>
<P>
"How can a man who is being watched by the FBI, pirate the core
workings of miniature missile technology from under the noses of
the entire American intelligence apparatus?" the paper questioned.
</P>
<P>
"Another line of thinking has it that the Americans are still
thrashing about for enemies in the wake of the Soviet Union's
meltdown," it said, "this fits well with the Anglo-American 'Clash
of Civilizations' future vision and those right-leaning members of
the American political elite who ascribe to it."
</P>
<P>
The daily said that China, being so enormous, quintessentially
a "foreign" culture, fiercely independent, nuclear armed and on an
amazing economic ascent, marks it as the outstanding Asian
challenge for the Americans in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the country has either been the devil incarnate for the Americans
or treated as a friend simply because enmity costs too much, it
said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are hearing noises reminiscent of the hysteria of
the 50s. How long can this continue? Probably through the ongoing
Kosovo crisis, on which Beijing is famously on the opposite side
of the fence from Washington," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
In all of this, it said, clearly the Americans are creating a
negative propaganda wall around China for a variety of reasons
including Taiwan and the long-term need for Washington to frighten
other Asian states about Beijing's intentions.

<HEADLINE> Nouri Re-elected Iran's Parliament Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Majlis
(parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri was re-elected on
Sunday for another one-year term after the rival moderate faction
failed to overwhelm him in the election.
</P>
<P>
In the internal election of the 270-seat Majlis, broadcast live
by Tehran radio, Nouri secured 161 votes out of the total 246
while his moderate rival Majid Ansari gained only 85 votes.
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth term for Nouri as Majlis speaker since he was
elected in 1992 during the fourth Majlis election.
</P>
<P>
During the election, Hassan Rowhani and Ali Movahedi Kermani
were also re-elected as first and second vice speakers.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily Tehran Times said Sunday the Party of
Constructive Executives of Iran, a main party supporting moderate
President Mohammad Khatami, had asked Rowhani to challenge Nouri,
but Rowhani rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Nouri's re-election indicated the continued
dominance of the Iranian conservatives on the country's
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Considering Fuel Rationing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government and oil
companies are considering rationing fuel as a stop-gap measure to
control the current shortage of fuel in the country due to the low
prices, The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM),
the sole importer and distributor of fuel in the country,
confirmed that there was a shortage of fuel already in the country
and it was imperative to either introduce fuel rationing or hike
the retail prices.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the delay to increase the prices could
result in the collapse of some companies as the oil industry was
operating at a loss due to low retail prices, which did not match
the costs of importing the fuel.
</P>
<P>
He said since attempts to increase fuel prices were being
opposed by a lot of people, the government's only option was to
ration fuel.
</P>
<P>
The business community has been calling for the increase in the
 prices of fuel but the proposals met heavy criticism from the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which feared that the hike
could trigger fresh increases in the prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira said
Saturday in an interview with The Sunday Mail that the hike in
fuel prices was inevitable in view of the prohibitively high costs
of importing fuel.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "Several economic commentators have said
fuel increases cannot be delayed any further because the oil
industry is presently running a serious loss which is threatening
to bring the entire industry to its knees."
</P>
<P>
He said banks would not continue financing the operations of
NOCZIM since it was not realizing any substantial dividends.
</P>
<P>
Chairman and managing director of Mobil, one of the major oil
suppliers in the country, Tom Walter, who represents the oil
companies, said the present economic conditions dictated that the
matter be handled with sensitivity if the oil industry was to
remain viable.
</P>
<P>
He said the international prices of fuel were 20 to 40 percent
higher than the current prices in Zimbabwe. The present prices
were unsustainable and the oil industry could fail to purchase
further supplies if the prices are not adjusted upwards.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy Booming in Small Southern Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A local saying goes that nine out
of ten farmers in Humen, a small coastal town with a population of
90,000 in south China's Guangdong Province, are business bosses.
</P>
<P>
The saying indicates the rapid development of the private
economy in Humen, a battlefield during the 1840-1842 Opium War,
since China introduced its reform and opening up policy in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
A number of people have now become very rich and even
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that there are 8,056 privately-owned
enterprises in Humen, accounting for 78 percent of the town's
total.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the industrial output value of the enterprises reached
500 million yuan (60 million US dollars), or one-sixth of the
town's total. Taxes turned over to state coffers by the
enterprises stood at 80 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The development of the private economy in Humen, a close
neighbor of Hong Kong and Macao, started in the early 1980s when a
clothing and daily necessities market was established, a senior
official from the town said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a 70-million yuan store, the largest in the Pearl
River Delta specializing in selling clothing, was established in
the town with funds from the town government and collected by
local people.
</P>
<P>
After years of development, an area of a square kilometer
emerged in Humen which has become known as a "garment city".
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1996, the town began hosting an international
garment fair every autumn which have attracted both domestic and
overseas businessmen, with turnover averaging 1.2 billion yuan
each year.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the town, known as one of China's four major garment
producers, has 500 garment manufacturing factories and 14 big
stores specialized in selling garments, with an annual sales
volume of 7 billion yuan.

ABU DHABI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will adopt an anti-dumping law, the first of its kind in the
Middle East countries, a UAE customs official has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big dumping problem in the UAE as some Gulf and
Asian countries are exporting goods at prices which are cheaper
than in the country of origin, or the same products made in the
UAE," Dr. Obaid Saqer Busit, chairman of UAE Customs Council and
director-general of Dubai Customs, was quoted Sunday by Khaleej
Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Busit, Dubai Customs is now working on a
anti-dumping law which is to come into force in the nearest
future.
</P>
<P>
"There must be an anti-dumping law, and we will introduce
it for the first time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Spare parts, foodstuff, electrical equipments and other cheap
products coming from some Middle East countries have spoiled the
local market and affected it very badly, as the UAE does not put
customs duties for Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries,
Busit said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain
and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Busit added some Asian countries, seeing the UAE as a big
market, are also bringing their goods here for hard currency.
</P>
<P>
The dumping problem is a long-standing one, he said, adding it
is not new in the UAE as well, but the problem is becoming bigger
than before, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take steps against that, which means that we
need a law stopping this kind of activities," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks' Bad Loans to Rise This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The level of non-performing loans
(NPLs) of Philippine banks is likely to reach 14 percent this
year, according to Goldman Sachs Investment Inc.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here Sunday, Goldman Sachs Executive
Director Donald Hanna said that the NPLs forecast is slightly
higher than the 13.2 percent registered by Philippine banks in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the NPLs level of Philippine banks is far
better than that recorded by other Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
"Although NPLs are rising, these are only around one-third of
those in the neighboring countries," Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Central Bank of the Philippines,
NPLs in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea range from
between 35 percent to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hanna said that Philippine banks have remained stable and the
country has been ranked the third with the most healthy financial
institutions in the region, next to China's Hong Kong, and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
A loan is considered non-performing if there has been no
payment made on interest or principal for three consecutive
months.

TIANJIN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Fragments of an elephant's tusk
estimated to be two million years old were found last month by
workers in Jixian County of Tianjin Municipality in a brick-

long, was excavated in segments from sandstone seven meters
underground.

Other fossilized parts of the elephant, including its backbone,
upper and lower jaws and several limbs were also found and all the
items are now stored in the Tianjin Nature Museum.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Boeing Company
pledged the company's continued growth in China, the Business
Weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing is committed to continued growth in China and will
continue to support not only the airlines but also the
manufacturing sector," said Larry Dickenson, vice-president of
Asia Pacific operations in the company's Commercial Airplanes
Group.
</P>
<P>
Boeing plans to send airline experts to work with individual
airlines, analyzing the route structures, fleet deployment and
utilization, yield management and many other operational
characteristics to see how it can help develop a plan that will
enable Chinese airlines to be more efficient and to generate
profits, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Saying that some Chinese airlines definitely need some major
adjustment in operational aspects, Dickenson said Boeing is
optimistic because it takes a long-term view of the opportunities
here.
</P>
<P>
He said China had made remarkable progress over the past decade
in the aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that Boeing is to launch its 717-200, a
100-seat twinjet that is about to complete its flights test
program and pass the certification process.
</P>
<P>
Dickenson said China will need around 200 airplanes of this
kind early in the next century. Last year, Boeing delivered over

CARACAS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's international reserves
closed on May 27 at 14.03 billion U.S. dollars, its highest level

The rise is attributed to the stock market stability, an

the reduction of imports because of the economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The total international reserves dropped to 13.14 billion
dollars in January, the lowest level registered this year.
</P>
<P>
The fall was caused by the lower prices drop and the debt

MEXICO CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The issues of economy, natural
disaster prevention and political cooperation will be high on the
agenda of the Latin America and the Caribbean Summit with the
European Union to be held in Rio de Janeiro June 27-28.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the foreign ministers of the Rio Group
here on Saturday, after a meeting concurred with the 13th Rio
Group Summit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, drafts were made and will be discussed
later next week as basis for the final document to be presented by
Latin America in the June summit, Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario
Green said.
</P>
<P>
The international financial situation, the political and
economic contacts between Latin America and the European Union,
the prevention of natural disasters, and the fight against crime
and corruption will be the focuses of the proposed Latin American
agenda to the European Union, Green told the press.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group members agreed to grant juridical power to the
Center of Regional Formation and Integration, a mechanism of
cooperation with the European Union that already exists, and
approved two statements on preventing natural disasters "with
operable means that will avoid useless repetition of the same kind
of assistance."

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Summit Proposes New Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Rio Group
gathered on the bloc's 13th summit here Saturday to discuss a new
financial system.
</P>
<P>
A Brazilian delegate told Xinhua that a proposal to set up the
new financial system has the support of his country, as well as
Argentina and Mexico, the three biggest economies in the group.
</P>
<P>
The proposal urges to set up a more stable international
financial system so that more resources will be available to
prevent on time possible financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Crises like the one that hit the Latin America in 1998 hamper
efforts for reform, openness and economic stabilization of those
less developed countries in the region, the delegate said.
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group was founded by eight nations of Colombia, Mexico,
Panama Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay in 1986. It
was joined later by Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Also on the day, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
said that the international financial crisis will be one of the
themes for discussion in the Latin America, the Caribbean and the
European Union Summit to be held next June in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso, who is in Mexico City to attend the 13th Rio Group
Summit, said it is necessary to create mechanisms to protect the
emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen relations and trade between Latin America, the
Caribbean and the EU will not affect the establishment of a free
trade zone of the Americas in 2005, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added that he is not much worried about
Argentina's financial crisis, since the country's economy "is
strong" and President Carlos Menem does not want to devaluate the
Argentine currency, the peso, which came under a speculative
attack last week.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Detains U.S. Tourists for Causing Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Eleven U.S. tourists have been
detained by Venezuelan National Guards after causing disorder
during a charter flight of the Servivensa Airline, the El
Universal newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The tourists, three of them Miami Police Department officials,
were going to the Venezuelan Margarita island in a flight
chartered by the United States ITR Bonanza travel agency.
</P>
<P>
The 11 American tourists kept offending other passengers during
the flight between Miami and the stop in Maiquetia either by
switching on sound systems at high volume or exhibiting grotesque
signals, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
When the plane landed on Venezuelan soil on Thursday, the plane
commander reported to the National Guard and they ordered
detention of the 11 passengers in an airport detention center.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Venezuelan authorities have started the
deportation process of the 11 detained U.S. citizens.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China's exports and sales of PC
components maintained a high growth momentum, the Business Weekly
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Exports of monitors were worth 1.74 billion U.S. dollars, up by
43 percent compared with 1997, the report noted as an example.
</P>
<P>
High value-added products such as operating systems and CPUs
are the preserve of big IT firms such as Microsoft and Intel.
</P>
<P>
Although some domestic companies are manufacturing medium value-
added products, most of them function as processing factories for
foreign companies, it said.
</P>
<P>
This is because domestic manufacturers lack development
abilities and sales channels, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with the computer manufacturing industry,
component product has less competitions among manufacturers, the
report quoted General Manager of Great Wall Group Lu Ming as
saying.
</P>
<P>
China has formed a comprehensive group of computer components
manufacturers in the Pearl River Delta. Analysts say the industry
has laid a sound foundation for future development.

<P>
PARIS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Bordeaux took its first French league
title since 1987 in dramatic style on Saturday as they beat Paris
Saint-Germanin 3-2 on the last day of the season.
</P>
<P>
Pascal Feindouno, a second-half substitute, scored the precious
goal in injury time just as the title seemed to be heading to
Marseille.
</P>
<P>
The Guinea-born 18-year-old latched on to a pass from Lilian
Laslandes and, with the championship at stake, calmly slid the
ball under Bernard Lama and into the net.
</P>
<P>
Runners-up Marseille, which began the night one point behind
Bordeaux, won 1-0 at Nantes.
</P>
<P>
Sylvain Wiltord, this season's top first division marksman with
22 goals, opened the scoring in the 19th minute.
</P>
<P>
Wiltord latched on to a pass wide on the left before charging
toward goal and curling the ball just inside the post from 10
meters.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Rodriguez bundled in an equalizer on the hour.
</P>
<P>
But Wiltord made it 2-1 within two minutes, connecting to a
delicate chip from Ali Benarbia.
</P>
<P>
But it looked like Bordeaux would be denied the title when
PSG's Brazilian striker Adailton headed in unmarked from eight
meters.
</P>
<P>
PSG goalkeeper Lama made a brilliant save in the 87th minute
from a header by Ivan Perez before Feindouno struck.

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports Surge in First Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China's imports of steel between
January and April surged 40.6 percent in tonnage over the same
period last year, mainly because of plunging price of steel
products on the international market.
</P>
<P>
China imported a total of 5.12 million tons of steel in the
first four months, valued at 2.245 billion US dollars, according
to latest figures provided by the General Administration of
Customs.
</P>
<P>
A report on Sunday's Business Weekly said that the sharp
increase of steel imports was because the prices for some imported
steel products were even lower than those on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The price of cold-rolling steel plate from Japan, for instance,
fell 20 percent in the first quarter, while the cost of Russian
imports declined 19.5 percent from a year earlier, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a trade expert from the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) told Xinhua that China's policy
to revitalize domestic market through expansion of domestic demand
since late last year also propelled the imports increase.
</P>
<P>
Another factor, the expert said, is that China has loosened the
control on imports since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's steel imports from Russia,
Kazakstan and Ukraine as a whole doubled compared with the imports
last year to hit 1.28 million tons in the first quarter,
accounting for 36.8 percent of China's aggregate steel imports in
the period.

<HEADLINE> China Not Likely to Increase Banana Imports: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China is not likely to increase
imports of bananas in the foreseeable future because domestic
bananas are more competitive in price, the China Daily Business
Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The retail price of domestically grown bananas averages three
yuan (0.36 US dollars) per kilogram, while that of imports is no
less than 4.2 yuan (0.51 US dollars), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a trade expert as saying that although
imported bananas are less perishable and more presentable than
domestic ones, the price gap leaves little room for the
possibility of increasing imports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Banana Exporting Countries Union (BECU) has
expressed interest in the Chinese banana market as tax
restrictions imposed by the European Union on the Central American
countries force BECU members to look for new markets.
</P>
<P>
Beatriz Garcia, coordinator of the Inter-American Agricultural
Institute with the Banana Union, told the paper that if each of
the 1.2 billion Chinese citizens ate just one banana produced by
the BECU countries, the problem of the search for new markets
would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs figures show that the country imported a record
512,770 tons of bananas in 1996, mainly because of a drop of
production within China. The imports in 1997 decreased as China's
production picked up. The imports last year stood at 350,000 tons,
about one-tenth of China's banana production.
</P>
<P>
Banana was the biggest item among China's fruit imports, the
report says.

was beaten 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 by Brazilian Fernando Meligeni in
the third round of French Open here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the two-time US Open champion, had been assured of
taking over the number one spot from Yevgeny Kafelnikov if he
reached the quarterfinals at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
But instead, he fell two rounds short after putting up an error-
plagued performace.
</P>
<P>
Meligeni, who reached the fourth round here for the third time,
used his vast clay court experience to gain advantage against
serve-and-volley specialist Rafter, who was frequently pulled out
of position.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first two sets, Rafter lifted himself in the
third. But his form dropped away in the fourth, when he looked
desperately tired and Meligeni unleashed some devastating passing
shots.
</P>
<P>
Rafter's exit left fourth-seeded defending champion Carlos Moya
of Spain the highest seed left in the event. Top seed Kafelnikov
and second-seed Pete Sampras have all been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Alex Corretja, the sixth seed and beaten finalist last year,
advanced to the fourth round with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 win over
Argentine qualifier Gaston Gaudio.
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil also advanced by beating Sjeng
Schalken of the Netherland 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 for his fourth straight
win in their career meetings. Kuerten has reached the last 16
without playing a top 50 player.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, Russian teenage Anna Kournikova earned
a fourth-round meeting with five-time champion Steffi Graf with a
rollercoaster win over Patty Schnyder in the women's singles.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Kournikova beat 11th-seeded Schnyder of
Switzerland 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 in just one hour and 17 minutes to set
up a tantalising battle between the new and old guard of women's
tennis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Graf defeated Asa Carlsson of Sweden 6-1, 6-4 in her third-
round match.
</P>
<P>
Three-time champion Monica Seles beat Maria Antonia Sanchez-
Lorenzo of Spain 6-1, 6-4 while second-seeded US Open champion
Lindsay Davenport beat Fabiola Zuluaga of Colombia 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.

LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Rangers won the first Old Firm
Scottish Cup final in 10 years, giving them a sixth domestic
treble and denying Celtic a single trophy in a painful season for
the Parkhead club on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Bhoys will consider themselves unlucky, after creating a
number of chances.
</P>
<P>
But striker Henrik Larsen had a rare off day and the Rangers
defence held firm with Colin Hendry playing through the pain of a
groin injury and Lorenzo Amoruso winning the man of the match
award.
</P>
<P>
Equally important for Scottish football, the game passed off
without major incident or controversy following the scenes the
last time the two clubs met, 27 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
All eyes were on referee Hugh Dallas and the players after the
league game at Parkhead saw three dismissals, a missile thrown at
the official and public order problems around Glasgow.

<HEADLINE> Van Gundy out Regardless, Knicks Close with Jac kson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks' coaching
saga continues despite the team's surpring playoff success.
</P>
<P>
The eight-seeded Knicks start the Eastern Conference finals
Sunday in Indiana. But back in New York, Scorephone, a telephone-
based provider of sports scores and news, is reporting that coach
Jeff Van Gundy is out, regarless of how far the team goes in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Citing a source close to the Knicks and Madison Square Garden,
Scorephone added that the team is on the verge of a deal that
would make Phil Jackson coach and general manager. The report also
said Van Gundy has given his agent permission to talk about the
vacancies with the Orlando Magic and Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks narrowly qualified for the playoffs under Van Gundy
and general manager Ernie Grunfeld lost his job in the process.
New York upset the top-seeded Miami Heat in the first round of the
playoffs and then dominated the Atlanta Hawks in a sweep of their
Eastern Conference semifinal series to become the first eighth
seed to reach the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Much has been made about the possible departure of Van Gundy
despite New York's success. Grundeld, who was criticized for
acquiring Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby in the offseason,
never saw the team he helped create become a cohesive unit.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks were 27-23 in the lockout-shortened regualr season
and Van Gundy has a career record of 120-97 (.553) in three-plus
seasons with New York.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Gundy took over the team on March 8, 1996,
relieving Don Nelson. He went 13-10 over the rest of the season
and the Knicks lost to the Chicago Bulls in five games in the
Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
He guided the team to a 57-25 record in his first full season
and was 43-39 in his second as the Knicks lost to the Pacers in
East semis.
</P>
<P>
Van Gundy had served as an assistant for the Knicks for 6 1/2
seasons, serving under Stu Jackson, John MacLeod, Pat Riley and
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
After the firing of Grunfeld, Dave Checketts, president of
Madison Square Garden, contacted Jackson shortly thereafter.
Checkets made a public denial of his meeting with Jackson during
the conference semifinals, only to apologize to Van Gundy after
admitting he met with the former Bulls coach.
</P>
<P>
Should Jackson end up running the Knicks, he would be left with
the team put together by Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
After coaching the Bulls to the last of their six NBA
championships in the decade, Jackson left a team that was
subsequently disbanded.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Conference Finals to be Decided by Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The benches are likely to
determine the Eastern Conference championship series between the
Indina Pacers and New York Knicks, two of the NBA's deepest teams.
</P>
<P>
Latrell Sprell, New York's leading scorer in the playoffs,
comes off the bench and Marcus Camby has been a rebounding,
scoring and shot-blocking force. Antonio Davis and Jalen Rose
often play the key minutes for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
If the starters have an off night, Chris Dudley and Chris
Childs could do a lot for the Knicks while Travis Best and Derrick
McKey could serving main backup.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks arrive in Market Square Arena having won five
consecutive playoff games for the first time in franchise history,
while Indiana's reserves have helped make the Pacers the only
undefeated team in the playoffs with sweeps of Milwaukee and
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't played them since they've been rolling," Indiana's
Mark Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have the best bench in the game. That's no
disrespect to anybody else's. When you have two guys finishing in
the top for the sixth man of the year award, when you have the
other guys coming in that can start on a lot of other teams, we
feel very strong about our bench."
</P>
<P>
Davis and Rose finished in a tie for third place in voting for
the sixth man award.
</P>
<P>
"Our bench has been an important part of our team. We play 10
guys all the time and divide the minutes according to how they're
playing," said coach Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
Chris Mullin said Sprewell, Camby and Childs make the Knicks a
more potent team than the one Indiana eliminated in last year's
conference semifinals 4-1.
</P>
<P>
"They have got a great card of bench players, great players. I
don't know if you necessarily call them bench players because a
lot of time they play as many or more minutes," said Mullin.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Millionaire Launches First TV Ad Blitz of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Multimillionare
businessman Steve Forbes is launching the first major advertising
campaign of the 2000 Presidential Election with about 10 million
dollars this summer alone.
</P>
<P>
With still 18 months to go for the general election, Forbes'
campaign is the earliest-ever presidential ad blitz in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Forbes' campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said that a national ad
package for the multimillionare would begin Wednesday, but did not
provide details.
</P>
<P>
The initial four-week ad cycle will cost the Forbes campaign
well more than 2 million dollars, advisers say.
</P>
<P>
Forbes will start with seven different television ads airing
nationwide on cable channels; a series of radio spots geared
toward conservative listeners; and a full-page ad for national and
local newspapers, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
He plans a steady stream of ads until the 2000 primaries,
his advisers say.
</P>
<P>
Forbes has been prepared for the 2000 campaign almost since the
day he pulled out of the 1996 presidential race. Nonetheless, the
Republican Party polls place him far behind the front-runners,
Taxes Governor George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole, former president
of American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Forbes' advisers are hoping the ad campaign propels their
candidate into the top tier of the Republican field.
</P>
<P>
Forbes, born in 1947 in New Jersey, is President and Chief
Executive of Forbes Inc. and Editor-in-Chief of Forbes, a
world-famous business magazine.
