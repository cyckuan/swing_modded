<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The 105th session of the Arab

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Its Stance on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today reiterated its
stance that Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity should be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
The official Middle East News Agency (MENA), which termed the
stance as "clear-cut and unchangeable," quoted an official
diplomatic source as saying that any claims contradicting this
stance are not true. MENA did not identify the source.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has repeatedly made statements
on Egypt's policies toward Iraq, which has been under
U.N. sanctions for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, at a joint press conference with Jordan's King
Hussein after their meeting in Cairo Thursday, Mubarak warned Arab
leaders not to intervene in Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has criticized calls by Arab leaders for Iraqis to
overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Last November, King Hussein reportedly urged a federation among
Kurds in northern Iraq, Sunni Moslems in the center and Shiites in
the south as a way to end Iraq's plight.
</P>
<P>
Egypt rejected the idea, saying it would divide Iraq.

<HEADLINE> New York Subway Use Drops Sharply After Fare Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- New York City's subway riders
decreased by nearly 4 million in last December compared with a
year ago, due to the increase of token price in November.
</P>
<P>
The Transit Authority said in a report Friday that the subway
ridership in 1995 reached its highest level in 21 years. But after
the token price increased from 1.25 dollars to 1.50 dollars, the
ridership dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
Bus fares were also increased at the same time, which had a
more transit effect on bus ridership, which fell off nearly 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
When you increase the fare, you'er going to lose fares, that's
historical," the New York Times quoted a spokesman for the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Times said ridership on the subways began a long decline in
1970, when there were 1.3 billion riders a year. The figures
declined to 1 billion in the 1980's and 995 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally the flux in subway ridership often reflects the
city's economic situation. When the economy declines, ridership
decreases as fewer jobs mean fewer subway riders.
</P>
<P>
But the trend changed some in the past few years due to a
number of factors. From 1992 to 1995, employment increased by 1
percent while subway ridership increased 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Transit officials attributed the change to the riders' increase
of confidence in subway safety and slow surface speeds that push
many people to resort underground transport facilities.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Agree to End Lumber Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Canada
reached an agreement to curb Canadian softwood lumber exports in a
deal that resolves a 13-year trade dispute between the two
countries, the "New York Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The wood involved is used for home building and other
construction and the United States timber industry had complained
that Canadian producers had bought subsidized wood from provincial
governments at below market prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the British Columbia, the largest
of Canada's lumber exporting province, is to levy 50 U.S. dollars
for each 1,000 feet for the first 250 million board feet in excess
of 9 billion and 100 U.S. dollars for each 1,000 board beet for
any amount over 9.25 billion board feet.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces will raise fees that producers pay them for
cutting timber.
</P>
<P>
The American lumber industry, for its part, agreed that it
would not make legal challenges or call for trade sanctions
against the Canadian lumber industry provided that the agreement
was being honored, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
American officials estimated that imports of softwood from
British Columbia would be reduced by 14 percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the latest year for which figures were available, the
province sent 9.4 billion board feet to the United States, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the Canadian share of the United States lumber
market has risen from just over 26 percent to about 36 percent,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Leading Zimbabwean Academic On Presidential Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A leading Zimbabwean academic
today described all three candidates in the March 16-17 presidential
elections as ''tired old men'' who should have retired from politics
a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National News Agency quoted political scientist Hong
Makumbe as saying that the forthcoming presidential elections
highlighted a leadership crisis that the country was currently
experiencing.
</P>
<P>
In the elections, incumbent President Robert Mugage,73, is being
challenged by retired bishop Abel Muzorewa (68) and reverend
Ndabaningi Sithole (76).
</P>
<P>
''All the three presidential candidates are tired, old men who
should have retired from active politics years ago to allow the
nation to be led by younger, more vibrant people who have the energy
and are full of new ideas of developing out country,'' said
Makumbe.
</P>
<P>
Makumbe castigated Muzorewa for ''betraying'' the people by
signing an internal agreement with former Prime Minister Iran Smith
which resulted in the short-lived Zimbabwe-Rhodesia government of
1978.
</P>
<P>
Sithole, he said, had an equally unimpressive track record, with a
political record riddled with policy shifts and sometimes unrealistic
promises which no sane Zimbabwean could believe.
</P>
<P>
For Mugabe, he said, the political record was probably just as
unimpressive as the other two.
</P>
<P>
However, he predicted Mugabe would win the elections.

BELGRADE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The 11 terrorists arrested in
the Muslim town of Fojnica near Sarajevo Thursday evening were
handed over by IFOR to the Bosnian government today.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman in Sarajevo Major Peter Bullock confirmed today
that among the 11 detainees, eight were Bosnian Muslims and the
other three were Iranian instructors.
</P>
<P>
Bulloch said one of them was holding a diplomatic passport of
the Iranian mission in Sarajevo and had to be released, while the
other two Iranians would probably be deported.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO has no jurisprudence in Bosnia, the Bosnian
government was expected to put on trial the terrorists handed over
to it, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
When the 11 terrorists were arrested, IFOR discovered in their
training camp large quantities of advanced weapons, booby traps,
explosives and kidnapping plans.
</P>
<P>
IFOR commander Admiral Leighton Smith accused Friday the Muslim
government in Sarajevo of being associated with the camp for
training terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Claim Properties In Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians are claiming
ownership of thousands of properties in the western part of
Jerusalem in advance of final status talks between Israel and
the PLO, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, a weekly English newspaper, said that the
Palestinian Authority (PA) is currently compiling lists of homes
and lots in Jerusalem that were allegedly owned by Palestinians
before the founding of the Jewish state in 1948, an effort to
stake a legal claim not only to east Jerusalem but also to
western half as well.
</P>
<P>
According to Khader Shirkat, head of the Palestinian Land
and Water Establishment, Palestinians have already contacted
experts from abroad in hope to form an international committee
by mid-March to study the claims.
</P>
<P>
Shirkat, who is also the lawyer handling the matter, said he
has received 1,500 claims to property ownerships in western
Jerusalem from Palestinians, but he expects the number to
culminates in as many as 10,000.
</P>
<P>
"We will see what condition the property is in and we will
also analyze the claims to see if they have a basis in
international law and Israeli law," Shirkat said.
</P>
<P>
The neighborhoods in which these properties are located include
Baka, Ein Kerem, Malha, Katamon, and in the city center along
Jafa Road and Ha'nevi'im Street. Shirkat said he hopes to
have the 1,500 claims reviewed by May 1 -- the day the
negotiations on Jerusalem's final status are due to begin.
</P>
<P>
However, Shirkat did not say how Palestinian negotiators might
use this material in the talks, whether they will demand
direct compensation or whether they will relinquish claims to
the properties if the eastern side of the city is given
over to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> All 20 Bodies Recovered From Crushed Tunnel in Kokkaido </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese rescue workers today
recovered the bodies of all the 20 people who were buried a week
ago in a tunnel collapse in Hokkaido, northern Japan.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of 19 people who were aboard a cummuter bus buried
under tons of rocks and mud were pulled from the wreck one by one
after the roof of the bus was cut open, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the rescue squad had recovered a body from a
four-wheel-drive vehicle that was also crushed in the rockfall.
Among the victims are a mother with her daughter and senior high
school students.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the bodies ended a week of painful waiting for
the victims' families who had been following the painstaking
rescue operations with increasing impatience.
</P>
<P>
Rescue efforts were hampered by the tunnel's
85-centimeter-thick concrete ceiling, which had collapsed onto the
roof of the bus and reduced it to a height of just one meter.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred last Saturday at the 1,086-meter-long
Toyahama Tunnel between the towns of Yoichi and Furubira along the
west coast of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.
</P>
<P>
The bus and the car were buried along a 40-meter stretch of the
tunnel when the ceiling gave way under the weight of rocks and
mud.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls on Oil Producing Countries to Cooperate to Maintain Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today called on oil
producing countries to cooperate to maintain oil prices and
stabilize the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Oil Hamdy el-Banbi told reporters here that both
OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers should shoulder their
responsibilities to deal with a possible return of Iraq to the
world oil market.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is now negotiating with the U.N. for an agreement which
will authorize the country to export a certain amount of oil to
purchase badly-needed food and medicines. Iraq is under
U.N. sanctions, including a ban on oil sale, for its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Banbi said Egypt has restricted its oil production to 900,000
barrels per day despite discoveries of new oil fields in the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
He added that the restriction is aimed at contributing to the
stabilization of the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Egypt will not reduce its oil
production if Iraq resumes its exports of oil, saying that Egypt's
quota on the world oil market should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that it is important to convene an
emergency meeting of the ministerial council of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) when Iraq returns to the
world oil market.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be aimed at taking a proper decision to
preserve the interests of oil producing countries and avert a drop
of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world only
behind Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Yeltsin's Remarks over Link with Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran today protested against
recent statement made by Russian President Boris Yeltsin over
Iranian link with Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the official
protest was presented by Iran's Ambassador to Moscow Mehdi Safari
in a meeting with officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Yeltsin's remarks have obviously
angered the Iranian authorities since they have kept silent over
the civil war between Chechen Moslems and Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Iranian officials said that Iran had sacrificed the
interest of Chechen Moslem brothers and sisters for the support
of Russia in building a nuclear power plant in the Islamic
Republic.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, the Russian officials, while expressing
surprise over President Yeltsin's remarks, said that the Russian
Foreign Ministry or intelligence agencies had not provided the
president with such information.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Yeltsin in his address to the workers of a
plant in Chelyabinsk said Chechen fighters were being trained in
Iran, Turkey and Pakistan and sent back home with arms and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had accused Iran of having link with the Chechen
separatists last month which was followed by Iran's strong
denial.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) will continue asking church clergymen to act as mediators
in helping release 13 hostages in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The 13 hostages are still in the hands of kidnappers belonging
to the Free Papua Movement (OPM) who kidnapped 26 people including
seven foreigners on January 8. Later the kidnappers released 13
of the 26 hostages.
</P>
<P>
An Antara report today from Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya,
quoted spokesman for the Trikora military regional command Lt.
Col. Maulud Hidayat as saying that the ABRI is of the view that
the religious approach is the best way that may be acceptable to
the OPM group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the regional security authority has been taking a
non-confrontational step by launching a territorial operation in a
bid to free the captives safely.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two OPM followers have given themselves up to the ABRI
after traveling for seven days from hostage hideout in the
jungles. They expressed readiness to act as guide to the location
where the hostages were held.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that Daniel Yudas Kogoya, one of the OPM
heads, had taken the hostages from the control of OPM group chief
Kelly Kwalik.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that the handover of the 13 hostages from
Kwalik to Kogoya would help the military free them.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were killed
and dozens of others injured in a train collision near Washington
Friday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
A passenger train, carrying 175 passengers, was heading for
Chicago in a snow storm when it crashed into a commuter train
bound for Washington at a railroad junction in Silver Spring,
Maryland, just outside the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
Two locomotives and several passenger cars of the 15-car Amtrak
passenger train derailed, but all of its passenger cars stayed
upright. An Amtrak spokesman said only 12 people on their train
suffered minor injuries in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties were from the four-car commuter
train. The passenger cars of the commuter train, which was pushed
by a rear locomotive, was directly hit by two 130-ton locomotives
of the Amtrak train.
</P>
<P>
"We recovered 11 bodies," said Montgomery County Police Sgt.
Wayne Jerman. Rescuers previously reported finding 12 bodies in
the wreckage. Transit officials said there were only 17 passengers
on the commuter train.
</P>
<P>
Local hospitals reported treating 21 people for injuries.
</P>
<P>
Investigators were sifting through the wreckage, trying to find
clues to how the trains ended up on the same track.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said investigators
were looking at the signals, the communications system operated by
the railroad company, the weather and human errors as possible
factors.

<HEADLINE> Yemen: No Objection to Hold Summit with Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Yemen has not turned down a
proposal on holding a summit meeting between Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh and his Eritrean counterpart Isaias Afewerki to
solve a dispute between the two countries over three Red Sea
islands, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, an "arbitration project" should first of all be agreed
upon to resolve the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute, major local dailies
quoted a well-placed Yemeni source as telling the Yemeni News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Paris on the sidelines of the funeral of late French president
Francois Mitterrand, Saleh said that some contacts had taken place
between him and Afewerki, the source said. The two leaders reached
an agreement on holding the summit in Paris or Cairo on their way
home.
</P>
<P>
The source pointed out that Afewerki paid a visit to Cairo
some days ago and Mubarak phoned Saleh on his proposal to hold the
Yemeni-Eritrean summit meeting in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said, in response, that he had no objection to such a
proposal, but some French mediation efforts are underway to
crystallize the "principles of the arbitration project."
</P>
<P>
Saleh told Mubarak that it is preferable to sign such a project
first before holding any summit between the leaders of Yemen and
Eritrea to help the summit, when convened, to reach positive
results.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian deputy minister
resigned in protest to new censorship imposed on authors and
publishers, reports a weekly here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian weekly Bahman said that Iran's Deputy Culture and
Islamic Guidance Minister Ahmad Masjed Jame'ee resigned for "not
accepting the responsibility for the new policies."
</P>
<P>
A source at the ministry told Xinhua that the ministry
has adopted a new policy of reviewing books before their
publication.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry's policy was that the books would not have
to be screened before publication. Now they are screening all
the books," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What's worse, they are not even giving the author the
courtesy of an official reply. They just jot down a note
ordering the author or publisher to change certain parts of
the book so he would get the license for publication," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The source said that those assigned to review the books are not
qualified and have shown their lack of knowledge of "the most
rudimentary facts about Iranian culture and politics."

<HEADLINE> Abu Dhabi's Port Zayed to be Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Dhabi Seaport
Authority of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will launch a 655.73
million-dollar expansion project.
</P>
<P>
The project aimed at modernizing Port Zayed and setting up a
new feeder harbor at the industrial village of Mussafah, in the
eastern suburb of the UAE capital city of Abu Dhabi, according to
the recent issue of the Abu Dhabi Magazine.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted Seaport's chairman Sheikh Saeed bin Zayed
al Nahyan as saying that projected expansions include the
construction of a 20,000 tons cold-storage, a new headquarters for
the general administration, bunker tanks, a workshop for the
maintenance of container handling equipment, a new computer
network and the purchasing of four additional gantry cranes.
</P>
<P>
He said a new harbor will set up at Mussafah at the cost of
16.94 million U.S. dollars which will help consignees and
shipping lines use feeder ships to transport their cargo.
</P>
<P>
Other improvements will include the changing of the old berth
fenders and replacing them with larger and more durable fenders as
well as deepening the approach channel to 15 meters and expanding
the current dhow harbor at the Free Port.
</P>
<P>
The Free Port in Port Zayed, which consists of 34 berths of six
meters in depth, receives dhows and launches from most of the
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saeed said the number of containers handled by Port
Zayed in the first ten months of 1995 increased by 111 percent
compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number
of ships that called the port rose by 22 percent and total tonnage
climbed by 43 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give the concrete figures.
</P>
<P>
Today, the UAE has over a dozen ports, with over two
hundred berths, serving the world's shipping lines.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- India and Nepal today signed
an umbrella power trading agreement primarily to facilitate export
of power from the Himalayan kingdom, which had embarked on a
program to exploit its massive hydro-electric potential.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by power secretaries of the two countries
in the presence of visiting Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba at a ceremony in Mumbai (Bombay), would now be ratified at
the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon meeting hosted by the Confederation of
Indian Industry on the concluding of his seven-day visit to India,
Deuba said besides enabling export of power to Indian markets, the
agreement would also facilitate private investments from India and
other countries in hydro-electric projects in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's Minister for Water Resources J.B. Rana said with its
83,000 megawatts of hydro-potential distributed over four major
river basins, Nepal was poised to capitalize on its added
advantage of geographic proximity to the Indian market in terms of
supply of energy.
</P>
<P>
Indian Power Secretary P. Abraham told reporters that India's
growing requirements would need the electricity generated both
within the country and in the proposed hydro projects in the
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
India could also sell power under the agreement to Nepal, he
added.

<HEADLINE> China to Buy Three Airbus-340s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Air China, the country's
largest airline, today signed an agreement with the European
Airbus Industry Consortium to buy three A-340s.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony, held at the Great Hall of the People
here, was attended by Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the ceremony, the premier met with Von Tein, Airbus'
chief executive officer, and diplomats from Germany, France,
Britain, Spain and the European Union, and held "warm and
friendly" talks with them.
</P>
<P>
Li extended congratulations on the agreement reached between
the Chinese airline and the Airbus consortium, saying this is yet
another proof of the good beginning of co-operation between China
and the European aviation industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the development of reform and opening up, and
of the modernization construction, China's civil aviation also
made headway in both passenger and cargo transportation.
</P>
<P>
"This high growth rate will continue in the next five years,"
he predicted, adding this "opens broad prospects for China's
co-operation with foreign countries in this field."
</P>
<P>
The Airbus consortium groups companies from France, Germany,
Britain and Spain. China's co-operation with Airbus, in a broader
sense, is its co-operation with the European Union as a whole, the
premier noted.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that Airbus would raise its competitiveness
and further expand the scale of its co-operation with China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China plans to build its own 100-120 seat
airplane through international co-operation and utilization of
mature technology. "We welcome Airbus' participation, bringing its
own advantages," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Premier Pays Chinese Lunar New Year Call on Government Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng and
other top central government leaders paid a Chinese Lunar New Year
call on staff members of the General Office of the central
government here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of leading State Council officials, Li wished all the
staff members a happy new year.
</P>
<P>
China made advances in every field in 1995, and the economy has
been developing in a healthy way, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been put under control as price hikes have slowed
and another good harvest was reaped in 1995, he told the staff
members.
</P>
<P>
More progress was made in reform and opening to the outside
world and breakthroughs were made in diplomatic work, the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed all these achievements to the joint efforts of
the people throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the General Office did quite a lot of work and made
marked achievements last year.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that 1996 is an important year as it is the
first year of the country's 1996-2000 economic and social
development plan period.
</P>
<P>
A good beginning will be of great significance for the work in
the coming years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first major task China has scheduled for after the
traditional Chinese New Year is the fourth sessions of the Eighth
National People's Congress and the Chinese Political People's
Consultative Conference, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The two sessions are expected to approve the 1996-2000 plan and
the long-term economic and social program through 2010 drafted by
the central authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li promised more efforts to curb inflation, produce more grain
and reform the state-owned enterprises so as to promote economic
development.
</P>
<P>
While a good job must be done in building a material
civilization, greater efforts are needed to build a moral
civilization, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to pay more attention to cracking down on all kinds of
criminal activities and improving security in a comprehensive way,
which is the pressing demand of all of the people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The premier said fresh progress should be made in diplomatic
work so as to create a better international environment for the
country's reform and opening to the outside world and economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen and Li Lanqing, and
several state councillors joined the premier in his new year
greetings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Lunar New Year of 1996, or the Year of the Rat,

<HEADLINE> Engineers Warn of Fire Risk in Macao Bullfight Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Engineers both in Hong Kong
and Macao were worried about safety in the temporary arena built
in Macao for the six-day bullfighting shows starting today,
according to a local press report here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Macao government engineer said there were unanswered
questions about fire hazards in the 6,000-capacity arena built
with bamboo and plywood.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong engineering consultant, Austin Gardner, said the
arena raised serious doubts about fire hazards and crowd control.
Gardner visited the site on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the arena was built by a scaffolding contractor who deals
with temporary access, there were "areas of concern" and the
design was inherently flawed. "There is no factor for safety," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A ticket salesman at the arena said 60 percent of the seats had
been sold for today's show.
</P>
<P>
Gardener estimated that a capacity crowd as much as 500 tons
would be pressing down on the bamboo structure. And the bamboo
handrails would be "useless" and "fall in an event of a crowd
being pushed in one direction."
</P>
<P>
"They would not last two minutes because there is inadequate
support for the upright," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Normal, natural pushing...in the form of a modest Mexican
wave" could end in tragedy, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, bamboo, plywood and the nylon joints, all
flammable materials, make the stadium a potential disaster zone as
someone might stick the end of a cigarette butt into the bamboo,
he warned.
</P>
<P>
Marcelo Remdios, the chief engineer of the Leal Senado, Macao's
municipal council which is responsible for stadium safety, was
reported to have called on the bullfight promoters to ban smoking
in the arena, but no answer was received, the report said.
</P>
<P>
And the organizers refused to respond to repeated inquiries
about the smoking policy in the arena.
</P>
<P>
In that case, Remdios could only order the structure to be
washed thoroughly down with water before each of the shows.
</P>
<P>
But fire department officers will be present at the shows,
Remdios said.

<P>
MADRID, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Peter Rzehak of Austria crashed
in the men's downhill training session at the Alpine skiing world
championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old skier lost control on the high speed course and
slided several hundred meters down the course before smashing into
the safety net.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian had his right knee ligaments torn and the injury
could end his skiing career, team doctors said.
</P>
<P>
Rzehak has been suffering injury over the past few years,
especially to both knees, which prevented him from competing in
either a world championships or an Olympic Games since he started
World Cup racing in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Rzehak finished second twice in two World Cup downhills, in
1993 and last season.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Nevada course is one of the fastest in skiing, with
the racers racing down the slope at a speed of 125 kilometers per
hour.

<HEADLINE> CBI Chief Urges Rational Debate on EMU Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) Friday attacked "emotional extremes" over Europe
and called for a balanced argument over the issues that affect UK
business.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, the CBI director-general, told the European
Movement Business Forum in London that to establish the best
options for UK business, there had to be rational discussions,
based on "logic and facts rather than emotion and slogans," on the
advantages and disadvantages of European economic and monetary
union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Turner warned against approaching the issue of Europe "with
either a strong federalist vision...or with an aggressively
anti-Europe stance, which exploits present difficulties in some
continental countries to cast doubt on the benefits UK membership
of the European Union has brought."
</P>
<P>
"Between Eurosceptic glee, that Europe faces problems, and the
Eurofanatic-speak, that unless everything goes ahead exactly as
planned in Maastricht then we slip back towards a divided
continent, there is a real danger that the voice of balance and
reason gets lost. But it is vital that voice is heard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even if the European monetary union did not go ahead in 1999,
it would not mean the end of the single European market or prevent
proceeding with EMU at a later date, he added.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers For Implementation Of Abuja Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from African
countries have called for closer cooperation by integration of
economy in the continent.
</P>
<P>
They made the appeal here on Friday in the "Resolution on
Implementation of the Treaty Establishing the African Economic
Community (AEC): strengthening regional economic communities,
rationalization and harmonization of the activities of regional
and sub-regional communities" adopted at the end of the three-day
first session of the Conference of African Ministers Responsible
for Trade, Regional Cooperation, Integration and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
The treaty to establishing the AEC was adopted at the Summit
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in Abuja,
Nigeria, in June 1991. There are a number of regional and
sub-regional economic organizations in the continent such as the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Common Market
of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
In Friday's resolution, the ministers called on African
countries, regional and sub-regional communities to "urgently
institute a program for the rationalization and harmonization of
community trade policies through the unification of trade
liberalization instruments within each regional space, in
particular those relating to the elimination of tariff barriers,
rules of origin, certificates of origin, compensation mechanisms
and tariff and statistical nomenclatures.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the ministers stressed "the urgent need for
accelerating the integration process given the development
challenge facing the continent in the context of the
globalization of the world economy, the establishment and
consolidation of regional and sub-regional economic blocks in the
developed countries and the prospects provided by the outcome of
the Uruguay round negotiations."
</P>
<P>
They appealed to "sustain and strengthen the regional
integration process by adopting appropriate measures for the
institution of common external tariffs, domestic taxation and
pricing policies susceptible of providing African products a
competitive edge in their own markets."
</P>
<P>
They called "to promote and encourage the participation of the
private sector in the integration process" and "to design and
implement self-financing mechanisms that will enable the regional
and subregional communities to secure adequate and regular
financing of the African economic integration process."
</P>
<P>
They requested member states and the regional and sub-regional
communities to design and implement appropriate activities for
the harmonization of other sectoral integration policies."

Commission for Africa (ECA) to organize a meeting to address the
problems faced by developing countries, especially by African
states.

associate other UN regional commissions, the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), the African Development Bank as well as the

The resolution invited the UN Development Program to accord
its highest priority to finance the conference and called upon
member states to fully participate in the launching of the
proposed conference.

enclaved Greek Cypriots in the Turkish-controlled Karpass
Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> 2 Girls Recorded in 14 New AIDS Cases in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A nine-month-old baby girl and
a five year old girl, born to mothers infected with human
immune-deficiency virus (HIV), were among the 14 new HIV/AIDS
cases reported to the Philippine Department of Health in January.
</P>
<P>
According to a press officer from the Health Department, the
children, already diagnosed as AIDS cases, got the disease
through perinatal transmission or from their infected mothers
before, during or after birth.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month-old baby girl died of AIDS shortly after she was
diagnosed last month.
</P>
<P>
According to the press officer, the newly reported pediatric
AIDS cases have brought to 10 the perinatal cases in the
Philippines since the disease's first detection in 1984.
</P>
<P>
An official from the World Health Organization (WHO) Western
Pacific Regional Headquarters in Manila told Xinhua that the WHO
estimated that there are over 500,000 pediatric AIDS cases
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 30 percent of all children born to
HIV-infected mothers developed AIDS and died from the disease at
the age of three.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Health Department has encouraged Philippine women who
are planning to have a child should assess their risk and undergo
AIDS test if necessary.
</P>
<P>
So far, the total number of AIDS death in the Philippines has
reached 116 since 1984. The cumulative HIV/AIDS cases so far
totaled 718, of which 243 were AIDS related while most of the
victims were at the age of 29-49.
</P>
<P>
According to the Health department, it is about time that AIDS
be regarded not only as a health problem but also a social issue
which should be everybody's concern.

<HEADLINE> HK Manufacturers Expect a Better Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Most manufacturers in Hong
Kong believe that business will be better in the Year of the Rat
than it was in the Year of the Pig, according to a business
prospects survey released here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lunar Calendar, 1995 is the Year of the Pig
while February 19 this year starts the Year of the Rat.
</P>
<P>
The half-yearly business prospects survey released by the
Census and Statistics Department here shows that optimistic
manufacturers outnumber the pessimists when it comes to predicting
their earnings prospects for the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pessimists believe they will see a rise in earnings
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said most of the optimists belong to the industries
which did well last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of printers, for instance, grew 8.2 percent last year,
more than double the average rate of increase for other
exporters. The survey shows that 61 percent of the printing
businessmen expect a mild rise in orders before June while 52
percent said the second half will see a slight improvement.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five percent of garment manufacturers say things will
either get mildly or significantly worse before June, while 29
percent believe their prospects will deteriorate by the second
half.
</P>
<P>
Garment manufacturers including those who had transferred to
China's mainland are facing increasingly tough competition from
low cost countries such as Sri Lanka and India.
</P>
<P>
Garment exports rose 2.7 percent last year, while overseas sale
of the textiles industry dropped three percent.
</P>
<P>
Amidst a global surge of demand for semi-conductors, Hong
Kong's electronics and electrical goods manufacturers enjoyed a
good year in 1995. More than half of them believe they will do
even better this year.
</P>
<P>
Members of the service industry are even more optimistic, with
40 percent of bankers expecting a significant rise in export value
in the first half of this year.

al-Fitr feast (the Minor Bairam), the local daily Al-Dostour
quoted informed sources here as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah issued a decree
forgiving all the Jordanian detainees in Kuwait who were convicted
for committing crimes or cooperating with the Iraqi occupation

</P>
<P>
The release of the Jordanian detainees may take place during

<HEADLINE> Rare Astronomical Phenomena to Appear in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Stargazers in China will be
able to cast their eyes on a double treat next year, the Beijing
Observatory predicted today.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers in the capital say that the brightness of the
Hale-Bopp comet will increase from February to April next year.
</P>
<P>
And in another event for sky-watchers there will be a solar
eclipse on March 9, 1997, visible in north China on March 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It is rare in the world for two such astronomical phenomena to
emerge concurrently," said Li Qibing, director of the Beijing
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
Hidden by the sunshine, the comet, found by two amateur
astronomers in America in July last year, is difficult to observe.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing observatory tracked it on February 12, this
year. After calculations, Chinese astronomers are predicting that
the comet will have a long tail and display a bright and visible
light next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mohe of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
the northernmost part of China, will witness the solar eclipse on
March 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
At that special moment, people will be able to see the comet in
the daytime, during the solar eclipse. This has only previously
occurred twice, on May 17, 1882 in Egypt and on May 20, 1947 in
Brazil before.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A national pharmaceutical
program has been launched in Ethiopia to improve the supply of
medicines in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy Minister of Health Lamiso Hayiso
here on Friday after receiving various medicines bought for over
5.68 million US dollars obtained from the government of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
He said the new program demanded 240 million US dollars for
the purchase of different medicines in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Minister said the package would be secured from the
government and foreign welfare organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said an additional 9.5 million US dollars was also
necessary to build the capacity of regional states so that they
could implement the national program including the supply, use
and control of medicines.
</P>
<P>
According to the Deputy Minister, some of the medicines bought
with over 1.86 million US dollars obtained from the African
Development Bank in loan had already arrived while others vital
to cure meningitis, tuberculosis and eye diseases were expected
to reach here soon.

<HEADLINE> Growing Chinese Mainland Impact On HK economy: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China has become an
important factor to influence economic activities in Hong Kong
with the rapid integration of the two economies, according to a
report released by the Hang Seng Bank.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Hang Seng Economic Monthly says that just
as the quick expansion of the Chinese economy led to rapid growth
in Hong Kong in the early 1990s, the macroeconomic adjustment
measures implemented by China since mid-1993 resulted in sluggish
growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
However the control measures would help provide an improved
business environment in China which is beneficial to the
development of Hong Kong's economy in a longer term.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that China's adjustment program had
curtailed Hong Kong's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 1994
and 1995 by approximately one percentage point a year. The
region's GDP grew five percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, China's stringent measures have
produced an adversely effect on Hong Kong's property, tourism and
export trade, which were faced with less inflow of funds, slower
growth of tourists and import demand from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The past decade has seen fast integration of the two
economies. China is now Hong Kong's largest trading partner,
accounting for 35 percent of the region's total trade. China is
also among the largest investors in Hong Kong with investment on
the rise. Mainland visitors currently make up one fifth of the
total arrivals in Hong Kong. On the other hand, Hong Kong is
China's second largest trading partner and biggest external
investor.
</P>
<P>
Based on a string of analyses, the report says the
macroeconomic adjustment measures have succeeded in soft-landing
the overheated Chinese economy -- bringing inflation down while
reducing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that China is likely to continue with its
present policy of selective credit allocation in 1996, which would
be beneficial to the development of the Chinese economy over a
longer run. Funds would be channeled into efficient enterprises
and projects essential to the country's long-term development,
including agriculture and infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
With the growing interdependence of Hong Kong and China, it is
almost certain that any improvement in the Chinese economy would
have a positive spill-over effect on HK economy, the report
concludes.

<HEADLINE> HK Economists Optimistic About Job Situation in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Economists here and the Hong
Kong government are hopeful that unemployment will ease in the New
Year, after the latest official figures showed a fall in the
jobless rate to 3.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
And a government economist predicted that unemployment would
drop further to 2.8 percent by late spring.
</P>
<P>
The Census and Statistics Department figures released yesterday
showed a gradual decline in unemployment. Joblessness stood at
3.6 percent in November, an 11-year high, before easing to 3.5
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
But the provisional unemployment rate rose slightly to 2.4
percent from 2.3 percent during the October-December period.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed the unemployment situation had
stabilized, said a spokeswoman for the Financial Secretary. But
government economists warned against early optimism, saying the
rate could rise again in February and March after the annual Lunar
New Year orders rush.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that if the jobless rate climbed after the
New Year, it would be because people tended to change jobs after
the holidays. Nevertheless, she added, economists' general
sentiment was that the worst was over.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said decreases in the unemployment rate
were recorded in most of the major sectors, including transport,
restaurants and hotels, manufacturing, import and export, and
retail trade.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,
Ian Perkin, said the latest figures showed unemployment was a
temporary problem.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the economy would improve in the next few
months, and the number of new entrants into the job market would
stabilize. He forecast the unemployment rate to fall to 2.8
percent by late spring.
</P>
<P>
Economist K.K. Chan, from the Nomura Research Institute, said
the figures were encouraging and lower than he had expected. The
institute had expected the rate to peak in the first half before
it could drop, "but now the U-turn came a bit earlier than
expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The institute forecast an average jobless rate of three percent
for the whole year.

<HEADLINE> Express Freight Trains for Hong Kong and Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Three express freight trains
supplying Hong Kong and Macao with poultry, produce, and frozen
foods have improved a great deal since the service started 34
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide better transport service, special freight
trains have been developed for the poultry and cattle exported to
Hong Kong and Macao, said an official from the Ministry of
Railways.
</P>
<P>
Almost all pork that supplies the two areas can be transported
by the special freight trains and all vegetables, fruits, and
frozen foods can also be moved by refrigerated cars, with water
and ice supplied en route at each stop.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source, the three express freight
trains are first among freight trains. A complete set of special
management measures and regulations have been established.
</P>
<P>
Three express freight trains to Hong Kong from the mainland
started in 1962 with the support of Chairman Mao Zedong and
Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
A large quantity of foodstuff has been shipped such as more
than five million cows, 85 million pigs, one million tons of
frozen foods, and a large amount of fresh fish and vegetables.

<HEADLINE> China-Japan Trade Expected To Hit 60 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Sino-Japanese trade is
expected to grow this year, hitting a trade volume of over 60
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
And in Beijing a senior Chinese official disclosed that
increasing numbers of Japanese enterprises plan to invest in
China's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Lu Kejian, deputy director-general of the Asian Affairs
Department of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), said in an interview with Xinhua that
economic and trade relations between China and Japan witnessed a
remarkable development last year, as bilateral trade, basically
balanced, continued to increase.
</P>
<P>
The two countries were still important trade and economic
partners, with Japan remaining China's biggest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume last year hit a record, amounting to
57.47 billion US dollars, a rise of nearly 20 percent over the
previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that China's export mix continued to be optimized and
manufactured goods accounted for two thirds of China's total
exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the exported items were primary manufactured
goods and high value-added products were to increase.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that most products from Sino-Japanese joint ventures
were sold back to Japan, the proportion reached 30 to 40 percent
of the Sino-Japanese trade volume.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the increase in Sino-Japanese joint
ventures helped China's import of machinery equipment, raw
materials and spare parts from Japan and the export of China's
manufactured goods like textiles and household appliances to Japan.
</P>
<P>
This, in Lu's words, plays an important role in improving
China's export mix and helps Sino-Japanese trade reach a balance.
</P>
<P>
During last year, Japanese investment in China continued to
grow. In the first nine months of 1995, Japan invested in 1,937
projects in China, with contracted Japanese investments worth 5.13
billion US dollars, and 1.994 billion US dollars were put into
those projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last September, Japan had invested in a total of
12,259 projects, with the total contracted investment reaching
19.367 US dollars, including a total amount of 9.534 billion US
dollars being put into those projects.
</P>
<P>
Lu emphasized that Japanese investments in China were prompt
and efficient, and the scale of the Japanese-invested projects in
China continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more Japanese enterprises intend to invest
in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Lu said he believed that the increase in Japanese investment in
China will promote the further development of bilateral economic
and trade co-operations between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Fourty-two police officers and
two civilians were injured in clashes after a football match in
Egypt's Port Said on the Suez Canal, police said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred when the Masri team fans set fire to five
vehicles and threw stones at a television van and other cars, to
protest the referee's decision to award a penalty to Cairo's
Zamalek team in the match on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Things got worsened when the Egyptian police threw tear gas
into the stadium to force people out, which ignited new clashes
and led to further injuries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims only suffered minor injuries and were
released shortly after being treated except that two policemen and
two civilians remained in the hospital on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Masri drew 2-2 with Cairo's Zamalek team in the match in Port
Said, 220 kilometers east of Cairo, as part of the Egyptian
football tournament.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Constitution to Be Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's King Mswati
iii has promised that his government will reinstate the rule of
constitution, 23 years after it was suspended.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come that we carry on with the constitution,"
the king said, adding that a constitution committee will be set
up to prepare the way for the reintroduction of a basic law.
</P>
<P>
King Mswati made the announcement at the opening of
Swaziland's parliament in Lomamba on Friday, following six weeks
of intensified pressure on his government from workers, students
and political groups.
</P>
<P>
It came as the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (sftu)
prepares to resume a national, pro-democracy strike on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sftu brought state service and industry to a halt during
an eight-day stayaway last month, with its members clashing on
several occasions with the police.
</P>
<P>
The federation suspended the strike pending the outcome of
talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Late on Friday, government representatives were locked in
talks with sftu officials in a last-ditch bid to stop the
federation resuming the strike on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a South African Press Association report, sftu
Secretary-General Jan Sithole said his organization will take a
final decision at a mass meeting tomorrow on whether to resume
the strike action.
</P>
<P>
Most of the sftu's demands center on labor issues but the
federation has also called for the reintroduction of multi-party
democracy in Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
King Mswati's father, King Sobhuza, suspended the bill of
rights and the constitution in 1973, and since then the king has
ruled by decree and forbidden political parties to operate in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Production of Edible Oil Raises in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The production of edible oil
in Uganda has increased from almost zero in 1985 to 2,000 tons in
1995.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Ugandan Ministry of
Agriculture today, the country now requires about 30,000 tons of
edible oil yearly, the output of 2,000 tons means that Uganda can
produce 6.6 percent of its national requirement now.
</P>
<P>
This is a result of steps taken by the government to revive
the edible oil industry in recent years. The government considers
the industry as "one of the priority areas that should be
revitalized and that a strategy which was based on the
recognition of the need for assistance assistance from the US.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also indicated that the per capita consumption
of edible oil in Uganda is estimated at 2.2 kilograms, far below
the world average of 24 kilograms per year.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the people's demand for edible oil, Uganda
imported edible oil worth about 50 million US dollars annually,
the statistics noted.

<HEADLINE> Quake-Stricken City Bids for World Heritage Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIJIANG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China's recent earthquake may
have shaken the buildings of Lijiang county. But it did not wave
the ancient city's resolve to apply for its famous historic
buildings to be given a top world honor.
</P>
<P>
The city is seeking to have its heritage given the status of
inscription on the World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials conveyed this willingness to officials from the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizations
(UNESCO) in the quake zone on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guo Zhan, secretary general of the Chinese Committee of the
International Council on Monuments and Sites said that the city
still qualifies for the granting of the honor.
</P>
<P>
He said the layout, main structures of most ancient buildings,
and special river systems, as well as the traditional cultures,
have not been damaged by the disaster.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO officials Minja Yang, senior program specialist in
charge of Asia Pacific Region of World Heritage Center, and
Richard A Engelhardt, regional advisor for culture in Asia and the
Pacific, were making an inspection in the city.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed the cultural and historical value of Lijiang
and encouraged local officials in their efforts to preserve the
old town in the hope that it may qualify for inscription on the
World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
Lijiang, in southwest China's Yunnan province, was hit by an
earthquake measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale on February 2.
</P>
<P>
The government announced in 1986 that Lijiang was a key
national historical city, because of its 1,000-year-old written
language which is the oldest pictograph still being used by modern
residents.
</P>
<P>
Dayan town, the main part of Lijiang, has been fully
preserved. This is unusual for an ancient city in China.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake largely damaged the three main roads of
Dayan. In the town's protection district for first scale relics,
40 percent of its 2,300 houses have collapsed; and in the
second-scale district, 35 percent of the 1,600 houses collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that as the oldest houses were all made of wood,
and the structures tightly joined with each other, they suffered
only slight damage.
</P>
<P>
But walls of buildings made with mud bricks were easily
destroyed by the force of the quake, they explained.
</P>
<P>
The Lijiang government has decided to restore the collapsed
houses to their original state, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Furniture Exports to Japan Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) has reported that Philippine furniture gained a
wider chunk of the Japanese market with exports rising 52 percent
in the period of January to November in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Bureau of Export Trade Promotion (BETP)
showed that in these months, total earnings of furniture exports
to Japan amounted to 18.43 million US dollars compared with 12.11
million US dollars for the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The demand of Philippine furniture in the Japanese market is
the result of Filipino ingenuity and unique creativity in adapting
to Japan's strict adherence to color, finish, size comfort and
price.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's total export of furniture reached
253.52 million US dollars in the January-November period of 1995.
This figure posted a 17.56 percent increase over the 1994 exports.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Millers Urged to Reduce Food Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian minister has urged
millers in the country to reduce food prices by applying
reasonable profit margins to the imported maize they are
processing.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Suresh Desai said
in a statement today that some millers were making high profits
on already expensive maize, thereby pushing prices to
unacceptably high levels.
</P>
<P>
Desai said although the government believed in a free market,
it does not mean that the government would stand by and allow a
few irresponsible millers to exploit the people in difficult
times and make their lives unbearable.
</P>
<P>
He announced his ministry would from next Monday release maize
to the market from the government strategic reserve and most of
the maize would go to small hammer mills.
</P>
<P>
This would result in a downward pressure on mealie meal (maize
flour) prices, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten days, average price of mealie meal has been
hiked by about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will still depend on imported maize for the next eight
to ten weeks before locally produced maize will enter the market.

<HEADLINE> HK Economists Optimistic About Job Situation in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Economists here and the Hong
Kong government are hopeful that unemployment will ease in the New
Year, after the latest official figures showed a fall in the
jobless rate to 3.3 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
And a government economist predicted that unemployment would
drop further to 2.8 percent by late spring.
</P>
<P>
The Census and Statistics Department figures released yesterday
showed a gradual decline in unemployment. Joblessness stood at
3.6 per cent in November, an 11-year high, before easing to 3.5
per cent in December.
</P>
<P>
But the provisional unemployment rate rose slightly to 2.4
percent from 2.3 percent during the October-December period.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed the unemployment situation had
stabilized, said a spokeswoman for the Financial Secretary. But
government economists warned against early optimism, saying the
rate could rise again in February and March after the annual Lunar
New Year orders rush.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that if the jobless rate climbed after the
New Year, it would be because people tended to change jobs after
the holidays. Nevertheless, she added, economists' general
sentiment was that the worst was over.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said decreases in the unemployment rate
were recorded in most of the major sectors, including transport,
restaurants and hotels, manufacturing, import and export, and
retail trade.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,
Ian Perkin, said the latest figures showed unemployment was a
temporary problem.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the economy would improve in the next few
months, and the number of new entrants into the job market would
stabilize. He forecast the unemployment rate to fall to 2.8 per
cent by late spring.
</P>
<P>
Economist K.K. Chan, from the Nomura Research Institute, said
the figures were encouraging and lower than he had expected. The
institute had expected the rate to peak in the first half before
it could drop, "but now the U-turn came a bit earlier than
expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The institute forecast an average jobless rate of three percent
for the whole year.

<HEADLINE> HK Manufacturers Expect a Better Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Most manufacturers in Hong
Kong believe that business will be better in the Year of the Rat
than it was in the Year of the Pig, according to a business
prospects survey released here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lunar Calendar, 1995 is the Year of the Pig
while February 19 this year starts the Year of the Rat.
</P>
<P>
The half-yearly business prospects survey released by the
Census and Statistics Department here shows that optimistic
manufacturers outnumber the pessimists when it comes to predicting
their earnings prospects for the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pessimists believe they will see a rise in earnings
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said most of the optimists belong to the industries
which did well last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of printers, for instance, grew 8.2 percent last year,
more than double the average rate of increase for other exporters.
 The survey shows that 61 percent of the printing businessmen
expect a mild rise in orders before June while 52 percent said the
second half will see a slight improvement.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five percent of garment manufacturers say things will
either get mildly or significantly worse before June, while 29
percent believe their prospects will deteriorate by the second
half.
</P>
<P>
Garment manufacturers including those who had transferred to
China's mainland are facing increasingly tough competition from
low cost countries such as Sri Lanka and India.
</P>
<P>
Garment exports rose 2.7 percent last year, while overseas sale
of the textiles industry dropped three percent.
</P>
<P>
Amidst a global surge of demand for semi-conductors, Hong
Kong's electronics and electrical goods manufacturers enjoyed a
good year in 1995. More than half of them believe they will do
even better this year.
</P>
<P>
Members of the service industry are even more optimistic, with
40 percent of bankers expecting a significant rise in export value
in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Reaffirms Commitment to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad has said his country is for peace but will not accept
anything that may infringe upon its national interests.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad made the statement during an "Iftar" (Moslem dinner)
banquet he held Friday evening in honor of local scholars and
religious leaders, today's local daily El-Thawrah reported.
</P>
<P>
"Syria keeps in mind the meanings of peace, but will never
agree to anything that may do harm to its national interests," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the difficulties may be, he stressed, Syria will
always seek friendly relations with all other countries in the
world provided that its interests and rights are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came more than a week before Syria and Israel start
another round of peace talks in Maryland, the United States, on
February 28.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Syria and Israel resumed in the United
States in December last year after a six-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been stalled mainly by differences over
future ties and security arrangements on the Golan Heights
following a proposed Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the strategic Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria has asked Israel to be more serious in its commitment to the
"international legitimate resolutions" and the peace-for-land
principle to help establish a just, comprehensive and lasting
peace in the region.

Singapore as part of the government's ongoing normalization
process with Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Employment Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing told a
recent congress hearing that a labor agreement is a prerequisite
to the normalization of relationship with Singapore which was
strained last year due to the execution of Filipino maid
Contemplacion for double murder in Singapore.

A ban on the deployment of Filipino women to Singapore was
imposed together with the downgrading of diplomatic relations
between the two countries.
</P>

safety and protection of Filipinos in Singapore are assured.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE has drafted a proposed bilateral agreement with

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Wants No Speedy Trial of Hawala Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A designated court of India
today rejected the request by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
President L.K. Advani for a speedy trial of the multi-crore rupee
hawala case.
</P>
<P>
The special court also turned down Advani's request that the
court take cognizance of the charge sheet against him, whether or
not the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) files additional
documents.
</P>
<P>
However, Additional Sessions Judge V.B. Gupta, while rejecting
the application, gave liberty to Advani to file the application
afresh at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
In a four-page plea submitted to the court Friday, Advani said
that the CBI had deliberately delayed the filing of additional
documents supporting the charge sheet against him so as to
scandalize him just before the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The BJP president said that the charge sheet contained no
evidence against him but only conclusions derived from
conjectures.
</P>
<P>
The CBI had alleged that Advani, leader of India's largest
opposition party, received six million rupees (about 164,000 US
dollars) from illegal foreign exchange dealers in the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Advani has vowed not to contest in the coming general elections
unless the court clears his name.

<HEADLINE> Farmland Being Brought Round (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Qingxi, a skilled farmer in Xiaoxian County, rented 60
hectares of farmland from 210 households in his village last year
on condition that he compensated them with 2,250 kilograms of
wheat per hectare and 3,000 kilograms of maize per hectare.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Wang earned a net income of more than
200,000 yuan, and the households who leased their land also gained
profits three times more than before when they operated
independently.
</P>
<P>
"So long as you work hard and with your mind, you can get rich
by making profits from the land," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianhua, another farmer specializing in farming in Linquan
County, believes the land is more and more valuable since it now
has a price.
</P>
<P>
The rent for farmland rose from 6,000 yuan per hectare last
year to 7,500 hectare this year.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that 150,000 hectares of farmland, accounting
for 3.5 percent of the total in the province, have been
transferred from one farmer to another.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that although Anhui carried out a second round of
land-use contracts, the land still belongs to the state, and is
used only for farming. "It will be retrieved if not for this
purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
The contract system has also attracted more farmers back to
the land, making full use of land resources.
</P>
<P>
At present, Anhui has tens of thousands of households
specializing in farming. They have opened up more than two
million hectares of land, generating 5.5 billion yuan worth of
products.
</P>
<P>
Experts in agriculture have agreed that the new
land-utilization contracts have aroused farmers' initiative in
farming and enabled skilled farmers to contract for more
land. This in turn has helped them generate a better economic
efficiency from the land.
</P>
<P>
Although Anhui experienced droughts last year, its output of
grain, cotton and oil-bearing crops still rose by 12.3 percent,
16.2 percent and 24.1 percent respectively over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor disclosed that the provincial government is
working out a package of regulations to standardize transfers
of farmland.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Orders Immediate CBI Action on Godman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court Friday
asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to make a decision
without further delay on the allegations against godman
Chandraswami, the Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The court said that it wanted the agency to either clear the
godman of the charges or book him.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Chandraswami was allegedly involved
in several criminal cases, including the hawala scandal in which
some top officials were accused of receiving bribes from illegal
foreign exchange dealers.
</P>
<P>
S.K. Jain, the key suspect in the hawala case, confessed to the
CBI in March last year that he had once asked Chandraswami to
deliver some money to Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
The court said that it was not at all satisfied with the way in
which the CBI dealt with the allegations against Chandraswami over
the years.
</P>
<P>
If the charges were false, the CBI should come out candidly and
clear the person as being falsely accused, and if not, it should
proceed according to the law, the court said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Ge Hongchang, head of Xiaogang
Village in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, was overjoyed when he
handed land-use certificates to farmers once again.
</P>
<P>
Ge could hardly forget the day 18 years ago when he headed his
villagers to make a finger-prints on an agreement for the dividing
of farmland for household management.
</P>
<P>
"I was running the risk of being sent to jail because such
conduct was regarded as 'capitalism' in those days," he explained.
</P>
<P>
This time it was a new round of 30-year contracts for the use
of farmland -- handed out with the blessing and approval of the
government.
</P>
<P>
"It will set our minds at ease," said Ge with feeling.
</P>
<P>
Under the old central planning economy, farmers had no say in
farming, and were told to plant crops collectively and get
materials "in kind" almost equally.
</P>
<P>
Ge did not expect that their determined action in the 1970s
would induce a nationwide rural reform, featuring the 15-year
contract for land utilization with a family as the basic unit.
</P>
<P>
Anhui Province started another round of 30-year land-use
contracts last year after the first round of contracts expired
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Soon after receiving the certificates, many farmers in Xiaogang
Village began to buy farm machinery.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have to worry about our land-managing rights being
infringed," said a farmer who preferred anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 90 percent of villages in Anhui Province,
just like Xiaogang Village, have concluded contracts on land
utilization with farmers.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with the first round of land-use contracts, Wang
Zhaoyao, deputy governor of the province, said, the new second
land-use contracts has assured farmers of the stable right to use
the land continuously for 30 years, and allowed them to transfer,
lease, donate and mortgage the land during the contract period,
thus bringing the land to life.
</P>
<P>
He explained that China has 1.2 billion people, and more than
70 percent are in the countryside. With smaller families, each
household had an average of 0.5 hectares of cultivated area, from
which farmers could hardly make huge profits and get rich in the
first round land-use contract.

HANOI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Men in Vietnam are the heaviest
cigarette smokers in Asia, according to a survey published by the
local press today.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that about 73.4 percent of the 2,000 men
surveyed in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City admit they are cigarette
smokers.
</P>
<P>
The figures in Japan and China are 66 percent and 61 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted jointly by the Sociology Institute in
Hanoi, the Ho Chi Minh City-based Health-Care Education
Information Center and the University of California.
</P>
<P>
It showed that only 4 percent of Vietnamese women are attracted
by cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Although 84 percent of those interviewed agreed that
cigarette-smoking is harmful to health, they said they would
continue and even increase the intake.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita consumption increased from 373 cigarettes in 1989 to
535 cigarettes in 1994 in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The survey discovered that about 7.3 million Vietnamese, or
one-tenth of the total population, will have their lives shortened

<HEADLINE> UN Urged to Maintain African Development after UNCTAD IX </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- African trade ministers
have reaffirmed the need for the international community to agree
on concrete policies, measures and actions to make Africa
maintain balanced growth and sustainable development after UNCTAD
IX.
</P>
<P>
The reaffirmation was made by African ministers for trade,
regional cooperation, integration and tourism in "Addis Ababa
Declaration on the ninth session of the U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD IX)" adopted at the end of a three-day
session Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said, "UNCTAD IX provides an exceptional
opportunity to reinvigorate the dialogue on development and
international economic cooperation, with a view to revitalizing
the development efforts of the developing countries through
multilateral cooperation in the spirit of genuine partnership."
</P>
<P>
However, the declaration said, "Africa has been largely
by-passed by the positive efforts of the globalization process
and the risk of further marginalization of this continent looms
large."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, a major challenge for UNCTAX IX is to take urgent
actions which would rapidly integrate Africa in the mainstream of
world economy," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Economists said African countries would lose two billion US
dollars after the terms of trade set by UNCTAD IX. And African
states now have over 317 billion dollars of foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Referring to resources flows and debt, the declaration said,
UNCTAD should continue to analyze regularly the debt problems
facing African countries with a view to making constructive
proposals for the resolution of these problems and advising them
on debt management and debt negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that "the implementation of Uruguay Round
agreements will impose significant transitional difficulties and
costs on the African countires, particularly the least developed
and net food-importing countries."
</P>
<P>
The declaration called for "measures to enable African
countries to adapt and benefit from the post Uruguay Round
context," "measures concerning commodities" and "trade and
competitive policy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers urged UNCTAD to "promote the
development of developing countries, particularly the least
developed among them."

<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today urged the Congress to immediately pass the Police
Reform Act of 1996 that permits automatic termination of
"non-performing and undesirable" policemen.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Congress, Ramos reaffirmed his commitment to
cleaning up the 97,000-strong Philippine National Police (PNP).
</P>
<P>
The new bill would provide for the compulsory retirement or
suspension of at least five years of service if police officers
are found inefficient in their work.
</P>
<P>
The bill would strengthen the disciplinary system by creating
new offices that handle complaints against erring policemen.
</P>
<P>
"The measures would institutionalize the Philippine National
Police as a civilian force through reforms in its organizational
set-up, as well as human resources and doctrines development and
would eventually professionalize the PNP," said Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The PNP has been under constant fire for doing an inefficient
job in cracking down on rampant kidnapping, bank robbery and other
crimes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rumors even have it that some of the kidnappings and bank
robberies were committed by PNP members themselves.

TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran today denied military
involvement in Bosnia and termed the U.S. ballyhoo on the
discovery of a camp as part of the White House's plot against the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a report carried in Today's
Tehran Times that the three Iranians enjoyed diplomatic immunity,
who were active earlier in rendering humanitarian assistance to
the Bosnian people.
</P>
<P>
The three Iranians were not involved in any kind of military
activities and had recently returned to Bosnia, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Admiral Leighton Smith, Commander of the NATO
Peace Implementation Force, claimed Friday that the NATO forces
had discovered a camp about 10 km south of Fojnica, taking eight
Bosnians and three Iranians into custody.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry official acknowledged that before the
Dayton Peace Accord was signed, Iran had training and technical
cooperation with police and security officials in Bosnia, but
ceased cooperation after the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
The three Iranians had recently gone to Bosnia to pack and
return to Iran, he said, adding that the U.S. forces have freed
the Iranians.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Results of Bangladesh's
parliamentary polls announced by the Election Commission (EC)
showed that the voter turnout was high.
</P>
<P>
But the high turnout figures do not seem to tally with the
actual presence of voters at polling stations as reported by
witnesses and the local press.
</P>
<P>
The votes obtained by winners in 119 constituencies indicate a
high turnout almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
However, even Chief Election Commissioner Akm Sadeq told
reporters after polling ended Thursday that the turnout was low.
</P>
<P>
Of the 119 winners, all but one are members of the ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
According to the results available from the EC Friday, 74 of
the 118 BNP candidates polled more than 30,000 votes each and 26
of them obtained well over 50,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties, who boycotted the election,
charged that a lot of votes were fraudulently cast.

<P>
NANJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- People in this capital of east
China's Jiangsu Province seem to be saving money as fast as they
are spending it even though the Spring Festival is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
Queues can be seen at some savings banks as people line up to
deposit their money while other people queue for their holiday
shopping.
</P>
<P>
Since February 1, the Nanjing Branch of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China saw deposits averaging ten million yuan
each day, 20 percent above the level on ordinary days, say
executives at the bank, which handles about 50 percent of
Nanjing's deposits.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the deposit fever to rising incomes, which
surged 15.9 percent to a per capita average of 6,800 yuan in 1995
among the wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
Prices have also put a damper on holiday spending sprees, and
growing numbers of bankruptcies among some enterprises have also
given people a warning about spending money too freely in case of
straightened circumstances, the analysts point out.

<P>
Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attacks on Israeli and
SLA forces in the Israeli self-declared "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>

The Israeli army warned that Israel would launch counter
attacks with might and main should Hezbollah carry out Katyusha
attacks against Israeli settlements in the south.

Nepal's constitution that provides for individual rights to earn
and keep property, including land.
</P>
<P>
The bill, registered at the Parliamentary Secretariat, is
scheduled for discussion during the forthcoming session of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new land reform bill calls for distributing 40 percent of
arable land in the southern Terai plain to peasants who till for
landowners and leaving the remaining 60 percent to the owners, the
report quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nepal began its land reform 30 years ago but the problem of
landless people in rural areas remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 500,000 landless people in rural areas
of this Himalayan kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government, which came into power last
September, has vowed to ban dual-ownership over land and solve the
landless problem on a long-term basis within the existing legal
framework.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Price Index Dropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The retail price index in
China's largest economic center was 107 and the consumer price
index reached 110.8 in January.
</P>
<P>
The two figures represent a 50 percent drop in the price rise
from the same period last year, according to Li Zhenxin, an
official with the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Commodity
Prices.
</P>
<P>
The index in January rose slightly by 0.4 percentage points
over last December.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates a good start for price controls in Shanghai,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Prices for 85 of the 257 goods under administrative supervision
were up in January, and those of 79 goods were down.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the municipal government regards the continuous
control of inflation its prime task for the macro-economic
controls in Shanghai, and is striving to hold the rise to below 10
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that Shanghai's markets have abundant goods,
especially during the spring festival, the Chinese New Year and
its biggest holiday.

<HEADLINE> More People From Zhejiang Spending Spring Festival Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Because of a sharp increase
in the number of people travelling abroad during the Spring
Festival, the staff of Zhejiang's Overseas Tourism Company will
not get a single day off during this year's unusually long
seven-day holiday.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the Spring Festival is an off season for us. But this
year, we are really too busy," said Chen Yan, general manager, who
just saw a group of over 200 people off.
</P>
<P>
Other travel agencies dealing in distant travel are busy as
well. It has been estimated that over 1,000 residents of this
eastern Chinese province will go to Thailand, Singapore, or
Malaysia during the ten days surrounding the lunar new year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
The shift from staying home for a family gathering to
travelling abroad really reflects a great leap forward not only
economically but also mentally, tourism analysts point out.
</P>
<P>
The economic reforms and opening-up of the past 17 years have
turned this coastal province into an economic powerhouse. Per
capita urban income last year topped 5,700 yuan (680 US dollars)
and rural income stood at 3,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over 30,000 residents from Zhejiang have travelled abroad since
1990. Destinations include countries in Southeast Asia and as far
away as Australia, France, and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Many of the people travelling abroad are owners of individual
businesses or well-off employees of successful rural enterprises,
but there are also farmers, workers, teachers, and clerks.
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for the lack of air tickets, more people would
be able to travel to Southeast Asian countries," said the general
manager, Mr Chen.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Economy Shows Positive Signs: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's economy showed some
positive signs during the last six months of the 1994-95 fiscal
year, with major macro-economic indicators under control, the
country's central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Projected higher agricultural production would contribute to a
much higher growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the current
fiscal year beginning last July, according to a report of the
Nepal Rastra Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank did not predict the GDP growth for the current 1995-96
fiscal year. The government earlier estimated that the GDP growth
for the previous fiscal year was 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Continued government control over the monetary expansion during
the last six months of the 1994-95 fiscal year has helped keep
inflation at a comparatively lower level, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the price index grew 7.3 percent in
mid-January this year compared with the 8.2 percent rise a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The country's rising trade imbalance in recent years began to
improve thanks to a recovery in overall exports and a considerable
slowdown in imports, the bank report said.
</P>
<P>
The total export increased by 2.5 percent to nearly 152 million
US dollars in the first six months of the 1995-96 fiscal year,
with exports to India growing 18.4 percent to reach 33 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Nepal's exports to third countries declined by 1.2
percent to 119 million dollars during the same period mainly due
to an 18 percent fall in exports of ready-made garments.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the total imports increased by 19.5 percent
to 597 million dollars compared with the 35.9 percent growth
recorded in the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserve stood at 734 million
dollars early this month, a nearly 4 percent increase over that at
the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year in mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia, Croatia Remain Apart on Mostar Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Foreign Minister Mate
Granic today failed to persuade Bosnian Muslim leaders to
compromise on the reunification of Mostar in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said after a meeting with
Granic in Sarajevo that his government firmly stands behind the
plan by Hans Koschnick, Mostar administrator assigned by the
European Union, to re-unify the town.
</P>
<P>
Mostar has been divided by Muslims and Croats since 1993 when
the two allied parties started to turn guns to each other for
territory.
</P>
<P>
"The plan on Mostar's organization is already a compromise, and
we cannot make a compromise over a compromise," Izetbegovic said.
</P>
<P>
Granic said modification should be found to "improve"
Koschnick's plan which calls for three Croat districts, three
Muslim districts and one mixed ethnic district in the town's
center.
</P>
<P>
Both the Croatian government and Croats in Mostar rejected the
plan, accusing it of creating the fourth Muslim district because
the Muslims enjoy a majority in the mixed district.
</P>
<P>
In response to the accusation, Izetbegovic said, "The Bosnian
government will not be ready to accept any modification to
Koschnick's plan."

Zimbabwe, said the minister, was ideally placed as a stopover

marketing efforts of both airlines it was hoped that more of the
airlines' customers would opt for travel via Harare as opposed to
the traditional routing via Southeast Asia.

<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will take steps in
1996 to attract more overseas investment and pursue a new economic
and trade strategy that parallels international practices.
</P>
<P>
The capital city will try to attract foreign investment worth
1.2 billion US dollars and approve about 1,000 overseas-funded
firms or projects this year, according to Vice-Mayor Lu Yucheng.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "China Daily", Lu said:" The overseas
investment will focus on local infrastructure, technological
upgrading of old enterprises, high-tech industry, agriculture,
tertiary industry, renovation of old houses and housing
construction."
</P>
<P>
The city will set up a new system to look into unlawful charge,
forfeit, inspection and administrative measures taken by
departments under unjustified pretexts.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city will also export commodities and services
worth 2.6 billion US dollars and get labour contracts worth 800
million US dollars, hoping to earn 400 million US dollars and send
4,000 labourers abroad.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in 1995, Beijing saw its foreign
trade hit 4.23 billion US dollars, an increase of 5.4 percent over
the previous year, while the local economy registered a 12.6
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
But compared with the coastal regions, Beijing lagged behind in
its export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to give full play to the Beijing New Technology
Experimental Zone and the Capital Science and Technology Group,"Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has more than 500 scientific institutes and

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tea Production up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Helped by favorable weather
conditions in 1995, Sri Lanka's tea production climbed to a record
245.9 million kilograms, an increase of 3.3 million kilograms
over 1994, according to trade sources today.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Colombo Brokers Association said that the rise
was a result of a combination of well-distributed rainfall and
better agricultural practices in the tea plantations.
</P>
<P>
Tea sales have also improved through the years. In 1995 sales
grossed 32 million US dollars in comparison with 30 million US
dollars in 1994 and 28 million US dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Most of the revenue came from low grown teas followed by high
grown teas. Medium grown teas did not bring in as much.
</P>
<P>
Buying by Russia and other Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) countries helped to push up sales while competition by
Middle East countries contributed to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Most of the CIS countries were supplied by Russian buyers while
the main Middle Eastern buyers were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria and
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed as Two Trains Collide in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A passenger train and a
local commuter train collided just north of the nation's capital
during a snowstorm today, killing at least 12 people and injuring
more than 20 others.
</P>
<P>
The passenger train, carrying 175 passengers, was heading for
Chicago when it slammed into the commuter train bound for
Washington at about 5:45 p.m. (22:45 GMT) at a railroad junction
in Silver Spring, Maryland, just outside the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
Railroad officials said the 15-car Amtrak passenger train was
supposed to be switched to another track to avoid the four-car
commuter train, but it remained on the same track and slammed into
the commuter train.
</P>
<P>
Two Amtrak locomotives and several passenger cars derailed, but
all of the train's passenger cars stayed upright on the
tracks. Amtrak said only 12 people on its train suffered minor
injuries in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Most of the casualties were from the commuter train. The
passenger cars of the commuter train, which was pushed by a rear
locomotive, was directly hit by two 130-ton locomotives of the
Amtrak train.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers found most of the dead in one of its cars that caught
fire after the collision.
</P>
<P>
"There were about 30 people in that particular car, who looked
like they were in a total state of disarray," said Mike Hall, a
Montgomery County spokesman. "We grabbed two or three of the more
seriously injured ones and loaded them into ambulances."
</P>
<P>
County officials said local hospitals reported treating 21
people for injuries. They said bodies of the dead were still left
in the wreck and had to be identified.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Restructure Missile Defense Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
restructure its ballistic missile defense (BMD) programs and place
its highest priority on developing the next generation of Patriot
missile defense system and lower tier Navy anti-missile system,
the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
The restructure decision came after a six-month study of BMD
programs led by U.S. Defense Undersecretary Paul Kaminski, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters at a Pentagon
conference presenting the review.
</P>
<P>
Kaminski said that some 450 million U.S. dollars will be added
to the next generation of Patriot PAC-3 missile system and Navy
Area Defense (lower-tier) system.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of Patriot missile defense system was
widely used in the U.S. Gulf War operations in 1991 to knock down
Iraqi scud missiles soaring into neighboring countries. The U.S.
Navy system is designed to have similar coverage but operates from
Aegis cruisers.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the development of the two missile defense
systems will meet the need for countering potential short-range
missile threats against the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the study says that the Pentagon should not deploy a
national missile defense system until 2008. The
Republican-controlled Congress has been pressing for such a system
to be deployed by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the Pentagon has planned to take some 2 billion
U.S. dollars away from the BMD programs and to use them to buy
more urgent military equipment such as tanks, jet fighters and
trucks.

<HEADLINE> French Government Urged to Eliminate Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The French government was urged
today to stage a campaign against widespread illiteracy in the
country as a recent survey showed one in every five French people
is illiterate.
</P>
<P>
"Illiteracy is a very serious and widespread phenomenon in
France," said the chairman of the French Anti-Illiteracy Standing
Committee which conducted the survey under an instruction from
Prime Minister Allain Juppe. The survey was published by Le Figaro
today.
</P>
<P>
The chairman also blamed the government for failing to do
enough work to wipe out illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed illiteracy as a major cause for unemployment
since it is very difficult for adult illiterates to find and keep
a job.
</P>
<P>
The education of illiterates' children will be affected because
their parents are not able to examine their study.
</P>
<P>
The committee came up with a 22-point proposal to the
government, which includes setting up a system to eliminate
illiteracy in French troops, a national anti-illiteracy day, and
an hour-long recitation course in schools.
</P>
<P>
The committee praised the French troops for opening courses to
about 6,000 soldiers annually. It also suggested that special
classes be given to illiterate parents on how to help their
children study, that senior students help juniors and that a
school be established to train personnel for fighting illiteracy.

<P>
WARSAW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Poland will make effort to
develop relations with its eastern neighbors while continuing
to knock the doors of the European Union (EU) and NATO, Prime
Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said today.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz was talking to foreign diplomatic missions for the
first time since being placed to the premiership by President
Alexander Kwasniewski on February 1.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural parliamentary speech earlier this month,
Cimoszewicz said his government will continue to make the EU and
NATO membership its top priorities.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz told reporters after the meeting that he will visit
the Netherlands, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in the near
future and plans to travel to Israel, Germany and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said keeping regular contacts with foreign diplomats
represents political transparency in the country and hoped that
foreign observers could understand recent changes in the Polish
government.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz's predecessor Jozef Oleksy resigned last month
after the security service accused him of having spied for Moscow
since the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Screening of Thai Senate Nominees Underway (by Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The screening of Thai senate
nominees is in progress as the present Upper House of parliament's
term expires on March 21.
</P>
<P>
Some 260 out of about 10,000 candidates nominated by various
professional groups, organizations and coalition parties, are
expected to emerge after the screening, and Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa will present the shortlist to the King for approval
early next month.
</P>
<P>
The new 260-seat senate is expected to comprise over 100 legal
experts, 40 military men and the country's top 12 millionaires.
</P>
<P>
Every professional group will be given seats in the new senate.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 percent of the new senators are expected to be legal
experts, compared with the outgoing senate which is predominated
by military appointees.
</P>
<P>
Although a four-man administrative committee has been appointed
to help with the screening, the prime minister has the final say
on the senate nominee list.
</P>
<P>
Former Parliament President Van Chansue, 73, is widely tipped
to replace Mechai Ruchupan as the senate speaker.
</P>
<P>
Mechai has reportedly made public statements displaying a
non-acceptance of the present government. He was also quoted as
telling a group of people once that the Banharn-led government
would not last longer than three months.
</P>
<P>
Van was the parliament president during the Chatichai
Choonhavan administration from 1988-1991.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Van has maintained close relationships with
key members of the ruling Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party and the
New Aspiration party, as well as with certain military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Both Banharn, leader of the Chart Thai party, and Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New Aspiration Party, have great
respect for Van, according to parliament sources.
</P>
<P>
With Van as the senate speaker, the government would be assured
of support from the new senate, said the sources.

BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Wang Wanmei, an 8-year-old
girl in a remote mountainous village in Langao County, Shaanxi
province, dreams of being able to enroll in school like other
children.
</P>
<P>
Two year ago, her mother left home and never came back and her
father, a poor farmer, who promised to let her go to school next
year, died of cancer last month.
</P>
<P>
Wang lost hope, and did not know how she would make it through
the Spring Festival, the biggest holiday in China.
</P>
<P>
Then along came Gou Jiaxue, who gave the little girl 900 yuan,
which will let her have a good time during the festival and will
allow her to go to school in the next term.
</P>
<P>
Gou, general-manager of a large-scale tea plant heard Wang's
story during an inspection tour early this month.
</P>

Gou went back and decided to call off the company's Spring
Festival party to save 23,000 yuan for "Project Hope", which aims

Shaanxi, a backward province in northwest China, has 4,520,000

<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Li Mingyin is grateful to the
police because he was helped out of trouble by two patrolmen in
Zibo in Shandong province when he sent his pregnant wife to the
hospital at midnight, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Li said, "Now I have come to believe that one really must turn
to the police for help whenever he is in difficulty."
</P>
<P>
Things are quite different a few years ago. Surly expressions,
harsh words and a sluggish working style of some policemen aroused
complaints from the public.
</P>
<P>
The change started when local authorities started the "Image
Project" last year in an attempt to improve the work of the police
and their relationship with local residents.
</P>
<P>
The 3,500 policemen in the city of three million were
prohibited from saying rude words and abusing rights. They also
tried to improve their efficiency and maintain closer ties with
citizens in order to help them as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people have found the policemen are becoming
more reliable and helpful since we improved our work," said Wang
Zhenhua, director of the Zibo Public Security Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Other areas have reformed the behaviour of their police force.
</P>
<P>
Drivers and pedestrians, whether on Beijing's Chang'an Avenue
or busy crossings in South China's Shenzhen, were impressed by
traffic policemen who used standard gestures to direct traffic,
changing their previous sluggish appearance.
</P>
<P>
Unlike some policemen who used to shout at traffic violators,
they always gave salutes and spoke politely while fining or
advising them. Many of them also prepared traffic maps, bicycle
pumps, first-aid kits and other things for people.
</P>
<P>
This change was brought about by a decision issued by the
Ministry of Public Security, asking traffic police in 38 big
cities to "provide warm service while strictly performing duties."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 174 cities have put police patrols on the streets to
guarantee safety in public places and assist those who need help.

MADRID, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Spain will increase its
financial aid to Palestinian self-rule government by 35 million
U.S. dollars this year, Spanish Foreign Minister Carlos Westendorp
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The extra loan exceeding Spain's aid share designated by the

Al-Nashashibi after their meeting.
</P>

The EU expects to forge closer economic ties with Palestine by
a bilateral cooperation agreement, which will be negotiated as
soon as the region assumes broader autonomy, Westendorp said, as
was done between the EU and many mediterranean and Middle-East
countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU signed cooperation agreements with countries including
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Morocco in the '70s to
provide free access to the Community market for industrial
products, customs preferences for certain agricultural products
and financial aid.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Hold Elections on April 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy's caretaker cabinet today
set the date for a general election on April 21, three years ahead
of schedule, after the country's opposing blocs failed to form a
new government, said a communique published here today.
</P>
<P>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro had dissolved parliament earlier
today after meeting the speakers of both houses of parliament,
opening the way for the general election, his office said.
</P>
<P>
And the outgoing Prime Minister Lamberto Dini held a cabinet
meeting Friday night and set the date of the election.
</P>
<P>
The present, deeply-divided parliament was elected in March
1994 when Silvio Berlusconi stormed to victory on a tide of
popular support.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi's shaky coalition fell apart after seven months and
Scalfaro appointed Dini, a former central banker, to lead a
technocrat government. Dini resigned 36 days ago when it became
clear he no longer had majority support in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Dini was expected to remain as caretaker prime minister during
the election campaign, which should result in Italy's 55th
government since World War ii.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution of parliament followed weeks of acrimonious
talks between Berlusconi's center-right Freedom Alliance and the
center-left Olive Tree grouping on forming a broad-based
government without resorting to a vote.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations finally failed this week when Antonio Maccanico, a
former minister instructed by Scalfaro to form a government to
oversee key constitutional reforms, said the two sides were
hopelessly deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro's decree, the 8th dissolution of Italian parliament
after World War ii, dismissed the current parliament which should
have lasted until 1999.

<P>
JAEN, Spain, February 16 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Challenger Zsuzsa
Polgar of Hungary moved one step closer to the world crown,
beating defending champion Xie Jun of China in the 11th game of
the Women's Chess World Championship here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The victory put Polgar 7.5 points against 3.5 of Xie Jun. The
Hungarian player needs one more point to take over the crown from
Xie.
</P>
<P>
Leading 6.5-3.5 after the 10th game, Polgar played steadily in
the 11th game with white pieces. Xie, to the contrary, could not
afford any more draws and opted for drastic moves. That gave the
much more experienced Polgar the chance of winning the game after
the 47th move.
</P>
<P>
The 12th game of the 16-game series will be played on
Saturday. Theoretically, Xie still has the chance of successfully
defending her crown.
</P>
<P>
As the defending champion, Xie needs 8 points to retain the
world champion crown.

XI'AN February 17 (Xinhua) -- China's famous Silk Road is to be
investigated by a United Nations team in a bid to develop tourism
along the ancient route taken by Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
The Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization of the
United Nations (UNESCO) will send the group to China to
investigate the route taken by buddhists during the development
of their religion.
</P>
<P>
A seminar was held last year in Nepal, in which Sakyamuni was
born, and scholars travelled along the Kathmandu River
Valley. They studied a number of important historical sites and
temples there.
</P>
<P>
This year, they plan to follow the route which the founder of
Buddhism travelled in India, through Pakistan to China.
</P>
<P>
In China, they will travel from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region to Xi'an, the capital city of the northwest China's Shaanxi
province, which is known as the starting-point of the Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at promoting cultural exchanges and
developing Buddhist tourism in the region along the Silk Road.

LIMA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The board of the Cartagena
Accord, the organization that technically coordinates the economic
integration of the Andean countries, suspended its activities
today for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The closing of the organization in Lima, the first time in its
history, is caused by delays in the payment of its debts, which
impedes it from footing the payrolls and operation costs.
</P>
<P>
The 130 officials, who are paid by the month, received their
fortnightly check Friday and were told not to return to work until
March 4.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by that date the crisis will have been
averted by some deposits made by Bolivia and Ecuador, which owed
about 500,000 U.S. dollars each, or by Peru, which owed 8 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>

These people often work as the chief representative or the

More of these higher positions are now becoming open to
competent local employees. The Shanghai offices of the 12 foreign
airlines have become major employers of talented local people.
</P>
<P>
These employees usually have good relations locally, something
that helps them greatly in opening the local market. The
difference in pay scales between foreign and domestic companies
also contributes a lot to the increase in the number of local

NANJING February 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has been developing its agriculture in a comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, 894,000 ha of low- or medium-yield
fields have been improved and 50,000 ha of wasteland made
available for use, yielding an additional 1.5 million tons of
grain and 380,000 tons of cotton.
</P>
<P>
The land reclamation was mainly done in undeveloped areas in
northern parts of the province. Partly as a result, per capita
income of rural residents increased by 437 yuan (53 U.S. dlr) in
1995.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.8 billion yuan was used for large-scale
exploitation of farmland, expansion of irrigated areas, and
development of disease-resistant strains over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
The local government has attached great importance to
scientific and technological development in agriculture. The
Nanjing Institute of Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences set up 22 experimental zones for grains, vegetables, and
fruits in collaboration with 10 counties and trained 340,000
people as agro-technicians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bosnia Troops to Get More Armored Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
sending more armored vehicles and taking other preventive measures
to protect American ground forces in Bosnia as landmine and other
dangers likely grow with spring coming, the U.S. Army said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Army Chief of Staff Dennis Reimer told reporters at the
Pentagon that 16,000 American soldiers implementing the Bosnian
peace treaty would be at greater risk of injury as warmer weather
thaws the fuses of mines embedded in frozen roadways in the Balkan
state.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. soldier has been killed and several others injured in
reported mine explosions in Bosnia since the American troops began
moving to Bosnia as part of the 60,000 NATO peace peacekeeping
forces.
</P>
<P>
"The mine detection and removal equipment that we have is still
not as good as I'd like," Reimer said, but no complete
technological solution is available.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. Army is doing "everything possible to
provide our soldiers the best equipment they possibly can have"
in their operations.
</P>
<P>
Reimer said that the Army is accelerating production of
armored Humvee utility vehicles and sending them all to the U.S.
army units in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that up to now only 10-20 percent of Humvees in
Bosnia have armor capable of protecting occupants from mine
explosions.

BELGRADE, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Two men, whom the peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia took into custody earlier
today in Sarajevo's Serb suburb of Ilidza on suspicion of sniper
activity, were released later in the day.
</P>
<P>
They were freed after a record was made of their arrest, the
Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
French IFOR troops blocked two buildings in Ilidza this
morning, suspecting that the fire opened on a passenger bus
shuttling between the Muslim section of Sarajevo and Ilidza had
come from that area, the news agency quoted Serb police sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
During the search, the IFOR troops confiscated two rifles and
ammunition from the two men's room. The two suspected snipers were
then handed over to the Serb police for further questioning before
being set free.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Sani Abacha has called for national unity in announcing the 1996
budget thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerians, both home and abroad, should bury their
differences and join hands to enhance current efforts at nation
building," said Abacha in his address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
A number of opposition leaders went exile in the United States
and Britain following military's arrest of Moshood Abiola, the
undeclared winner of the 1993 general elections who proclaimed
himself President of Nigeria in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha urged politicians to compete within the
framework of the three-year program of transition to civil rule
which he had announced on October 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The program decided that Nigeria would employ a rotational
presidency which means the future head of state of the west
African country would come in turn from the six electoral zones
set by the military government.
</P>
<P>
"The power sharing system should leave no one in doubt that
Nigerians should have the respect for one another," said Abacha.
</P>
<P>
"Our politicians must learn from the bitter experiences of the
past and also from the contemporary political events elsewhere
and avoid those mistake which have led to instability in our
political process," warned the general.
</P>
<P>
Six successful military coups occurred in oil-rich Nigeria
which is also Africa's most Populous nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The seizure of a U.S.-hired
helicopter by the fighters of the National Patriotic Front
of Liberia (NPFL) has delayed a formal ceremony today of
handing over three helicopters to the West African peace-keeping
force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, fighters of the
NPFL led by Charles Taylor seized the helicopter on Friday in
Gbarnta, NPFL's stronghold, and forced the pilots to leave by
road.
</P>
<P>
The motives for taking the helicopter were not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
The seized helicopter is one of the three, which arrived in
liberia last sunday and have been hired by the United States and
provided for ECOMOG. ECOMOG is supposed to disarm the estimated
60,000 fighters of Liberia's armed factions, including the NPFL,
a month ago under a peace agreement signed in Nigeria last
August by all parties to the Liberian conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, the disarmament has been delayed by lack of funds and
the recent fighting between an armed faction, Ulimo-j, and the
ECOMOG soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the U.S. embassy in Liberia was today quoted
as saying that the U.S. ambassador William Milam had
been talking with Charles Taylor's people for the release of the
helicopter.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Maps Out Plan for Expanding Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Public Sector Minister
Atef Ebeid said today that the shares of 45 public companies will
be offered for sale for the first time as part of Egypt's expanded
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Ebeid, who doubles as Minister of State for Administrative
Development and Environment, said that more shares of the
companies which have already been partly privatized will be
offered for sale this year, according to the Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the agency as saying that buyers of the shares
will be asked not to change the activities of the companies. They
should also have experience in handling the work of the companies,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier local media reports, the government
approved the sale of some companies and banks in which the public
sector has no more than 49 percent of the equity.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that the government has agreed on the sale
of all of the assets of 14 companies in textile, engineering
and foodstuff industries along with 36 hotels and nine Nile
cruisers.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that the privatization process has
achieved initial success as all the companies offered for sale so
far have not suffered any job losses and their annual turnover has
increased, thereby resulting in a hike in employees' wages as
well as in profits.
</P>
<P>
But the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which
are backing Egypt's economic reform program, have said that the
privatization process is too slow.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet shift early last month was seen to be aimed at
quickening the pace of the economic reform, especially that of
privatization.
