<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Urged to Break Monopoly of PSI Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's apex trade body, the
Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry FBCCI)
Thursday urged National Board of Revenue (NBR) to break monopoly
of the Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI) companies for facilitating
businessmen to get competitive services.
</P>
<P>
"We are not getting appropriate services due to monopoly of the
PSI companies," a hardware machinery importer told a tripartite
meeting attended by representatives from the NBR, the FBCCI and
the PSI companies.
</P>
<P>
FBCCI vice president M.A. Mumin requested the NBR to appoint at
least three more PSI companies, one each for the three blocks
divided according to the origin of imported goods, and another one
for India in particular for better export-import preparatory
services.
</P>
<P>
Only a PSI company remains in operation in the country for each
block since February 15 to increase revenue and smooth import
operations.
</P>
<P>
FBCCI President Mintoo said an audit agency should be appointed
immediately and the NBR should introduce a complain center to
solve PSI-related problems.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the discussion, FBCCI directors and members
complained the misbehavior by the officials of PSI companies,
harassment non-implementation of issuance of provisional
certificates, delayed issuance of certificates and operational
problems.
</P>
<P>
The representatives from the PSI companies informed that
changes are taking place day by day in the newly-instituted
mechanism which was aimed at plugging duty evasion. Measures for
most of the complaints have already been taken, they added.
</P>
<P>
NBR chairman Zakir Ahmed Khan requested the PSI companies to
submit a report on the remaining problems within a day or two and
assured the businessmen of negotiating the problems with the PSI
companies for solution next week.
</P>
<P>
"Necessary steps will be taken to solve the existing problems.
Once the existing problems are solved, the PSI will be established
as an ideal system," the tax administration boss told the meeting.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Chief Negotiator Renews Call for Japan's Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Jong Thae Hwa, chief negotiator of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), on Thursday
renewed the demand for Japan's compensation for its 1910-1945
colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Jong told reporters after ending the second round of talks with
Japanese negotiators on normalizing diplomatic ties in Kisarazu,
east of Tokyo, that Japan stole cultural assets from Korea and
inflicted pains on Korean people during and after the colonization.
</P>
<P>
"Japan invaded and colonized Korea for a long time... It is
only proper that we, as victims, have the right to demand
compensation. Japan has nothing but the duty to compensate," Jong
said.
</P>
<P>
"By doing so, Japan will be able to regain international trust,
rebuild its destroyed morale and establish the basis for being
able to have normal relations with other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from Japan and the DPRK concluded Thursday their
two-day talks, first in Tokyo and second in Kisarazu, Chiba
Prefecture, without achieving a breakthrough on key issues
including the DPRK's demand for compensation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, however, agreed to meet again in October in a
third country for their third round of negotiations to continue
discussing pertinent issues.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of talks in April, the DPRK proposed a four-
point package demanding from Japan an official written apology,
compensation to satisfy the DPRK people, cover for damaged or
stolen cultural assets, and an improvement in the legal status of
DPRK people living in Japan on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
Chief Japanese negotiator Kojiro Takano at the time rejected
any wartime compensation on the grounds that Japan and the DPRK
were not at war in colonial times.
</P>
<P>
In the latest talks, Jong and Takano maintained their basic
positions on various issues, including the compensation issue.

<HEADLINE> 28 Federations Sign up for Doping Test Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- All 28 federations governing
Olympic summer sports have signed up for a program of out-of-
competition drug testing, the secretary-general of the World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA) said in Lausanne on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Harry Salvasamy said he received the signed contract from the
International Gymnastics Federation Thursday afternoon, while the
International Volleyball Federation returned its contract
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salvasamy said: "We will contact them immediately to discuss
the practicalities and the whereabouts of the athletes."
</P>
<P>
WADA, created last year to coordinate a worldwide testing
campaign for banned performance-enhancing drugs, had set a target
of carrying out 2,150 tests before the start of the Sydney
Olympics, Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
Salvasamy said he expected that 1,900-2,000 would in fact be
completed.
</P>
<P>
He said he was particularly pleased that 14 of the summer
sports federations had changed their regulations to allow the out-
of-competition testing.
</P>
<P>
WADA will now be monitoring how the federations manage their
test results, said Salvasamy. Any competitor who produces a
positive result will be handled under the regulations of his or
her own sport.

<HEADLINE> China Levies Anti-Dumping Tax on ROK Polyester Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) will start to levy an anti-
dumping tax for imported polyester film made in the Republic of
Korea (ROK) as of August 25, MOFTEC announced today in a final
judgment.
</P>
<P>
Such dumping causes tangible damage to the domestic polyester
film industry, MOFTEC said.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC has decided that importers must pay relevant anti-
dumping tax to China's customs when they import polyester film
made in the ROK from August 25.
</P>
<P>
According to Notice No. 12 issued by MOFTEC in 1999, the cash
margin paid by importers should be converted to tax in accordance
with the anti-dumping taxation rates. Relevant parties can apply
for returning excessive money from local customs within six months
from August 25.
</P>
<P>
In line with China's rules on anti-dumping and anti-allowances,
MOFTEC issued notices on April 16 and May 7 last year to start an
anti-dumping investigation into imported polyester film made in
the ROK.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC and the General Administration of Customs jointly
conducted the investigation, while the State Economic and Trade
Commission and relevant departments of the State Council studied
the degree of damage on China's domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
On December 29, 1999, MOFTEC issued a preliminary judgment
notice, implementing temporary anti-dumping measures for polyester
film imported from the ROK.
</P>
<P>
The anti-dumping measures will remain effective for five years.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The toll in heavy rains that
ravaged several parts of south Andhra Pradesh increased to 130
with reports of rain-related incidents pouring in from across the
state, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the worst-affected coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions
got a respite from torrential rains today, PTI quoted official
sources as saying fresh reports of rain-related deaths poured in
from several districts.
</P>
<P>
Indian Army and Air Force continued their rescue operations for
the second day today, evacuating people from marooned areas.
</P>
<P>
The rainfalls, which affected as many as 300 villages in 13
districts, threw normal life out of gear and over 40,000 people in
the state capital Hyderabad were evacuated from low-lying areas,
PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The coastal district of Guntur was the worst affected,
accounting for 37 deaths, followed by Hyderabad, 25, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad had received 24
cm rainfall on Wednesday, the highest in the last 46 years,
leading to inundation of as many as 110 low-lying localities and
throwing normal life out of gear.
</P>
<P>
The state government announced closure of schools in Hyderabad
and surrounding municipalities till next Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, PTI said, citizens of Hyderabad today woke up to a
bright sunshine after two days of nightmarish experience with
sheet of flood waters covering several parts of the city.

JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Olympic
Games organizers said on Friday that they have adopted a tough
line on substance abuse and firm steps are being taken to ensure
that a drup-free South African team travels to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Executive President of the South African National Olympic
Committee Sam Ramsamy said pre-games testing has already been
undertaken on most South African athletes.
</P>
<P>
A South African boxer originally selected from the squad has
been subsequently excluded after testing positive and a cyclist,
whose six-month suspension for contravening the antidoping code
expired in May this year, will also miss out on the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Although this cyclist is now competing on the international
circuit, we have declined to take him to the games," Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Our firm policy is that if any athlete tests positive within a
two-year period leading up the Games, that person will be excluded
from the Olympic team," he added.

</P>
<P>
The big correction was reasonable, according to technical
analysis, as the Shanghai composite had index gained 27.7 percent
without much correction since May 15. There were more profits that
were gained in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The restructured shares led the loss, however, the ST shares
performed actively during this week.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 500 Quakes Rock Turkey in Recent 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 491 quakes, ranging
from 2.6 to 5.9 on the Richter scale, took place throughout Turkey
in the last four months, Anatolia News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 10 were moderate, 43 slight and the others very
slight, according to the data of the Istanbul-based Bogazici
University Kandilli Observatory and Seismology Institute.
</P>
<P>
Southwestern province Denizli and central province Cankiri had
experienced more quakes in number. A total of 15 quakes occurred in
Turkey on August 20, 2000, and 10 of them were in Denizli but all
the quakes in the province were slight.
</P>
<P>
The massive quake of the recent four months took place in
Cankiri on June 6, 2000. The preliminary magnitude of this quake,
which caused casualties and financial damage, was 5.9 on the
Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 quakes occurred in Cankiri the same day, among
them a 5.8-magnitude aftershock was recorded.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 quakes occurred in Turkey on June 9 of this year
and seven of them also were recorded in Cerkes and Orta townships
in Cankiri province. One of the quakes in Cerkes was measuring 5.2
on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a quake-prone country whose Marmara region was hit by
two devastating earthquakes last year, claiming nearly 20,000
lives. It was reported that approximately 5-8 quakes took place in
Turkey every day.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale again shook
Marmara region on Wednesday, injuring ten people. The tremor, felt
in 11 provinces in the country, lasted for 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that they have learned lessons from the
earthquake disasters, saying that construction of multi-storey
buildings were not allowed around the fault line and they were
encouraging construction of maximum three-storey buildings.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists warned that another massive earthquake could shake
Turkey's biggest city Istanbul at any time, calling for the
government to make preparations very well.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit ever said that a series of measures
had been taken against a possible massive earthquake which could
hit Istanbul in coming years.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants India to Be On the Side of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
Friday expressed his hope that India would be "on the side of
peace" in the Middle East affairs and he did not see as a "holy
date" the September 13 deadline set by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat for declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Regional and Cooperation Shimon Peres, who arrived
here Thursday for a four-day visit, told the press here that
Arafat had hinted that September 13 might not be a strict deadline
for his threatened unilateral declaration.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who met Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Thursday, is here to seek Indian support close on the heels of
Arafat's visit to New Delhi last week.
</P>
<P>
"We want India on the side of peace. We do not want India to
support us against the Palestinians. We don't want one-side
support of India," said Peres, an Israeli former prime minister
and a Nobel laureate as an architect of the 1994 Oslo Accord.
</P>
<P>
He informed Vajpayee of the latest development in the Middle
East, saying Vajpayee responded "favorably" to his appraisal.
</P>
<P>
Peres spoke warmly of the relations Israel wants to establish
with the Palestinian people and of the need to build economy on
Palestinian side..
</P>
<P>
He declined to give a time frame by which an accord could be
reached between Israel and Palestine but said all parties were
keen that a solution should be found before the end of the tenure
of United States President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Asked if a unilateral declaration by Arafat would have any
impact on the peace process, Peres said it would have a limited
impact.
</P>
<P>
Indicating that it was a tough phase in the negotiations
between leaders of Israel and Palestine, he said when it came to
politics, it was easy to compromise, but when it came to religion,
it became very difficult.
</P>
<P>
It was important that there should be both diplomatic and
economic peace and both sides were negotiating for building an
infrastructure in the Middle East as at present the area had only
an infrastructure of war and fear of war.

<HEADLINE> Thai Shares Down Slighty, Trading Volume Remains Thin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai stocks are little changed
Friday on lack of fresh market-moving factors, traders said.
</P>
<P>
At the closing of the day, the benchmark Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) index was slightly down 0.48 point, or 0.15 percent,
at 306.84 from 307.32 Thursday. The blue-chip SET 50 Index was
down 0.05 point, or 0.2 percent, at 21.58.
</P>
<P>
Despite the index declines, advancers were outpacing decliners
79 to 68, with 89 stocks unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume totaled 109 million shares worth 1.48 billion baht
(36 million U.S. dollars). Thin trading volume remained throughout
the day as most investors are on the sidelines. Some local
investors are selectively trading in high liquidity stocks on a
corporate news basis.
</P>
<P>
The finance sector is up 1.15, or 0.19 percent, at 598.45, on
local buying after their two-day declines on news over the early
liberalization of brokerage commission's fee.
</P>
<P>
Among the active stocks are --Kitanakin Finance Company, up 4.
92 percent; Krungthai Thanakit Finance company, up 7.69 percent;
the Mutual Fund Public Comanpay, up 10.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the SET index is likely to move between 304 to
310 points with lower than 2 billion baht (48 million dollars) in
trading value in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
They also said the market will continue its narrow range with
thin dealings ahead of the general election, which is expected to
take place during the last quarter this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Share prices fell for the
third straight day on Singapore Stock Market Friday continuing
their downward momentum as the market waffled on a variety of
unfavorable news.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) slipped by 7.67 points
to end at 2,166.29 points in quiet dealings.
</P>
<P>
The total volume shrank to 224.24 million units worth 531.46
million Singapore dollars (about 308.99 million U.S. dollars).
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 171 to 110 with 281
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
ST Engg clinched to the top on the volume list as it registered
a turnover of 15.36 million units. It was followed by SingTel that
had 15.35 million shares done. Brierley was the next with 10.36
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Venture was the biggest gainer of the day surging up 100 cents
to close at 23.00 Singapore dollars. Robinson went up 28 cents to
finish at 4.86 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sem, CityDev and NatElec
edged up 20 cents to end at 14.80, 8.75 and 5.95 Singapore dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
DBS and UOB led descent of the day as they sank 50 cents each
to close at 21.80 and 13.10 Singapore dollars respectively.
Chartered shed 40 cents to finish at 14.60 Singapore dollars. SIA
and SIA 200 slid by 30 cents to end at 17.00 and 17.10 separately.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the day's fall was led by banking stocks
which was continuing to lose favor as investors viewed the recent
upswing as being overdone.
</P>
<P>
They said news that the U.S. army may delay announcing the
winners of its 6.8 billion U.S. dollars armed vehicles contract
dragged down the stock of ST Engineering.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that SingTel's rally today was spurred by the
report that Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Holdings would consider buying
into Singapore Telecommunications Corporation when the Singapore
government divests its shareholdings.

<HEADLINE> Italy Beats Japan to Finish 7th in Women's Volleyball Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy proved that its previous
victory over Japan to get the remaining Olympic slot was no fluke
as the Italians beat the Japanese anew, this time to get a
consolation seventh place of the 2000 World Women's Volleyball
Grand Prix here.
</P>
<P>
The Italians leaned anew on crowd-favorite Francesa Piccinni,
Elisa Togut and Darina Mifkova to post a 19-25, 25-21, 25-ll, 25-
19 victory over the Japanese in the 97 minutes encounter.
</P>
<P>
With Ikumi Ogake and Chikako Kumamae spearheading the attacks
for Japan, the taller Italians were defeated in the opening set,
but they bounced back with dominating and powerful spikes that
shattered the Japanese defense to sweep the next three sets.
</P>
<P>
"We're not satisfied with this win because we committed too
much errors in the first set," said Italian coach Angiolino
Frigoni.
</P>
<P>
From the fourth place finish last year, the Italians suffered a
big slump in this 8th edition of the Grand Prix where they won
only twice, all of them against Japan, in 11 outings.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Italians dealt the Japanese three setbacks,
including the crucial match in June in the Olympic qualifying
tournament in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the Japanese women's national team
did not qualify in the Olympics, which it dominated in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
And worse, the Japanese finished last with 0-11 win-loss card
in this year's Grand Prix, but will still go home with a
consolation prize of l0,000 U.S. dollars. Italy pocketed a 20,000-
dollar cash prize.

BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Composite Index
ended at 2086.7 points, up 15.54 points or 0.75 percent today.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was 13.08 billion yuan, which was 20 percent less

</P>
<P>
Inheriting strength from yesterday's rally from the previous
tumble, the Shanghai stock market opened higher at 2073.72 points
this morning.
</P>
<P>
But at the 2080-point level, the profit-taking pressure and
released shares changed heavily. So the index was led down again.
However, after the market dropped to 2066.33 points in the
afternoon, the index was pushed up by investors' buying and the
market ended at a high level.

</P>
<P>
Although the market was bottoming out, the fundamental tone
was rather cautious and vulnerable, as investors were not sure for
the direction.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that sessions ahead are likely to
be plagued with choppy trading. The index may be confined to a
very narrow trading range as investors continue to be hesitant to
commit.

<HEADLINE> China Keeps Close Eye on Trans-Genetic Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China has strengthened
management on trans-genetic studies and experiments in a move to
carry out an international agreement on biosafety the country
signed early this month.
</P>
<P>
China signed the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety of the
Convention on Biological Diversity at the headquarters of the
United Nations in New York on August 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
The protocol is aimed to ensure "an adequate level of
protection in the areas of the safe transfer, handling and use of
living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from modern
biotechnology that may have adverse effects on the conservation
and sustainable use of biological diversity," while taking into
account risks to human health, and specifically focusing on
transboundary movements.
</P>
<P>
In the past dozen years, biological technology has been
developing rapidly in China. Some 22 kinds of trans-genetic crops
and trees which are of good quality and resist pests and disease
have been used for field experiments.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, China ranks fourth in trans-genetic
crop experiment and production in the world.
</P>
<P>
China also imports LMOs such as trans-genetic soybeans, and has
established joint ventures with some foreign enterprises engaged
in biological research and development.
</P>
<P>
However, the State Environmental Protection Administration (
SEPA) said effective measures must be taken to strengthen
inspection and management of LMOs research and production to guard
against possible adverse effect on the biological diversity,
ecological environment and human health in China.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA has issued the Framework of China State Biosafety with
the help of departments of science and technology, agriculture,
forestry, education, and medicine inspection and will continue to
build a national system for the inspection and technological
support of biosafety in accordance with the framework.

<HEADLINE> Rectum Polyp Removing Reduces Incidence of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found
that removing polyps from patients' rectum can reduce the
incidence and death toll resulting from rectum cancer by 40
percent and 50 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Science and Technology Daily quoted researches from the
Tumor Institute of Zhejiang University as saying that they took
the lead in the world in proving that the removing of rectum
polyps (small lumps that grow inside someone's body) could prevent
the occurrence of rectum cancer to some extent.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the institute and Haining Medical Research
Institute jointly examined total of 230,000 people above 30 years
old in Haining City, east China's Zhejiang Province, in 1977 and
1980 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The intestinal health checks indicated that 4,077 people had
rectum polyps or adenoma and all of them were removed soon after
the check-ups.
</P>
<P>
Follow-up checks of the 4,077 people show that the incidence
and death rate from rectum cancer of the group were reduced by 68.
6 percent and 82.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The large intestine cancer is one of the most common cancers
for Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Experts indicate that the number of rectum cancer patients
accounts for two-thirds of the intestine cancer patients. Most
intestine cancer develops from intestinal adenoma after 10 to 15
years.

<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- World leading instrumentation company Saab Marine
Electronics of Sweden has set up its Middle East base in Sharjah's
Saif Zone of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in an attempt to
further explore the market.
</P>
<P>
Saab Marine Middle East would operate through a wide regional
swathe extending from Egypt to the UAE, including Iran, said Anders
Roos, CEO of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
"We have earlier been operating here for many years through our
agent Maritronics, but felt it imperative that we set up our own
Mideast base," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saif Zone is currently under construction, likely to
be ready within two months, according to Taryam Mattar Mohammed
Taryam, director general of the Zone.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Motorola Israel, which develops and manufactures
mobile data transmission systems, is building a development center
for software engineers from the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA).
</P>
<P>
The center will be in an industrial zone being built in the
northern West Bank on a hill that borders the PNA. It is part of
Motorola's new strategy of building relationships between groups of
software developers in Jordan and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Justice Ministry will try to push
through amendments to the copyright law in the next few months so
that penalties can be imposed more readily on copyright violators.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has recently assigned more people to handle
intellectual property matters, both in the legislation department
and in the economic department.
</P>
<P>
The legal liability of Internet service providers is now high on
the agenda of a committee set up by the ministry to investigate
legal issues related to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- An average Israeli family in the top two income
deciles spent 7.5 times more per child on educational services last
year than an average family in the two lowest deciles, said the
Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the CBS findings, 600 shekels (150 U.S. dollars) a
month was spent per child for educational services -- tuition,
courses, extracurricular activities and tutoring -- by the upper 20

percent while 80 shekels (20 dollars) was spent by the lower 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
An average family spent 3.6 percent more in 1999 over the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Protests Launched in Northern Cyprus Against Possible "State of Emergency" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The plans proposed by Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for "state of emergency" in northern
Cyprus has caused protests, Greek Cypriot media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said earlier this week that a state of emergency is
needed to deal with a worsening economic crisis. Opponents fear
such action would curtail democratic rights and freedom and
suppress any dissenting views.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Turkish Cypriot organizations, including political
parties and trade unions, are staging a series of protests, to
denounce the planned move and to demand an end to Turkey's
dominance of the northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus in 1983 which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted Turkish Cypriot newspaper Avrupa as saying that a

decision by Turkey's National Security Council gave the green light
to Denktash to proceed with the proclamation of a state of
emergency in the north.
</P>
<P>
The council, meeting under Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer,
decided to intervene in northern Cyprus by "dictating" an "action
plan" to deal with the grave economic and social problems facing
Denktash's breakaway state.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting on Tuesday said measures
decided by the council aimed at "strengthening the unity and
prosperity of the Turkish Cypriots and securing political and
economic stability."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has criticised the way the Turkish Cypriot regime has
managed the heavily subsidized economy.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said earlier this week a state of emergency might be
the best way to deal with the worsening economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Street protesters earlier this month urged Denktash and his
administration to resign over its handling of a series of bank
failures in northern Cyprus and condemned Turkey's influence on the
island.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot public sector employees union also issued a
statement saying the present chaos in the north would not be
resolved by a state of emergency, but through democratic
procedures.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports to Reach Six Million Tons This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports is
expected to meet the government's target of six million tons this
year, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said he believes rice trade agreement between Thailand
and Vietnam, along with other export promotion projects launched
by the commerce ministry, will help boost Thai rice exports to
reach the targeted six million tons by the year end, though the
rice exports in the first eight months fell short of the target.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Vietnam are the biggest and the second biggest
rice exporters in the world. Earlier this year the two governments
agreed that any cooperation, be it on the governmental level or
even between exporters themselves, should be carried out in a way
that will benefit rice growers of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Thai rice in the first eight months of this year
reached 3.5 million tons, one million tons of which, or about 30
percent, are Thai jasmine or Hom Mali rice, Supachai was quoted by
Thai News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
A promising prospect was envisaged for improving exports of
Thai jasmine rice in the rest of the year, which would eventually
help promote overall exports of Thai rice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand sells 20 to 30 billion baht's (500 to 750 million U.S.
dollars) worth of jasmine rice every year in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Last year the country exported 6.658 million tons of rice with
a total value of 85 billion baht (2.12 billion dollars), the
highest level in history.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's main overseas markets for its rice are Hong Kong,
Singapore, Indonesia, Iran and the Philippines.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's coxless four
rowing team believed they were right on the mark for what they had
predicted to be a gut-busting finish down the last few meters of
the Penrith rowing course for the gold medal at the Sydney
Olympics next month, New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four will be one of the most hotly contested races at the

Olympic champions Australia; Italy, which beat the New Zealand
team into second place at the Lucerne World Cup regatta last month;
France, Norway and New Zealand.

history of friendly contacts. During the 45 years since the
establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries, in
keeping with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have
kept improving their political relations, enhancing economic and
trade cooperation and developing their cultural exchange, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Nepal have also had good coordination and cooperation
in world affairs, Qian said.

It is a firm policy of the Chinese Government to maintain and
develop good-neighborly relationships with Nepal, he said.

<P>
Briefing the guest on China's strategy to develop its vast
western areas, Qian said there is great potential for the two

conditions and opportunities for the cooperation between Nepal and
the Tibet Autonomous Region, he said.

Bastola expressed satisfaction over the progress of the two
countries' relations over the past 45 years. Nepal highly
appreciates China's long-term assistance to its economic and

<HEADLINE> Most of Polluting Enterprises Meet Environmental Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- About 90 percent of the
polluting enterprises in China have reached the state or local
standards of environmental protection, said the State Environment
Protection Administration (SEPA) today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, 89.9 percent of the total number of 238,000
polluting enterprises in China have reached the environmental
standards, up 1.5 percent compared with the previous month,
according to the latest statistics released by SEPA.
</P>
<P>
Some 98 percent of the polluting enterprises in Tianjin,
Jiangsu, Shandong and Beijing have met the standards, while in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
Sichuan, Qinghai, Guizhou and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
less than 70 percent of polluting enterprises have reached the
standards.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the polluting enterprises in China should meet
the state and local standards for protecting the environment by
the end of the year 2000, according to a program to protect the
environment, which was issued by the Chinese government four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
China has already closed more than 65,000 polluting enterprises,
and has meted out financial or administrative punishment to those
which failed to reach the standards in time.
</P>
<P>
Provinces and autonomous regions that still have a large number
of polluting enterprises should take more strict measures to
guarantee the realization of the final goal by the end of this
year, said Lu Xinyuan, director of the Department of Pollution
Control under the SEPA.

<HEADLINE> Calimlim Denies Bugging of Estrada's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Armed Forces vice
chief of staff Jose Calimlim said Friday in a statement that he
did not order any bugging on the telephone of Philippine President
Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said the allegation of bugging the office of the
President is a concoction by detractors waging a vilification
campaign to put him out of contention as one of the contenders as
the next chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
He issued the statement to rebut point by point the allegation
by Thomas Dumpit, a former member of the Presidential Security
Group (PSG), that Calimlim masterminded the bugging of the
telephone of President Estrada in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Dumpit said in a letter that he knew about the installation of
these bugging devices in the Presidential Palace whose recordings
end up in the camp of the opposition party Lakas.
</P>
<P>
"It is no wonder that everything that happens in the Palace
finds its place in the newspapers," Dumpit said in the letter
which was published by the newspaper of Philippine Daily Inquirer
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim assured that when he was the PSG chief, he did not
order any bugging on the telephone of the president.
</P>
<P>
The job of the PSG is to see to it that the president and the
First Family are secured from harm. It is not involved in bugging,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim, who is also the concurrent chief of the Intelligence
Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said that as far
as being named as the next chief of staff, "I'm not thinking about
it. I'm contented with the position I have attained in my military
career."

list of all 63 "unconverted long-term prisoners" now in South
Korea and their families, media reports said here.

Names of all the "unconverted long-term prisoners" and photos
of some of them were published in newspapers. Among them, the
oldest is 89 years and the youngest 55.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said on Wednesday that it planned to receive the
prisoners and their families and decided to send a plane to Seoul
to take them back on September 2.
</P>
<P>
"Unconverted long-term prisoners" refer to prisoners detained
by South Korea since the Korean War in the 1950s who would not
change their political conviction.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the prisoners was included in the June 15
North-South joint declaration signed by DPRK leader Kim Jong Il
and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung at the end of the inter-
Korean summit in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>

JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Proposals raised at July's Camp David summit will serve as
the base for further negotiations with the Palestinians, Israeli
acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Thursday in talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria, backtracking from
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's post-summit statement that the failure
to sign a final agreement had rendered Israeli concessions "null
and void."
</P>
<P>
Describing talks with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross aimed at
reconvening a summit, Ben-Ami said Israel's "aspiration is to try
and produce a collective paper to express what the parties
understand is the product of Camp David on some core issues."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Thursday discussed with acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-
Ami what the Israeli minister later called "interesting ideas" for
bridging the gap between Israel and the Palestinians on the
Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Alexandria was but one of a series of behind-the-
scenes efforts to prepare for the U.S. President Bill Clinton's
meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on September 6 at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Following the bilateral meetings, Clinton will decide whether to
reconvene a summit that would lead to an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday took his first
concrete step toward establishing a national unity government by
calling on the opposition Likud to join his government within a few
weeks if the peace process with the Palestinians fails.
</P>
<P>
Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon said his party would no join a unity
government because of Barak's far-reaching concessions in the talks
with the Palestinians, particularly over Jerusalem and the Jordan
Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
Barak's move generated a scathing response in the left-wing
Meretz, which Barak likes to call Labor's "natural partner," even
if it is currently not in the government.

<P>

Yediot Aharonot: "Yes my present situation is tough."
</P>
<P>
Barak Thursday reached out to the opposition Likud for a
national unity government once talks with the Palestinians failed
to yield a peace accord. The overture was rejected by Likud leader
Ariel Sharon and evoked strong protests from the left-wing Meretz
party.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A mild earthquake measuring 4.8
on the Richter Scale jolted Bengkulu, capital of Bengkulu province,
Indonesia, early Friday, but no casualty was reported.
</P>
<P>
The quake was the second to hit the city in nine hours after a
stronger earthquake measuring 5.2 on Richter scale struck at about
6:30 p.m. Thursday, Antara news agency quoted an official of the
Kepahiang Meteorological and Geophysics Office Sidik Pramono as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The first tremor's epicenter was located 6.55 south latitude
and 103.17 east longitude, 61 kilometers beneath the Indian Ocean
or some 160 kilometers southeast of Enggano island.
</P>
<P>
The second quake's epicenter has yet to be determined because
the monitoring equipment has failed to record it.
</P>
<P>
Pramono said that this month, the province has been jolted by
47 tremors, five of them measuring more than 4 on the Richter
scale.
</P>
<P>
A strong earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale rocked
Bengkulu last June, killing more than 100 people and injuring
hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Almost 3,000 aftershocks were recorded after the strong quake,
97 of which were felt by the people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Uzbekistani Defense Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao
said today that China will further expand and strengthen
cooperation in all fields with Uzbekistan, including the joint
combat against national separatism, international terrorism,
religious extremism and other cross-nation crimes.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is also the vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission, made the remarks in his meeting with visiting
Uzbekistani Defense Minister Yuri Agzamov.
</P>
<P>
China-Uzbekistan relations have seen sound development since
the two countries forged diplomatic ties, Hu said. The expansion
of such relations are "in the fundamental interests of the two
countries and the two peoples and conducive to regional peace,
stability and development" he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hu said Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with Uzbekistani
President Islam Abduganiyevich Karimov at the "Shanghai Five"
summit held in Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, in July. The two
heads of state extensively exchanged views on bilateral ties,
regional and global issues, and reached a broad consensus. He also

foundation for the healthy and stable growth of bilateral ties in
the long run.

the Taiwan issue and China will give Uzbekistan support in its
effort to safeguard national stability, regional security and the
advancement of economic development.

Agzamov considered his current visit to China "an important
follow-up step" to implement the consensus reached by the two
heads of state. Uzbekistan can "learn from China" in its army
building, he said.

Sharing Hu's view on bilateral ties, the minister said that
Uzbekistan will consistently adhere to the One-China principle and
support the stance of the Chinese government on the Taiwan issue.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM May Still Snub South Pacific Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark may still snub the South Pacific Forum meeting, which
will be held in Kirabati in October.
</P>
<P>
Last Month, Helen Clark said she wouldn't go if - as looked
likely then - Fiji's coup leader George Speight had a key role in
the Fijian government.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, she is still questioning whether she should go "
because the forum has no criteria requiring good governance from
its member states," the Evening Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is waiting for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to convince her she needs to go, according to the
Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I am still waiting for Foreign Affairs to produce some
thoughts on the South Pacific strategy," Helen Clark was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
That includes looking at how New Zealand could best contribute
to a more stable region and improve governance among South Pacific
states, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"I suspect if they are keen for me to go to the South Pacific
Forum, they should be rattling something out," she said.
</P>
<P>
Helen Clark said there has to be something in it for New
Zealand for her to attend the forum meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I want to feel there is some point in going," she said.
</P>
<P>
If Helen Clark stays home, Foreign Minister Phil Goff is likely
to represent New Zealand at the meeting, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Aid to Colombia Sparks Jitters in Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Fearing troubles will spill
over onto their own land, neighboring countries of Colombia have
expressed concerns about the U.S. intervention in Colombia's anti-
drug war. They fear that U.S. involvement could trigger massive
displacements of people toward neighboring states and dampen the
hope of a peaceful solution to Colombia's civil strife.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, days before his visit to Colombia on August 30, U.S.
President Bill Clinton okayed an aid package worth 1.3 billion
dollars to war-torn Colombia to help the world's biggest cocaine
producer fight the drugs trade.
</P>
<P>
The aid includes 18 Black Hawk helicopters and 42 Huey 2
helicopters, as well as money to train and equip Colombia's police
and military.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, U.S. military advisers would also be
dispatched to Colombia to train special contingents in combating
drug traffickers and producers, mostly the leftist guerrillas who
protect and profit from the illegal industry.
</P>
<P>
There are fears in the region that U.S. aid, which strengthens
the Colombian armed forces, will indirectly lead Bogota away from
a political solution to Colombia's three-decade civil war between
the government and rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, one of the five neighbors of Colombia, voiced its
concern that the U.S. role in Colombia could force Colombian drug
producers and traffickers to seek shelter in its territory.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said Thursday that if the
conflict in Colombia is worsened by American military presence, it
could generate big mobilization of people toward neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan government is not opposed to U.S. aid to
Colombia, explained the minister, but it is keeping its watch over
consequences for Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has suffered an array of kidnappings and plane
hijackings in the border area.
</P>
<P>
Rangel pledged that Venezuela, which refused to let U.S.
reconnaissance planes fly over its territory to track drug-
trafficking aircraft toward the United States, won't get involved
in other countries' matters.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela believes that dialogue between the Colombian
government and the rebel groups is the best way to end the
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Rangel did not rule out the possibility that President Hugo
Chavez may take up the issue at a summit of South American heads
of state at the end of August in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, another immediate neighbor of Colombia, said last week
that it was worried about the negative effects that "Plan Colombia
" might have along the common border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It has the same fear as Venezuela that Colombian rebels may
cross the border into Brazil and drug traffickers might move their
cocaine-producing plantations into Brazil's Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also fears that the possible application of defoliants
to Colombian drug crop plantations may cause environmental
problems in its forests.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia announced that
Brazil would not be drawn into any common international operation
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador, Colombia's two Andean neighbors, appear to be
supportive to U.S. intervention because they receive some extra of
the aid package.
</P>
<P>
But Ecuador is acting to strengthen its own security in the
common border with Colombia for fear that Colombia's cancerous
tumor -- the drug trade -- will spread to its territory.
</P>
<P>
Though new U.S. envoy to Bogota Anne Woods Patterson tried to
quell the fears of these countries by labeling speculations of
exodus of refugees to nearby countries and flare-up of the
Colombian war as "exaggerated," both sides of the conflict in
Colombia expect an escalation of the war.
</P>
<P>
"There will be peace, but first there will be war," Colombia's
armed forces chief, General Fernando Tapias said in an interview
published in Brazil on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"If they implement Plan Colombia in practice they will have the
worst conflict that this country has ever seen. And we will be
ready for it," Raul Reyes, the chief negotiator for the country's
biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
warned in a separate interview.

<HEADLINE> Houston Comets Hurtle Towards Fourth WNBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Cynthia Cooper is well on her
way to her fourth straight WNBA Championship Most Valuable Player
Award.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, she and the Houston Comets need just one more
win to capture their fourth consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
As Cooper scored 20 for her team, the Comets never trailed en
route to a 59-52 Game 1 victory over the New York Liberty in front
of 19,500 screaming fans at Madison Square Garden in New York.
</P>
<P>
Houston has won two of its three previous championships at New
York's expense and had little trouble overcoming the Liberty's
home-court advantage again.
</P>
<P>
Cooper opened the scoring with a pair of running jumpers and
Houston was able to weather each of New York's ensuing runs at the
lead.
</P>
<P>
The Liberty closed within four points with just under four
minutes to play and Teresa Weatherspoon's free throws with 0:52
left on the clock cut the deficit to 52-50.
</P>
<P>
But Cooper came through in dramatic fashion. She beat the shot
clock with an off-balance jumper, drawing a foul and sinking the
ensuing free throw with 26 seconds left to end a seven-minute
scoring drought for Houston.
</P>
<P>
Cooper sealed the victory by knocking down two free throws with
14 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
Tari Phillips scored 24 points for the Liberty, who had come
back from a series-opening loss to eliminate Cleveland in the
Eastern Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
Game Two is Saturday afternoon in Houston.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Upgrades Hong Kong's Currency Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Rating agency Moody's Investor
Service has upgraded Hong Kong's short-term foreign currency
country ceiling to Prime-1 from Prime-2, and the domestic currency
issuer rating of the government to Aa3 from A1.
</P>
<P>
The move will mean access to cheaper short-term foreign
currency funding for many Hong Kong companies, according to local
media reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency left Hong Kong's key long-term sovereign
rating untouched at A3, which will continue to penalize issuers of
public and private sector foreign currency bonds.
</P>
<P>
The upgrades reflected Hong Kong's "successful navigation
through the highly stressful period of the East Asian and post-
Russian financial crisis, and the continued robustness of both its
fiscal and external positions," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Moody's also predicted the real estate sector would remain "an
integral part" of the regional economy, despite the effects of the
Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
All of the Moody's-rated real estate development and management
companies in East Asia have maintained their investment grade
ratings.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of Hong Kong, welcomed the
upgrade but said it was only achieved after long talks between the
government and various credit-rating agencies.

and Flowers, Folk Dance of the Yao People, Butterfly Lovers and Ye
Shen Chen from Beijing Opera.
</P>
<P>
And two western musical pieces such as Galop in Chinese Style
composed by great musician Johann Strauss were also played at the
concert by Chinese traditional musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
Before the concert started, an ten-minute video tape showing
Chinese National Traditional Orchestra was displayed, giving the
audience an experience of Chinese traditional music and its
musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
In the Folk Dance of the Yao People, which vividly presents Yao
people celebrating a festival with songs and dances, the main

elegant movements of female dancers.
</P>
<P>
While the liveliness of the young men was embodied through the
vigorous accompaniment played on plucked instruments.
</P>
<P>
When the music ended in an enthusiastic climax of dancing and
singing, the 1,000-plus audience applauded for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"It's my first time to experience a Chinese traditional concert,
and it's amazing! Chinese musical instruments are so unique, and I
can't believe erhu, such a small instrument can give out so
beautiful music." David Knorr, a technician told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his wife attended the
concert, accompanied by several of his deputies and other senior U.
N. officials.
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere in the world, music can be a form of perfect
communication. It doesn't care about your passport, language or
creed. It just wants to be enjoyed, and as such it is a
manifestation of our common humanity." Annan wrote in a letter of
greetings to the concert. "If music be the food of peace, play on.
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan thanked Chinese musicians for coming here to share their
music with people of all nations. He said watching such high-level
concert helped him to relax after a full day's working.

Representative and Permanent Deputy Representative, and Zhang
Hongxi, Chinese Consular General in New York appeared at the

<P>
The decision was made at an ASEAN central bankers' meeting

"There is no single nation to have borrowed from the fund
because its size is too small, so members decided to lift its

<P>
Currently, the fund was jointly set up by the five founding
ASEAN members, namely Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and
the Philippines, with each contributing 40 million dollars to the

<HEADLINE> Howard Insists on Reconciliation in practice with Aboriginals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard insists on his "reconciliation in practice" with
Aboriginals, the Australian Associated Press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister defended his refusal to apologize to those
forcibly separated from their aboriginal parents, now called "the
stolen generation."
</P>
<P>
He was in response to an accusation made by the former prime
minister Malcolm Fraser Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The former Liberal leader criticized the government for
fighting the stolen generation in the courts, refusing to say "
sorry" and rejecting United Nations criticisms in his delivery of
the annual Vincent Lingiari memorial lecture.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he urged Australia to adopt a bill of rights,
saying common law had failed to protect the rights of around 40,
000 Aboriginals in the country.
</P>
<P>
Howard confronted the accusation by saying that "If
reconciliation was as simple as substituting one word for another,
it would have been done years ago."
</P>
<P>
"The best way of helping disadvantaged people now is to address
elements of disadvantage," he said, adding "we are increasingly
doing that."
</P>
<P>
However, Fraser' remarks were welcomed by Aboriginal leaders.
Head of the Council for the Aboriginal Reconciliation Evelyn Scott
said Thursday night: "I was most impressed, I thought it was a
brilliant speech."
</P>
<P>
"The things he spoke about like the bill of rights, I was a bit
surprised by it but I fully endorse what he was saying," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar construction
authorities Thursday reached a contract with an Italian company on
purchase of the company's machine products to be used in the
country's bridge construction project, official newspaper The New
Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The contract, signed between the Myanmar Public Works of the
Ministry of Construction and the Casagrande SPA of Italy, is for
the purchase of two sets of Casagrande C 600 HD bore piling
machines to be used in the construction project of another new
major bridge crossing the country's Thanlwin River in Mawlamyine
township in southern Mon state.
</P>
<P>
There are three existing bridges crossing the Thanlwin river
respectively located in Hpa-an, Tarsan and Takawet townships.
</P>
<P>
The new Thanlwin bridge will be the longest one after
completion with a length of 3,174 meters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has built a total of
112 bridges in the country since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Extend Civilian Emergency in Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
extend civilian emergency status in the riot-torn province of
Maluku, said Governor of Maluku Province Saleh Latuconsina, who is
in charge of the state of civilian emergency in the province.
</P>
<P>
"I see civilian emergency, which will expire in late August, is
still needed," reports reaching here Friday from Ambon, capital
of Maluku province, said.
</P>
<P>
The governor made the statement Thursday after an inspection in
some areas in the province along with Chief of the National Police
Gen. Rusdihardjo.
</P>
<P>
He said that with entering of the third month of the civilian
emergency imposition, situation in Maluku has improved, adding
that a month ago economic activities as well as school resumed
again.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rusdihardjo also confirmed that the situation in
Maluku is much better now following the imposition of civilian
emergency three months ago. But he admitted minor scale conflicts
were still taking place.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed a nearly two
years of communal bloodshed involving Muslims and Christians.
Thousands of lives have been claimed and tens of thousands of
others have been forced to take shelter in the neighboring
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations as well as some western countries have
strongly urged the central government to put an end to the
bloodshed or let them help stop the conflict. But Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid has clearly refused the offer, saying
that Indonesia was able to settle the problem by itself.

ZAGREB, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of fires occurred this
year causing a loss of 150 million kuna, or 17.75 million U.S.
dollars, Croatian Interior Minister Sime Lucin said Thursday at a
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian broadcast and television station quoted Lucin as
saying that the country suffered a total of 936 fires in recent
three weeks, which destroyed some 9,000 hectares of forests, four
buildings and 20 economic installations.
</P>
<P>
Lucin blamed high temperatures and drought for the fires around
the country. He said that although more firefighters, soldiers and
volunteers have been mobilized to put the blazes under control,
the fires are still spreading because of bad weather.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Not To Use Crude to Harm Consumers: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Vice Foreign Minister
Jorge Valero denied Thursday that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) will use crude to harm consumer nations.
</P>
<P>
Valero, also president of the organization commission of the
second OPEC Summit to be held in Caracas from September 27-29,
said the bloc intends to balance market prices.
</P>
<P>
"There's no intention whatsoever on behalf of the bloc to
utilize oil as confrontation weapon against consumer countries, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that neither Venezuela nor OPEC wishes to be
disturbing factors on the price issue, but wants to achieve fair
prices in order to balance markets and guarantee income to
exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he defended the price band mechanism agreed
by OPEC members in June as the best formula to balance crude
prices on markets.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism set oil prices to remain within a band between 22
and 28 U.S. dollars a barrel. OPEC production quota will go down
or up if the average price goes up to over 28 dollars or down to
22 dollars per barrel during 20 consecutive days.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Suffers Loss of 2.3 Billion U.S. Dollars in Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's exports suffered a
loss of 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first six months this year,
caused by the fall of basic products' prices on the world market,
the National Industry Confederation (CNI) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin, "Foreign Trade in Perspective", released by the
CNI, said that products' prices went down by 4.4 percent compared
with the same period of 1997, before the start of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
A significant recovery of prices will depend on a cut in the
production of certain products worldwide, like coffee, soybean in
grains and chicken, said the CNI.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Refuses to Restructure Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Colombia on Thursday turned down
the demands by its international creditors to restructure its 19-
billion-U.S. dollar foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Juan Manuel Santos Calderon said this would
trigger a crisis of immeasurable size, similar or worse than what
happened in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Colombia will have to use 40.4 percent of its national budget
estimated at 26 billion dollars in 2001 to service its external
and internal debts.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions, guerrilla groups and some economists have asked
the government to declare a moratorium on the servicing of foreign
debts in order to use more money in the budget to economic and
salary development.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that it was unnecessary to take the
step because the root of Colombia's economic troubles resides in
its enormous tax deficit.
</P>
<P>
In September, Calderon will present a package of measures to
the congress on the resolution of the fiscal imbalance with the
formula of increasing tax taking and lower expenses, which has
been strongly opposed by the congress and trade unions.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Returns IMF Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian National Bank
returned two loans totaling 100 million US dollars Tuesday to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a bid to resume its
cooperation with the world financial body, a Ukrainian official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two loans were granted to Ukraine in December, 1997, and
February, 1998 respectively, said Valery Litvizki, the chief
advisor to Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Ukraine returned the money on a voluntary
basis to regain the cooperative relationship with IMF.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko, who is on a working visit to Germany, confirmed the
return on Thursday, reported the Interfax-Ukraine news agency.
</P>
<P>
IMF suspended its loans to Ukraine in September last year,
saying that Ukraine didn't fulfill its obligations.
</P>
<P>
The financial body later sent experts to examine the loan
accounts in the Ukrainian National Bank and claimed that the bank
made a false report on its foreign exchange reserve situation when
applying for the loan items.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko attributed the difference between the two sides over
the foreign exchange reserve to the different calculating method
and hoped that the two sides would resume bilateral cooperation as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
High level Ukrainian governmental delegations twice visited IMF
headquarters in Washington this year but no substantial progress
was made.

<HEADLINE> Italian Peacekeepers Break Criminal Gang in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo-based Italian
peacekeepers announced Thursday that they have broken an ethnic
Albanian criminal gang made up of members from the former illegal
armed group, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Ten gang members
were said to have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, the ten suspects
were arrested under the charges of illegally possessing weapons
and conducting organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The Italian peacekeeping troops launched a surprise search on
Wednesday in ten living quarters of the gang members in the
southeast border area of Kosovo, in which they found four semi-
automatic rifles, one automatic rifle, one sniper's rifle and more
than 50,000 German marks (about 22,800 U.S. dollars) in cash, said
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug quoted a spokesman for the Italian peacekeeping
troops as saying that a large number of KLA uniforms were also
found in the above operation.
</P>
<P>
The gang members were suspected of being involved in three
murders taking place between last December and January this year,
said the news agency.

<HEADLINE> Standard Set For Mine Resource Assessors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China will issue a new set of
regulations to standardize the qualifications of registered mine
assessors.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is expected to help smooth the transfer of
exploitation rights on mineral resources, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Issued by the Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR), the
regulation requires those who evaluate mine resources to have
standard mine assessing qualifications before the approval by the
government.
</P>
<P>
This regulation aims to standardize mine resource evaluation,
which will better protect China's mine resources, said Zhong
Weizhi, director of MLR's Geographic Exploration Department.
</P>
<P>
According to China's 1996 Mineral Resources Law, foreign or
private companies are allowed to prospect for and extract mineral
resources in China after they have paid the central government,
which represents the country as the owner of all mineral reserves.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation of resources is needed to fix the fees paid to
the government for the transfer of mine prospecting and
exploration rights.
</P>
<P>
Mine resources assessors must be Chinese citizens with a master
's degree or above and with a certain period of experience in
related work, according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
And mine assessors are eligible for employment with mine
evaluation agencies and are registered with the government by
their employers after passing the standard examination, which will
be held by the end of this year for the first time.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 22 evaluation agencies approved by MLR in
China, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"So far there are no foreign mine resources evaluation agencies
in China, but foreign assessors are welcome to operate in the
country," Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Zhong also stressed that China's mine resource evaluation
method and procedure are in line with international rules.
</P>
<P>
"It will help standardize mine evaluation and improve operators
' capabilities," said Zhang Zhenkai, president of Beijing Haidiren
Resources Consultation Company.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Return GSP to Thailand Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will
return trade privileges under the Generalized System of Preference
(GSP) to Thailand and other countries in its next fiscal year,
starting from April 1, 2001, according to a report of the Thai
Commerce Ministry available here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
All 26 items of Thai products that were withdrawn from the
Japanese government's GSP program could be re-exported to Tokyo
after April 1, 2001, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other countries which were also withdrawn from the trade
privilege program could also re-export to the Asian powerful
economy next year, it added.
</P>
<P>
Japan's withdrawal of GSP from Thailand and other countries was
due to the countries' exports to Japan beyond overall ceilings and
quotas set for 23 items of imported products, including plywood,
bamboo wood, leather products, clothes, knitted gloves, plastic
products, mental, sodium glutamate, and peppermint oil, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and some other Asian and African countries, including
China, Pakistan, Vietnam, Iraq, Malaysia, and South Africa, were
also specifically deprived from Japan's GSP for exporting three
items of products to the country beyond one fourth of overall set
quotas, it said.

<HEADLINE> Croatia to Earn 3 Billion Dollars from Tourism This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Tourism, one of main pillar
industries in Croatia, is expected to earn 3 billion U.S. dollars
this year, Croatian Radio and Television reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months, 19.8 million tourists lodged in
Croatia, 47 percent more than the same period of last year. Of the
total, 17.1 million persons were from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian tourist industry suffered a loss of over one
billion dollars last year because of the airstrikes against
Yugoslavia by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Close to the Adriatic Sea, Croatia has a long and tortuous
coastline, which endows it with an excellent environment for
tourism.
</P>
<P>
At present, tourism earnings in Croatia account for 3 percent
of the total in the Mediterranean region. But the Croatian
government is trying to increase the share to 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> IOC Satisfied With Athens 2004 Olympics Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) Thursday voiced their satisfaction with
the progress of projects for the Athens 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with the progress of works and with the
close cooperation we have with the minister of public works Costas
Laliotis and his department," said IOC Vice-President Jacques
Rogge after separate meetings with Greek officials, including
Deputy Culture Minister for Sports Giorgos Floridis and Athens
Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Rogge, who arrived here Thursday to review the preparations by
Greece for the Athens Games, also said that the results had been
encouraging so far and their greatest satisfaction was that Greece
would be left with an improved infrastructure after the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with Rogge as fruitful and productive,
Laliotis said that they presented the analytical time line of
developments for the preparations and proved that all their
actions and projects would in fact be realized.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister Thursday unveiled plans for 18 major roads
and five of the projects would be reportedly completed by the end
of 2003 and the remainder in May 2004, four months before the
start of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
In April, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch sharply
criticized Athens for its delays in several areas of Olympic
preparations, saying that such delays would endanger the 2004
Games' smooth running.
</P>
<P>
After the IOC warning, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
began to take actions to accelerate the pace of the preparations,
with the reorganizing of the Athens Olympic Organizing Committee,
which is currently headed by Yianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who
helped Athens obtain the right to host the 2004 Games.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Woman Footballer Akers to Retire from International Competitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 24 (Xinhua) -- Michelle Akers, one of the
top American women soccer players, announced Thursday that she is
retiring from international competition and will not play in next
month's Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
She said the decision was made because of an injured shoulder
and her longtime battle with chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
"After winning the gold medal in 1996, I promised myself to
never again play in the condition I was in during those Olympic
Games," Akers said.
</P>
<P>
After the shoulder injury suffered on March 27 and subsequent
surgery on April 6 that caused her to miss almost all of the U.S.
Olympic preparation matches, Akers didn't return to the team until
its European tour in July but played well enough to earn a spot on
the 18-player Olympic roster.
</P>
<P>
However, she re-injured her shoulder in an August 15 match
against Russis and is retiring as the national team's second all-
time leading scorer behind Mia Hamm, with 105 goals and 37 assists.
</P>
<P>
Her retirement marks an end of a historic 15-year career after
Akers, 34, played in the first-ever U.S. women's national team
match against Italy on August 18, 1985.
</P>
<P>
She was the top scorer at the first-ever Women's World Cup in
1991, netting 10 goals to become the first American to win a
Golden Boot award at a FIFA competition.
</P>
<P>
Even though she won't be playing on the Olympic Team, Akers
will be attending the Games, saying that "I plan to cheer my team
on to win gold in Sydney."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Paralympics
team, bracketed among the achievers in international Olympic
competition, is hoping to continue, at the coming Sydney Games,
its winning streak.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Paralympics, slated for October 19 to 29 following
the summer Olympic Games, will be the world's second-largest
sporting event this year.
</P>
<P>
The Paralympic Games are acknowledged as the elite world
competition for physically disabled and intellectually impaired
athletes.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will send 63 athletes to Sydney to compete in nine
sports, namely athletics, cycling, basketball, equestrian,
powerlifting, shooting, swimming, table tennis and sailing.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 percent of the teams will comprise blacks and almost a
third of the athletes are women.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Forex Reserves Reach 1.111 Bln U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 24 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan (
SBP) Thursday disclosed that it has 1.111 billion U.S. dollars of
foreign exchange reserves and termed it as a comfortable level.
</P>
<P>
These reserves include Foreign Currency deposits of 452 million
dollars, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)
quoting an SBP statement.
</P>
<P>
There is no Presidential Ordinance which bars the State Bank
from maintaining these deposits as part of its reserves. However,
as a matter of prudent policy and to protect the interests of
depositors the State Bank since December 1999 has decided that
these deposits would not be utilized to meet current account
deficits, the APP report said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has removed all restrictions on foreign exchange
payments since January 2000. The State Bank has been making
purchases from the open market along with efforts to line up
appropriate funding to attain a comfortable reserve level while
remaining current on its external payments, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Norway Says Israeli-Palestinian Peace Deal Possible Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Foreign Minister
Thorbjoern Jagland said here Friday that Israel could reach a peace
agreement on final-status talks with the Palestinians soon.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Jagland said that he has been convinced after
meetings with israeli and Palestinian leaders that the two sides
could reach such a peace deal this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Compromise over the status of Jerusalem, a main obstacle in the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, was not beyond reach, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Jagland held talks with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Bethlehem, the West Bank city located just south
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to discuss the Jerusalem issue with Faisal
Husseini, a Central Committee Member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, in East Jerusalem later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Jagland also said that his country, which played a key role in
helping both Israel and the Palestinians to forge the Oslo peace
accords in 1993, could help in any solution for the Palestinian
refugee problem, another key issue facing the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak said if Arafat does not realize the urgency to reach the
peace deal, the impasse could post a great danger to the security
of the entire region.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Barak added, that Israel could not give up its
sovereignty over the Jewish holy site in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"No Israeli prime minister could agree to let the Palestinians
have sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which is the holy site for
the Jewish people for generations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said the if the peace deal could not be reached soon,
violence could erupt again in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Jagland flew to Israel from the Egyptian seaport city of
Alexandria on Thursday, where he held talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Israel describes Jerusalem as its eternal and undivided capital,
while Palestinians want at least East Jerusalem to be the future
capital of an independent Palestinian state which Arafat intends to
declare on September 13.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, there are about 3.5 million
Palestinian refugees and most of them are living in Jordan, Syria
and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Overspeed Landing Might Cause Gulf Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAMA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Landing at excessive speed may
cause the Gulf Air Airbus A320 to crash into shallow Gulf waters
near the runway of the Bahraini International Airport, leaving all
143 people on board dead, a local newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The pilot was requested by the control tower not to land with
that high speed," the Bahrain Tribune said, citing an alleged
conversation between the pilot and the air traffic control tower
and visual images on the tower's radar.
</P>
<P>
The pilot responded to the tower's instructions by climbing
again, then making two turns to reduce speed and finally
reapproaching the runway, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the plane's speed was still too high to land and that
the tower again instructed the pilot to reduce speed, it added.
</P>
<P>
"On the third attempt, the pilot took a small turn at high
speed. He lost control, which caused the plane to nosedive into the
waters next to the runway," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini airport authorities have claimed the control tower did
not receive any distress call from the pilot Ihsan Shakeeb.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is still unclear why the experienced pilot failed to
reduce the speed of the airbus.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have recovered the flight data recorder and
cockpit
voice recorder from the wreckage of Flight GF072, which was
traveling from Cairo to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi television said that Wednesday's accident was "due to
human error and not to technical malfunction."

BEIRUT, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 troops began to deploy
in Lebanon's Christian heartland, the Druze hinterland and the

</P>
<P>
The troops, backed by rapid deployment units to prevent any

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Rejects Israeli Reinvasion Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 25 (Xinhua) -- President Emile Lahoud rejected
the Israeli threat to return to Lebanon if the border did not
remain peaceful, An Nahar newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"They (Israelis) will think 100 times before taking any such
action," Lahoud told a visiting delegation of the Lions Club in the
Middle East Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is not an easy passageway any more. Lebanon is now a
state in the full sense of the word, enjoying the respect of the
international community around the world," Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a threat served the day before by Israel's
ground forces commander Maj. Gen. Moshe Ivry-Sukenik, who said the
Israeli army might have to mount a Lebanon thrust in case of a
major border incident "to create a new situation and not to impose
a new occupation."
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said the liberation of south Lebanon was a first step
toward a comprehensive Middle East peace. Israel pulled all its
troops out of the so-called security zone on May 24, ending 22
years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel should also withdraw from Syria's Golan Heights and allow
the estimated 360,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon to return to
their land before a peace accord could be concluded, he added.

<HEADLINE> Most Bodies of Plane Crash Victims off Bahrain Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAMA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Relatives of most of the victims
in Gulf Air plane crash have completed identification of the bodies
of their loved ones Friday, as some of the deceased, of Saudi,
Bahraini and United Arab Emirates nationalities, have been buried.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air issued a release at a press conference here, saying the
airline was making an immediate advance payment of 25,000 U.S.
dollars to each of the bereaved families in the tragic accident
which claimed 143 lives.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Airbus A320 of the Gulf Air flight 072 plunged
into the shallow waters of the Gulf off Bahraini international
airport Wednesday evening after two unsuccessful attempts to land,
killing all 135 passengers and eight crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The flight was en route from Cairo to Bahrain. The passengers
include 63 Egyptians, 34 Bahrainis, 12 Saudis, two Britons, an
Australian, nine Palestinians, six from the United Arab Emirates,
three Chinese, one Korean, one Kuwaiti, one Sudanese, one Omani and
an American.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air said the advance payment to the victims' families will
be considered as part of the final settlement of compensation
arising from the accident.
</P>
<P>
What caused the catastrophe remains unknown. The black boxes, a
flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder, have been
recovered from the wreckage of the aircraft, and investigations
have been ordered together with experts from Airbus Industrie,
manufacturer of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The airline rejected as "entirely speculative" media reports
quoting the contents of the flight data recorder, saying the black
box can not be opened in Bahrain, where it is currently held under
guard with Civil Aviation Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The black box will be sent for examination and interpretation to
Europe or America, it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that to try to find out the cause of the crash is the
responsibility of the investigation team, headed by Bahraini
Communications Minister Sheikh Ali Bin Khalifa Al Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A320 joined the Gulf Air fleet in 1994, and had
accumulated 17,000 flying hours.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air belongs in equal parts to Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the
government of Abu Dhabi, the largest of seven sheikdoms making up
the United Arab Emirates. The Bahrain-based Gulf Air operates a
fleet of 28 planes and flies to 53 international destinations.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 1,100 Airbus A320s in service around the
world and the Airbus A320 can seat up to 150 passengers.

JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will visit Turkey on Monday to discuss the Middle East peace
process with Turkish leaders, the Prime Minister's Office said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak will also discuss with Turkish leaders ways to further
improve economic and security cooperations between the two

</P>
<P>
But foreign diplomats here said that Barak's trip to Turkey is
to seek Turkish support for its peace policy and ask Turkey not to
back Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to unilaterally declare an
independent Palestinian state in September.
</P>
<P>
After the failed Camp David Middle East peace summit in July,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat launched an international
diplomacy to seek support for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Barak also sent his several cabinet ministers, including acting
Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Regional Cooperation Minister
Shimon Peres, to visit a large number of countries to counter
Arafat's efforts.

<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday underlined the importance
to enhance cooperation and coordination between the two countries
in a bid to advance the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation initiated by Clinton, the two
leaders reviewed the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on the ongoing contacts and consultations
by all concerned parties on ways of narrowing gaps between the
Palestinians and Israelis, and the future steps in the peace
process, it said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has been engaged in an intensive string of meetings with
the parties to the Arab-Israeli peace talks since last month's
Palestinian-Israeli Camp David summit failed to produce a final
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Clinton agreed on the need to exert joint efforts to
help remove the obstacles standing in the way of realizing a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the major sponsor of the Mideast peace
process, while Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with
Israel, plays a key role in mediating the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Mubarak received a call from United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan, during which they discussed the peace
process between the Palestinians and Israelis, and other regional
issues.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Condoles Xinhua Victims in Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAMA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Air authority on Friday
extended condolences to a delegation of China's Xinhua News Agency
on the death of three Xinhua staff members in the plane crash two
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air Vice President Walter Wan West expressed regret while
meeting in the Gulf Hotel with the five Xinhua representatives,
three of whom lost their wives in the air disaster. The delegation
arrived here Thursday from Cairo aboard a special flight arranged
by the airline to carry relatives of the victims of the tragic
accident.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A320 of GF072 from Cairo to Bahrain ditched into the
Gulf off Bahrain's international airport after two unsuccessful
attempts to land Wednesday night, killing all the 135 passengers
and eight crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The three Xinhua women staff, who were on their way to Beijing
after visiting their husbands, were among the victims. West
exchanged views with the Xinhua delegation over the handling of
post-accident affairs, promising the airline will provide every
possible help to the bereaved families.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, head of Xinhua's Mideast Regional Bureau Ge Xiangwen
expressed thanks to the airline for its measures to search and
rescue possible survivors since the tragedy took place.
</P>
<P>
David Jump, a counselor to Bahraini interior minister, and
Chinese charge D'affaires to Bahrain Li Conglu were present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
As to what caused the plane crash, West said that an committee
consisted of experts from Airbus Industrie, Gulf Air, Bahraini
Civil Aviation Authority, and the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board will kick off investigations Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The probe will be under personal direction of Bahraini Crown
Prince Salman ibn Hamad in order to speed up the process, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the pilot, a father of three, was experienced and
responsible, while referring to media reports that human errors
were behind the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all sayings are speculative until an official
conclusion is announced by the investigation team. The black boxes
of the plane -- flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- have
been recovered and will be sent to Europe or America for
examination and interpretation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader: Hostages' Safety Still Primary Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The safety of the remaining
hostages kept by the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu remains the government's
top priority,Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Friday in
Zamboanga City in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement of the Presidential Palace, the
president pointed out that it is because of this concern that the
government has not used the full force of the law to effect the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"If only we are after violence, on the first day we would have
attacked the kidnappers. But because we are after the safety of
the hostages, it is taking us a long time to work for their
release," the president said.
</P>
<P>
And because of this, Estrada added, he cannot guarantee that
the hostages would be released on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the arrest of the alleged Abu Sayyaf
associates with 240,000 U.S. dollars in ransom money Thursday
would not hamper ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were arrested by elements of the Presidential
Anti-organized Crime Task Force while trying to exchange the money
into Philippine pesos at the Zamboanga City branch of the Land
Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made it clear that the government maintains a no-ransom
policy and that the money did not come from the Philippine
government.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the Abu Sayyaf promised last week to
release the hostages, but the group reneged on its promise.The
rebel group is still holding nearly 30 hostages, including 12
Westerners.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Faces Shortage of Cancer Treatment Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- There is excessive pressure on
Vietnam's cancer treatment system, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has between 100,000 and 150,000 new cancer patients
each year, but runs only two specialized hospitals using obsolete
equipment, VNA quoted Nguyen Ba Duc, director of Hospital K, a
Hanoi-based institution specializing in cancer treatment, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Duc made the remarks at an international workshop here from
August 23 to 25, which attracted 20 professors and doctors from
the United States, Singapore, Australia and China and nearly 450
of their colleagues in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Duc further reported that between 50,000 and 70,000 Vietnamese
people die of cancer every year.
</P>
<P>
At present, Duc noted, provincial hospitals could barely cope
with cancers due to a dire shortage of special equipment and
experienced doctors.
</P>
<P>
But some progress has been reported in the field. An increasing
number of patients have easy access to diagnosis and have been
successfully treated.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999-2000 period, the Vietnamese government invested 70
billion Vietnamese dong (5.7 million U.S. dollars) in upgrading
the country's four major cancer treatment centers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate to Look Into Bugging Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Two lawmakers Friday urged the
Philippine Senate to investigate allegations that the former chief
of the Presidential Security Group (PSG), General Jose Calimlim,
has installed bugging devices in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople and Senator Robert
Barbers said the allegations made by Major Thomas Dumpit merit an
investigation given its serious implications on the presidency and
national security.
</P>
<P>
Dumpit said in a letter that he knew about the installation of
these bugging devices in the Presidential Palace whose recordings
end up in the camp of the opposition party Lakas.
</P>
<P>
"It is no wonder that everything that happens in the Palace
finds its place in the newspapers," Dumpit said in the letter
which was published by the newspaper Philippine Daily Inquirer on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ople said Dumpit would have to corroborate his charges before a
formal inquiry or suffer administrative and possibly even criminal
charges for maligning his superior officer.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Barbers dismissed reports that the
opposition Lakas party officials and those close to former
President Fidel Ramos are responsible for the said bugging devices.
</P>
<P>
"Why is Lakas always being blamed? This is beyond comprehension.
There's absence of concrete proof and there isn't enough evidence
to conclude that Lakas has something to do with it," Barbers said.
</P>
<P>
The two senators said the senate, through its appropriate
committees,would invite Dumpit to shed light on his accusations
and produce the evidence he claims to have.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Calimlim said Friday in a statement that he did
not order any bugging on the telephone of President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said the allegation of bugging the office of the
president is a concoction by detractors waging a vilification
campaign to put him out of the contention for the office of the
chief of staff.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Construction Industry to Remain in Doldrums: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore minister has
acknowledged that his country's construction industry will remain
in doldrums until the end of 2001 as local constructors would
inevitably be affected by a fall in construction demand.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan said in
the parliament Friday that construction demand could move into
positive value-added growth toward the end of 2001 provided that
the good performance of the economy is maintained over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that construction demand in Singapore, measured
in contract value, has dropped from its peak of 23.5 billion
Singapore dollars (13.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 11.7
billion Singapore dollars (6.9 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Building and Construction Authority has forecast that
construction demand would rise to 17.3 billion Singapore dollars (
10.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 2000, he said, noting that the
increase would come mainly from the two government reclamation
projects while the volume of building works is expected to remain
stagnant.
</P>
<P>
Mah said the government has been looking at ways to advance
some of the infrastructure and institutional projects, especially
public sector projects, so as to boost construction demand.
</P>
<P>
But the total value of projects still fell in 1999 despite the
fact that the number of projects awarded by the public sector rose
by 25 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"As construction projects would need a few years to complete,
any action taken now will not lead to immediate results," he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Breaches Support Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso breached the
45-pesos support level against the U.S. dollar on Friday, dragged
by a weak Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed lower at 45.04 to the U.S. dollar, compared
with its previous close of 44.98.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, on the other hand, closed 92.5 lower at 8,342.5
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Friday's close was the peso's lowest level against the
greenback since the currency settled at 45.07 on July 26.
</P>
<P>
Total volume at the Philippine Dealing System amounted to a
measly 46 million dollars, against 83 million dollars in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the peso just followed the Indonesian rupiah
Friday as there was no fresh news in the local market.
</P>
<P>
The peso has been trading near the psychological support level
of 45 against the dollar in recent days on lingering worries over
the widening budget deficit, lackluster economic prospects and the
unresolved hostage crisis in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government reported a deficit of 59.7 billion
pesos(1.49 billion dollars) for the January-to-July period,
against the full-year target of 62.5 billion pesos (1.56 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Currently, the government is still negotiating for the release
of some 28 hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf group in Jolo, Sulu,
while peace talks with the bigger secessionist group Moro Islamic
Liberation Front have been suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank of the Philippines said it will not
touch its borrowing and lending rates in a meeting next week, as
the peso fluctuation was simply hinged on the movements of other
Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura said the peso will be
gaining ground against the U.S. dollar in the third or fourth
quarter with the expected dollar inflow from overseas remittances.

NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Concerted Efforts Bear Fruit for Somali Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
ARTA, Djibouti, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Somali transitional
parliament Saturday elected former interior minister Abdiqasim
Salad Hassan as its first head of state in almost a decade,
marking a great success of the Somali Peace Conference being held
in Arta, Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The eight-hour-odd long presidential election, which followed
the selection of the country's speaker of the parliament by
representatives of Somali clans six days ago, will definitely pave
the way to put an end of insecurity of the nation that has been
living in chaos and violence without central government since the
downfall of the Siyad Barre regime in 1991 and give an impetus to
the long-waited national reconciliation in the Horn of Africa
country.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the success of the Somali Peace Conference,
which brings about fruitful results one after another, firstly lie
in the sustained efforts being made by the world society in
solving Somali problems.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the current Somali Peace Conference which began here
on May 2, the past decade witnessed at least 12 international
peace conferences that focused on political settlement of civil
war in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being discouraged by the successive failure of the
previous meetings, the world society has been drawing lessons from
the past and making its unremitting efforts to push forward the
Somali peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that Djibouti sponsored the first Somali
Peace Conference in 1991. The fact that it is again hosting the
Somali peace meeting after a nine-year suspension is exactly an
example of such efforts.
</P>
<P>
Scientific practice shows that external causes will play no
role in the changes of natural world unless they combine with the
internal ones. The success or failure of the Somali peace process
will by no means depart from this natural law.
</P>
<P>
Nobody is able to stop the Somalis from fighting each other
unless they themselves are willing to do so, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Somali Peace Conference began, faction and elder
clan leaders, and representatives from industrial, commercial and
cultural sectors held discussions on how to eliminate
contradictions existing among various clans for many years. Under
the direct mediation by Djibouti President Ismael Omar Gulleh,
they finally reached a consensus with the participants to the
peace conference on a number of issues ranging from the end of
civil war, the establishment of central government to the
realization of country's unification and the resumption of state
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
This really created favorable conditions for the successful
peace conference.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Somali people, prompted by their eagerness for
peace and a democratic central government, are apparently choosing
a way to national reconciliation by their own.
</P>
<P>
It is under such circumstances, namely the sustained
international mediation plus Somali people's willingness for peace,
that have made the great success of the on-going Somali Peace
Conference possible.
</P>
<P>
Being a turning point of the country's peace process, the
launch of the Somali Peace Conference is yet to say everything is
just fine.
</P>
<P>
Of all the difficulties for the democratically elected state
authority, the protruding one is that the new leaders of Somalia
will have to face sooner or later the challenges from warlords
scattered in the various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
To this point, Speaker of the Somali transitional parliament
Abdulla Dero Issak looked quite confident. He indicated that "no
war will continue in Somalia because 99 percent of the Somali
population will come to us."

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, Italy Beat Opponents in Grand Prix Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Italy defeated
here Friday their respective opponents for a higher consolation
finish but the pure thrilling action has yet to come Saturday when
the top four teams meet in the cross-over semi-finals of the World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix 2000.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans leaned anew on their famed solid defense and
power in sweeping the uninspired Americans, 25-23, 25-23, 25-19,
to clinch fifth place while the Italians recovered from opening
set loss to beat Japan, 19-25, 25-21, 25-11, 25-19 for seventh
place.
</P>
<P>
Top spiker Ku Min-jung spearheaded anew the Koreans with 18
points, including 17 on attack, while the Italians were led by
Francesa Piccinni, Elisa Togut and Darina Mifkova who scored 14
points apiece.
</P>
<P>
With their fifth-place finish, the South Koreans pocketed a
consolation prize of 30,000 dollars, while the Americans took home
the sixth-placer's 25,000 dollars consolation prize. Both South
Korea and the United States finished with identical 5-6 win-loss
card.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, who suffered a huge slump from their fourth-place

finish last year after winning only twice, all of them against
Japan, in 11 matches, received a 20,000-dollar cash award.
</P>
<P>
Despite finishing dead last with no single win in 11 matches,
the Japanese brought home a consolation prize of 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the third preliminary round that saw Russia, Brazil,
Italy and South Korea displaying their world-class winning form,
the Filipino fans get another chance to see more powerhouse
countries in volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Joining defending champion Russia and Brazil in the semis are
another two teams from the China leg, which are the top semi-
finalists and undefeated Cuba and China.

BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgian cycling star Tom Steels
Friday said he would not take part in the Sydney Games due to
illness.
</P>
<P>
After suffering a viral infection, Steels came down with a
sudden high fever last week. A blood analysis showed it will take
over a month before the sprinter, who won two stages in the Tour
de France, will be back to full fitness.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "in such circumstances, it is no use to keep
dreaming of the Games. I have to be in top shape to achieve
anything out there, and there is no way I can do that."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Belgium already lost Johan Museeuw, its top
cycling star, after he broke his leg and collarbone in a
motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
Over the summer, the talented but mercurial Frank Vandenbroucke

<HEADLINE> Ferreira Vows to Do Best in U.S. Open and Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African tennis player
Wayne Ferreira said on Friday that he is confident he can do well
at next week's U.S. Open tennis championship and the ensuing
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, who has been back recently in the top 20 for the
first time over the past three years, was last ranked 20 on May 26
1997 but injury and a lack of motivation saw him tumble out of the
top 50.
</P>
<P>
However, the new and invigorated Ferreira has reached the
fourth round of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a really good summer in the U.S. and I've had a lot
of fun," said Ferreira in a telephone interview call from
California, the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I've been feeling good about my game again and I think I can
do well at both the U.S. Open and the Olympics," the tennis player
said.
</P>
<P>
While Ferreira wants to do well at the U.S. Open, he also has
his heart set on winning a medal at the Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"In some ways the Olympics is even bigger for me than any Grand
Slam. I don't get too many chances to play for my country and it
is certainly an honour for me to be playing in my third Olympics,"
Ferreira said.
</P>
<P>
At the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, Ferreira won silver in the
doubles with Pietie Norval and in Atlanta lost to American Agassi.
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta was disappointing but hopefully I will do better this
time. I've always had a good time in Australia and I think Sydney
is a great venue," he said.

ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Olympic organisers in Athens face
a race against time to ensure preparations for the 2004 Games are
completed, the head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
co-ordinating commissions, Jacques Rogge, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two months after the introduction of a new leadership team to
head the Athens Olympic Games Organizing Committee (ATHOC), Rogge
said that progress had been made, but there was still a mountain
to climb.
</P>
<P>
"Time is critical," said Rogge. "This concern is obviously
shared by all parties. We have been assured deadlines will be
respected and even brought forward where necessary. ATHOC is now
on track, but the clock is ticking."
</P>
<P>
The IOC said in a statement Friday that time constraints
concerning long-haul projects like infrastructure, transport,
construction and technology were now the concern of the ATHOC and
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the full IOC co-ordinating commission would
return to Athens on November 22-24 to review the lessons learned
from the Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> SEZs: China's modernization Pacemakers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- With the approaching of the 20th
anniversary of China's four earliest special economic zones (SEZs)
on August 26, the cities of Shenzhen, Xiamen, Zhuhai and Shantou,
and Hainan Province have all mapped out development blueprints for
the new century.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Gaoli, secretary of the Communist Party of China's
Shenzhen committee, said that the goal of Shenzhen is to basically
realize modernization by 2005 and reach the level of moderately
developed countries by 2010 and that of developed countries in
2030.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's counterpart in Xiamen, Hong Yongshi, pledged that his
city would make progress in modernization with indexes regarding
the economy, science and technology, and social development
meeting or closing to the requirements of modernization in five
years.
</P>
<P>
In Zhuhai, officials vowed to realize modernization in 2007
while their colleagues in Shantou promised to build the city into
a modernized port city in the world by 2008.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Province, the largest of China's SEZs set up 12 years
ago, has a new ambitious plan to streamline its agriculture,
marine economy and tourism while promoting urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that by setting the goals for modernization,
the SEZs are still leading other parts of the country in
development as they were 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, local authorities in Shenzhen, encouraged and
supported by senior Chinese leaders including Deng Xiaoping, were
determined to blaze a trail for China's reform and opening-up
drive.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has then become a window of the country to the outside
world and a platform for reform measures, along with Xiamen,
Zhuhai and Shantou.
</P>
<P>
To ensure successful reform and opening-up in the SEZs, China
introduced a wide range of special preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market
managed to stay on the positive territory this week, although it
almost wiped off all its gains on a nose-dive on Wednesday in the
wake of a round of usual profit-taking activities.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen B-share index inched up 0.32 points or 0.25
percent to 126.49 at the end of the week, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover increased sharply to 1.85 billion Hong
Kong dollars, which was 1.17 billion Hong Kong dollars or 169.62
percent more than the total of last week, hitting a one-week
record high since December of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Providing the trigger for the market's reversal were rumors
that China's A and B shares won't merge, later denied as
misinterpreted remarks from State Development and Planning
Minister Zeng Peiyan.
</P>
<P>
The later sessions in the week were subject to choppy,
directionless trading, with the index stuck to lows, as investors
continued to be hesitant to commit. Bargain hunters did not pull
the market out of the red, and any buying move lacked conviction.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that a lackluster week will have
grip on the market with trading on the lighter side and investors
on the sidelines in a cautious mood. Poor corporate outlook is
enough to keep the index from picking up steam for a period.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B-Share Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market was
plagued with extremely choppy trading this week, after the market'
s attempt to advance had fizzled as the buying continued to lack
conviction, while the selling resumed its vigor and rumor stories.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai B-share index tumbled 5.46 points or 11.71 percent
to 72.77 at the end of the week, posting its largest weekly
decline in one month, according to Homeway, China's leading
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover extended to 433.98 million U.S. dollars,
which was 179.13 million U.S. dollars or 70.29 percent more than
the total of last week.
</P>
<P>
After starting the week on a dynamic note, the market reversed
courses in a very abrupt fashion. The sudden meltdown of the
market was considered being triggered by rumors that China's A and
B shares won't merge, later denied as misinterpreted remarks from
the State Development and Planning Minister Zeng Peiyan.
</P>
<P>
Given that rumors had been cleared, the market started trimming
its heavy losses as bargain hunters came to the rescue. However,
investors' sentiment became fragile and confidence seemed not very
easy to be restored, so that the market failed to materialize a
recovery, leaving the index stuck around its lows.
</P>
<P>
And the key point, analysts say, lies in that the recent gains
hardly match the performance of Chinese companies. State media
reported in July that more than 100 Chinese companies -- almost
one out of every ten publicly traded firms-- will report first-
half losses.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predict that it is likely to be a pretty
volatile week ahead as the market will be traded with little
direction. It sill takes time for the aggressive nature to prevail
again.

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP Grows 10.3 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Gross Domestic Product (
GDP) of Hong Kong attained a double-digit growth, at 10.8 percent
in real terms in the second quarter of 2000 over a year earlier,
after a 14.3 percent growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate in real terms of GDP for 2000 is
raised from 6 percent in the earlier forecast to 8.5 percent,
according to the Half-yearly Economic Report 2000 released by the
Hong Kong government Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of goods had double-digit growth for three
consecutive quarters, rising by 17.7 percent in real terms in the
second quarter of 2000 over a year earlier. This was underpinned
by strong global and regional demand and improved price
competitiveness of Hong Kong's exports.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending attained a further appreciable year-on-year
growth of 5.2 percent in real terms, in tandem with increased
overall income and sustained improvement in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The labor market generally improved further. The seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate fell distinctly, from 5.6 percent in
the first quarter of 2000 to 5.0 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the government predicted that exports of goods
and services should gain further support from the intense demand
across virtually all the major markets, including the United
States, Europe, China's mainland, and the rest of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Apart from re-exports, offshore trading, inbound tourism and
business services are expected to be the major growth lines.
</P>
<P>
In the domestic sector, a firmer consumer sentiment amidst the
improved labor market conditions should continue to uphold
consumer spending. Also, a better business outlook coupled with
the desire to upgrade productive efficiency and quality should
continue to spur investment spending.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Reporters to Be Allowed to Visit Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council will authorize its subordinate office in southwest
China's Chongqing Municipality to handle the application from
Taiwan media for interviews in the city as of September 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1997, the Taiwan Affairs Office granted related
offices of 12 provinces and cities to handle interview application
from Taiwan press.
</P>
<P>
Journalistic visits are the major component of press exchanges
across the Taiwan Straits. The mainland has always encouraged such
exchanges. The Taiwan Affairs Office issued special regulations
concerning Taiwan reporters' visits to the mainland in 1996 that
further simplified procedures.
</P>
<P>
In practice and especially in case of an emergency, related
departments do their utmost to provide convenience for Taiwan
reporters, with some applications approved on the same day.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 5,000 Taiwan reporters have visited the
mainland in recent years, while only some 200 mainland reporters
have been to Taiwan. None of the mainland media has been able to
send reporters to the island due to obstacles by the Taiwan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The mainland press expect the Taiwan authorities to take
immediate steps to show their sincerity in promoting press
exchanges of the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Largest Copyright Dispute in China Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A copyright dispute involving 29
famous contemporary writers was settled today in the Beijing First
Intermediate People's Court, with the writers winning the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest copyright dispute in China since 1949 in
terms of the number of writers involved.
</P>
<P>
The 29 writers, including Ba Jin and Wang Meng, made a lawsuit
to the court around June, accusing the Jilin Photo Publishing
House and the Beijing Xinhua Book Co. Ltd of infringing copyright
by illegally publishing and distributing a book series titled "
Classical Essays by Famous Chinese Writers in the Twenty Century".
</P>
<P>
The book series include essays by these writers, and the
publisher neither sought permission from the writers nor
remunerated them.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the writers appealed to the court for stopping the
distribution of the book series and asked the Jinlin Province-
based publisher to pay 99,000 yuan for infringing copyright and 10,
000 yuan in compensation to each writer.
</P>
<P>
After legal proceedings, the court handed down its verdict,
ordering the publisher to pay 23,760 yuan to each of the 29
writers for copyright infringement, and to stop distributing the
book series immediately while publishing written apologies in
newspapers.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Launches Website on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
launched a new website, www.freeconomy.org, Friday in an effort to
promote Hong Kong's image as one of the freest economies in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Hong Kong and the Pursuit of Economic Freedom," the
website provides comprehensive information including Hong Kong's
economic policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
"Economic freedom is, above all, about openness, transparency,
freedom of speech and the free and unfettered flow of information
at all levels -- government, business, politics," said Donald
Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was ranked as the world's freest economy by the
Fraser Institute, the Hong Kong Center for Economic Research and
the Cato Institute in January this year, and by the Heritage
Foundation in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The website encapsulates the government's commitment to
transparency, open government and economic freedom, he said.
</P>
<P>
It has taken six months to develop the website through the
joint efforts of the Information Services Department of Hong Kong
and a team led by David Dodwell, co-author of the "Hong Kong
Advantage" study published in 1997 which examined the competitive
strengths and weaknesses of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
The site is in both English and Chinese and has an audio
version for the sight-impaired. It will in due course be available
in French, German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that academics, economists, officials of other
governments, researchers for think-tanks and financial
organizations, and anyone interested in economic matters will find
this a valuable, thought-provoking resource," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Dispute Settled in China's Tianjin Municipality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Six overseas management
personnel who were surrounded by joint-venture workers in a labor
dispute in north China's Tianjin safely left their company today.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in the Tianjin Meite Packaging Company,
a Hong Kong Meite Co. and the Tianjin Wanhua Co. joint-venture.
</P>
<P>
In March, the company merged with Meite Packaging becoming a
totally overseas-funded company. The company planned to continue
to employ 150 workers, but 71 of whom were disgruntled with the
new labor contracts because they did not specify the terms of
their employment.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the workers refused to sign the contracts and asked
to go back to Wanhua, which rejected their demand.
</P>
<P>
On the morning August 22, the 71 workers went to Meite hoping
to hold talks with the overseas boss, who refused to do so and had
a bulletin posted announcing the termination of labor contracts
with the workers.
</P>
<P>
Then, the workers stopped six overseas management personnel
from leaving the company, including an American, a Malaysian and
four from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Local police rushed to the site soon after the incident took
place and separated the workers from the management personnel,
while local government was immediately involved in mediating.
</P>
<P>
By 11 o'clock Thursday, an agreement was reached. Meite
revoking its contract termination announcement and gave
compensation to workers while Wanhua agreed to accept the workers.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were satisfied with the settlement, and the workers
left the company early this morning.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Warns Against Overheating of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said Friday that Hong Kong would not see double-digit
growth in the third quarter or fourth quarter this year as in the
first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
"I must warn everybody that this figure is not repeatable and
it is not likely that we are going to have double-digit growth in
the third quarter or fourth quarter," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following the earlier release of the Half-
Yearly Economic Report 2000 by the Hong Kong government, which
reported a 10.8-percent economic growth in the second quarter of
2000 over a year earlier, after a 14.3-percent growth in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate in real terms of the GDP for 2000 is
raised from 6 percent in the earlier forecast to 8.5 percent,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Further double-digit growth would not be desirable and would
perhaps overheat the economy, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"We must remember that we are a fairly mature and developed
economy, and our per capita GDP is among the highest in the world,
so it would not be good for ourselves in the long run for the
economy to grow at double digit," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, set against the past recession and the contraction of
the GDP in 1998, the robust growth is certainly a very stimulating
experience, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Predicts Moderate Medium-Term Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang on Friday expressed optimism about Hong
Kong's economic performance in the rest of the year, but predicted
that the growth rate would slow down in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in CNBC Asia's "The Asian Wall Street Journal," Tsang
noted that Hong Kong's economy, with a per capita GDP approaching
25,000 U.S. dollars, is an industrialized economy, and so, "it is
unreal to maintain a double-digit growth."
</P>
<P>
"And indeed, I think this would be undesirable if we had that
and we would be overheating the economy," he said, predicting that
the trend growth rate, in the medium term, would slow down to stay
at something between 4 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics released on Friday, the real-
term growth of Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP) reached 10.
8 percent in the second quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
So after these heights of 10.8 percent and 14.3 percent in the
first two quarters, "I do believe the economy will moderate to a
more decent growth rate," Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
But for the year 2000 as a whole, Tsang said he believed the
year would be a quite brilliant year. "We have forecast it to grow
by 8.5 percent, but after this, I think it will gradually work
down to 4 to 5 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to what are the driving factors behind the strong GDP growth,
Tsang listed some external factors, including a stable U.S. market,
a recovering Japanese economy and a powerfully growing mainland of
China.
</P>
<P>
And in Hong Kong, he said, the main driving force is trade,
both visible and invisible.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism, financial services are surging ahead, and on top of
that there is a very healthy inflow of capital in Hong Kong,
spurring new levels of investment, and domestic consumption has
been rising very satisfactorily," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So these are all the underlying elements producing quite a
brilliant performance in the year 2000." he said.

a nationwide crack-down, in June, on illegal activities in the
business.
</P>
<P>
The blitz has gained support from the media and public, said
Liu Shengli, a Ministry of Culture official in charge of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, investigations and inspections have
been carried out by local departments concerned, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, he confessed that lots of game parlors are operating
without legal documents, while some of them continued to accept
under-age customers.
</P>
<P>
And some people are running illegal video-game parlors under
the disguise of Internet cafes or computer training schools, he
said, noting that some owners are moving their business to
suburban and rural areas or are engaged in underground operations.
</P>
<P>
Liu announced that the government will stop issuing licenses to
new video-game parlors, close down those which have been engaged
in illegal activities, and severely punish law offenders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, manufacturing and sale of game machines for the
domestic market will be banned, he said.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team will be sent to check the results of the
campaign nationwide by October.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, China has nearly 60,000
registered video-game parlors.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest More to Treat Wastewater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China will invest about 40
billion yuan (4.8 billion U.S. dollar) each year in the next 10
years to make sure at least 70 percent of wastewater in major
cities and 60 percent in ordinary cities is treated before
discharge by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to purchase and build more urban
wastewater treatment facilities, according to a new pollution
control policy jointly issued by the State Environmental
Protection Administration, the Ministry of Construction and the
Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The policy requires that at least 50 percent of the wastewater
in urban areas across the country should be treated before
discharge by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China built 176 wastewater treatment plants between 1980 and
1995, enabling the country to treat 20 percent of the wastewater
produced in cities.
</P>
<P>
Construction of urban wastewater treatment facilities has been
stepped up since 1995 and up to the end of 1998, 266 wastewater
treatment plants were operating, with a total daily capacity of 11
million tons. Currently, another 203 facilities are under
construction.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policy, investors from both at home and
abroad are welcome to build such facilities in cities and villages
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Lashes Out At Taiwan Leader's Trip Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency,
Xinhua, lashed out at the leader of Taiwan authorities for his
visit to foreign countries, saying that money can't buy
international justice.
</P>
<P>
A commentary from Xinhua said only three months after his
taking office, the Taiwan leader followed the "money diplomacy"
pursued by his predecessor Lee Teng-hui, and went abroad with
cheques.
</P>
<P>
The international justice, which Lee has failed to buy with big
money, will not fall in the hands of the present leader of Taiwan,
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taiwan leader has been in office, Taiwan has
witnessed political, economic and social chaos.
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying his best to sort out the domestic mess, the
Taiwan leader embarked on a cross-continent trip abroad, which
stunned the public of Taiwan, and exposed his true colors of
intending to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan" in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the Taiwan leader has refused to
recognized the one-China principle, played the game of words on
the cross-Straits relations and vigorously promoting his splittism
to the rest of the world, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan leader slapped his own face by offering the money of
Taiwan tax-payers to his foreign hosts, though he had time and
again promised never to engage in the so-called "money diplomacy"
of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
It has been a fact that there is only one China in the world,
and the one-China principle has been widely recognized throughout
the international community, it said.
</P>
<P>
No matter what the tricks are and how much money they are going
to spend on the "money diplomacy," the one-China principle will
not be altered.
</P>
<P>
It will only bring disgrace to himself if the leader of Taiwan
continues to pursue the path of Lee Teng-hui and tries to
challenge the one-China principle, the commentary said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China'
s top legislature, said today that legislation on social security
must conform to the fundamental interests of the great masses.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark while presiding over a lecture on China's
Social Security system, which is the 16th in a series of lectures
on law sponsored by the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
As the establishment and perfection of the social security
system has great impact on China's reform, development and
stability, great attention should be attached to the work, Li
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called on China's lawmakers to summarize the country's
successful experiences on social security policies over the past
years, and at the same time, gain legislative experience on the
aspect from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li disclosed that the formation of the Law on Social Security
is already at the top of the present NPC Standing Committee's
agenda, and concerned departments should work harder so as to
submit the draft to the top legislature for deliberation as soon
as possible.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Meets Delegation From Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
met here today with a delegation from the United Daily News Group
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he was optimistic about the prospects of the
development of the cross-Straits relations, which have witnessed
expanded exchanges and cooperation in economic, cultural and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
However, there also exists some political hurdles between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits, said Qian, also a member of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
The major problem is that the leader of the Taiwan authorities
still refuses to consider himself a Chinese, evades the one-China
principle and plays word games resulting in the stalemate of cross-
Straits dialogues and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Qian told the visitors "Taiwan independence" will never be
accepted by the international community and the Chinese people,
including the majority of Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The earlier realization of direct trade, postal, air and
shipping services between the mainland and Taiwan is the ardent
wish of the people on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite Taiwan's promise of realizing the goal within the
year, there has been no concrete action to date. The major problem
that impedes the direct services lies on the side of Taiwan, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian also spoke highly of the media's role
in enhancing mutual understanding of people on both sides of the
Straits.
</P>
<P>
The seven member delegation is on a 10-day visit to the
mainland as guests of the Xinhua News Agency.

According to officials, the expansion of reform in the SEZs
will focus on systematic innovations, including adjustments in the
ownership structure, and transformation of functions of government
departments in accordance with international common practices.
</P>
<P>
The government should also simplify procedures to make it
easier to get businesses up and running and give a bigger role to
the market, while improving services, experts say.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, efforts must be made to improve the social
security system and the financing system, and have intermediary
organs operating according to standards.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming 50 years will be an important historical period
in China's drive to realize modernization and make the Chinese
nation's long-cherished dream of building a powerful China come
true.
</P>
<P>
Experts are confident that Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen,
and Hainan will set the pace in China's drive toward modernization.

<HEADLINE> SEZs: China's modernization Pacemakers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the opening-up drive swept other parts of the country, the
preferential policies were applied to more regions. The saying
that special economic zones are no longer special prevails in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the SEZs have not lost their vitality. And observers
say that the SEZs still shoulder a historical mission today.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the SEZs have been focusing on improving the
overall economic quality and on developing high-tech industries
and other economies with special features.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other parts of China, the SEZs still hold an edge
in utilizing domestic and overseas resources and markets and in
adapting themselves to international common practices to boost
economic development.
</P>
<P>
While fully expanding economic cooperation with multinationals,
Shenzhen is tightening ties with Hong Kong, and Xiamen and Hainan
with Taiwan. In Shantou, efforts have been made to attract
overseas Chinese, one of the major channels of overseas investment
to the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that improving overall economic performance is a
necessary choice for the SEZs as China will face fiercer
competition after its entry into the World Trade Organization. It
is the only way for them to realize modernization.
</P>
<P>
To hit the goal, analysts say, the SEZs should give national
treatment to overseas investors for more funding while making
efforts to open up overseas markets for their own companies
products.
</P>
<P>
By changing the past practice of offering preferential policies
to overseas investors in certain fields, the SEZs have lifted all
restrictions for them.

MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The launch of an RS-20 rocket
that is to put five foreign satellites into orbit has been delayed
by one day until 2 p.m. Moscow time (1000 GMT) Saturday, the
Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rocket was scheduled to blast off from Kazakhstan's

Specialists do not think the problems are significant, the

</P>
<P>
The satellites include two from Italy, two from Saudi Arabia
and one from Malaysia. The launch will represent a space debut for
the Saudis and the Malaysians, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian satellites will be used for environmental
monitoring, and data transmission for commercial purposes as well
as education and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The two Saudi satellites, from the Saudi Arabian Space Research
Institute, are also designed for educational and scientific
purposes.

MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Latvia has asked a number of
foreign countries for assistance in investigating two blasts that
rocked a shopping center in central Riga earlier this month, the
Interfax news agency reported Friday.

<HEADLINE> Rabobank Publishes Guidelines on Funding GMO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Rabobank, the world's biggest
lending bank to agriculture, published guidelines on Friday for
funding genetically modified organisms (GMO).
</P>
<P>
The Dutch bank group said in a statement that though it would
provide financing for the genetic modification of crops, the
technology of genetic modification should not be used if better
alternatives are available.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which lent out 30 billion euros (27 billion U.S.
dollars) last year, said it would not be involved in providing
funds for the genetic modification of human life.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of animals, the Rabobank group applies the 'No,
unless' principle," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank group claimed that it was the first financial
institution to have written out a code of conduct on genetic
modification.
</P>
<P>
It said the code of conduct would provide global guidance for
funding decisions within the bank group, but it is open to changes
since scientific and ethical dimensions are still developing.
</P>
<P>
The group will focus on projects which help preserve the
environment and human and animal health, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Rabobank estimated that its market share accounts for no more
than one to 2 percent of the world's 7 trillion dollar
agricultural market.
</P>
<P>
Genetic modification via implanting foreign genes is used in
agriculture to make crops resistant to insects or herbicides.
</P>
<P>
However, European environmentalists and consumer groups have
been protesting the marketing of genetically modified crops such
as maize and soybeans, claiming that potential dangers lurk in the
technology.
</P>
<P>
The discovery earlier this year that farmers in several
European Union (EU) countries had unknowingly planted genetically
modified rapeseed imported from Canada triggered a huge protest.
</P>
<P>
The EU has imposed a moratorium on licensing new genetically
modified crops, while EU food producers are requested to label
their products as containing genetically modified organisms unless
they can guarantee that the ingredients contain less than one
percent of genetically modified organisms.

<HEADLINE> Former French Minister Attacks Government Policy on Corsica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Former French Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua Friday severely attacked the plan of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin to give more administrative and fiscal autonomy to
Corsica.
</P>
<P>
In a written plan published on July 20, Jospin proposed giving
Corsica more autonomous power in government and a new tax statute.
</P>
<P>
Pasqua, who is now president of the Neo-Gaullist Rally for
France, said in a statement to the press that each time the
government adopts "a policy of pacification" toward Corsica, a "
minority of fascists and racists" on the island will show up and
acts of violence increase.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized President Jacques Chirac for keeping silent
about the plan, which is also called "Matignon process" in
reference to the office building of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed that half of the French population support
Jospin's plan for Corsica, while the other half are opposed.
</P>
<P>
The political circles of France are also divided over the plan,
which will be discussed by the parliament in autumn.

<HEADLINE> Canada Geese Annoying Residents in Southern Ontario </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A population explosion in the
number of Canada geese is beginning to annoy the people of
southern Ontario. The big, noisy birds are reportedly invading
and taking over urban areas near the St. Lawrence River shoreline
and islands.
</P>
<P>
Most of the unwanted geese are coming from areas west of
Toronto, where the geese were introduced more than 20 years ago,
the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of geese has more than tripled in the past decade in
southern Ontario. There were 100,000 geese in 1990 and the number
reached 350,000 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
These southern "giant" geese have taken to farmland, golf
courses and lawns. They seem to like short-cut lawns, and have
become increasingly friendly and tame toward humans.
</P>
<P>
If you play golf at courses near the St. Lawrence River, you're
stepping around goose droppings all the time, according to local
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Every municipality in the Golden Horseshoe from Oshawa to
Niagara Falls in Ontario has become involved in some form of goose
control.
</P>
<P>
Authorities near the Pearson International and Toronto Island
airports have removed some geese and nests, while trying to
redesign the areas to be less attractive to them.
</P>
<P>
Other efforts include poking holes in eggs, rounding up adult
birds and shipping them out of town, and using shrubs and fences
to break up open areas where the geese feel secure.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Hail Result of Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Somali people in its
capital city of Mogadishu and many other cities and towns were
holding celebrations on Saturday to congratulate Abdiqasim Salad
Hassan on being newly elected first President of the state in
almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Ahmed Shakur, district commissioner of Bur Dhubo town,
told Xinhua how the people of the town still remained in the
streets, celebrating for the victory of Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of his people, Shakur has pledged full
support and congratulated for all of the Somalis wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
The people of Mogadishu who did not go to bed last night still
continue celebrating. The celebrations are also being held in many
other towns and regions such as Bay, Bakol, Gedo, Kismaio, Lower
Shabelle, Mudug, Galgudud.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the people have been so influenced by
politics of the country.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Mohamed Hussein Migwa working in a construction of a
building also told Xinhua how he is happy that at last Somalia can
now have a government. The porters, plumbers working under him
have likewise gathered together, chanting words supporting
President Hassan.
</P>
<P>
"We have been meaning to get a religious president for ages,"
said Ahmed Qalli, a watchman in Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
The-58-year-old Hassan was elected as Somali President early
Saturday morning after three rounds of presidential elections in
Arta, Djibouti, which lasted for more than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
Born in Dhusamareb district of Galgudud region, he had been a
long term minister in the former regime led by the late Siad Barre
which was overthrown in 1991. His last post in that regime was
the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, who himself looked tired, said a little after he was
officially declared the interim president of Somalia for the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his thanks for those voted for him and those who
didn't and also asked the people to forgive each other and prayed
for bringing a lasting peace and prosperity to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the faction leaders such as Hussein Mohamed Aidid
and Muse Sudi Yalahow have issued warnings against a possible
catastrophic fighting between what they called the Somalis and the
Djibouti established administration.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition of some of the faction leaders to this
administration, the people are jubilating and large scale of
fighting involved by the clannish militiamen of Mogadishu is less
likely.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the interim government will have its first
sitting place in Mogadishu, still Hassan is less likely to accept
any place other than Mogadishu where enjoys considerable support.

<HEADLINE> Angola Gains 6.5 Percent of Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola has seen an average 6.5
percent of annual economic growth rate in the past five years as
the government gradually transferred priority to economic
reconstruction in the war-torn country, an official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.
</P>
<P>
Jose Pedro de Morais was quoted on Thursday by the official
news agency Angop as saying at an economic seminar in the capital
Luanda that in 1993 the Angolan economy dropped by 25 percent due
to the civil war which erupted again in late 1992 soon after the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, however, the GDP recovered to the level of 1992, which
was estimated at some eight billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry has contributed a lot to the GDP expansion
with export income accounting for 83 percent of the GDP in 1999,
jumping from 70 percent of the GDP in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At present, the oil production in the second largest oil
producing country in Africa is estimated at 750,000 barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan National Bank (BNA), meanwhile, has been trying to
stabilize the financial situation by reducing money supply,
cutting the inflation rate from four digits in 1995 to three
digits in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Further drop in inflation to two digits is expected next year
after reforms was implemented with the liberalization of the
interest rates as well as the foreign exchange market, according
to the IMF official.
</P>
<P>
The Angola government has also been trying to attract foreign
investment in developing abundant oil, diamond and fisheries
resources.
</P>
<P>
As the security situation eased following the government forces
inflicted heavy losses on the UNITA rebels in a mass offensive
launched in late 1999, the Angolan government hoped to bring peace
and prosperity to the country ravaged by the 25-year civil war.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Geared up for Clinton Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 extra policemen have
been called to the Nigerian capital Abuja from the surrounding
states ahead of U.S. President Bill Clinton' s upcoming visit to
the west African country on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government is expected to ask Clinton to help
forgive the country's 31 billion U.S. dollars of external debt,
local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government had advised Nigerians against an "
exaggerated expectation" on Clinton' s visit, the second by an
American president after Jimmy Carter in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Susan Rice, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs, said earlier in Washington that Nigeria is not eligible
for the "Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative" on debt relief.
But she promised to help Nigeria reschedule its debt to make it "
manageable".

<HEADLINE> Mandela Criticizes West for Neglecting Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Africa is being neglected
by Western powers who should do more to prevent conflicts plaguing
the continent, former South African President Nelson Mandela said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South African Institute of International
Affairs at the University of the Witwatersrand, Mandela lambasted
the West's apparent unwillingness to become involved in Africa,
while readily going to the aid of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Citing Rwanda as an example, Mandela said observers had
frequently noted the failure of the West to intervene and end the
genocide in the central African nation.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone was another example of the West's neglect, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While Nato prepared itself for action in Kosovo, Sierra Leone
seemed a virtually forsaken place from an international
perspective," he said.
</P>
<P>
As atrocities were carried out in Sierra Leone, the weaponry
funding, communications and intelligence promised by Western
powers failed to materialize, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said ethnic tensions which ignited the genocide in
Rwanda continued to play a role in the conflicts in neighboring
Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We are not suggesting that these and other African conflicts
can be subjected to the same template of conflict resolution or
that the actions of Kosovo can simply be transplanted to the
conflicts on this continent," said the former president.
</P>
<P>
"We in Africa and Asia must, however, envy the readiness and
willingness on the part of the international community to
intervene and commit resources to the reconstruction of Kosovo
society," he said.

<P>
Zimbabwean liberation war veterans have occupied over 1,000
white-owned farms since February this year to demand the
government speed up land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1980 when the government embarked on the
resettlement program some 60,000 families have been resettled on 3.

<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone government on
Friday released 171 rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
fighters from various prisons of the country, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The release was announced by President Tejan Kabbah on Monday
as a peace gesture following the RUF chose its field commander
Issa Sesay to replace detained Foday Sankoh as the interim leader.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone government saw the change of leadership as a
signal that the RUF wanted to reopen talks with the government to
revive the Lome peace accord signed in July last year after the
abduction of about 500 UN peacekeepers by the RUF in May.
</P>
<P>
However, two Nigerian peacekeeping soldiers were seriously
wounded when the RUF rebels attacked their unit in the Port Loko
region on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> 12 Leaders Confirm to Witness Signing of Burundi Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Twelve heads of state and
government, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, have confirmed
to witness the signing of the Burundi peace agreement in northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete told a news conference that more
invited leaders were likely to make their confirmations over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders to participate in the signing ceremony are
presidents Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Benjamin
Mkapa of Tanzania, Bakili Muluzi of Malawi, Festus Mogae of
Botswana, Pierre Buyoua of Burundi, Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, Paul
Kagame of Rwanda, King Mswati of Swaziland and Lesotho Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said Libya, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium will be represented by senior government officials and
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim
Ahmed Salim as well as representatives from the United Nations,
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
European Union will also witness the historical event.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Clinton, who arrives in Tanzania on Monday
afternoon from Nigeria, will hold talks with Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a Burundi government delegation left
the capital Bujumbura Friday morning for Arusha while Burundi
peace facilitator Nelson Mandela is expected to arrive in Arusha
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Facilitator's representative Mark Bomani said that Mandela
would meet with the 19 Burundian delegations involved in the peace
talks in Arusha to try to reach a consensus on points of
disagreement in draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Mandela will make compromise proposal on the issues that have
not yet been resolved," he added .
</P>
<P>
The sticking points include who will lead Burundi's
transitional government and the implementation of a cease-fire in
a seven-year-old civil war between Hutu rebel groups and army and
government which are dominated by the Tutsi minority, which left
more than 200,000 people dead and a further 1.2 million displaced.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were initiated by former Tanzanian president
Julius Nyerere in June 1998 and have been beefed up by former
South African president Nelson Mandela since he succeeded Nyerere
as the facilitator in December 1999 following the latter's death
of leukemia.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Sets Four Foreign Journalists Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Liberia on Friday released four
foreign journalists arrested last week on charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in the capital Monrovia, Liberian
Justice Minister Eddington Varmah, who is also Attorney-General,
said that the decision was made "on humanitarian grounds"
following consultation with President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Liberia did not drop charges against the defendants "because of
lack of evidence or in reaction to pressure from any source",
Varmah said in a statement, adding that the action was "entirely
on humanitarian grounds" following apologies from both the
defendants and their employer were forwarded to the Liberian
government.
</P>
<P>
"They may continue to enjoy the warm hospitality and goodwill
of the Liberian people," said Varmah in a response to the movement
of the journalists after their release.
</P>
<P>
The four journalists, two Britons, a Sierra Leone and a South
African, were in Liberia to make a documentary for Britain's
Channel Four Television when they were arrested.

<HEADLINE> S. African Trade with U.S. to Be Boosted by New Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African business can
look forward to a massive boost in trade opportunities with the
United States with the imminent implementation of the Africa
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which will slash import duties,
the U.S. embassy said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, inadequate customs procedures certifying point of
origin for clothing and apparel could delay the eligibility of
duty-free status for South African textiles under AGOA, U.S.
economic affairs counselor to South Africa Bob Godec told
reporters in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
At present, only Mauritius had adequate controls in place over
point of origin, he said.
</P>
<P>
Godec said a wide range of African products would enjoy duty-
free status into the U.S. market -- provided the exporting
countries met certain conditions -- once the act came into effect
on October 1.
</P>
<P>
"AGOA presents remarkable new opportunities for African
business... because we are sincerely interested in the prosperity
of Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade concessions were expected to create about 66,000
jobs in South Africa's textile industry alone, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The act, which was signed into law by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on May 18 this year, extends the scope of duty-free status
currently in place in terms of the Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP).
</P>
<P>
The GSP gives designated African countries duty-free status on
about 4,600 products.
</P>
<P>
Godec said the act would extend this concession for a further
eight years.
</P>
<P>
AGOA adds up to 1,897 products to the list and allows clothing
and apparel made in eligible African countries, with either
African or U.S. fabrics, to be imported into the U.S. duty-free.
Currently, an average 17.5 percent tariff is levied on textiles
imported into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
It also gives sub-Sahara African countries improved access to U.
S. credit and technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
The act would also increase the "cap" on textile imports from
Africa from 1.5 percent of total U.S. clothing imports to 3.5
percent over eight years, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imported clothing and apparel worth about 60 billion U.
S. dollars each year, and the figure was expected to double over
the next eight years, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The act also removes quotas on textile imports by qualifying
countries.
</P>
<P>
Godec warned, however, that countries would only qualify for
the concession on clothing if its government had in place an
adequate "visa system".
</P>
<P>
This was essential to ensure the goods were not originally
imported for other regions.
</P>
<P>
"It would be to the advantage of South Africa to move fairly
quickly to put the visa system in place," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows 5.3 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 5.3 percent in the second quarter of this year,
slightly higher than the previous estimate of 5.2 percent, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross domestic product (GDP), the nation's
total output of goods and services, in the second quarter
surpassed the growth in the first quarter when the economy grew at
a 4.8 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
The government said the GDP growth was attributed to increases
in business investment and government spending that offset a
slowdown in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all
economic activities, rose at a 2.9 percent rate in the second
quarter, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 1997. In the
first quarter, consumer spending surged at a 7.6 percent rate, a
17-year high.
</P>
<P>
But business investment, including spending on computers and
other equipment, increased at an annual rate of 14.6 percent in
the second quarter. That compared with a 21 percent rate posted in
the first quarter. Businesses also increased their spending on
inventories, adding to second-quarter growth.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to growth was increased spending by the
federal government, which rose at a whopping annual rate of 16.9
percent in the second quarter. That compared with a 14.2 percent
rate of decrease in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, however, continued to be a drag on
growth. The bloated deficit subtracted 1.2 percentage points from
growth in the second quarter, compared to a reduction of 0.9
percentage points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
All the changes show the economy grew at an annual rate of 119.
7 billion U.S. dollars in the second quarter, pushing the country'
s total output of goods and services to 9.3 trillion dollars,
after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the GDP, and closely watched by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose at an unrevised
annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from a 3.5
percent rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times over
the last 14 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control. On Tuesday, the Fed decided to leave interest rates
unchanged, but left the door open to further rate increases should
tight labor markets spark wage and price pressures down the road.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the National Association of Realtors
reported that existing-home sales plunged 9.8 percent in July to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units as higher
mortgage rates cut into demand.
</P>
<P>
In the current quarter, many analysts believe the economy has
slowed to a growth rate of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government also reported Friday that after-tax profits of U.
S. corporations grew by 2.4 percent in the second quarter, down
from the 5.7 percent in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Respond to U.N. Chief's Call to Sign, Ratify Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- An exceptional response
has been generated to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call to
all heads of State or Government to use the unique opportunity
afforded by the forthcoming Millennium Summit to sign, ratify or
accede to key treaties to which they are not yet a party, U.N.
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Summit will be largest-ever gathering of world leaders and
will be held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from
September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
To date, 69 States have informed the Secretary-General that
they will participate in the event during the three-day summit by
singing, ratifying or accede to a number of multilateral treaties
of which he is the custodian, according to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The majority of states will undertake treaty actions at the
presidential or prime ministerial level, and some will sign or
deposit instruments of ratification relating to over seven
treaties each, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said most treaty actions will relate to approximately
37 treaties, the majority of which cover human rights, disarmament,
the environment, and international criminal law.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of May 15, 2000 sent to all heads of state or
government, the Secretary-General informed the world leaders that
he would provide special facilities to enable them to add their
signatures to any of the more than 500 treaties deposited with him.
</P>
<P>
He drew special attention to a core group of 25 multilateral
treaties, among them those dealing with landmines, rights of women
and children, and climate change.

ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven people have been burnt to
death in Greece in recent days as a total of 106 forest fires are
still raging in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The death of three men and four women, all aged over 70 years,

UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- State-of-the-art
technology, including high-definition television, digital
photography and webcasting, will make the United Nations
Millennium Summit a truly 21st century event, U.N. said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Further to an initiative by the Japanese government, the Japan
Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) has offered on a pro bono basis
services and equipment to the United Nations for its coverage of
the Millennium Summit with high-definition television technology (

<HEADLINE> Popularity of Taoism Testifies Religious Freedom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The fact that there are
countless Taoist followers in China testifies that there is true
religious freedom in the country, a leading Chinese Taoist master
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Master Min Zhiting, a member of a Chinese religious leaders
delegation, told reporters that there are so many people in China
who believe or practise the indigenous Taoism that it is very
difficult for him to give an accurate number of followers.
</P>
<P>
Taoism, though an ancient and multi-god religion, is by no
means equal to feudal superstition, the master stressed. Many
ancestors who have made great contribution to social progress are
respected as gods by Taoists and worshipped in temples or shrines
built for them, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 1,600 Taoist temples across China
where more than 26,000 Taoist priests and nuns lead religious life,
he said. But it is very difficult to give an exact number of
believers because many of them do not live in Taoist temples as
priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
An annual temple fair sponsored by the Taoist Temple of White
Clouds in Beijing on every lunar Chinese New Year, for example,
attracts as many as 300,000 visitors who went to the temple to
worship Taoist gods and pray for blessings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taoist temples built on famous mountains in China
such as Mount Tai and Mount Hua where, according to tradition,
celestial beings lived or ancient Taoists had practiced
austerities and become immortal are also very popular among
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Taoism itself is a proof that there is
religious freedom in china, Master Min noted.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, comprising leaders of China's top five
religions, is here for a goodwill visit to the United States at
the invitation of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation before
attending the Millennium World Peace Summit of religious leaders
to be held at the U.N. headquarters on August 28.

MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) met Friday in
southwestern Russia to discuss the situation in Central Asia, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense chiefs from Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Belarus, Ukraine and Tajikistan attended the meeting in the

</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were represented by army command

"The military actions unleashed by international terrorists in
southwest Kyrgyzstan and southern Uzbekistan are regarded by the
Commonwealth's defense ministers as a threat and challenge to the

They believe that in the current situation, the states should
not merely coordinate, but should combine military, political and
technical efforts to neutralize the threat of the proliferation of
international terrorism.
</P>

The defense chiefs have worked out a number of concrete
measures toward stability in Central Asia, which they plan to
submit to the CIS heads of state for approval.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan oil closed the week
at 28.68 U.S. dollars per barrel, 1.11 dollars above last week's
price, the Mines and Energy Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The average price for the year is 25.75 dollars per barrel, far
higher than the 16.04 dollars in 1999 and the 10.57 dollars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the recent rise in oil price to the drop in
the inventories of the countries that are big oil consumers, such
as is the United States.
</P>
<P>
Oil, which constitutes the engine of the Venezuelan economy,
provides 70 percent of the hard currency the country needs, and
more than half of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate that Venezuela's annual oil income will
increase by about 1 billion dollars if the oil price surges one
dollar.

ROME, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will toughen
up existing measures against pedophiles and create a team of

pedophilia since "there is no magic formula" against it, and

such as the initiative taken by maverick daily Libero this week
when it published lists of condemned pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
"The main message we want to get across today is that the
entire community is as responsible for each child as if it were
its own -- if this attitude does not exist, our policies will
never be effective," she said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet agreed to form a group of ministers to monitor the
progress of anti- pedophilia measures and education programs aimed
at curbing the malaise which in recent days stirred up outrage
across the country after last weekend's back-to-back rapes and
murders of two young girls.
</P>
<P>
According to Turco, one of the main points of the campaign
against pedophilia is creating support and information systems for
parents of minors, as well as offering therapy for pedophiles in
order to eliminate the problem at the source.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government will also instill training programs for
teachers, whose extensive contact with children could make them
crucial in spotting signs of pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, the country's Children's Day will give the
government an chance to turn the spotlight on its anti-pedophilia
campaign: informative pamphlets for parents of minors will be
distributed in order to teach them how to be on the look-out for
any troubling signs in their children.
</P>
<P>
One of the trickier topics the group of ministers will have to
face is that of the presence of police in schools, an idea which
rose out of anti-pedophilia debates earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Italian Interior Minister Enzo Bianco Friday retracted previous
promises to implement information sessions for school children by
law enforcement officers about pedophiles, while Education
Minister Tullio De Mauro suggested police involvement be used only
as an "exterior" preventative measure.
</P>
<P>
Bianco also said that, together with Justice Minister Piero
Fassino, he will work toward forming an information pool dealing
with pedophilia for prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to copy the system already used for terrorism and
the mafia," Fassino said, which uses a powerful information
database to track perpetrators.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Allow More Duty-Free Products From Least-Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada will allow more products
from the world's least-developed countries to enter duty-free
beginning from September 1, 2000, the government announced here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 570 additional tariff items will be accorded duty-
free treatment, which means about 90 percent of product categories
from the world's least-developed countries may enter Canada duty-
free, according to a government statement.
</P>
<P>
"By gaining greater access to the Canadian market, least-
developed countries are benefiting from the global trading system,
" said International Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"These measures also demonstrate Canada's support for the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and its efforts to promote further trade
liberalization," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's new tariff measures came as a result of months of
consultations among WTO members, who are responding to a four-
point plan by the trade organization to help build confidence in
the world trading system among developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth Tuxtla Political
Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism Summit started Friday in
Guatemala City to promote cooperation between Mexico and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
The forum is attended by presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico,
Alfonso Portillo of Guatemala, Carlos Flores Facusse of Honduras,
Franciso Flores of El Salvador, Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua, and
Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica, according to reports from
Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
Belize Prime Minister Said Musa and Panamanian Vice President
Arturo Vallarino also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Integration and the war against international crime are our
big problems. The world demands from us unity; the world claims
for integration. It is worthless to be isolated in this globalized
world," said Guatemalan President Portillo in the opening speech.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and seven Central American countries seek in this one-
day meeting regional agreements in issues such as drug trafficking,
illegal weapon trafficking and common positions in international
policies.
</P>
<P>
The countries of the area seek to consolidate their trade
relations for the promotion of the financing of development.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders will analyze a common strategy to combat
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
They will also tackle development projects, among which is the
construction of a 1,400 kilometer long gas pipeline to take
Mexican natural gas to Guatemala and other countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The summit ends Friday with the signing of the Guatemala
Declaration to encompass the commitments of the governments in
economic, commercial, financial, migratory, and security issues,
among others.
</P>
<P>
The Tuxtla mechanism of political coordination and cooperation,
the biggest forum of cooperation between Mexico and Central
America was created in 1991, with the first summit held in Tuxtla
Gutierrez, capital of the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
The second summit was held in Costa Rica in 1995, and the third
in El Salvador in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bush Promises to Strengthen Ties With Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush said Friday that he would strengthen ties
with Latin America if he wins a presidential victory in November.
</P>
<P>
"Our future cannot be separated from the future of Latin
America," Bush said in a speech at Florida International
University.
</P>
<P>
"The Clinton-Gore administration has had no strategy," he said.
"We have seen summits without substance, and reaction instead of
action.... We were promised a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Yet
it never happened."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Clinton administration for losing lucrative
business deal in Latin America, namely in Mexico and Chile, to the
European Union and Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I don't fault our European friends for making these deals," he
said. "We dropped the ball, and they are running with it."
</P>
<P>
Bush promised that he would resume suspended free-trade talks
with Chile and other Latin American nations once he is elected.
</P>
<P>
The campaign camp of Democratic presidential candidate Vice
President Al Gore immediately slammed Bush's efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Governor Bush has shown that he is not ready to represent the
United States on the international stage," said Gore national
spokesman Douglas Mattaway.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Cuba, Bush said he was opposed to any relaxation
of the almost 40-year-old economic embargo against Havana.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Tells Rebel Not To Fear Clinton's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana said Friday that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) must not fear the forthcoming visit  of U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The rebel FARC declared Thursday "non grata" Clinton's presence
in Colombia who will arrive on August 30 in the Caribbean city of
Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will state his support for the Plan Colombia, a
strategy proposed by the Pastrana administration against drugs,
with investments of 7.5 billion U.S. dollars, to which the United
States will contribute 1.3 billion dollars, most of it in military
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that the Plan Colombia aims at combating drug
trafficking. The guerrillas have said that they do not have
anything to do with drug trafficking. In consequence, they have
nothing to fear," said Pastrana to the press in the Caribbean
island of San Andres, where he attended a forum.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that "70 percent (of the Plan Colombia) is aimed
at social investment. I cannot see how any Colombian can oppose
this."
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rios, one of the FARC spokesmen, who has been holding
peace talks with the government since October 1999, said that "
Clinton does not come in peace, nor to support the efforts for a
political solution to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug plan threatens the peace process and means "a
real danger of generalization of the war," added the rebel leader.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trying to Placate Fear of Colombian Neighbors over U.S.-Involved Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
tried hard to placate Latin Americans' fear over its increasing
involvement in Colombia's military action against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan, and there is no proposal, and there is no
idea of committing American forces in Colombia to do anything but .
..training," Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as the Clinton administration will pour 1.3
billion U.S. dollars in aid into Colombia over the next two years
to back up a drive against drug traffickers and armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton will make a five-hour visit to Colombia
next week to endorse the U.S. support for the drug war.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's neighbors fear that the militarization of the drug
war will push the fighting over their borders, along with waves of
refugees and displacement of the drug trade itself.
</P>
<P>
Pickering called the fear of Latin American nations fear a "
misunderstanding" of U.S. efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil has ruled out military cooperation with the
United States in Colombia. It is also concerned about the
environmental fallout in the Amazon jungle from the use of
chemicals to destroy Colombia's drug plantations.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela distances itself from the U.S. strategy in Colombia
by refusing to allow American planes to fly over its territory on
drug missions.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Friday as investors continued to search for guidance on the market
direction after the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest
rates alone earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 9.89 at 11,192.63.
The blue chip index rose in the previous four sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 10.60 at 4,042.68 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 2.87 at 1,506.45.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks opened lower on profit-taking and bounced
back then, lifting the Dow index higher at the finish. Investors
moved in the market in the late session to buy some big stocks
such as International Business Machine Corp. for safety.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index fell as traders sold some stocks to lock in
profits from a rally in the previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
Investors have stayed on sideline to search for the market
direction since the Federal Reserve decided to leave rates
unchanged at a monetary policy meeting Tuesday. They were happy
with the move but remained concerned about corporate earnings
because of the slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
Two government reports had little effect on the market. One
report said the U.S. gross domestic product grew 5.3 percent in
the second quarter, meeting analysts' expectations and the other
said existing-home sales plunged 9.8 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.59 at 672.53 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.87 at 934.81. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.81 at 525.11.

<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,457 up, 1,354 down and 531
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Norway Says Israeli-Palestinian Peace Deal Possible Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Foreign Minister
Thorbjoern Jagland said here Friday that Israel could reach a peace
agreement on final-status talks with the Palestinians soon.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Jagland said that he has been convinced after
meetings with israeli and Palestinian leaders that the two sides
could reach such a peace deal this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Compromise over the status of Jerusalem, a main obstacle in the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, was not beyond reach, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Jagland held talks with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Bethlehem, the West Bank city located just south
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to discuss the Jerusalem issue with Faisal
Husseini, a Central Committee Member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, in East Jerusalem later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Jagland also said that his country, which played a key role in
helping both Israel and the Palestinians to forge the Oslo peace
accords in 1993, could help in any solution for the Palestinian
refugee problem, another key issue facing the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak said if Arafat does not realize the urgency to reach the
peace deal, the impasse could post a great danger to the security
of the entire region.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Barak added, that Israel could not give up its
sovereignty over the Jewish holy site in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"No Israeli prime minister could agree to let the Palestinians
have sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which is the holy site for
the Jewish people for generations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said the if the peace deal could not be reached soon,
violence could erupt again in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Jagland flew to Israel from the Egyptian seaport city of
Alexandria on Thursday, where he held talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Israel describes Jerusalem as its eternal and undivided capital,
while Palestinians want at least East Jerusalem to be the future
capital of an independent Palestinian state which Arafat intends to
declare on September 13.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, there are about 3.5 million
Palestinian refugees and most of them are living in Jordan, Syria
and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Overspeed Landing Might Cause Gulf Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAMA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Landing at excessive speed may
cause the Gulf Air Airbus A320 to crash into shallow Gulf waters
near the runway of the Bahraini International Airport, leaving all
143 people on board dead, a local newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The pilot was requested by the control tower not to land with
that high speed," the Bahrain Tribune said, citing an alleged
conversation between the pilot and the air traffic control tower
and visual images on the tower's radar.
</P>
<P>
The pilot responded to the tower's instructions by climbing
again, then making two turns to reduce speed and finally
reapproaching the runway, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the plane's speed was still too high to land and that
the tower again instructed the pilot to reduce speed, it added.
</P>
<P>
"On the third attempt, the pilot took a small turn at high
speed. He lost control, which caused the plane to nosedive into the
waters next to the runway," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini airport authorities have claimed the control tower did
not receive any distress call from the pilot Ihsan Shakeeb.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is still unclear why the experienced pilot failed to
reduce the speed of the airbus.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have recovered the flight data recorder and
cockpit
voice recorder from the wreckage of Flight GF072, which was
traveling from Cairo to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi television said that Wednesday's accident was "due to
human error and not to technical malfunction."

<HEADLINE> Ten Thousands Troops Deployed Friday to Guard Election in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 troops began to deploy
in Lebanon's Christian heartland, the Druze hinterland and the
northern provinces Friday morning to guard the first round of the
parliamentary elections scheduled to begin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The troops, backed by rapid deployment units to prevent any
disorders, would complete the deployment operation by sundown,
Oriental radio quoted Interior Minister Michel Murr as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said police units will stage a similar deployment on
Saturday. All liquor parlors in northern and central Lebanon were
ordered closed until Monday and all kinds of weapons, even those
with a government or army license, were banned.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 candidates are contesting the 63 seats at stake in
the first round of the election. The new parliament will be made of
128 half-Christian, half-Muslim members. The second round, which is
set for September 3 in Beirut as well as east and south Lebanon,
will
fill the remaining 65 seats.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanese law, the current government will resign
after the formation of the new parliament. The president will
nominate a prime minister who has to be proved by the parliament.
Then the prime minister will establish a new government in a month.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Rafik Hariri and the incumbent prime
minister Salim Hoss are regarded by local people as the candidates
of the premiership.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Rejects Israeli Reinvasion Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 25 (Xinhua) -- President Emile Lahoud rejected
the Israeli threat to return to Lebanon if the border did not
remain peaceful, An Nahar newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"They (Israelis) will think 100 times before taking any such
action," Lahoud told a visiting delegation of the Lions Club in the
Middle East Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is not an easy passageway any more. Lebanon is now a
state in the full sense of the word, enjoying the respect of the
international community around the world," Lahoud said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a threat served the day before by Israel's
ground forces commander Maj. Gen. Moshe Ivry-Sukenik, who said the
Israeli army might have to mount a Lebanon thrust in case of a
major border incident "to create a new situation and not to impose
a new occupation."
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said the liberation of south Lebanon was a first step
toward a comprehensive Middle East peace. Israel pulled all its
troops out of the so-called security zone on May 24, ending 22
years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel should also withdraw from Syria's Golan Heights and allow
the estimated 360,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon to return to
their land before a peace accord could be concluded, he added.

</P>
<P>
What caused the catastrophe remains unknown. The black boxes, a
flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder, have been
recovered from the wreckage of the aircraft, and investigations
have been ordered together with experts from Airbus Industrie,
manufacturer of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The airline rejected as "entirely speculative" media reports
quoting the contents of the flight data recorder, saying the black
box can not be opened in Bahrain, where it is currently held under
guard with Civil Aviation Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The black box will be sent for examination and interpretation to
Europe or America, it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that to try to find out the cause of the crash is the
responsibility of the investigation team, headed by Bahraini
Communications Minister Sheikh Ali Bin Khalifa Al Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A320 joined the Gulf Air fleet in 1994, and had
accumulated 17,000 flying hours.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air belongs in equal parts to Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the
government of Abu Dhabi, the largest of seven sheikdoms making up
the United Arab Emirates. The Bahrain-based Gulf Air operates a
fleet of 28 planes and flies to 53 international destinations.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 1,100 Airbus A320s in service around the
world and the Airbus A320 can seat up to 150 passengers.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will visit Turkey on Monday to discuss the Middle East peace
process with Turkish leaders, the Prime Minister's Office said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak will also discuss with Turkish leaders ways to further
improve economic and security cooperations between the two
countries, the office added.
</P>
<P>
But foreign diplomats here said that Barak's trip to Turkey is
to seek Turkish support for its peace policy and ask Turkey not to
back Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to unilaterally declare an
independent Palestinian state in September.
</P>
<P>
After the failed Camp David Middle East peace summit in July,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat launched an international
diplomacy to seek support for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Barak also sent his several cabinet ministers, including acting
Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Regional Cooperation Minister
Shimon Peres, to visit a large number of countries to counter
Arafat's efforts.

<P>
CAIRO, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday underlined the importance
to enhance cooperation and coordination between the two countries
in a bid to advance the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation initiated by Clinton, the two
leaders reviewed the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on the ongoing contacts and consultations
by all concerned parties on ways of narrowing gaps between the
Palestinians and Israelis, and the future steps in the peace
process, it said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has been engaged in an intensive string of meetings with
the parties to the Arab-Israeli peace talks since last month's
Palestinian-Israeli Camp David summit failed to produce a final
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Clinton agreed on the need to exert joint efforts to
help remove the obstacles standing in the way of realizing a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the major sponsor of the Mideast peace
process, while Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with
Israel, plays a key role in mediating the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Mubarak received a call from United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan, during which they discussed the peace
process between the Palestinians and Israelis, and other regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
Both Annan and Clinton offered condolences on the crash of a
Gulf Air Airbus A320 near Bahrain on Wednesday that left 143 people
dead, including 63 Egyptians. The flight was en route to Bahrain
from Cairo, Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Condoles Xinhua Victims in Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAMA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Air authority on Friday
extended condolences to a delegation of China's Xinhua News Agency
on the death of three Xinhua staff members in the plane crash two
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Air Vice President Walter Wan West expressed regret while
meeting in the Gulf Hotel with the five Xinhua representatives,
three of whom lost their wives in the air disaster. The delegation
arrived here Thursday from Cairo aboard a special flight arranged
by the airline to carry relatives of the victims of the tragic
accident.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A320 of GF072 from Cairo to Bahrain ditched into the
Gulf off Bahrain's international airport after two unsuccessful
attempts to land Wednesday night, killing all the 135 passengers
and eight crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The three Xinhua women staff, who were on their way to Beijing
after visiting their husbands, were among the victims. West
exchanged views with the Xinhua delegation over the handling of
post-accident affairs, promising the airline will provide every
possible help to the bereaved families.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, head of Xinhua's Mideast Regional Bureau Ge Xiangwen
expressed thanks to the airline for its measures to search and
rescue possible survivors since the tragedy took place.
</P>
<P>
David Jump, a counselor to Bahraini interior minister, and
Chinese charge D'affaires to Bahrain Li Conglu were present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
As to what caused the plane crash, West said that an committee
consisted of experts from Airbus Industrie, Gulf Air, Bahraini
Civil Aviation Authority, and the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board will kick off investigations Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The probe will be under personal direction of Bahraini Crown
Prince Salman ibn Hamad in order to speed up the process, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the pilot, a father of three, was experienced and
responsible, while referring to media reports that human errors
were behind the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all sayings are speculative until an official
conclusion is announced by the investigation team. The black boxes
of the plane -- flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- have
been recovered and will be sent to Europe or America for
examination and interpretation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader: Hostages' Safety Still Primary Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The safety of the remaining
hostages kept by the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu remains the government's
top priority,Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Friday in
Zamboanga City in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement of the Presidential Palace, the
president pointed out that it is because of this concern that the
government has not used the full force of the law to effect the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"If only we are after violence, on the first day we would have
attacked the kidnappers. But because we are after the safety of
the hostages, it is taking us a long time to work for their
release," the president said.
</P>
<P>
And because of this, Estrada added, he cannot guarantee that
the hostages would be released on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president also said the arrest of the alleged Abu Sayyaf
associates with 240,000 U.S. dollars in ransom money Thursday
would not hamper ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were arrested by elements of the Presidential
Anti-organized Crime Task Force while trying to exchange the money
into Philippine pesos at the Zamboanga City branch of the Land
Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made it clear that the government maintains a no-ransom
policy and that the money did not come from the Philippine
government.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the Abu Sayyaf promised last week to
release the hostages, but the group reneged on its promise.The
rebel group is still holding nearly 30 hostages, including 12
Westerners.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Faces Shortage of Cancer Treatment Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- There is excessive pressure on
Vietnam's cancer treatment system, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has between 100,000 and 150,000 new cancer patients
each year, but runs only two specialized hospitals using obsolete
equipment, VNA quoted Nguyen Ba Duc, director of Hospital K, a
Hanoi-based institution specializing in cancer treatment, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Duc made the remarks at an international workshop here from
August 23 to 25, which attracted 20 professors and doctors from
the United States, Singapore, Australia and China and nearly 450
of their colleagues in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Duc further reported that between 50,000 and 70,000 Vietnamese
people die of cancer every year.
</P>
<P>
At present, Duc noted, provincial hospitals could barely cope
with cancers due to a dire shortage of special equipment and
experienced doctors.
</P>
<P>
But some progress has been reported in the field. An increasing
number of patients have easy access to diagnosis and have been
successfully treated.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999-2000 period, the Vietnamese government invested 70
billion Vietnamese dong (5.7 million U.S. dollars) in upgrading
the country's four major cancer treatment centers.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Promises More Cooperation With Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori said here Friday that his government is
committed to further strengthening cooperation with Nepal in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
Mori said during his official talks with Nepali Prime Minister
Girija Koirala that since Japan and Nepal have a long and
historical friendship, they should continue the cordial
relationship and strengthen cooperation, especially in the
economic and cultural fields, according to a spokesman of the
Japanese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said at a news briefing after the talks that Mori
offered to provide assistance to Nepal for its development
projects in agriculture, infrastructure, education, culture and
health.
</P>
<P>
Mori stressed the need to promote people-to-people exchanges
between the two countries and proposed an exchange program that
will invite to Japan Nepali youths for technical training and
Nepali scholars and researchers for cultural exchanges, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Mori also mentioned an initiative to take 5,000 young people
per year from South Asian countries, including Nepal, to Japan for
various kinds of training and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Nepali Prime Minister Koirala expressed
appreciation for the economic assistance extended to Nepal by the
Japanese government and hoped that the cordial cooperation between
the two countries will continue, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also discussed issues of mutual concern,
such as regional issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mori arrived here earlier Friday for a one-day official visit
to Nepal, the last leg of his eight-day four-nation South Asia
tour aimed at strengthening ties with the region. He is the first-
ever Japanese prime minister to visit Nepal since the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1956.
</P>
<P>
Mori's South Asia tour also included Bangladesh, Pakistan and
India.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate to Look Into Bugging Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Two lawmakers Friday urged the
Philippine Senate to investigate allegations that the former chief
of the Presidential Security Group (PSG), General Jose Calimlim,
has installed bugging devices in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople and Senator Robert
Barbers said the allegations made by Major Thomas Dumpit merit an
investigation given its serious implications on the presidency and
national security.
</P>
<P>
Dumpit said in a letter that he knew about the installation of
these bugging devices in the Presidential Palace whose recordings
end up in the camp of the opposition party Lakas.
</P>
<P>
"It is no wonder that everything that happens in the Palace
finds its place in the newspapers," Dumpit said in the letter
which was published by the newspaper Philippine Daily Inquirer on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ople said Dumpit would have to corroborate his charges before a
formal inquiry or suffer administrative and possibly even criminal
charges for maligning his superior officer.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Barbers dismissed reports that the
opposition Lakas party officials and those close to former
President Fidel Ramos are responsible for the said bugging devices.
</P>
<P>
"Why is Lakas always being blamed? This is beyond comprehension.
There's absence of concrete proof and there isn't enough evidence
to conclude that Lakas has something to do with it," Barbers said.
</P>
<P>
The two senators said the senate, through its appropriate
committees,would invite Dumpit to shed light on his accusations
and produce the evidence he claims to have.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Calimlim said Friday in a statement that he did
not order any bugging on the telephone of President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said the allegation of bugging the office of the
president is a concoction by detractors waging a vilification
campaign to put him out of the contention for the office of the
chief of staff.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Construction Industry to Remain in Doldrums: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore minister has
acknowledged that his country's construction industry will remain
in doldrums until the end of 2001 as local constructors would
inevitably be affected by a fall in construction demand.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan said in
the parliament Friday that construction demand could move into
positive value-added growth toward the end of 2001 provided that
the good performance of the economy is maintained over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that construction demand in Singapore, measured
in contract value, has dropped from its peak of 23.5 billion
Singapore dollars (13.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 11.7
billion Singapore dollars (6.9 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Building and Construction Authority has forecast that
construction demand would rise to 17.3 billion Singapore dollars (
10.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 2000, he said, noting that the
increase would come mainly from the two government reclamation
projects while the volume of building works is expected to remain
stagnant.
</P>
<P>
Mah said the government has been looking at ways to advance
some of the infrastructure and institutional projects, especially
public sector projects, so as to boost construction demand.
</P>
<P>
But the total value of projects still fell in 1999 despite the
fact that the number of projects awarded by the public sector rose
by 25 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"As construction projects would need a few years to complete,
any action taken now will not lead to immediate results," he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Breaches Support Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso breached the
45-pesos support level against the U.S. dollar on Friday, dragged
by a weak Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed lower at 45.04 to the U.S. dollar, compared
with its previous close of 44.98.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, on the other hand, closed 92.5 lower at 8,342.5
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Friday's close was the peso's lowest level against the
greenback since the currency settled at 45.07 on July 26.
</P>
<P>
Total volume at the Philippine Dealing System amounted to a
measly 46 million dollars, against 83 million dollars in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the peso just followed the Indonesian rupiah
Friday as there was no fresh news in the local market.
</P>
<P>
The peso has been trading near the psychological support level
of 45 against the dollar in recent days on lingering worries over
the widening budget deficit, lackluster economic prospects and the
unresolved hostage crisis in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government reported a deficit of 59.7 billion
pesos(1.49 billion dollars) for the January-to-July period,
against the full-year target of 62.5 billion pesos (1.56 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Currently, the government is still negotiating for the release
of some 28 hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf group in Jolo, Sulu,
while peace talks with the bigger secessionist group Moro Islamic
Liberation Front have been suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank of the Philippines said it will not
touch its borrowing and lending rates in a meeting next week, as
the peso fluctuation was simply hinged on the movements of other
Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura said the peso will be
gaining ground against the U.S. dollar in the third or fourth
quarter with the expected dollar inflow from overseas remittances.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Concerted Efforts Bear Fruit for Somali Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
ARTA, Djibouti, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Somali transitional
parliament Saturday elected former interior minister Abdiqasim
Salad Hassan as its first head of state in almost a decade,
marking a great success of the Somali Peace Conference being held
in Arta, Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The eight-hour-odd long presidential election, which followed
the selection of the country's speaker of the parliament by
representatives of Somali clans six days ago, will definitely pave
the way to put an end of insecurity of the nation that has been
living in chaos and violence without central government since the
downfall of the Siyad Barre regime in 1991 and give an impetus to
the long-waited national reconciliation in the Horn of Africa
country.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the success of the Somali Peace Conference,
which brings about fruitful results one after another, firstly lie
in the sustained efforts being made by the world society in
solving Somali problems.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the current Somali Peace Conference which began here
on May 2, the past decade witnessed at least 12 international
peace conferences that focused on political settlement of civil
war in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being discouraged by the successive failure of the
previous meetings, the world society has been drawing lessons from
the past and making its unremitting efforts to push forward the
Somali peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that Djibouti sponsored the first Somali
Peace Conference in 1991. The fact that it is again hosting the
Somali peace meeting after a nine-year suspension is exactly an
example of such efforts.
</P>
<P>
Scientific practice shows that external causes will play no
role in the changes of natural world unless they combine with the
internal ones. The success or failure of the Somali peace process
will by no means depart from this natural law.
</P>
<P>
Nobody is able to stop the Somalis from fighting each other
unless they themselves are willing to do so, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Somali Peace Conference began, faction and elder
clan leaders, and representatives from industrial, commercial and
cultural sectors held discussions on how to eliminate
contradictions existing among various clans for many years. Under
the direct mediation by Djibouti President Ismael Omar Gulleh,
they finally reached a consensus with the participants to the
peace conference on a number of issues ranging from the end of
civil war, the establishment of central government to the
realization of country's unification and the resumption of state
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
This really created favorable conditions for the successful
peace conference.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Somali people, prompted by their eagerness for
peace and a democratic central government, are apparently choosing
a way to national reconciliation by their own.
</P>
<P>
It is under such circumstances, namely the sustained
international mediation plus Somali people's willingness for peace,
that have made the great success of the on-going Somali Peace
Conference possible.
</P>
<P>
Being a turning point of the country's peace process, the
launch of the Somali Peace Conference is yet to say everything is
just fine.
</P>
<P>
Of all the difficulties for the democratically elected state
authority, the protruding one is that the new leaders of Somalia
will have to face sooner or later the challenges from warlords
scattered in the various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
To this point, Speaker of the Somali transitional parliament
Abdulla Dero Issak looked quite confident. He indicated that "no
war will continue in Somalia because 99 percent of the Somali
population will come to us."

finish but the pure thrilling action has yet to come Saturday when
the top four teams meet in the cross-over semi-finals of the World

another two teams from the China leg, which are the top semi-
finalists and undefeated Cuba and China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgian cycling star Tom Steels
Friday said he would not take part in the Sydney Games due to
illness.
</P>
<P>
After suffering a viral infection, Steels came down with a
sudden high fever last week. A blood analysis showed it will take
over a month before the sprinter, who won two stages in the Tour
de France, will be back to full fitness.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "in such circumstances, it is no use to keep
dreaming of the Games. I have to be in top shape to achieve
anything out there, and there is no way I can do that."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Belgium already lost Johan Museeuw, its top
cycling star, after he broke his leg and collarbone in a
motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
Over the summer, the talented but mercurial Frank Vandenbroucke
also pulled out of the selection.

<HEADLINE> Ferreira Vows to Do Best in U.S. Open and Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African tennis player
Wayne Ferreira said on Friday that he is confident he can do well
at next week's U.S. Open tennis championship and the ensuing
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, who has been back recently in the top 20 for the
first time over the past three years, was last ranked 20 on May 26
1997 but injury and a lack of motivation saw him tumble out of the
top 50.
</P>
<P>
However, the new and invigorated Ferreira has reached the
fourth round of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a really good summer in the U.S. and I've had a lot
of fun," said Ferreira in a telephone interview call from
California, the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I've been feeling good about my game again and I think I can
do well at both the U.S. Open and the Olympics," the tennis player
said.
</P>
<P>
While Ferreira wants to do well at the U.S. Open, he also has
his heart set on winning a medal at the Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"In some ways the Olympics is even bigger for me than any Grand
Slam. I don't get too many chances to play for my country and it
is certainly an honour for me to be playing in my third Olympics,"
Ferreira said.
</P>
<P>
At the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, Ferreira won silver in the
doubles with Pietie Norval and in Atlanta lost to American Agassi.
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta was disappointing but hopefully I will do better this
time. I've always had a good time in Australia and I think Sydney
is a great venue," he said.

ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Olympic organisers in Athens face
a race against time to ensure preparations for the 2004 Games are
completed, the head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
co-ordinating commissions, Jacques Rogge, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two months after the introduction of a new leadership team to
head the Athens Olympic Games Organizing Committee (ATHOC), Rogge
said that progress had been made, but there was still a mountain
to climb.
</P>
<P>
"Time is critical," said Rogge. "This concern is obviously
shared by all parties. We have been assured deadlines will be
respected and even brought forward where necessary. ATHOC is now
on track, but the clock is ticking."
</P>
<P>
The IOC said in a statement Friday that time constraints
concerning long-haul projects like infrastructure, transport,
construction and technology were now the concern of the ATHOC and
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the full IOC co-ordinating commission would
return to Athens on November 22-24 to review the lessons learned
from the Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> SEZs: China's modernization Pacemakers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- With the approaching of the 20th
anniversary of China's four earliest special economic zones (SEZs)
on August 26, the cities of Shenzhen, Xiamen, Zhuhai and Shantou,
and Hainan Province have all mapped out development blueprints for
the new century.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Gaoli, secretary of the Communist Party of China's
Shenzhen committee, said that the goal of Shenzhen is to basically
realize modernization by 2005 and reach the level of moderately
developed countries by 2010 and that of developed countries in
2030.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's counterpart in Xiamen, Hong Yongshi, pledged that his
city would make progress in modernization with indexes regarding
the economy, science and technology, and social development
meeting or closing to the requirements of modernization in five
years.
</P>
<P>
In Zhuhai, officials vowed to realize modernization in 2007
while their colleagues in Shantou promised to build the city into
a modernized port city in the world by 2008.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Province, the largest of China's SEZs set up 12 years
ago, has a new ambitious plan to streamline its agriculture,
marine economy and tourism while promoting urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that by setting the goals for modernization,
the SEZs are still leading other parts of the country in
development as they were 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, local authorities in Shenzhen, encouraged and
supported by senior Chinese leaders including Deng Xiaoping, were
determined to blaze a trail for China's reform and opening-up
drive.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has then become a window of the country to the outside
world and a platform for reform measures, along with Xiamen,
Zhuhai and Shantou.
</P>
<P>
To ensure successful reform and opening-up in the SEZs, China
introduced a wide range of special preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market
managed to stay on the positive territory this week, although it
almost wiped off all its gains on a nose-dive on Wednesday in the
wake of a round of usual profit-taking activities.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen B-share index inched up 0.32 points or 0.25
percent to 126.49 at the end of the week, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover increased sharply to 1.85 billion Hong
Kong dollars, which was 1.17 billion Hong Kong dollars or 169.62
percent more than the total of last week, hitting a one-week
record high since December of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Providing the trigger for the market's reversal were rumors
that China's A and B shares won't merge, later denied as
misinterpreted remarks from State Development and Planning
Minister Zeng Peiyan.
</P>
<P>
The later sessions in the week were subject to choppy,
directionless trading, with the index stuck to lows, as investors
continued to be hesitant to commit. Bargain hunters did not pull
the market out of the red, and any buying move lacked conviction.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that a lackluster week will have
grip on the market with trading on the lighter side and investors
on the sidelines in a cautious mood. Poor corporate outlook is
enough to keep the index from picking up steam for a period.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B-Share Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market was
plagued with extremely choppy trading this week, after the market'
s attempt to advance had fizzled as the buying continued to lack
conviction, while the selling resumed its vigor and rumor stories.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai B-share index tumbled 5.46 points or 11.71 percent
to 72.77 at the end of the week, posting its largest weekly
decline in one month, according to Homeway, China's leading
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover extended to 433.98 million U.S. dollars,
which was 179.13 million U.S. dollars or 70.29 percent more than
the total of last week.
</P>
<P>
After starting the week on a dynamic note, the market reversed
courses in a very abrupt fashion. The sudden meltdown of the
market was considered being triggered by rumors that China's A and
B shares won't merge, later denied as misinterpreted remarks from
the State Development and Planning Minister Zeng Peiyan.
</P>
<P>
Given that rumors had been cleared, the market started trimming
its heavy losses as bargain hunters came to the rescue. However,
investors' sentiment became fragile and confidence seemed not very
easy to be restored, so that the market failed to materialize a
recovery, leaving the index stuck around its lows.
</P>
<P>
And the key point, analysts say, lies in that the recent gains
hardly match the performance of Chinese companies. State media
reported in July that more than 100 Chinese companies -- almost
one out of every ten publicly traded firms-- will report first-
half losses.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predict that it is likely to be a pretty
volatile week ahead as the market will be traded with little
direction. It sill takes time for the aggressive nature to prevail
again.

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP Grows 10.3 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Gross Domestic Product (
GDP) of Hong Kong attained a double-digit growth, at 10.8 percent
in real terms in the second quarter of 2000 over a year earlier,
after a 14.3 percent growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate in real terms of GDP for 2000 is
raised from 6 percent in the earlier forecast to 8.5 percent,
according to the Half-yearly Economic Report 2000 released by the
Hong Kong government Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of goods had double-digit growth for three
consecutive quarters, rising by 17.7 percent in real terms in the
second quarter of 2000 over a year earlier. This was underpinned
by strong global and regional demand and improved price
competitiveness of Hong Kong's exports.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending attained a further appreciable year-on-year
growth of 5.2 percent in real terms, in tandem with increased
overall income and sustained improvement in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The labor market generally improved further. The seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate fell distinctly, from 5.6 percent in
the first quarter of 2000 to 5.0 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the government predicted that exports of goods
and services should gain further support from the intense demand
across virtually all the major markets, including the United
States, Europe, China's mainland, and the rest of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Apart from re-exports, offshore trading, inbound tourism and
business services are expected to be the major growth lines.
</P>
<P>
In the domestic sector, a firmer consumer sentiment amidst the
improved labor market conditions should continue to uphold
consumer spending. Also, a better business outlook coupled with
the desire to upgrade productive efficiency and quality should
continue to spur investment spending.

BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council will authorize its subordinate office in southwest
China's Chongqing Municipality to handle the application from
Taiwan media for interviews in the city as of September 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1997, the Taiwan Affairs Office granted related
offices of 12 provinces and cities to handle interview application
from Taiwan press.
</P>
<P>
Journalistic visits are the major component of press exchanges
across the Taiwan Straits. The mainland has always encouraged such
exchanges. The Taiwan Affairs Office issued special regulations
concerning Taiwan reporters' visits to the mainland in 1996 that
further simplified procedures.
</P>
<P>
In practice and especially in case of an emergency, related
departments do their utmost to provide convenience for Taiwan
reporters, with some applications approved on the same day.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 5,000 Taiwan reporters have visited the
mainland in recent years, while only some 200 mainland reporters
have been to Taiwan. None of the mainland media has been able to
send reporters to the island due to obstacles by the Taiwan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The mainland press expect the Taiwan authorities to take
immediate steps to show their sincerity in promoting press
exchanges of the two sides.

This is the largest copyright dispute in China since 1949 in

by illegally publishing and distributing a book series titled "
Classical Essays by Famous Chinese Writers in the Twenty Century".
</P>
<P>
The book series include essays by these writers, and the
publisher neither sought permission from the writers nor
remunerated them.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the writers appealed to the court for stopping the
distribution of the book series and asked the Jinlin Province-
based publisher to pay 99,000 yuan for infringing copyright and 10,
000 yuan in compensation to each writer.
</P>
<P>
After legal proceedings, the court handed down its verdict,
ordering the publisher to pay 23,760 yuan to each of the 29
writers for copyright infringement, and to stop distributing the
book series immediately while publishing written apologies in
newspapers.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Launches Website on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
launched a new website, www.freeconomy.org, Friday in an effort to
promote Hong Kong's image as one of the freest economies in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Hong Kong and the Pursuit of Economic Freedom," the
website provides comprehensive information including Hong Kong's
economic policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
"Economic freedom is, above all, about openness, transparency,
freedom of speech and the free and unfettered flow of information
at all levels -- government, business, politics," said Donald
Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was ranked as the world's freest economy by the
Fraser Institute, the Hong Kong Center for Economic Research and
the Cato Institute in January this year, and by the Heritage
Foundation in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The website encapsulates the government's commitment to
transparency, open government and economic freedom, he said.
</P>
<P>
It has taken six months to develop the website through the
joint efforts of the Information Services Department of Hong Kong
and a team led by David Dodwell, co-author of the "Hong Kong
Advantage" study published in 1997 which examined the competitive
strengths and weaknesses of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
The site is in both English and Chinese and has an audio
version for the sight-impaired. It will in due course be available
in French, German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that academics, economists, officials of other
governments, researchers for think-tanks and financial
organizations, and anyone interested in economic matters will find
this a valuable, thought-provoking resource," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Dispute Settled in China's Tianjin Municipality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Six overseas management
personnel who were surrounded by joint-venture workers in a labor
dispute in north China's Tianjin safely left their company today.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in the Tianjin Meite Packaging Company,
a Hong Kong Meite Co. and the Tianjin Wanhua Co. joint-venture.
</P>
<P>
In March, the company merged with Meite Packaging becoming a
totally overseas-funded company. The company planned to continue
to employ 150 workers, but 71 of whom were disgruntled with the
new labor contracts because they did not specify the terms of
their employment.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the workers refused to sign the contracts and asked
to go back to Wanhua, which rejected their demand.
</P>
<P>
On the morning August 22, the 71 workers went to Meite hoping
to hold talks with the overseas boss, who refused to do so and had
a bulletin posted announcing the termination of labor contracts
with the workers.
</P>
<P>
Then, the workers stopped six overseas management personnel
from leaving the company, including an American, a Malaysian and
four from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Local police rushed to the site soon after the incident took
place and separated the workers from the management personnel,
while local government was immediately involved in mediating.
</P>
<P>
By 11 o'clock Thursday, an agreement was reached. Meite
revoking its contract termination announcement and gave
compensation to workers while Wanhua agreed to accept the workers.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were satisfied with the settlement, and the workers
left the company early this morning.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Warns Against Overheating of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said Friday that Hong Kong would not see double-digit
growth in the third quarter or fourth quarter this year as in the
first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
"I must warn everybody that this figure is not repeatable and
it is not likely that we are going to have double-digit growth in
the third quarter or fourth quarter," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following the earlier release of the Half-
Yearly Economic Report 2000 by the Hong Kong government, which
reported a 10.8-percent economic growth in the second quarter of
2000 over a year earlier, after a 14.3-percent growth in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate in real terms of the GDP for 2000 is
raised from 6 percent in the earlier forecast to 8.5 percent,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Further double-digit growth would not be desirable and would
perhaps overheat the economy, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"We must remember that we are a fairly mature and developed
economy, and our per capita GDP is among the highest in the world,
so it would not be good for ourselves in the long run for the
economy to grow at double digit," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, set against the past recession and the contraction of
the GDP in 1998, the robust growth is certainly a very stimulating
experience, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Predicts Moderate Medium-Term Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang on Friday expressed optimism about Hong
Kong's economic performance in the rest of the year, but predicted
that the growth rate would slow down in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in CNBC Asia's "The Asian Wall Street Journal," Tsang
noted that Hong Kong's economy, with a per capita GDP approaching
25,000 U.S. dollars, is an industrialized economy, and so, "it is
unreal to maintain a double-digit growth."
</P>
<P>
"And indeed, I think this would be undesirable if we had that
and we would be overheating the economy," he said, predicting that
the trend growth rate, in the medium term, would slow down to stay
at something between 4 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics released on Friday, the real-
term growth of Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP) reached 10.
8 percent in the second quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
So after these heights of 10.8 percent and 14.3 percent in the
first two quarters, "I do believe the economy will moderate to a
more decent growth rate," Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
But for the year 2000 as a whole, Tsang said he believed the
year would be a quite brilliant year. "We have forecast it to grow
by 8.5 percent, but after this, I think it will gradually work
down to 4 to 5 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to what are the driving factors behind the strong GDP growth,
Tsang listed some external factors, including a stable U.S. market,
a recovering Japanese economy and a powerfully growing mainland of
China.
</P>
<P>
And in Hong Kong, he said, the main driving force is trade,
both visible and invisible.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism, financial services are surging ahead, and on top of
that there is a very healthy inflow of capital in Hong Kong,
spurring new levels of investment, and domestic consumption has
been rising very satisfactorily," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So these are all the underlying elements producing quite a
brilliant performance in the year 2000." he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A number of video-game parlors
and their owners have been punished since the government launched
a nationwide crack-down, in June, on illegal activities in the
business.
</P>
<P>
The blitz has gained support from the media and public, said
Liu Shengli, a Ministry of Culture official in charge of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, investigations and inspections have
been carried out by local departments concerned, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, he confessed that lots of game parlors are operating
without legal documents, while some of them continued to accept
under-age customers.
</P>
<P>
And some people are running illegal video-game parlors under
the disguise of Internet cafes or computer training schools, he
said, noting that some owners are moving their business to
suburban and rural areas or are engaged in underground operations.
</P>
<P>
Liu announced that the government will stop issuing licenses to
new video-game parlors, close down those which have been engaged
in illegal activities, and severely punish law offenders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, manufacturing and sale of game machines for the
domestic market will be banned, he said.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team will be sent to check the results of the
campaign nationwide by October.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, China has nearly 60,000
registered video-game parlors.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest More to Treat Wastewater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China will invest about 40
billion yuan (4.8 billion U.S. dollar) each year in the next 10
years to make sure at least 70 percent of wastewater in major
cities and 60 percent in ordinary cities is treated before
discharge by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to purchase and build more urban
wastewater treatment facilities, according to a new pollution
control policy jointly issued by the State Environmental
Protection Administration, the Ministry of Construction and the
Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The policy requires that at least 50 percent of the wastewater
in urban areas across the country should be treated before
discharge by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China built 176 wastewater treatment plants between 1980 and
1995, enabling the country to treat 20 percent of the wastewater
produced in cities.
</P>
<P>
Construction of urban wastewater treatment facilities has been
stepped up since 1995 and up to the end of 1998, 266 wastewater
treatment plants were operating, with a total daily capacity of 11
million tons. Currently, another 203 facilities are under
construction.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policy, investors from both at home and
abroad are welcome to build such facilities in cities and villages
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Lashes Out At Taiwan Leader's Trip Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency,
Xinhua, lashed out at the leader of Taiwan authorities for his
visit to foreign countries, saying that money can't buy
international justice.
</P>
<P>
A commentary from Xinhua said only three months after his
taking office, the Taiwan leader followed the "money diplomacy"
pursued by his predecessor Lee Teng-hui, and went abroad with
cheques.
</P>
<P>
The international justice, which Lee has failed to buy with big
money, will not fall in the hands of the present leader of Taiwan,
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taiwan leader has been in office, Taiwan has
witnessed political, economic and social chaos.
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying his best to sort out the domestic mess, the
Taiwan leader embarked on a cross-continent trip abroad, which
stunned the public of Taiwan, and exposed his true colors of
intending to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan" in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the Taiwan leader has refused to
recognized the one-China principle, played the game of words on
the cross-Straits relations and vigorously promoting his splittism
to the rest of the world, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan leader slapped his own face by offering the money of
Taiwan tax-payers to his foreign hosts, though he had time and
again promised never to engage in the so-called "money diplomacy"
of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
It has been a fact that there is only one China in the world,
and the one-China principle has been widely recognized throughout
the international community, it said.
</P>
<P>
No matter what the tricks are and how much money they are going
to spend on the "money diplomacy," the one-China principle will
not be altered.
</P>
<P>
It will only bring disgrace to himself if the leader of Taiwan
continues to pursue the path of Lee Teng-hui and tries to
challenge the one-China principle, the commentary said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China'
s top legislature, said today that legislation on social security
must conform to the fundamental interests of the great masses.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark while presiding over a lecture on China's
Social Security system, which is the 16th in a series of lectures
on law sponsored by the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
As the establishment and perfection of the social security
system has great impact on China's reform, development and
stability, great attention should be attached to the work, Li
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called on China's lawmakers to summarize the country's
successful experiences on social security policies over the past
years, and at the same time, gain legislative experience on the
aspect from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li disclosed that the formation of the Law on Social Security
is already at the top of the present NPC Standing Committee's
agenda, and concerned departments should work harder so as to
submit the draft to the top legislature for deliberation as soon
as possible.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Meets Delegation From Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
met here today with a delegation from the United Daily News Group
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he was optimistic about the prospects of the
development of the cross-Straits relations, which have witnessed
expanded exchanges and cooperation in economic, cultural and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
However, there also exists some political hurdles between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits, said Qian, also a member of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
The major problem is that the leader of the Taiwan authorities
still refuses to consider himself a Chinese, evades the one-China
principle and plays word games resulting in the stalemate of cross-
Straits dialogues and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Qian told the visitors "Taiwan independence" will never be
accepted by the international community and the Chinese people,
including the majority of Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The earlier realization of direct trade, postal, air and
shipping services between the mainland and Taiwan is the ardent
wish of the people on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite Taiwan's promise of realizing the goal within the
year, there has been no concrete action to date. The major problem
that impedes the direct services lies on the side of Taiwan, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian also spoke highly of the media's role
in enhancing mutual understanding of people on both sides of the
Straits.
</P>
<P>
The seven member delegation is on a 10-day visit to the
mainland as guests of the Xinhua News Agency.

According to officials, the expansion of reform in the SEZs
will focus on systematic innovations, including adjustments in the
ownership structure, and transformation of functions of government
departments in accordance with international common practices.
</P>
<P>
The government should also simplify procedures to make it
easier to get businesses up and running and give a bigger role to
the market, while improving services, experts say.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, efforts must be made to improve the social
security system and the financing system, and have intermediary
organs operating according to standards.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming 50 years will be an important historical period
in China's drive to realize modernization and make the Chinese
nation's long-cherished dream of building a powerful China come
true.
</P>
<P>
Experts are confident that Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen,
and Hainan will set the pace in China's drive toward modernization.

<HEADLINE> SEZs: China's modernization Pacemakers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the opening-up drive swept other parts of the country, the
preferential policies were applied to more regions. The saying
that special economic zones are no longer special prevails in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the SEZs have not lost their vitality. And observers
say that the SEZs still shoulder a historical mission today.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the SEZs have been focusing on improving the
overall economic quality and on developing high-tech industries
and other economies with special features.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other parts of China, the SEZs still hold an edge
in utilizing domestic and overseas resources and markets and in
adapting themselves to international common practices to boost
economic development.
</P>
<P>
While fully expanding economic cooperation with multinationals,
Shenzhen is tightening ties with Hong Kong, and Xiamen and Hainan
with Taiwan. In Shantou, efforts have been made to attract
overseas Chinese, one of the major channels of overseas investment
to the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that improving overall economic performance is a
necessary choice for the SEZs as China will face fiercer
competition after its entry into the World Trade Organization. It
is the only way for them to realize modernization.
</P>
<P>
To hit the goal, analysts say, the SEZs should give national
treatment to overseas investors for more funding while making
efforts to open up overseas markets for their own companies
products.
</P>
<P>
By changing the past practice of offering preferential policies
to overseas investors in certain fields, the SEZs have lifted all
restrictions for them.

MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The launch of an RS-20 rocket
that is to put five foreign satellites into orbit has been delayed
by one day until 2 p.m. Moscow time (1000 GMT) Saturday, the
Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rocket was scheduled to blast off from Kazakhstan's

</P>
<P>
Specialists do not think the problems are significant, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The satellites include two from Italy, two from Saudi Arabia
and one from Malaysia. The launch will represent a space debut for
the Saudis and the Malaysians, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian satellites will be used for environmental
monitoring, and data transmission for commercial purposes as well
as education and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The two Saudi satellites, from the Saudi Arabian Space Research
Institute, are also designed for educational and scientific
purposes.

<HEADLINE> Rabobank Publishes Guidelines on Funding GMO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Rabobank, the world's biggest
lending bank to agriculture, published guidelines on Friday for
funding genetically modified organisms (GMO).
</P>
<P>
The Dutch bank group said in a statement that though it would
provide financing for the genetic modification of crops, the
technology of genetic modification should not be used if better
alternatives are available.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which lent out 30 billion euros (27 billion U.S.
dollars) last year, said it would not be involved in providing
funds for the genetic modification of human life.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of animals, the Rabobank group applies the 'No,
unless' principle," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank group claimed that it was the first financial
institution to have written out a code of conduct on genetic
modification.
</P>
<P>
It said the code of conduct would provide global guidance for
funding decisions within the bank group, but it is open to changes
since scientific and ethical dimensions are still developing.
</P>
<P>
The group will focus on projects which help preserve the
environment and human and animal health, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Rabobank estimated that its market share accounts for no more
than one to 2 percent of the world's 7 trillion dollar
agricultural market.
</P>
<P>
Genetic modification via implanting foreign genes is used in
agriculture to make crops resistant to insects or herbicides.
</P>
<P>
However, European environmentalists and consumer groups have
been protesting the marketing of genetically modified crops such
as maize and soybeans, claiming that potential dangers lurk in the
technology.
</P>
<P>
The discovery earlier this year that farmers in several
European Union (EU) countries had unknowingly planted genetically
modified rapeseed imported from Canada triggered a huge protest.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Former French Minister Attacks Government Policy on Corsica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Former French Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua Friday severely attacked the plan of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin to give more administrative and fiscal autonomy to
Corsica.
</P>
<P>
In a written plan published on July 20, Jospin proposed giving
Corsica more autonomous power in government and a new tax statute.
</P>
<P>
Pasqua, who is now president of the Neo-Gaullist Rally for
France, said in a statement to the press that each time the
government adopts "a policy of pacification" toward Corsica, a "
minority of fascists and racists" on the island will show up and
acts of violence increase.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized President Jacques Chirac for keeping silent
about the plan, which is also called "Matignon process" in
reference to the office building of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed that half of the French population support
Jospin's plan for Corsica, while the other half are opposed.
</P>
<P>
The political circles of France are also divided over the plan,
which will be discussed by the parliament in autumn.

<HEADLINE> Canada Geese Annoying Residents in Southern Ontario </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A population explosion in the
number of Canada geese is beginning to annoy the people of
southern Ontario. The big, noisy birds are reportedly invading
and taking over urban areas near the St. Lawrence River shoreline
and islands.
</P>
<P>
Most of the unwanted geese are coming from areas west of
Toronto, where the geese were introduced more than 20 years ago,
the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of geese has more than tripled in the past decade in
southern Ontario. There were 100,000 geese in 1990 and the number
reached 350,000 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
These southern "giant" geese have taken to farmland, golf
courses and lawns. They seem to like short-cut lawns, and have
become increasingly friendly and tame toward humans.
</P>
<P>
If you play golf at courses near the St. Lawrence River, you're
stepping around goose droppings all the time, according to local
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Every municipality in the Golden Horseshoe from Oshawa to
Niagara Falls in Ontario has become involved in some form of goose
control.
</P>
<P>
Authorities near the Pearson International and Toronto Island
airports have removed some geese and nests, while trying to
redesign the areas to be less attractive to them.
</P>
<P>
Other efforts include poking holes in eggs, rounding up adult
birds and shipping them out of town, and using shrubs and fences
to break up open areas where the geese feel secure.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Hail Result of Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Somali people in its
capital city of Mogadishu and many other cities and towns were
holding celebrations on Saturday to congratulate Abdiqasim Salad
Hassan on being newly elected first President of the state in
almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Ahmed Shakur, district commissioner of Bur Dhubo town,
told Xinhua how the people of the town still remained in the
streets, celebrating for the victory of Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of his people, Shakur has pledged full
support and congratulated for all of the Somalis wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
The people of Mogadishu who did not go to bed last night still
continue celebrating. The celebrations are also being held in many
other towns and regions such as Bay, Bakol, Gedo, Kismaio, Lower
Shabelle, Mudug, Galgudud.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the people have been so influenced by
politics of the country.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Mohamed Hussein Migwa working in a construction of a
building also told Xinhua how he is happy that at last Somalia can
now have a government. The porters, plumbers working under him
have likewise gathered together, chanting words supporting
President Hassan.
</P>
<P>
"We have been meaning to get a religious president for ages,"
said Ahmed Qalli, a watchman in Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
The-58-year-old Hassan was elected as Somali President early
Saturday morning after three rounds of presidential elections in
Arta, Djibouti, which lasted for more than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
Born in Dhusamareb district of Galgudud region, he had been a
long term minister in the former regime led by the late Siad Barre
which was overthrown in 1991. His last post in that regime was
the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, who himself looked tired, said a little after he was
officially declared the interim president of Somalia for the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his thanks for those voted for him and those who
didn't and also asked the people to forgive each other and prayed
for bringing a lasting peace and prosperity to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the faction leaders such as Hussein Mohamed Aidid
and Muse Sudi Yalahow have issued warnings against a possible
catastrophic fighting between what they called the Somalis and the
Djibouti established administration.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition of some of the faction leaders to this
administration, the people are jubilating and large scale of
fighting involved by the clannish militiamen of Mogadishu is less
likely.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the interim government will have its first
sitting place in Mogadishu, still Hassan is less likely to accept
any place other than Mogadishu where enjoys considerable support.

<HEADLINE> Angola Gains 6.5 Percent of Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola has seen an average 6.5
percent of annual economic growth rate in the past five years as
the government gradually transferred priority to economic
reconstruction in the war-torn country, an official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.
</P>
<P>
Jose Pedro de Morais was quoted on Thursday by the official
news agency Angop as saying at an economic seminar in the capital
Luanda that in 1993 the Angolan economy dropped by 25 percent due
to the civil war which erupted again in late 1992 soon after the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, however, the GDP recovered to the level of 1992, which
was estimated at some eight billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry has contributed a lot to the GDP expansion
with export income accounting for 83 percent of the GDP in 1999,
jumping from 70 percent of the GDP in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At present, the oil production in the second largest oil
producing country in Africa is estimated at 750,000 barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan National Bank (BNA), meanwhile, has been trying to
stabilize the financial situation by reducing money supply,
cutting the inflation rate from four digits in 1995 to three
digits in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Further drop in inflation to two digits is expected next year
after reforms was implemented with the liberalization of the
interest rates as well as the foreign exchange market, according
to the IMF official.
</P>
<P>
The Angola government has also been trying to attract foreign
investment in developing abundant oil, diamond and fisheries
resources.
</P>
<P>
As the security situation eased following the government forces
inflicted heavy losses on the UNITA rebels in a mass offensive
launched in late 1999, the Angolan government hoped to bring peace
and prosperity to the country ravaged by the 25-year civil war.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Geared up for Clinton Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 extra policemen have
been called to the Nigerian capital Abuja from the surrounding
states ahead of U.S. President Bill Clinton' s upcoming visit to
the west African country on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government is expected to ask Clinton to help
forgive the country's 31 billion U.S. dollars of external debt,
local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government had advised Nigerians against an "
exaggerated expectation" on Clinton' s visit, the second by an
American president after Jimmy Carter in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Susan Rice, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs, said earlier in Washington that Nigeria is not eligible
for the "Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative" on debt relief.
But she promised to help Nigeria reschedule its debt to make it "
manageable".

<HEADLINE> Mandela Criticizes West for Neglecting Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Africa is being neglected
by Western powers who should do more to prevent conflicts plaguing
the continent, former South African President Nelson Mandela said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South African Institute of International
Affairs at the University of the Witwatersrand, Mandela lambasted
the West's apparent unwillingness to become involved in Africa,
while readily going to the aid of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Citing Rwanda as an example, Mandela said observers had
frequently noted the failure of the West to intervene and end the
genocide in the central African nation.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone was another example of the West's neglect, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While Nato prepared itself for action in Kosovo, Sierra Leone
seemed a virtually forsaken place from an international
perspective," he said.
</P>
<P>
As atrocities were carried out in Sierra Leone, the weaponry
funding, communications and intelligence promised by Western
powers failed to materialize, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said ethnic tensions which ignited the genocide in
Rwanda continued to play a role in the conflicts in neighboring
Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We are not suggesting that these and other African conflicts
can be subjected to the same template of conflict resolution or
that the actions of Kosovo can simply be transplanted to the
conflicts on this continent," said the former president.
</P>
<P>
"We in Africa and Asia must, however, envy the readiness and
willingness on the part of the international community to
intervene and commit resources to the reconstruction of Kosovo
society," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government to Seize 509 More Farms for Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Friday
announced the compulsory acquisition of another 509 farms for
resettlement of landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
Under its fast-track resettlement program, the government
earlier identified 3,041 farms for the resettlement exercise.

Nearly 2,000 families countrywide have been resettled since the
fast-track resettlement scheme began in June this year on 81,321
hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to acquire at least five million hectares
to resettle thousands of landless Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean liberation war veterans have occupied over 1,000
white-owned farms since February this year to demand the
government speed up land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1980 when the government embarked on the
resettlement program some 60,000 families have been resettled on 3.
3 million hectares of land countrywide.

<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone government on
Friday released 171 rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
fighters from various prisons of the country, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The release was announced by President Tejan Kabbah on Monday
as a peace gesture following the RUF chose its field commander
Issa Sesay to replace detained Foday Sankoh as the interim leader.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone government saw the change of leadership as a
signal that the RUF wanted to reopen talks with the government to
revive the Lome peace accord signed in July last year after the
abduction of about 500 UN peacekeepers by the RUF in May.
</P>
<P>
However, two Nigerian peacekeeping soldiers were seriously
wounded when the RUF rebels attacked their unit in the Port Loko
region on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> 12 Leaders Confirm to Witness Signing of Burundi Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Twelve heads of state and
government, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, have confirmed
to witness the signing of the Burundi peace agreement in northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete told a news conference that more
invited leaders were likely to make their confirmations over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders to participate in the signing ceremony are
presidents Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Benjamin
Mkapa of Tanzania, Bakili Muluzi of Malawi, Festus Mogae of
Botswana, Pierre Buyoua of Burundi, Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, Paul
Kagame of Rwanda, King Mswati of Swaziland and Lesotho Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said Libya, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium will be represented by senior government officials and
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim
Ahmed Salim as well as representatives from the United Nations,
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
European Union will also witness the historical event.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Clinton, who arrives in Tanzania on Monday
afternoon from Nigeria, will hold talks with Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a Burundi government delegation left
the capital Bujumbura Friday morning for Arusha while Burundi
peace facilitator Nelson Mandela is expected to arrive in Arusha
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Facilitator's representative Mark Bomani said that Mandela
would meet with the 19 Burundian delegations involved in the peace
talks in Arusha to try to reach a consensus on points of
disagreement in draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Mandela will make compromise proposal on the issues that have
not yet been resolved," he added .
</P>
<P>
The sticking points include who will lead Burundi's
transitional government and the implementation of a cease-fire in
a seven-year-old civil war between Hutu rebel groups and army and
government which are dominated by the Tutsi minority, which left
more than 200,000 people dead and a further 1.2 million displaced.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were initiated by former Tanzanian president
Julius Nyerere in June 1998 and have been beefed up by former
South African president Nelson Mandela since he succeeded Nyerere
as the facilitator in December 1999 following the latter's death
of leukemia.

Addressing a press conference in the capital Monrovia, Liberian
Justice Minister Eddington Varmah, who is also Attorney-General,
said that the decision was made "on humanitarian grounds"
following consultation with President Charles Taylor.

Liberia did not drop charges against the defendants "because of
lack of evidence or in reaction to pressure from any source",
Varmah said in a statement, adding that the action was "entirely
on humanitarian grounds" following apologies from both the
defendants and their employer were forwarded to the Liberian
government.
</P>
<P>
"They may continue to enjoy the warm hospitality and goodwill

<HEADLINE> S. African Trade with U.S. to Be Boosted by New Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African business can
look forward to a massive boost in trade opportunities with the
United States with the imminent implementation of the Africa
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which will slash import duties,
the U.S. embassy said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, inadequate customs procedures certifying point of
origin for clothing and apparel could delay the eligibility of
duty-free status for South African textiles under AGOA, U.S.
economic affairs counselor to South Africa Bob Godec told
reporters in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
At present, only Mauritius had adequate controls in place over
point of origin, he said.
</P>
<P>
Godec said a wide range of African products would enjoy duty-
free status into the U.S. market -- provided the exporting
countries met certain conditions -- once the act came into effect
on October 1.
</P>
<P>
"AGOA presents remarkable new opportunities for African
business... because we are sincerely interested in the prosperity
of Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade concessions were expected to create about 66,000
jobs in South Africa's textile industry alone, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The act, which was signed into law by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on May 18 this year, extends the scope of duty-free status
currently in place in terms of the Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP).
</P>
<P>
The GSP gives designated African countries duty-free status on
about 4,600 products.
</P>
<P>
Godec said the act would extend this concession for a further
eight years.
</P>
<P>
AGOA adds up to 1,897 products to the list and allows clothing
and apparel made in eligible African countries, with either
African or U.S. fabrics, to be imported into the U.S. duty-free.
Currently, an average 17.5 percent tariff is levied on textiles
imported into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
It also gives sub-Sahara African countries improved access to U.
S. credit and technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
The act would also increase the "cap" on textile imports from
Africa from 1.5 percent of total U.S. clothing imports to 3.5
percent over eight years, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imported clothing and apparel worth about 60 billion U.
S. dollars each year, and the figure was expected to double over
the next eight years, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The act also removes quotas on textile imports by qualifying
countries.
</P>
<P>
Godec warned, however, that countries would only qualify for
the concession on clothing if its government had in place an
adequate "visa system".
</P>
<P>
This was essential to ensure the goods were not originally
imported for other regions.
</P>
<P>
"It would be to the advantage of South Africa to move fairly
quickly to put the visa system in place," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows 5.3 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 5.3 percent in the second quarter of this year,
slightly higher than the previous estimate of 5.2 percent, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross domestic product (GDP), the nation's
total output of goods and services, in the second quarter
surpassed the growth in the first quarter when the economy grew at
a 4.8 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
The government said the GDP growth was attributed to increases
in business investment and government spending that offset a
slowdown in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all
economic activities, rose at a 2.9 percent rate in the second
quarter, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 1997. In the
first quarter, consumer spending surged at a 7.6 percent rate, a
17-year high.
</P>
<P>
But business investment, including spending on computers and
other equipment, increased at an annual rate of 14.6 percent in
the second quarter. That compared with a 21 percent rate posted in
the first quarter. Businesses also increased their spending on
inventories, adding to second-quarter growth.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to growth was increased spending by the
federal government, which rose at a whopping annual rate of 16.9
percent in the second quarter. That compared with a 14.2 percent
rate of decrease in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, however, continued to be a drag on
growth. The bloated deficit subtracted 1.2 percentage points from
growth in the second quarter, compared to a reduction of 0.9
percentage points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
All the changes show the economy grew at an annual rate of 119.
7 billion U.S. dollars in the second quarter, pushing the country'
s total output of goods and services to 9.3 trillion dollars,
after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the GDP, and closely watched by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose at an unrevised
annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from a 3.5
percent rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times over
the last 14 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control. On Tuesday, the Fed decided to leave interest rates
unchanged, but left the door open to further rate increases should
tight labor markets spark wage and price pressures down the road.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the National Association of Realtors
reported that existing-home sales plunged 9.8 percent in July to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units as higher
mortgage rates cut into demand.
</P>
<P>
In the current quarter, many analysts believe the economy has
slowed to a growth rate of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government also reported Friday that after-tax profits of U.
S. corporations grew by 2.4 percent in the second quarter, down
from the 5.7 percent in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Respond to U.N. Chief's Call to Sign, Ratify Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- An exceptional response
has been generated to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call to
all heads of State or Government to use the unique opportunity
afforded by the forthcoming Millennium Summit to sign, ratify or
accede to key treaties to which they are not yet a party, U.N.
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Summit will be largest-ever gathering of world leaders and
will be held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from
September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
To date, 69 States have informed the Secretary-General that
they will participate in the event during the three-day summit by
singing, ratifying or accede to a number of multilateral treaties
of which he is the custodian, according to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The majority of states will undertake treaty actions at the
presidential or prime ministerial level, and some will sign or
deposit instruments of ratification relating to over seven
treaties each, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said most treaty actions will relate to approximately
37 treaties, the majority of which cover human rights, disarmament,
the environment, and international criminal law.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of May 15, 2000 sent to all heads of state or
government, the Secretary-General informed the world leaders that
he would provide special facilities to enable them to add their
signatures to any of the more than 500 treaties deposited with him.
</P>
<P>
He drew special attention to a core group of 25 multilateral
treaties, among them those dealing with landmines, rights of women
and children, and climate change.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Seven people have been burnt to
death in Greece in recent days as a total of 106 forest fires are
still raging in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The death of three men and four women, all aged over 70 years,
were reported to be in the northern prefecture of Ioannina.
Unconfirmed reports said there were two people missing.

</P>
<P>
The government has also asked Israel and Germany to help deal
with the fires, which have already destroyed vast areas of forests

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- State-of-the-art
technology, including high-definition television, digital
photography and webcasting, will make the United Nations
Millennium Summit a truly 21st century event, U.N. said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Further to an initiative by the Japanese government, the Japan
Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) has offered on a pro bono basis
services and equipment to the United Nations for its coverage of
the Millennium Summit with high-definition television technology (
HDTV), according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
NHK's offer will include the first-ever use in the General
Assembly Hall of two large-scale television projection screens
throughout the summit, the United Nations said.
</P>
<P>
HDTV, which has previously been used at the annual U.N. World
Television Forum in New York, provides high-resolution digital
images with CD sound quality and is considered to be the next-
generation television technology.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 high-definition cameras and eight high-definition

<HEADLINE> Popularity of Taoism Testifies Religious Freedom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The fact that there are
countless Taoist followers in China testifies that there is true
religious freedom in the country, a leading Chinese Taoist master
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Master Min Zhiting, a member of a Chinese religious leaders
delegation, told reporters that there are so many people in China
who believe or practise the indigenous Taoism that it is very
difficult for him to give an accurate number of followers.
</P>
<P>
Taoism, though an ancient and multi-god religion, is by no
means equal to feudal superstition, the master stressed. Many
ancestors who have made great contribution to social progress are
respected as gods by Taoists and worshipped in temples or shrines
built for them, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 1,600 Taoist temples across China
where more than 26,000 Taoist priests and nuns lead religious life,
he said. But it is very difficult to give an exact number of
believers because many of them do not live in Taoist temples as
priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
An annual temple fair sponsored by the Taoist Temple of White
Clouds in Beijing on every lunar Chinese New Year, for example,
attracts as many as 300,000 visitors who went to the temple to
worship Taoist gods and pray for blessings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taoist temples built on famous mountains in China
such as Mount Tai and Mount Hua where, according to tradition,
celestial beings lived or ancient Taoists had practiced
austerities and become immortal are also very popular among
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Taoism itself is a proof that there is
religious freedom in china, Master Min noted.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, comprising leaders of China's top five
religions, is here for a goodwill visit to the United States at
the invitation of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation before
attending the Millennium World Peace Summit of religious leaders
to be held at the U.N. headquarters on August 28.

MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday criticized as "
discriminatory" neighboring Latvia's language law which will come

<P>
"Latvia will see yet another legislative act aimed at
discriminating against the assimilation of national minorities,"
the document said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow accuses the Latvian authorities of "continuing to ignore
the demands of the majority of the Latvian people and the European
human rights standards."

silent tolerance of Latvia's discriminatory policy against

MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) met Friday in
southwestern Russia to discuss the situation in Central Asia, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense chiefs from Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Belarus, Ukraine and Tajikistan attended the meeting in the
Ashuluk testing ground in Astrakhan.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were represented by army command

"The military actions unleashed by international terrorists in
southwest Kyrgyzstan and southern Uzbekistan are regarded by the
Commonwealth's defense ministers as a threat and challenge to the

</P>
<P>
The defense chiefs at the meeting are assessing such actions as

They believe that in the current situation, the states should
not merely coordinate, but should combine military, political and
technical efforts to neutralize the threat of the proliferation of
international terrorism.

The defense chiefs have worked out a number of concrete
measures toward stability in Central Asia, which they plan to
submit to the CIS heads of state for approval.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan oil closed the week
at 28.68 U.S. dollars per barrel, 1.11 dollars above last week's
price, the Mines and Energy Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The average price for the year is 25.75 dollars per barrel, far
higher than the 16.04 dollars in 1999 and the 10.57 dollars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the recent rise in oil price to the drop in
the inventories of the countries that are big oil consumers, such
as is the United States.
</P>
<P>
Oil, which constitutes the engine of the Venezuelan economy,
provides 70 percent of the hard currency the country needs, and
more than half of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate that Venezuela's annual oil income will
increase by about 1 billion dollars if the oil price surges one
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Promises Tougher Anti-Pedophilia Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will toughen
up existing measures against pedophiles and create a team of
ministers to help protect children, Social Affairs Minister Livia
Turco said here Friday after the government's first post-summer
recess session.
</P>
<P>
Turco said the initiatives were the best way to fight
pedophilia since "there is no magic formula" against it, and
stressed that it was "dangerous" to propose illusory solutions
such as the initiative taken by maverick daily Libero this week
when it published lists of condemned pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
"The main message we want to get across today is that the
entire community is as responsible for each child as if it were
its own -- if this attitude does not exist, our policies will
never be effective," she said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet agreed to form a group of ministers to monitor the
progress of anti- pedophilia measures and education programs aimed
at curbing the malaise which in recent days stirred up outrage
across the country after last weekend's back-to-back rapes and
murders of two young girls.
</P>
<P>
According to Turco, one of the main points of the campaign
against pedophilia is creating support and information systems for
parents of minors, as well as offering therapy for pedophiles in
order to eliminate the problem at the source.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government will also instill training programs for
teachers, whose extensive contact with children could make them
crucial in spotting signs of pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, the country's Children's Day will give the
government an chance to turn the spotlight on its anti-pedophilia
campaign: informative pamphlets for parents of minors will be
distributed in order to teach them how to be on the look-out for
any troubling signs in their children.
</P>
<P>
One of the trickier topics the group of ministers will have to
face is that of the presence of police in schools, an idea which
rose out of anti-pedophilia debates earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Italian Interior Minister Enzo Bianco Friday retracted previous
promises to implement information sessions for school children by
law enforcement officers about pedophiles, while Education
Minister Tullio De Mauro suggested police involvement be used only
as an "exterior" preventative measure.
</P>
<P>
Bianco also said that, together with Justice Minister Piero
Fassino, he will work toward forming an information pool dealing
with pedophilia for prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to copy the system already used for terrorism and
the mafia," Fassino said, which uses a powerful information
database to track perpetrators.

"These measures also demonstrate Canada's support for the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and its efforts to promote further trade
liberalization," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's new tariff measures came as a result of months of
consultations among WTO members, who are responding to a four-
point plan by the trade organization to help build confidence in
the world trading system among developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Mexico-C. America Summit Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth Tuxtla Political
Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism Summit started Friday in
Guatemala City to promote cooperation between Mexico and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
The forum is attended by presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico,
Alfonso Portillo of Guatemala, Carlos Flores Facusse of Honduras,
Franciso Flores of El Salvador, Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua, and
Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica, according to reports from
Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
Belize Prime Minister Said Musa and Panamanian Vice President
Arturo Vallarino also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Integration and the war against international crime are our
big problems. The world demands from us unity; the world claims
for integration. It is worthless to be isolated in this globalized
world," said Guatemalan President Portillo in the opening speech.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and seven Central American countries seek in this one-
day meeting regional agreements in issues such as drug trafficking,
illegal weapon trafficking and common positions in international
policies.
</P>
<P>
The countries of the area seek to consolidate their trade
relations for the promotion of the financing of development.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders will analyze a common strategy to combat
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
They will also tackle development projects, among which is the
construction of a 1,400 kilometer long gas pipeline to take
Mexican natural gas to Guatemala and other countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The summit ends Friday with the signing of the Guatemala
Declaration to encompass the commitments of the governments in
economic, commercial, financial, migratory, and security issues,
among others.
</P>
<P>
The Tuxtla mechanism of political coordination and cooperation,
the biggest forum of cooperation between Mexico and Central
America was created in 1991, with the first summit held in Tuxtla
Gutierrez, capital of the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
The second summit was held in Costa Rica in 1995, and the third
in El Salvador in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bush Promises to Strengthen Ties With Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush said Friday that he would strengthen ties
with Latin America if he wins a presidential victory in November.
</P>
<P>
"Our future cannot be separated from the future of Latin
America," Bush said in a speech at Florida International
University.
</P>
<P>
"The Clinton-Gore administration has had no strategy," he said.
"We have seen summits without substance, and reaction instead of
action.... We were promised a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Yet
it never happened."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Clinton administration for losing lucrative
business deal in Latin America, namely in Mexico and Chile, to the
European Union and Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I don't fault our European friends for making these deals," he
said. "We dropped the ball, and they are running with it."
</P>
<P>
Bush promised that he would resume suspended free-trade talks
with Chile and other Latin American nations once he is elected.
</P>
<P>
The campaign camp of Democratic presidential candidate Vice
President Al Gore immediately slammed Bush's efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Governor Bush has shown that he is not ready to represent the
United States on the international stage," said Gore national
spokesman Douglas Mattaway.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Cuba, Bush said he was opposed to any relaxation
of the almost 40-year-old economic embargo against Havana.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Tells Rebel Not To Fear Clinton's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana said Friday that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) must not fear the forthcoming visit  of U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The rebel FARC declared Thursday "non grata" Clinton's presence
in Colombia who will arrive on August 30 in the Caribbean city of
Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will state his support for the Plan Colombia, a
strategy proposed by the Pastrana administration against drugs,
with investments of 7.5 billion U.S. dollars, to which the United
States will contribute 1.3 billion dollars, most of it in military
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that the Plan Colombia aims at combating drug
trafficking. The guerrillas have said that they do not have
anything to do with drug trafficking. In consequence, they have
nothing to fear," said Pastrana to the press in the Caribbean
island of San Andres, where he attended a forum.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that "70 percent (of the Plan Colombia) is aimed
at social investment. I cannot see how any Colombian can oppose
this."
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rios, one of the FARC spokesmen, who has been holding
peace talks with the government since October 1999, said that "
Clinton does not come in peace, nor to support the efforts for a
political solution to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug plan threatens the peace process and means "a
real danger of generalization of the war," added the rebel leader.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trying to Placate Fear of Colombian Neighbors over U.S.-Involved Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
tried hard to placate Latin Americans' fear over its increasing
involvement in Colombia's military action against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan, and there is no proposal, and there is no
idea of committing American forces in Colombia to do anything but .
..training," Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as the Clinton administration will pour 1.3
billion U.S. dollars in aid into Colombia over the next two years
to back up a drive against drug traffickers and armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton will make a five-hour visit to Colombia
next week to endorse the U.S. support for the drug war.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's neighbors fear that the militarization of the drug
war will push the fighting over their borders, along with waves of
refugees and displacement of the drug trade itself.
</P>
<P>
Pickering called the fear of Latin American nations fear a "
misunderstanding" of U.S. efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil has ruled out military cooperation with the
United States in Colombia. It is also concerned about the
environmental fallout in the Amazon jungle from the use of
chemicals to destroy Colombia's drug plantations.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela distances itself from the U.S. strategy in Colombia
by refusing to allow American planes to fly over its territory on
drug missions.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Friday as investors continued to search for guidance on the market
direction after the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest
rates alone earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 9.89 at 11,192.63.
The blue chip index rose in the previous four sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 10.60 at 4,042.68 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 2.87 at 1,506.45.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks opened lower on profit-taking and bounced
back then, lifting the Dow index higher at the finish. Investors
moved in the market in the late session to buy some big stocks
such as International Business Machine Corp. for safety.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index fell as traders sold some stocks to lock in
profits from a rally in the previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
Investors have stayed on sideline to search for the market
direction since the Federal Reserve decided to leave rates
unchanged at a monetary policy meeting Tuesday. They were happy
with the move but remained concerned about corporate earnings
because of the slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
Two government reports had little effect on the market. One
report said the U.S. gross domestic product grew 5.3 percent in
the second quarter, meeting analysts' expectations and the other
said existing-home sales plunged 9.8 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.59 at 672.53 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.87 at 934.81. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.81 at 525.11.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,457 up, 1,354 down and 531
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 670.68 million shares from 816.79

"The minimal level of nuclear arms necessary for Russia must be

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Concerted Efforts Bear Fruit for Somali Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
ARTA, Djibouti, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Somali transitional
parliament Saturday elected former interior minister Abdiqasim
Salad Hassan as its first head of state in almost a decade,
marking a great success of the Somali Peace Conference being held
in Arta, Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The eight-hour-odd long presidential election, which followed
the selection of the country's speaker of the parliament by
representatives of Somali clans six days ago, will definitely pave
the way to put an end of insecurity of the nation that has been
living in chaos and violence without central government since the
downfall of the Siyad Barre regime in 1991 and give an impetus to
the long-waited national reconciliation in the Horn of Africa
country.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the success of the Somali Peace Conference,
which brings about fruitful results one after another, firstly lie
in the sustained efforts being made by the world society in
solving Somali problems.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the current Somali Peace Conference which began here
on May 2, the past decade witnessed at least 12 international
peace conferences that focused on political settlement of civil
war in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being discouraged by the successive failure of the
previous meetings, the world society has been drawing lessons from
the past and making its unremitting efforts to push forward the
Somali peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that Djibouti sponsored the first Somali
Peace Conference in 1991. The fact that it is again hosting the
Somali peace meeting after a nine-year suspension is exactly an
example of such efforts.
</P>
<P>
Scientific practice shows that external causes will play no
role in the changes of natural world unless they combine with the
internal ones. The success or failure of the Somali peace process
will by no means depart from this natural law.
</P>
<P>
Nobody is able to stop the Somalis from fighting each other
unless they themselves are willing to do so, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Somali Peace Conference began, faction and elder
clan leaders, and representatives from industrial, commercial and
cultural sectors held discussions on how to eliminate
contradictions existing among various clans for many years. Under
the direct mediation by Djibouti President Ismael Omar Gulleh,
they finally reached a consensus with the participants to the
peace conference on a number of issues ranging from the end of
civil war, the establishment of central government to the
realization of country's unification and the resumption of state
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
This really created favorable conditions for the successful
peace conference.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Somali people, prompted by their eagerness for
peace and a democratic central government, are apparently choosing
a way to national reconciliation by their own.
</P>
<P>
It is under such circumstances, namely the sustained
international mediation plus Somali people's willingness for peace,
that have made the great success of the on-going Somali Peace
Conference possible.
</P>
<P>
Being a turning point of the country's peace process, the
launch of the Somali Peace Conference is yet to say everything is
just fine.
</P>
<P>
Of all the difficulties for the democratically elected state
authority, the protruding one is that the new leaders of Somalia
will have to face sooner or later the challenges from warlords
scattered in the various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
To this point, Speaker of the Somali transitional parliament
Abdulla Dero Issak looked quite confident. He indicated that "no
war will continue in Somalia because 99 percent of the Somali
population will come to us."

<P>
MANILA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Italy defeated
here Friday their respective opponents for a higher consolation
finish but the pure thrilling action has yet to come Saturday when
the top four teams meet in the cross-over semi-finals of the World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix 2000.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans leaned anew on their famed solid defense and
power in sweeping the uninspired Americans, 25-23, 25-23, 25-19,
to clinch fifth place while the Italians recovered from opening
set loss to beat Japan, 19-25, 25-21, 25-11, 25-19 for seventh
place.
</P>
<P>
Top spiker Ku Min-jung spearheaded anew the Koreans with 18
points, including 17 on attack, while the Italians were led by
Francesa Piccinni, Elisa Togut and Darina Mifkova who scored 14
points apiece.
</P>
<P>
With their fifth-place finish, the South Koreans pocketed a
consolation prize of 30,000 dollars, while the Americans took home
the sixth-placer's 25,000 dollars consolation prize. Both South
Korea and the United States finished with identical 5-6 win-loss
card.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, who suffered a huge slump from their fourth-place

finish last year after winning only twice, all of them against
Japan, in 11 matches, received a 20,000-dollar cash award.
</P>
<P>
Despite finishing dead last with no single win in 11 matches,
the Japanese brought home a consolation prize of 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the third preliminary round that saw Russia, Brazil,
Italy and South Korea displaying their world-class winning form,
the Filipino fans get another chance to see more powerhouse
countries in volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Joining defending champion Russia and Brazil in the semis are
another two teams from the China leg, which are the top semi-
finalists and undefeated Cuba and China.

Friday said he would not take part in the Sydney Games due to
illness.
</P>

He noted that "in such circumstances, it is no use to keep
dreaming of the Games. I have to be in top shape to achieve
anything out there, and there is no way I can do that."

<HEADLINE> Ferreira Vows to Do Best in U.S. Open and Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African tennis player
Wayne Ferreira said on Friday that he is confident he can do well
at next week's U.S. Open tennis championship and the ensuing
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, who has been back recently in the top 20 for the
first time over the past three years, was last ranked 20 on May 26
1997 but injury and a lack of motivation saw him tumble out of the
top 50.
</P>
<P>
However, the new and invigorated Ferreira has reached the
fourth round of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a really good summer in the U.S. and I've had a lot
of fun," said Ferreira in a telephone interview call from
California, the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I've been feeling good about my game again and I think I can
do well at both the U.S. Open and the Olympics," the tennis player
said.
</P>
<P>
While Ferreira wants to do well at the U.S. Open, he also has
his heart set on winning a medal at the Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"In some ways the Olympics is even bigger for me than any Grand
Slam. I don't get too many chances to play for my country and it
is certainly an honour for me to be playing in my third Olympics,"
Ferreira said.
</P>
<P>
At the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, Ferreira won silver in the
doubles with Pietie Norval and in Atlanta lost to American Agassi.

<P>
ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Olympic organisers in Athens face
a race against time to ensure preparations for the 2004 Games are
completed, the head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
co-ordinating commissions, Jacques Rogge, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two months after the introduction of a new leadership team to
head the Athens Olympic Games Organizing Committee (ATHOC), Rogge
said that progress had been made, but there was still a mountain
to climb.
</P>
<P>
"Time is critical," said Rogge. "This concern is obviously
shared by all parties. We have been assured deadlines will be
respected and even brought forward where necessary. ATHOC is now
on track, but the clock is ticking."
</P>
<P>
The IOC said in a statement Friday that time constraints
concerning long-haul projects like infrastructure, transport,
construction and technology were now the concern of the ATHOC and
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the full IOC co-ordinating commission would
return to Athens on November 22-24 to review the lessons learned
from the Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> SEZs: China's modernization Pacemakers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- With the approaching of the 20th
anniversary of China's four earliest special economic zones (SEZs)
on August 26, the cities of Shenzhen, Xiamen, Zhuhai and Shantou,
and Hainan Province have all mapped out development blueprints for
the new century.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Gaoli, secretary of the Communist Party of China's
Shenzhen committee, said that the goal of Shenzhen is to basically
realize modernization by 2005 and reach the level of moderately
developed countries by 2010 and that of developed countries in
2030.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's counterpart in Xiamen, Hong Yongshi, pledged that his
city would make progress in modernization with indexes regarding
the economy, science and technology, and social development
meeting or closing to the requirements of modernization in five
years.
</P>
<P>
In Zhuhai, officials vowed to realize modernization in 2007
while their colleagues in Shantou promised to build the city into
a modernized port city in the world by 2008.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Province, the largest of China's SEZs set up 12 years
ago, has a new ambitious plan to streamline its agriculture,
marine economy and tourism while promoting urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that by setting the goals for modernization,
the SEZs are still leading other parts of the country in
development as they were 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, local authorities in Shenzhen, encouraged and
supported by senior Chinese leaders including Deng Xiaoping, were
determined to blaze a trail for China's reform and opening-up
drive.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has then become a window of the country to the outside
world and a platform for reform measures, along with Xiamen,
Zhuhai and Shantou.
</P>
<P>
To ensure successful reform and opening-up in the SEZs, China
introduced a wide range of special preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market
managed to stay on the positive territory this week, although it
almost wiped off all its gains on a nose-dive on Wednesday in the
wake of a round of usual profit-taking activities.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen B-share index inched up 0.32 points or 0.25
percent to 126.49 at the end of the week, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover increased sharply to 1.85 billion Hong
Kong dollars, which was 1.17 billion Hong Kong dollars or 169.62
percent more than the total of last week, hitting a one-week
record high since December of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Providing the trigger for the market's reversal were rumors
that China's A and B shares won't merge, later denied as
misinterpreted remarks from State Development and Planning
Minister Zeng Peiyan.
</P>
<P>
The later sessions in the week were subject to choppy,
directionless trading, with the index stuck to lows, as investors
continued to be hesitant to commit. Bargain hunters did not pull
the market out of the red, and any buying move lacked conviction.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that a lackluster week will have
grip on the market with trading on the lighter side and investors
on the sidelines in a cautious mood. Poor corporate outlook is
enough to keep the index from picking up steam for a period.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B-Share Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market was
plagued with extremely choppy trading this week, after the market'
s attempt to advance had fizzled as the buying continued to lack
conviction, while the selling resumed its vigor and rumor stories.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai B-share index tumbled 5.46 points or 11.71 percent
to 72.77 at the end of the week, posting its largest weekly
decline in one month, according to Homeway, China's leading
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover extended to 433.98 million U.S. dollars,
which was 179.13 million U.S. dollars or 70.29 percent more than
the total of last week.
</P>
<P>
After starting the week on a dynamic note, the market reversed
courses in a very abrupt fashion. The sudden meltdown of the
market was considered being triggered by rumors that China's A and
B shares won't merge, later denied as misinterpreted remarks from
the State Development and Planning Minister Zeng Peiyan.
</P>
<P>
Given that rumors had been cleared, the market started trimming
its heavy losses as bargain hunters came to the rescue. However,
investors' sentiment became fragile and confidence seemed not very
easy to be restored, so that the market failed to materialize a
recovery, leaving the index stuck around its lows.
</P>
<P>
And the key point, analysts say, lies in that the recent gains
hardly match the performance of Chinese companies. State media
reported in July that more than 100 Chinese companies -- almost
one out of every ten publicly traded firms-- will report first-
half losses.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predict that it is likely to be a pretty
volatile week ahead as the market will be traded with little
direction. It sill takes time for the aggressive nature to prevail
again.

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP Grows 10.3 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Gross Domestic Product (
GDP) of Hong Kong attained a double-digit growth, at 10.8 percent
in real terms in the second quarter of 2000 over a year earlier,
after a 14.3 percent growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate in real terms of GDP for 2000 is
raised from 6 percent in the earlier forecast to 8.5 percent,
according to the Half-yearly Economic Report 2000 released by the
Hong Kong government Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of goods had double-digit growth for three
consecutive quarters, rising by 17.7 percent in real terms in the
second quarter of 2000 over a year earlier. This was underpinned
by strong global and regional demand and improved price
competitiveness of Hong Kong's exports.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending attained a further appreciable year-on-year
growth of 5.2 percent in real terms, in tandem with increased
overall income and sustained improvement in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The labor market generally improved further. The seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate fell distinctly, from 5.6 percent in
the first quarter of 2000 to 5.0 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the government predicted that exports of goods
and services should gain further support from the intense demand
across virtually all the major markets, including the United
States, Europe, China's mainland, and the rest of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Apart from re-exports, offshore trading, inbound tourism and
business services are expected to be the major growth lines.
</P>
<P>
In the domestic sector, a firmer consumer sentiment amidst the
improved labor market conditions should continue to uphold
consumer spending. Also, a better business outlook coupled with
the desire to upgrade productive efficiency and quality should
continue to spur investment spending.

BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council will authorize its subordinate office in southwest
China's Chongqing Municipality to handle the application from
Taiwan media for interviews in the city as of September 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1997, the Taiwan Affairs Office granted related
offices of 12 provinces and cities to handle interview application
from Taiwan press.
</P>
<P>
Journalistic visits are the major component of press exchanges
across the Taiwan Straits. The mainland has always encouraged such
exchanges. The Taiwan Affairs Office issued special regulations
concerning Taiwan reporters' visits to the mainland in 1996 that
further simplified procedures.
</P>
<P>
In practice and especially in case of an emergency, related
departments do their utmost to provide convenience for Taiwan
reporters, with some applications approved on the same day.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 5,000 Taiwan reporters have visited the
mainland in recent years, while only some 200 mainland reporters
have been to Taiwan. None of the mainland media has been able to
send reporters to the island due to obstacles by the Taiwan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The mainland press expect the Taiwan authorities to take
immediate steps to show their sincerity in promoting press
exchanges of the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Largest Copyright Dispute in China Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A copyright dispute involving 29
famous contemporary writers was settled today in the Beijing First
Intermediate People's Court, with the writers winning the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest copyright dispute in China since 1949 in
terms of the number of writers involved.
</P>
<P>
The 29 writers, including Ba Jin and Wang Meng, made a lawsuit
to the court around June, accusing the Jilin Photo Publishing
House and the Beijing Xinhua Book Co. Ltd of infringing copyright
by illegally publishing and distributing a book series titled "
Classical Essays by Famous Chinese Writers in the Twenty Century".
</P>
<P>
The book series include essays by these writers, and the
publisher neither sought permission from the writers nor
remunerated them.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the writers appealed to the court for stopping the
distribution of the book series and asked the Jinlin Province-
based publisher to pay 99,000 yuan for infringing copyright and 10,
000 yuan in compensation to each writer.
</P>
<P>
After legal proceedings, the court handed down its verdict,
ordering the publisher to pay 23,760 yuan to each of the 29
writers for copyright infringement, and to stop distributing the
book series immediately while publishing written apologies in
newspapers.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Launches Website on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
launched a new website, www.freeconomy.org, Friday in an effort to
promote Hong Kong's image as one of the freest economies in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Hong Kong and the Pursuit of Economic Freedom," the
website provides comprehensive information including Hong Kong's
economic policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
"Economic freedom is, above all, about openness, transparency,
freedom of speech and the free and unfettered flow of information
at all levels -- government, business, politics," said Donald
Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was ranked as the world's freest economy by the
Fraser Institute, the Hong Kong Center for Economic Research and
the Cato Institute in January this year, and by the Heritage
Foundation in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The website encapsulates the government's commitment to
transparency, open government and economic freedom, he said.
</P>
<P>
It has taken six months to develop the website through the
joint efforts of the Information Services Department of Hong Kong
and a team led by David Dodwell, co-author of the "Hong Kong
Advantage" study published in 1997 which examined the competitive
strengths and weaknesses of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
The site is in both English and Chinese and has an audio
version for the sight-impaired. It will in due course be available
in French, German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that academics, economists, officials of other
governments, researchers for think-tanks and financial
organizations, and anyone interested in economic matters will find
this a valuable, thought-provoking resource," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Dispute Settled in China's Tianjin Municipality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Six overseas management
personnel who were surrounded by joint-venture workers in a labor
dispute in north China's Tianjin safely left their company today.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in the Tianjin Meite Packaging Company,
a Hong Kong Meite Co. and the Tianjin Wanhua Co. joint-venture.
</P>
<P>
In March, the company merged with Meite Packaging becoming a
totally overseas-funded company. The company planned to continue
to employ 150 workers, but 71 of whom were disgruntled with the
new labor contracts because they did not specify the terms of
their employment.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the workers refused to sign the contracts and asked
to go back to Wanhua, which rejected their demand.
</P>
<P>
On the morning August 22, the 71 workers went to Meite hoping
to hold talks with the overseas boss, who refused to do so and had
a bulletin posted announcing the termination of labor contracts
with the workers.
</P>
<P>
Then, the workers stopped six overseas management personnel
from leaving the company, including an American, a Malaysian and
four from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Local police rushed to the site soon after the incident took
place and separated the workers from the management personnel,
while local government was immediately involved in mediating.
</P>
<P>
By 11 o'clock Thursday, an agreement was reached. Meite
revoking its contract termination announcement and gave
compensation to workers while Wanhua agreed to accept the workers.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were satisfied with the settlement, and the workers
left the company early this morning.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Warns Against Overheating of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said Friday that Hong Kong would not see double-digit
growth in the third quarter or fourth quarter this year as in the
first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
"I must warn everybody that this figure is not repeatable and
it is not likely that we are going to have double-digit growth in
the third quarter or fourth quarter," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following the earlier release of the Half-
Yearly Economic Report 2000 by the Hong Kong government, which
reported a 10.8-percent economic growth in the second quarter of
2000 over a year earlier, after a 14.3-percent growth in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate in real terms of the GDP for 2000 is
raised from 6 percent in the earlier forecast to 8.5 percent,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Further double-digit growth would not be desirable and would
perhaps overheat the economy, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"We must remember that we are a fairly mature and developed
economy, and our per capita GDP is among the highest in the world,
so it would not be good for ourselves in the long run for the
economy to grow at double digit," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, set against the past recession and the contraction of
the GDP in 1998, the robust growth is certainly a very stimulating
experience, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Predicts Moderate Medium-Term Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang on Friday expressed optimism about Hong
Kong's economic performance in the rest of the year, but predicted
that the growth rate would slow down in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in CNBC Asia's "The Asian Wall Street Journal," Tsang
noted that Hong Kong's economy, with a per capita GDP approaching
25,000 U.S. dollars, is an industrialized economy, and so, "it is
unreal to maintain a double-digit growth."
</P>
<P>
"And indeed, I think this would be undesirable if we had that
and we would be overheating the economy," he said, predicting that
the trend growth rate, in the medium term, would slow down to stay
at something between 4 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics released on Friday, the real-
term growth of Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP) reached 10.
8 percent in the second quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
So after these heights of 10.8 percent and 14.3 percent in the
first two quarters, "I do believe the economy will moderate to a
more decent growth rate," Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
But for the year 2000 as a whole, Tsang said he believed the
year would be a quite brilliant year. "We have forecast it to grow
by 8.5 percent, but after this, I think it will gradually work
down to 4 to 5 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to what are the driving factors behind the strong GDP growth,
Tsang listed some external factors, including a stable U.S. market,
a recovering Japanese economy and a powerfully growing mainland of
China.
</P>
<P>
And in Hong Kong, he said, the main driving force is trade,
both visible and invisible.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism, financial services are surging ahead, and on top of
that there is a very healthy inflow of capital in Hong Kong,
spurring new levels of investment, and domestic consumption has
been rising very satisfactorily," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So these are all the underlying elements producing quite a
brilliant performance in the year 2000." he said.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Crack-down on Illegal Video-Game Parlors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A number of video-game parlors
and their owners have been punished since the government launched
a nationwide crack-down, in June, on illegal activities in the
business.
</P>
<P>
The blitz has gained support from the media and public, said
Liu Shengli, a Ministry of Culture official in charge of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, investigations and inspections have
been carried out by local departments concerned, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, he confessed that lots of game parlors are operating
without legal documents, while some of them continued to accept
under-age customers.
</P>
<P>
And some people are running illegal video-game parlors under
the disguise of Internet cafes or computer training schools, he
said, noting that some owners are moving their business to
suburban and rural areas or are engaged in underground operations.
</P>
<P>
Liu announced that the government will stop issuing licenses to
new video-game parlors, close down those which have been engaged
in illegal activities, and severely punish law offenders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, manufacturing and sale of game machines for the
domestic market will be banned, he said.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team will be sent to check the results of the
campaign nationwide by October.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, China has nearly 60,000
registered video-game parlors.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest More to Treat Wastewater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China will invest about 40
billion yuan (4.8 billion U.S. dollar) each year in the next 10
years to make sure at least 70 percent of wastewater in major
cities and 60 percent in ordinary cities is treated before
discharge by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to purchase and build more urban
wastewater treatment facilities, according to a new pollution
control policy jointly issued by the State Environmental
Protection Administration, the Ministry of Construction and the
Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The policy requires that at least 50 percent of the wastewater
in urban areas across the country should be treated before
discharge by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China built 176 wastewater treatment plants between 1980 and
1995, enabling the country to treat 20 percent of the wastewater
produced in cities.
</P>
<P>
Construction of urban wastewater treatment facilities has been
stepped up since 1995 and up to the end of 1998, 266 wastewater
treatment plants were operating, with a total daily capacity of 11
million tons. Currently, another 203 facilities are under
construction.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policy, investors from both at home and
abroad are welcome to build such facilities in cities and villages
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Lashes Out At Taiwan Leader's Trip Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency,
Xinhua, lashed out at the leader of Taiwan authorities for his
visit to foreign countries, saying that money can't buy
international justice.
</P>
<P>
A commentary from Xinhua said only three months after his
taking office, the Taiwan leader followed the "money diplomacy"
pursued by his predecessor Lee Teng-hui, and went abroad with
cheques.
</P>
<P>
The international justice, which Lee has failed to buy with big
money, will not fall in the hands of the present leader of Taiwan,
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taiwan leader has been in office, Taiwan has
witnessed political, economic and social chaos.
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying his best to sort out the domestic mess, the
Taiwan leader embarked on a cross-continent trip abroad, which
stunned the public of Taiwan, and exposed his true colors of
intending to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan" in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the Taiwan leader has refused to
recognized the one-China principle, played the game of words on
the cross-Straits relations and vigorously promoting his splittism
to the rest of the world, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan leader slapped his own face by offering the money of
Taiwan tax-payers to his foreign hosts, though he had time and
again promised never to engage in the so-called "money diplomacy"
of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
It has been a fact that there is only one China in the world,
and the one-China principle has been widely recognized throughout
the international community, it said.
</P>
<P>
No matter what the tricks are and how much money they are going
to spend on the "money diplomacy," the one-China principle will
not be altered.
</P>
<P>
It will only bring disgrace to himself if the leader of Taiwan
continues to pursue the path of Lee Teng-hui and tries to
challenge the one-China principle, the commentary said.

is already at the top of the present NPC Standing Committee's
agenda, and concerned departments should work harder so as to
submit the draft to the top legislature for deliberation as soon
as possible.

Qian said he was optimistic about the prospects of the
development of the cross-Straits relations, which have witnessed
expanded exchanges and cooperation in economic, cultural and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
However, there also exists some political hurdles between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits, said Qian, also a member of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
The major problem is that the leader of the Taiwan authorities
still refuses to consider himself a Chinese, evades the one-China
principle and plays word games resulting in the stalemate of cross-
Straits dialogues and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Qian told the visitors "Taiwan independence" will never be
accepted by the international community and the Chinese people,
including the majority of Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The earlier realization of direct trade, postal, air and
shipping services between the mainland and Taiwan is the ardent
wish of the people on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite Taiwan's promise of realizing the goal within the
year, there has been no concrete action to date. The major problem
that impedes the direct services lies on the side of Taiwan, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian also spoke highly of the media's role
in enhancing mutual understanding of people on both sides of the
Straits.
</P>
<P>
The seven member delegation is on a 10-day visit to the
mainland as guests of the Xinhua News Agency.

According to officials, the expansion of reform in the SEZs
will focus on systematic innovations, including adjustments in the
ownership structure, and transformation of functions of government
departments in accordance with international common practices.
</P>
<P>
The government should also simplify procedures to make it
easier to get businesses up and running and give a bigger role to
the market, while improving services, experts say.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, efforts must be made to improve the social
security system and the financing system, and have intermediary
organs operating according to standards.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming 50 years will be an important historical period
in China's drive to realize modernization and make the Chinese
nation's long-cherished dream of building a powerful China come
true.
</P>
<P>
Experts are confident that Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen,
and Hainan will set the pace in China's drive toward modernization.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the opening-up drive swept other parts of the country, the
preferential policies were applied to more regions. The saying
that special economic zones are no longer special prevails in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the SEZs have not lost their vitality. And observers
say that the SEZs still shoulder a historical mission today.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the SEZs have been focusing on improving the
overall economic quality and on developing high-tech industries
and other economies with special features.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other parts of China, the SEZs still hold an edge
in utilizing domestic and overseas resources and markets and in
adapting themselves to international common practices to boost
economic development.
</P>
<P>
While fully expanding economic cooperation with multinationals,
Shenzhen is tightening ties with Hong Kong, and Xiamen and Hainan
with Taiwan. In Shantou, efforts have been made to attract
overseas Chinese, one of the major channels of overseas investment
to the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that improving overall economic performance is a
necessary choice for the SEZs as China will face fiercer
competition after its entry into the World Trade Organization. It
is the only way for them to realize modernization.
</P>
<P>
To hit the goal, analysts say, the SEZs should give national
treatment to overseas investors for more funding while making
efforts to open up overseas markets for their own companies
products.
</P>
<P>
By changing the past practice of offering preferential policies
to overseas investors in certain fields, the SEZs have lifted all
restrictions for them.

In early August, armed bandits invaded Uzbekistan and southern

He said China is willing to cooperate closely with central
Asian nations and other countries concerned and take concrete

MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The launch of an RS-20 rocket
that is to put five foreign satellites into orbit has been delayed
by one day until 2 p.m. Moscow time (1000 GMT) Saturday, the
Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rocket was scheduled to blast off from Kazakhstan's
Baikonur launch center at 2 p.m. Moscow time Friday, but computers
aborted the launch, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Specialists do not think the problems are significant, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The satellites include two from Italy, two from Saudi Arabia
and one from Malaysia. The launch will represent a space debut for
the Saudis and the Malaysians, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian satellites will be used for environmental
monitoring, and data transmission for commercial purposes as well
as education and scientific research.
</P>

The two Saudi satellites, from the Saudi Arabian Space Research
Institute, are also designed for educational and scientific

<HEADLINE> Rabobank Publishes Guidelines on Funding GMO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Rabobank, the world's biggest
lending bank to agriculture, published guidelines on Friday for
funding genetically modified organisms (GMO).
</P>
<P>
The Dutch bank group said in a statement that though it would
provide financing for the genetic modification of crops, the
technology of genetic modification should not be used if better
alternatives are available.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which lent out 30 billion euros (27 billion U.S.
dollars) last year, said it would not be involved in providing
funds for the genetic modification of human life.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of animals, the Rabobank group applies the 'No,
unless' principle," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank group claimed that it was the first financial
institution to have written out a code of conduct on genetic
modification.
</P>
<P>
It said the code of conduct would provide global guidance for
funding decisions within the bank group, but it is open to changes
since scientific and ethical dimensions are still developing.
</P>
<P>
The group will focus on projects which help preserve the
environment and human and animal health, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Rabobank estimated that its market share accounts for no more
than one to 2 percent of the world's 7 trillion dollar
agricultural market.
</P>
<P>
Genetic modification via implanting foreign genes is used in
agriculture to make crops resistant to insects or herbicides.
</P>
<P>
However, European environmentalists and consumer groups have
been protesting the marketing of genetically modified crops such
as maize and soybeans, claiming that potential dangers lurk in the
technology.
</P>
<P>
The discovery earlier this year that farmers in several
European Union (EU) countries had unknowingly planted genetically
modified rapeseed imported from Canada triggered a huge protest.
</P>
<P>
The EU has imposed a moratorium on licensing new genetically
modified crops, while EU food producers are requested to label
their products as containing genetically modified organisms unless
they can guarantee that the ingredients contain less than one
percent of genetically modified organisms.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Former French Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua Friday severely attacked the plan of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin to give more administrative and fiscal autonomy to
Corsica.
</P>
<P>
In a written plan published on July 20, Jospin proposed giving
Corsica more autonomous power in government and a new tax statute.
</P>
<P>
Pasqua, who is now president of the Neo-Gaullist Rally for
France, said in a statement to the press that each time the
government adopts "a policy of pacification" toward Corsica, a "
minority of fascists and racists" on the island will show up and
acts of violence increase.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized President Jacques Chirac for keeping silent
about the plan, which is also called "Matignon process" in
reference to the office building of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed that half of the French population support
Jospin's plan for Corsica, while the other half are opposed.
</P>
<P>
The political circles of France are also divided over the plan,
which will be discussed by the parliament in autumn.

OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A population explosion in the

southern Ontario. The big, noisy birds are reportedly invading

reached 350,000 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
These southern "giant" geese have taken to farmland, golf
courses and lawns. They seem to like short-cut lawns, and have
become increasingly friendly and tame toward humans.
</P>
<P>
If you play golf at courses near the St. Lawrence River, you're
stepping around goose droppings all the time, according to local
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Every municipality in the Golden Horseshoe from Oshawa to
Niagara Falls in Ontario has become involved in some form of goose
control.
</P>
<P>
Authorities near the Pearson International and Toronto Island
airports have removed some geese and nests, while trying to
redesign the areas to be less attractive to them.
</P>
<P>
Other efforts include poking holes in eggs, rounding up adult
birds and shipping them out of town, and using shrubs and fences
to break up open areas where the geese feel secure.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Hail Result of Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Somali people in its
capital city of Mogadishu and many other cities and towns were
holding celebrations on Saturday to congratulate Abdiqasim Salad
Hassan on being newly elected first President of the state in
almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Ahmed Shakur, district commissioner of Bur Dhubo town,
told Xinhua how the people of the town still remained in the
streets, celebrating for the victory of Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of his people, Shakur has pledged full
support and congratulated for all of the Somalis wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
The people of Mogadishu who did not go to bed last night still
continue celebrating. The celebrations are also being held in many
other towns and regions such as Bay, Bakol, Gedo, Kismaio, Lower
Shabelle, Mudug, Galgudud.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the people have been so influenced by
politics of the country.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Mohamed Hussein Migwa working in a construction of a
building also told Xinhua how he is happy that at last Somalia can
now have a government. The porters, plumbers working under him
have likewise gathered together, chanting words supporting
President Hassan.
</P>
<P>
"We have been meaning to get a religious president for ages,"
said Ahmed Qalli, a watchman in Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
The-58-year-old Hassan was elected as Somali President early
Saturday morning after three rounds of presidential elections in
Arta, Djibouti, which lasted for more than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
Born in Dhusamareb district of Galgudud region, he had been a
long term minister in the former regime led by the late Siad Barre
which was overthrown in 1991. His last post in that regime was
the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, who himself looked tired, said a little after he was
officially declared the interim president of Somalia for the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his thanks for those voted for him and those who
didn't and also asked the people to forgive each other and prayed
for bringing a lasting peace and prosperity to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the faction leaders such as Hussein Mohamed Aidid
and Muse Sudi Yalahow have issued warnings against a possible
catastrophic fighting between what they called the Somalis and the
Djibouti established administration.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition of some of the faction leaders to this
administration, the people are jubilating and large scale of
fighting involved by the clannish militiamen of Mogadishu is less
likely.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the interim government will have its first
sitting place in Mogadishu, still Hassan is less likely to accept
any place other than Mogadishu where enjoys considerable support.

<HEADLINE> Angola Gains 6.5 Percent of Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola has seen an average 6.5
percent of annual economic growth rate in the past five years as
the government gradually transferred priority to economic
reconstruction in the war-torn country, an official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.
</P>
<P>
Jose Pedro de Morais was quoted on Thursday by the official
news agency Angop as saying at an economic seminar in the capital
Luanda that in 1993 the Angolan economy dropped by 25 percent due
to the civil war which erupted again in late 1992 soon after the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, however, the GDP recovered to the level of 1992, which
was estimated at some eight billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry has contributed a lot to the GDP expansion
with export income accounting for 83 percent of the GDP in 1999,
jumping from 70 percent of the GDP in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At present, the oil production in the second largest oil
producing country in Africa is estimated at 750,000 barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan National Bank (BNA), meanwhile, has been trying to
stabilize the financial situation by reducing money supply,
cutting the inflation rate from four digits in 1995 to three
digits in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Further drop in inflation to two digits is expected next year
after reforms was implemented with the liberalization of the
interest rates as well as the foreign exchange market, according
to the IMF official.
</P>
<P>
The Angola government has also been trying to attract foreign
investment in developing abundant oil, diamond and fisheries
resources.
</P>
<P>
As the security situation eased following the government forces
inflicted heavy losses on the UNITA rebels in a mass offensive
launched in late 1999, the Angolan government hoped to bring peace
and prosperity to the country ravaged by the 25-year civil war.

ABUJA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 extra policemen have
been called to the Nigerian capital Abuja from the surrounding
states ahead of U.S. President Bill Clinton' s upcoming visit to
the west African country on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government is expected to ask Clinton to help
forgive the country's 31 billion U.S. dollars of external debt,
local newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government had advised Nigerians against an "
exaggerated expectation" on Clinton' s visit, the second by an
American president after Jimmy Carter in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Susan Rice, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs, said earlier in Washington that Nigeria is not eligible
for the "Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative" on debt relief.
But she promised to help Nigeria reschedule its debt to make it "
manageable".

<HEADLINE> Mandela Criticizes West for Neglecting Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Africa is being neglected
by Western powers who should do more to prevent conflicts plaguing
the continent, former South African President Nelson Mandela said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South African Institute of International
Affairs at the University of the Witwatersrand, Mandela lambasted
the West's apparent unwillingness to become involved in Africa,
while readily going to the aid of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Citing Rwanda as an example, Mandela said observers had
frequently noted the failure of the West to intervene and end the
genocide in the central African nation.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone was another example of the West's neglect, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While Nato prepared itself for action in Kosovo, Sierra Leone
seemed a virtually forsaken place from an international
perspective," he said.
</P>
<P>
As atrocities were carried out in Sierra Leone, the weaponry
funding, communications and intelligence promised by Western
powers failed to materialize, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said ethnic tensions which ignited the genocide in
Rwanda continued to play a role in the conflicts in neighboring
Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We are not suggesting that these and other African conflicts
can be subjected to the same template of conflict resolution or
that the actions of Kosovo can simply be transplanted to the
conflicts on this continent," said the former president.
</P>
<P>
"We in Africa and Asia must, however, envy the readiness and
willingness on the part of the international community to
intervene and commit resources to the reconstruction of Kosovo
society," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government to Seize 509 More Farms for Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Friday
announced the compulsory acquisition of another 509 farms for
resettlement of landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
Under its fast-track resettlement program, the government
earlier identified 3,041 farms for the resettlement exercise.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 families countrywide have been resettled since the
fast-track resettlement scheme began in June this year on 81,321
hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to acquire at least five million hectares
to resettle thousands of landless Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean liberation war veterans have occupied over 1,000
white-owned farms since February this year to demand the
government speed up land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1980 when the government embarked on the
resettlement program some 60,000 families have been resettled on 3.
3 million hectares of land countrywide.

<P>
LAGOS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leone government on
Friday released 171 rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
fighters from various prisons of the country, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The release was announced by President Tejan Kabbah on Monday
as a peace gesture following the RUF chose its field commander
Issa Sesay to replace detained Foday Sankoh as the interim leader.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone government saw the change of leadership as a
signal that the RUF wanted to reopen talks with the government to
revive the Lome peace accord signed in July last year after the
abduction of about 500 UN peacekeepers by the RUF in May.
</P>
<P>
However, two Nigerian peacekeeping soldiers were seriously
wounded when the RUF rebels attacked their unit in the Port Loko
region on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> 12 Leaders Confirm to Witness Signing of Burundi Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Twelve heads of state and
government, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, have confirmed
to witness the signing of the Burundi peace agreement in northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete told a news conference that more
invited leaders were likely to make their confirmations over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders to participate in the signing ceremony are
presidents Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Benjamin
Mkapa of Tanzania, Bakili Muluzi of Malawi, Festus Mogae of
Botswana, Pierre Buyoua of Burundi, Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, Paul
Kagame of Rwanda, King Mswati of Swaziland and Lesotho Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said Libya, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium will be represented by senior government officials and
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim
Ahmed Salim as well as representatives from the United Nations,
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
European Union will also witness the historical event.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Clinton, who arrives in Tanzania on Monday
afternoon from Nigeria, will hold talks with Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a Burundi government delegation left
the capital Bujumbura Friday morning for Arusha while Burundi
peace facilitator Nelson Mandela is expected to arrive in Arusha
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Facilitator's representative Mark Bomani said that Mandela
would meet with the 19 Burundian delegations involved in the peace
talks in Arusha to try to reach a consensus on points of
disagreement in draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Mandela will make compromise proposal on the issues that have
not yet been resolved," he added .
</P>
<P>
The sticking points include who will lead Burundi's
transitional government and the implementation of a cease-fire in
a seven-year-old civil war between Hutu rebel groups and army and
government which are dominated by the Tutsi minority, which left
more than 200,000 people dead and a further 1.2 million displaced.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were initiated by former Tanzanian president
Julius Nyerere in June 1998 and have been beefed up by former
South African president Nelson Mandela since he succeeded Nyerere
as the facilitator in December 1999 following the latter's death
of leukemia.

following consultation with President Charles Taylor.

Liberia did not drop charges against the defendants "because of
lack of evidence or in reaction to pressure from any source",
Varmah said in a statement, adding that the action was "entirely

defendants and their employer were forwarded to the Liberian
government.
</P>
<P>
"They may continue to enjoy the warm hospitality and goodwill

<HEADLINE> S. African Trade with U.S. to Be Boosted by New Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African business can
look forward to a massive boost in trade opportunities with the
United States with the imminent implementation of the Africa
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which will slash import duties,
the U.S. embassy said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, inadequate customs procedures certifying point of
origin for clothing and apparel could delay the eligibility of
duty-free status for South African textiles under AGOA, U.S.
economic affairs counselor to South Africa Bob Godec told
reporters in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
At present, only Mauritius had adequate controls in place over
point of origin, he said.
</P>
<P>
Godec said a wide range of African products would enjoy duty-
free status into the U.S. market -- provided the exporting
countries met certain conditions -- once the act came into effect
on October 1.
</P>
<P>
"AGOA presents remarkable new opportunities for African
business... because we are sincerely interested in the prosperity
of Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade concessions were expected to create about 66,000
jobs in South Africa's textile industry alone, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The act, which was signed into law by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on May 18 this year, extends the scope of duty-free status
currently in place in terms of the Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP).
</P>
<P>
The GSP gives designated African countries duty-free status on
about 4,600 products.
</P>
<P>
Godec said the act would extend this concession for a further
eight years.
</P>
<P>
AGOA adds up to 1,897 products to the list and allows clothing
and apparel made in eligible African countries, with either
African or U.S. fabrics, to be imported into the U.S. duty-free.
Currently, an average 17.5 percent tariff is levied on textiles
imported into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
It also gives sub-Sahara African countries improved access to U.
S. credit and technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
The act would also increase the "cap" on textile imports from
Africa from 1.5 percent of total U.S. clothing imports to 3.5
percent over eight years, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imported clothing and apparel worth about 60 billion U.
S. dollars each year, and the figure was expected to double over
the next eight years, Godec said.
</P>
<P>
The act also removes quotas on textile imports by qualifying
countries.
</P>
<P>
Godec warned, however, that countries would only qualify for
the concession on clothing if its government had in place an
adequate "visa system".
</P>
<P>
This was essential to ensure the goods were not originally
imported for other regions.
</P>
<P>
"It would be to the advantage of South Africa to move fairly
quickly to put the visa system in place," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at an
annual rate of 5.3 percent in the second quarter of this year,
slightly higher than the previous estimate of 5.2 percent, the
Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross domestic product (GDP), the nation's
total output of goods and services, in the second quarter
surpassed the growth in the first quarter when the economy grew at
a 4.8 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
The government said the GDP growth was attributed to increases
in business investment and government spending that offset a
slowdown in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all
economic activities, rose at a 2.9 percent rate in the second
quarter, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 1997. In the
first quarter, consumer spending surged at a 7.6 percent rate, a
17-year high.

<P>
But business investment, including spending on computers and
other equipment, increased at an annual rate of 14.6 percent in
the second quarter. That compared with a 21 percent rate posted in
the first quarter. Businesses also increased their spending on
inventories, adding to second-quarter growth.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to growth was increased spending by the
federal government, which rose at a whopping annual rate of 16.9
percent in the second quarter. That compared with a 14.2 percent
rate of decrease in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, however, continued to be a drag on
growth. The bloated deficit subtracted 1.2 percentage points from
growth in the second quarter, compared to a reduction of 0.9
percentage points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
All the changes show the economy grew at an annual rate of 119.
7 billion U.S. dollars in the second quarter, pushing the country'
s total output of goods and services to 9.3 trillion dollars,
after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the GDP, and closely watched by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, rose at an unrevised
annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from a 3.5
percent rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times over
the last 14 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control. On Tuesday, the Fed decided to leave interest rates
unchanged, but left the door open to further rate increases should
tight labor markets spark wage and price pressures down the road.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the National Association of Realtors
reported that existing-home sales plunged 9.8 percent in July to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units as higher
mortgage rates cut into demand.
</P>
<P>
In the current quarter, many analysts believe the economy has
slowed to a growth rate of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government also reported Friday that after-tax profits of U.
S. corporations grew by 2.4 percent in the second quarter, down
from the 5.7 percent in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Respond to U.N. Chief's Call to Sign, Ratify Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- An exceptional response
has been generated to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call to
all heads of State or Government to use the unique opportunity
afforded by the forthcoming Millennium Summit to sign, ratify or
accede to key treaties to which they are not yet a party, U.N.
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Summit will be largest-ever gathering of world leaders and
will be held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from
September 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
To date, 69 States have informed the Secretary-General that
they will participate in the event during the three-day summit by
singing, ratifying or accede to a number of multilateral treaties
of which he is the custodian, according to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The majority of states will undertake treaty actions at the
presidential or prime ministerial level, and some will sign or
deposit instruments of ratification relating to over seven
treaties each, the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said most treaty actions will relate to approximately
37 treaties, the majority of which cover human rights, disarmament,
the environment, and international criminal law.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of May 15, 2000 sent to all heads of state or
government, the Secretary-General informed the world leaders that
he would provide special facilities to enable them to add their
signatures to any of the more than 500 treaties deposited with him.
</P>
<P>
He drew special attention to a core group of 25 multilateral
treaties, among them those dealing with landmines, rights of women
and children, and climate change.

UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- State-of-the-art
technology, including high-definition television, digital
photography and webcasting, will make the United Nations
Millennium Summit a truly 21st century event, U.N. said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Further to an initiative by the Japanese government, the Japan
Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) has offered on a pro bono basis
services and equipment to the United Nations for its coverage of
the Millennium Summit with high-definition television technology (
HDTV), according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
NHK's offer will include the first-ever use in the General
Assembly Hall of two large-scale television projection screens
throughout the summit, the United Nations said.
</P>
<P>
HDTV, which has previously been used at the annual U.N. World
Television Forum in New York, provides high-resolution digital
images with CD sound quality and is considered to be the next-
generation television technology.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 high-definition cameras and eight high-definition

<HEADLINE> Popularity of Taoism Testifies Religious Freedom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The fact that there are
countless Taoist followers in China testifies that there is true
religious freedom in the country, a leading Chinese Taoist master
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Master Min Zhiting, a member of a Chinese religious leaders
delegation, told reporters that there are so many people in China
who believe or practise the indigenous Taoism that it is very
difficult for him to give an accurate number of followers.
</P>
<P>
Taoism, though an ancient and multi-god religion, is by no
means equal to feudal superstition, the master stressed. Many
ancestors who have made great contribution to social progress are
respected as gods by Taoists and worshipped in temples or shrines
built for them, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 1,600 Taoist temples across China
where more than 26,000 Taoist priests and nuns lead religious life,
he said. But it is very difficult to give an exact number of
believers because many of them do not live in Taoist temples as
priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
An annual temple fair sponsored by the Taoist Temple of White
Clouds in Beijing on every lunar Chinese New Year, for example,
attracts as many as 300,000 visitors who went to the temple to
worship Taoist gods and pray for blessings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taoist temples built on famous mountains in China
such as Mount Tai and Mount Hua where, according to tradition,
celestial beings lived or ancient Taoists had practiced
austerities and become immortal are also very popular among
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Taoism itself is a proof that there is
religious freedom in china, Master Min noted.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, comprising leaders of China's top five
religions, is here for a goodwill visit to the United States at
the invitation of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation before
attending the Millennium World Peace Summit of religious leaders
to be held at the U.N. headquarters on August 28.

<P>
In January-May last year, 10,897 Russians died after drinking
fake alcoholic products, Interfax said, quoting the National

The association puts the blame on rampant bootlegging across

<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday criticized as "
discriminatory" neighboring Latvia's language law which will come
into force in September, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian cabinet has adopted the rules for applying the law
"in their worst version with purely cosmetic changes," the Russian
foreign ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Latvian human rights organizations and international experts
criticized the draft rules when they were being prepared as "
running counter to the standards established by the OSCE (
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) and the
Council of Europe," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Latvia will see yet another legislative act aimed at
discriminating against the assimilation of national minorities,"
the document said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow accuses the Latvian authorities of "continuing to ignore
the demands of the majority of the Latvian people and the European
human rights standards."
</P>
<P>
The statement also criticized "some foreign partners" for their
silent tolerance of Latvia's discriminatory policy against
national minorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) met Friday in
southwestern Russia to discuss the situation in Central Asia, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Defense chiefs from Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Belarus, Ukraine and Tajikistan attended the meeting in the
Ashuluk testing ground in Astrakhan.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were represented by army command
representatives as their defense ministers are staying home to
deal with military operations against armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The military actions unleashed by international terrorists in
southwest Kyrgyzstan and southern Uzbekistan are regarded by the
Commonwealth's defense ministers as a threat and challenge to the
sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of those states,"
Interfax quoted a participant as saying.
</P>
<P>
The defense chiefs at the meeting are assessing such actions as
a threat to the entire CIS.
</P>
<P>
They believe that in the current situation, the states should
not merely coordinate, but should combine military, political and
technical efforts to neutralize the threat of the proliferation of
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The defense chiefs have worked out a number of concrete
measures toward stability in Central Asia, which they plan to
submit to the CIS heads of state for approval.
</P>
<P>
They also considered the establishment of a joint command,
which will include the military personnel from Russia and the
Central Asian states, Interfax said.

WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people have

</P>
<P>
Responding to a question at a press conference, Living Buddha

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan oil closed the week
at 28.68 U.S. dollars per barrel, 1.11 dollars above last week's
price, the Mines and Energy Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The average price for the year is 25.75 dollars per barrel, far
higher than the 16.04 dollars in 1999 and the 10.57 dollars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the recent rise in oil price to the drop in
the inventories of the countries that are big oil consumers, such
as is the United States.
</P>
<P>
Oil, which constitutes the engine of the Venezuelan economy,
provides 70 percent of the hard currency the country needs, and
more than half of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate that Venezuela's annual oil income will
increase by about 1 billion dollars if the oil price surges one
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Promises Tougher Anti-Pedophilia Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will toughen
up existing measures against pedophiles and create a team of
ministers to help protect children, Social Affairs Minister Livia
Turco said here Friday after the government's first post-summer
recess session.
</P>
<P>
Turco said the initiatives were the best way to fight
pedophilia since "there is no magic formula" against it, and
stressed that it was "dangerous" to propose illusory solutions
such as the initiative taken by maverick daily Libero this week
when it published lists of condemned pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
"The main message we want to get across today is that the
entire community is as responsible for each child as if it were
its own -- if this attitude does not exist, our policies will
never be effective," she said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet agreed to form a group of ministers to monitor the
progress of anti- pedophilia measures and education programs aimed
at curbing the malaise which in recent days stirred up outrage
across the country after last weekend's back-to-back rapes and
murders of two young girls.
</P>
<P>
According to Turco, one of the main points of the campaign
against pedophilia is creating support and information systems for
parents of minors, as well as offering therapy for pedophiles in
order to eliminate the problem at the source.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government will also instill training programs for
teachers, whose extensive contact with children could make them
crucial in spotting signs of pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, the country's Children's Day will give the
government an chance to turn the spotlight on its anti-pedophilia
campaign: informative pamphlets for parents of minors will be
distributed in order to teach them how to be on the look-out for
any troubling signs in their children.
</P>
<P>
One of the trickier topics the group of ministers will have to
face is that of the presence of police in schools, an idea which
rose out of anti-pedophilia debates earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Italian Interior Minister Enzo Bianco Friday retracted previous
promises to implement information sessions for school children by
law enforcement officers about pedophiles, while Education
Minister Tullio De Mauro suggested police involvement be used only
as an "exterior" preventative measure.
</P>
<P>
Bianco also said that, together with Justice Minister Piero
Fassino, he will work toward forming an information pool dealing
with pedophilia for prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to copy the system already used for terrorism and
the mafia," Fassino said, which uses a powerful information
database to track perpetrators.

OTTAWA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada will allow more products
from the world's least-developed countries to enter duty-free
beginning from September 1, 2000, the government announced here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
As many as 570 additional tariff items will be accorded duty-
free treatment, which means about 90 percent of product categories
from the world's least-developed countries may enter Canada duty-
free, according to a government statement.
</P>
<P>
"By gaining greater access to the Canadian market, least-
developed countries are benefiting from the global trading system,
" said International Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"These measures also demonstrate Canada's support for the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and its efforts to promote further trade
liberalization," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's new tariff measures came as a result of months of
consultations among WTO members, who are responding to a four-
point plan by the trade organization to help build confidence in
the world trading system among developing countries.

MEXICO CITY, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth Tuxtla Political
Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism Summit started Friday in
Guatemala City to promote cooperation between Mexico and Central
America.
</P>

The forum is attended by presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico,
Alfonso Portillo of Guatemala, Carlos Flores Facusse of Honduras,
Franciso Flores of El Salvador, Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua, and
Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica, according to reports from
Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
Belize Prime Minister Said Musa and Panamanian Vice President

</P>
<P>
"Integration and the war against international crime are our
big problems. The world demands from us unity; the world claims
for integration. It is worthless to be isolated in this globalized
world," said Guatemalan President Portillo in the opening speech.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and seven Central American countries seek in this one-
day meeting regional agreements in issues such as drug trafficking,
illegal weapon trafficking and common positions in international
policies.
</P>
<P>
The countries of the area seek to consolidate their trade
relations for the promotion of the financing of development.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders will analyze a common strategy to combat
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
They will also tackle development projects, among which is the
construction of a 1,400 kilometer long gas pipeline to take
Mexican natural gas to Guatemala and other countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The summit ends Friday with the signing of the Guatemala
Declaration to encompass the commitments of the governments in
economic, commercial, financial, migratory, and security issues,
among others.
</P>
<P>
The Tuxtla mechanism of political coordination and cooperation,
the biggest forum of cooperation between Mexico and Central

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush said Friday that he would strengthen ties
with Latin America if he wins a presidential victory in November.
</P>
<P>
"Our future cannot be separated from the future of Latin
America," Bush said in a speech at Florida International
University.
</P>
<P>
"The Clinton-Gore administration has had no strategy," he said.
"We have seen summits without substance, and reaction instead of
action.... We were promised a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Yet
it never happened."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Clinton administration for losing lucrative
business deal in Latin America, namely in Mexico and Chile, to the
European Union and Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I don't fault our European friends for making these deals," he
said. "We dropped the ball, and they are running with it."
</P>
<P>
Bush promised that he would resume suspended free-trade talks
with Chile and other Latin American nations once he is elected.
</P>
<P>
The campaign camp of Democratic presidential candidate Vice
President Al Gore immediately slammed Bush's efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Governor Bush has shown that he is not ready to represent the
United States on the international stage," said Gore national
spokesman Douglas Mattaway.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Cuba, Bush said he was opposed to any relaxation
of the almost 40-year-old economic embargo against Havana.

States will contribute 1.3 billion dollars, most of it in military
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that the Plan Colombia aims at combating drug
trafficking. The guerrillas have said that they do not have
anything to do with drug trafficking. In consequence, they have
nothing to fear," said Pastrana to the press in the Caribbean
island of San Andres, where he attended a forum.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that "70 percent (of the Plan Colombia) is aimed
at social investment. I cannot see how any Colombian can oppose
this."
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rios, one of the FARC spokesmen, who has been holding
peace talks with the government since October 1999, said that "
Clinton does not come in peace, nor to support the efforts for a
political solution to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug plan threatens the peace process and means "a
real danger of generalization of the war," added the rebel leader.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trying to Placate Fear of Colombian Neighbors over U.S.-Involved Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
tried hard to placate Latin Americans' fear over its increasing
involvement in Colombia's military action against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan, and there is no proposal, and there is no
idea of committing American forces in Colombia to do anything but .
..training," Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as the Clinton administration will pour 1.3
billion U.S. dollars in aid into Colombia over the next two years
to back up a drive against drug traffickers and armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton will make a five-hour visit to Colombia
next week to endorse the U.S. support for the drug war.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's neighbors fear that the militarization of the drug
war will push the fighting over their borders, along with waves of
refugees and displacement of the drug trade itself.
</P>
<P>
Pickering called the fear of Latin American nations fear a "
misunderstanding" of U.S. efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil has ruled out military cooperation with the
United States in Colombia. It is also concerned about the
environmental fallout in the Amazon jungle from the use of
chemicals to destroy Colombia's drug plantations.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela distances itself from the U.S. strategy in Colombia
by refusing to allow American planes to fly over its territory on
drug missions.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Friday as investors continued to search for guidance on the market
direction after the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest
rates alone earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 9.89 at 11,192.63.
The blue chip index rose in the previous four sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 10.60 at 4,042.68 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 2.87 at 1,506.45.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks opened lower on profit-taking and bounced
back then, lifting the Dow index higher at the finish. Investors
moved in the market in the late session to buy some big stocks
such as International Business Machine Corp. for safety.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index fell as traders sold some stocks to lock in
profits from a rally in the previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
Investors have stayed on sideline to search for the market
direction since the Federal Reserve decided to leave rates
unchanged at a monetary policy meeting Tuesday. They were happy
with the move but remained concerned about corporate earnings
because of the slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
Two government reports had little effect on the market. One
report said the U.S. gross domestic product grew 5.3 percent in
the second quarter, meeting analysts' expectations and the other
said existing-home sales plunged 9.8 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.59 at 672.53 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.87 at 934.81. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.81 at 525.11.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,457 up, 1,354 down and 531
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 670.68 million shares from 816.79
million in the previous session.

nuclear arms capable of guaranteeing its national security.

"The minimal level of nuclear arms necessary for Russia must be
ensured despite the shortage of resources Russia has experienced
over the last few years," Kasyanov said.

Nuclear weapons must be kept under constant control, Kasyanov
said. "We must be sure our facilities are safe."
