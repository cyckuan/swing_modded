<HEADLINE> India Scales Down 9th Plan Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- India Scaled down the growth
target of its ninth five-year plan (1997-2002) Tuesday to 6.5
percent from 7 percent due to poor performance during the first
two years.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who is also chairman of
the Planning Commission, directed the panel to incorporate
government's priorities on agriculture, infrastructure and social
sector during a 90-minute meeting of the commission held here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
S. R. Hashim, a secretary of the Commission told the press
after the meeting that the overall plan size might change
marginally from earlier 21,900 billion rupees (approximately 547.5
billion U.S. dollar) due to incorporation of the prime minister's
recent five-point special action program.
</P>
<P>
The detailed draft for the plan would be presented for
cabinet's approval by the first week of December and the National
development Council would be convened thereafter for finalization
of the plan.
</P>
<P>
The finalization of the ninth plan was delayed by political
uncertainties and subsequent mid-term elections later this month,
although the former United Front government released the draft
plan just a day before counting for Lower House elections began in
March this year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman Jaswant Singh's preoccupation with talks with
the U.S. administration following India's nuclear tests in May
also delayed the drafting of the ninth plan.
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission approved the plan for the entire period
of 1997-2002 and there would not be any plan holiday due to delay
in finalization the plan, said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a member of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
The panel would incorporate Vajpayee's special action program
which includes emphasis on agriculture, social sector,
infrastructure and information technology.
</P>
<P>
The government had earlier declared that it would earmark 60
percent of the plan funds for agriculture and rural development.

<HEADLINE> EU Tightens Ban on Export of Hazardous Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
tightened its prohibition to export hazardous waste to
non-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
countries.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, tightened the export ban by adopting a regulation that
clarifies the scope of the prohibition of waste exports from OECD
countries to non-OECD countries.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will then transpose into the European Union law
the lists of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the export ban should also cover the
wastes that are on the EU's hazardous waste list for presenting a
risk for the environment even though they are not on the ban list
of the Basel Convention.
</P>
<P>
The commission also said that it foresees the possibility of
further tightening the EU scope of export ban which may in the end
become stricter than the requirement of the Basel Convention.
</P>
<P>
The convention concerns the control of transboundary movements
of hazardous wastes and their disposal and is concerned with the
environmentally sound management of hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
The EU is a party to the convention, as are all the EU member
states.

<HEADLINE> France Cancels Debt Owed by Honduras, Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- France announced on Tuesday that
it will cancel all the debts owed by Honduras and Nicaragua, the
two Central American states which were worst struck by the
hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
While making the announcement, French Minister of Finance and
Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn said that France will go further by
establishing with Britain a fund for paying the debt of the
hurricane-struck Central American states to financial creditors
such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The debt owed by Honduras to France stands at 500 million
francs (83 million U.S. dollars) and that of Nicaragua 800 million
francs (133 million U.S. dollars), according to the French Foreign
Ministry assistant spokesman, Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac will make a visit to Honduras,
Salvador and Nicaragua from November 14 to 16 after visiting
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French armed forces are staging an humanitarian
operation, ``Operation Cormoran,'' to provide emergency aid to
Central American states.
</P>
<P>
French military sources said that 400 French soldiers have been
mobilized for the operation which is focused on distributing
humanitarian aid materials and clearing roads.
</P>
<P>
Military planes and warships are deployed for sending materials
and rescuers to Central American states, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
When answering questions at the National Assembly, the minister
of finance and economy said that Honduras and Nicaragua are facing
the task of reconstructing their economy ``almost from zero,'' in
the wake of the passing of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
France is standing by these countries by sending not only
humanitarian support such as emergency sanitary aid, but also
support in financial field, he said.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Monday appealed to all the
creditor institutions or countries of Central American states to
partially cancel their debt and launch a moratorium postponing the
payment of their debt.
</P>
<P>
France has asked the member creditors of the Paris Club to
postpone the payment of debts owed by Central American states at
least by two years from 1999 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
A moratorium by the Paris Club will allow Honduras delay the
payment of some 500 million U.S. dollars and Nicaragua 250 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total public debt owned by Honduras to international
creditors and foreign governments is estimated at 3.7 billion U.S.
dollars, and that of Nicaragua 6.1 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Housing Prices Rise in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new housing price
index was 0.9 percent higher in September compared with the same
period a year ago, Statistics Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the 19th consecutive year-over-year increase after 31
consecutive declines from July 1994 to January 1997, the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The annual changes of housing price varied considerably among
the Canadian cities surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The highest annual increase was the 8.2 percent jump recorded
in the booming Calgary market, while the largest drops were in
Victoria and Vancouver, which were down 6.8 percent and 5.5
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In Canada's largest city of Toronto, the annual increase was
3.2 percent. Because of its market size, this had a marked impact
on the national rate.
</P>
<P>
On a month-to-month basis, Canada's new housing price index
witnessed a slip of 0.1 percent in September, the second such drop
in the last 23 months, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
This decline was due mainly to declines in British Columbia
(B.C.) province. Although there are areas of activity in the B.C.
marketplace, conditions remain extremely competitive.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the monthly decline in September, the general
improvement in new housing markets in recent months has been
attributable to higher consumer confidence in Ontario and the
Praries, favourable mortgage interest rates and strong activity in
the resale market," the agency added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Visits S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister
General Chi Haotian arrived here Tuesday, kicking off his
five-day official friendly visit to South Africa, the first of
its kind in the history of the two countries' troops.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech released at Johannesburg International
Airport, Chi, also vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission and state councillor, spoke highly of development of
bilateral ties since Beijing and Pretoria established official
diplomatic relations early this year.
</P>
<P>
"Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China
and South Africa in January, the two countries have enjoyed
smooth development of the relations in various spheres and new
progress in political, economic, cultural and scientific and
technologicial fields."
</P>
<P>
He said the military-to-military relations constitutes an
important part of the state-to-state relations and the
development of the former should keep pace with the development
of the latter.
</P>
<P>
The general, who is here at the invitation of South African
Defense Minister Joe Modise, said his current visit was to
officially initiate the high-level exchanges between the two
defense ministries, and the two militaries, and create favorable
conditions of further developing an all-round relationship
between China and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Modise will reportedly hold a grand military review in
Pretoria, the administrative capital of the country, Wednesday to
welcome Chi.
</P>
<P>
Following his visit to South Africa, Chi will also visit
Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> S. African Help in Angola Peace Process Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
asked South Africa to assist in efforts to find lasting peace in
war-torn Angola, South African state television SABC reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.N. special envoy to Angola, Iffa Diallo, met South
African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad Tuesday to convey the
message from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Diallo, who is touring countries in the region to save the
peace process in Angola, said renewed fighting between the
Angolan government and Jonas Savimbi's rebel UNITA movement is
putting the country on the brink of another civil war.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. Security Council believes that compliance
with the Lusaka protocol, signed in 1994, was the best way to
bring about peace in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said UNITA leader Savimbi was the first to breach the
agreement, but some actions by the Angolan government also
amounted to an infringement. The government had, for example,
decided to suppress a number of privileges previously accorded to
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Diallo told Pahad about the U.N.'s
concern about the deteriorating security situation in Angola and
again called on regional leaders to support the Lusaka agreement
and to isolate warlords.
</P>
<P>
Regional institutions such as the Organization for African
Unity (OAU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
should tell Angola with one voice that war was not the solution
to its political problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Diallo said he and Pahad did not discuss the possibility of
sending a regional peace-keeping force to Angola.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, a meeting of SADC defense ministers raised
the possibility of sending troops to Angola to save the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But Diallo said what Angola needed was a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said no decision on intervention was made yet. He added
that such a decision could be made only by the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Diallo, who arrived in South Africa from Angola Tuesday
morning, leaves later on the day for Namibia. He will also visit
Zimbabwe, Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire, and again Angola during the first
round of his diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
Several other countries will be visited before he returns to
South Africa in a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Foreign Investment Inflow Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was the
largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa
last year, with inflows rising from 760 million U.S. Dollars in
1996 to 1.7 billion Dollars, a United Nations report has showed.
</P>
<P>
The figure was revealed in the annual report of the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on Monday, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa attracted more than a quarter of the continent's
FDI last year, which stood at 6.4 billion Dollars, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Releasing highlights of the annual UNCTAD report in
Johannesburg, the South African Industrial Development
Corporation said the sharp increase in capital inflow was largely
due to the privatization of public corporations.
</P>
<P>
These included the 30 percent sale of Telkom, the state-owned
telecommunications company, the sale of six radio stations and
Sun Air.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1998, FDI flows into South Africa
continued to be driven mainly by privatization, including the
purchase of a 20 percent share in the airport authority by an
Italian firm, an official of the corporation, Jorge Maia, said.
</P>
<P>
"Some foreign investment may also have been attracted by the
restructuring and unbundling of large South African conglomerate
companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, FDI unrelated to privatization appeared to have
declined between 1996 and 1997, Maia said.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the incoming FDI came from the United
States, Malaysia, Britain, Germany and Japan. Some 60 percent of
the total inflow was in the form of mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Excluding South Africa, FDI flows to Africa were just three
percent of total flows to developing countries last year, with a
volume of 4.7 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Angola accounted for
two-thirds of this total.
</P>
<P>
Noting that foreign direct investment into Africa was low, the
U.N. report said there were signs of rising levels for the
future, as economic reforms and regulatory improvements in many
African countries were being recognized by foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition's Presidential Petition Turned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Supreme Court here
Tuesday threw out a presidential petition in which five
opposition parties were challenging the parentage of President
Frederick Chiluba and the results of the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube who led a full bench of five
judges ruled that Chiluba, who defeated former president Kenneth
Kaunda in Zambia's first multi-party elections held in 1991 and
was re-elected in the 1996 elections, is a Zambian and cleared
him of allegations that he is either a Congolese or Mozambican.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties including the country's largest
opposition party, the United National Independence Party led by
Kaunda, were petitioning, among other things, that the results of
the country's 1996 presidential elections should be declared null
and void because Chiluba was a foreigner and that he did not
qualify to stand for the elections held on November 18, 1996
under the constitution amendments.
</P>
<P>
The amendments adopted in May 1996 provide that foreign
nationals and those with foreign parentage are prohibited from
contesting the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The court also declared during a four-hour ruling that the
1996 elections were substantially conducted within the country's
electoral regulations despite a few flaws unearthed in the
electoral process by over 100 petitioners' witness.
</P>
<P>
As for Chiluba's controversial parentage, Ngulube cited
various authorities to prove that people born prior to October
24, 1964 when Zambia won its independence from Britain
automatically or by constitutional provisions became Zambian
citizens after independence.
</P>
<P>
Even though a number of witnesses in the one-year continuous
trial from February 1997 to January 1998, including the
self-proclaimed father of Chiluba, Luka Chabala Kafupi, had
testified that the president was born at a mission hospital in
former Zaire, Chiluba could still be a Zambian under the
pre-independence or post-independence constitution and laws, said
the chief justice.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the petitioners had called other witnesses who
testified that Chiluba was born of a father, Gym Zialale Nkonde,
from Mozambique while others had testified that he was born at a
village near Kitwe, 400 kilometers north of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Although the parentage of Chiluba was a matter of public
controversy, said Ngulube, the conflicting stories given by
witnesses regarding the president's origin could not be relied
upon.
</P>
<P>
He added that the court would rather rely on Chiluba's own
sworn testimony that he is a Zambian born at a northern Musangu
village and his mother Daina Kaimbe and his father Titus Jacob
Nkonde were Zambians.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice further pointed out that even if it were
true that Chabala or Nkonde from Mozambique were Chiluba's true
biological father, the question of citizenship would not arise
because he and all his alleged fathers would have become Zambian
citizens on October 24, 1996.

<HEADLINE> UK Doctor Sent for Trial on Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A British doctor was sent for
trial on Tuesday accused of murdering an 81-year-old patient and
forging her will.
</P>
<P>
Harold Shipman, 52, has been charged with murder Kathleen
Grundy and attempted deception to try to inherit her 300,000-pound
(498,100 US dollars) estate. He has been charged with murdering
three other women, all were his patients.
</P>
<P>
Police began investigating Shipman when Grundy's daughter
contacted them after discovering her mother's will had apparently
been changed two weeks before her death to make Shipman the sole
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
A court near Manchester in northwest England sent him to trial
on Tuesday for Grundy's death and will decide on December 7
whether he should face trial for the others.
</P>
<P>
All four of the murders with which he is charged allegedly took
place between December last year and June this year.
</P>
<P>
Shipman is being held in prison until his trial begins with a
hearing on December 8, where he is due to make his plea.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Claim to Pinpoint Animal Protein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
claimed to have pinpointed the first ever "pure" animal protein
which can phenomenally trigger forward motility of sperms in
mammals.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Tuesday that the
promising discovery might serve as the panacea for all male
infertility problems arising out of poor mammalian sperm motility
inside the female genital tract.
</P>
<P>
PTI said that the protein had been purified for the first time
from a biological fluid -- buffalo blood serum.
</P>
<P>
Two scientist, G. C. Majumder and M. Mandal, from the Indian
Institute of Chemical Biology in Calcutta struck upon the "pure"
animal glycoprotein while hunting for natural sperm motility
regulators in buffalo, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
All other motility promoting proteins earlier reported mostly
by American scientists are "impure" since they are a mix of a
group of proteins namely albumins and immunoglobins.
</P>
<P>
In a project sponsored by the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research in collaboration with the Department of Atomic
Energy, PTI said, the scientist tested the protein on buffalo and
goat semen samples.
</P>
<P>
They reported "excellent" results at the National Congress on
Andrology and Reproductive Medicine held in Calcutta recently.
</P>
<P>
The research team had applied for patents for their discovery
in India, Japan, the United States and Europe.

<HEADLINE> UK High Street Sales Take A dive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) - The UK retailers have suffered a
large slump in sales last month, which is said only the second
time since March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall in UK High Street sales has heightened fears
that the country is heading for a recession and lead to fresh
calls for another cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), published
Tuesday, show that retail sales fell 0.6 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The decline, it says, was caused by many shops putting on sales
throughout the month in an attempt to lure cautious shoppers to
spend money.
</P>
<P>
Bridget Rosewell, chief economic adviser to the BRC, said:
"These results show that the half-point cut in interest rates
announced last Thursday was well timed."
</P>
<P>
"The trend is still firmly downwards and will need to be
reversed shortly if the economy is to keep growing," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, many observers here believe that customers are now
keeping a tight hold on their wallets, fearing that they could
soon be out of a job if firms start laying off workers as the
economy deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
A series of high profile job losses in regions such as the
North East has created a crisis of confidence amongst shoppers.
</P>
<P>
There are now concerns that consumer confidence could collapse
further without another cut in interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Injected Genes Help Grow New Blood Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have for
the first time shown that inserted genes into the heart could
enable patients to grow their new blood vessels, reported the
Washington Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this approach could someday spare patients the
need for bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
Currently several teams in the United States have injected a
gene that makes a protein called vascular endothelial growth
factor or VEGF into the hearts of people who have clogged vessels
but are too sick to go under ordinary bypass surgery or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the gene prompts the heart to sprout
tiny new blood vessels to nourish blood-starved muscle and relieve
crippling chest pain.
</P>
<P>
Reporting at a meeting held in Dallas Monday by American Heart
Association, Ronald G. Crystal of Cornell Medical School in New
York City said that among the 16 patients receiving the VSGF gene
injection, some were taking as many as 60 nitroglycerin tablets a
week for their pain, now the average dose is 2.5 pills weekly.
nearly half of the patients are entirely free of pain.

<P>
LUANDA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's supermarket
group, Shoprite Checkers, has planned to open a large supermarket
network and fresh food stores in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The plan of Shoprite has won the approval of the Angolan
government the other day, the Angolan News Agency Angog reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The South African company has decided to invest 30.9 million
U.S. Dollars to set up three limited corporations in Angola from
1998 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Shoprite's investment plan, 14.69 million Dollars
will go to Shoprite Supermarket, 12.77 million Dollars to
Shoprite Angola Real Estate and 3.44 million Dollars to Angola
Fresh Food Market.
</P>
<P>

network in Angola. Currently, it has plan to open eight
supermarkets and one big storage in capital Luanda, in Lobito in
central Angola and in Cabinda City in the north.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Turkey to Stop Military Action in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Tuesday called on Turkey to stop its
military action in northern Iraq and withdraw its troops from
Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's territorial integrity should be preserved and any
action violating it should be avoided, Mohammadi was quoted by
the official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 Turkish troops moved into northern Iraq on Sunday
in a new cross-border offensive to wipe out the bases of the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), outlawed in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK militants have been fighting since 1984 for an
autonomous Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said such (military) actions would only deteriorate
the already fragile situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We understand Turkey's security concerns, but we believe that
military actions will further complicate the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey should pull back its troops and settle
the issue through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has launched series of cross-border military strikes to
try to eradicate Kurdish rebels taking shelter in northern Iraq,
over which Iraq lost control after the 1991 Gulf War when the
U.S. and its allies set up a de facto autonomous Kurdish zone.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has reportedly lost much of its support recently since
Turkey pressured Syria to stop its alleged aid to the rebels and
the Iraqi Kurdish factions controlling northern Iraq pledged to
fight it.
</P>
<P>
The lastest Turkish raid against the PKK was timed to talks
between two Iraqi Kurdish leaders in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The two factions - the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan - signed a peace accord in Washington
in September, agreeing to share power and hold elections next year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement upset Turkey, which opposes any move toward the
creation of an independent Kurdish state that could inspire the
PKK in its battle for autonomy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Special Interest in Israel's Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Israel
has denied that it has "special interest" in Israel's local
elections as reported by the local press.
</P>
<P>
Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz told the Israel Radio Tuesday
that it is natural for the U.S. embassy to watch closely the local
election to see who will win, but that does not mean the embassy
has a particular and special interest in it.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper Ha'aretz reported Tuesday that the
U.S. embassy has been monitoring the municipal elections, which
started Tuesday morning, very closely, seeking clues for the
direction Israeli politics are heading for.
</P>
<P>
It said that embassy staff not only tried their best to gather
information about the elections, but also paid special attention
to the parties' general approach, campaign strategy and the
importance the parties attach to the results of the elections.
</P>
<P>
It also said the embassy set up a special team two months ago,
whose members did not bother to conceal the true reason for their
interest.
</P>
<P>
Based on the questions the embassy officials have been asking,
the embassy is interested primarily in the implications of the
Tuesday's voting for Israel's Knesset (parliament) elections, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
During the ongoing local elections, Israeli voters elect 161
mayors among 682 candidates and 2,800 municipal council members
among 20,000 hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
The number of eligible voters is about 4 million, 3.5 million
Jews and 350,000 Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Till Tuesday evening, the average turnout around the country
was nearly 30 percent and about 300 violent incidents, big or
small, were reported during the voting.
</P>
<P>
The polling stations will closed at 8:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) and
final results will be announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has called on Arabs in East
Jerusalem to boycott the elections, saying East Jerusalem is an
occupied territory and Arab's participation would weaken the
Palestinian position in the final status negotiations over the
city.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince Gets Jordanian King's Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince and
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz received a message
Tuesday from King Hussein of Jordan on regional issues, especially
the standoff between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed by visiting Jordanian Prime Minister
Fayez Tarawneh during a meeting with Abdullah, the Kuwait News
Agency reported. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal was
present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Riyadh said that the message covered
developments of the region, mainly the Middle East peace process
and current Iraqi-U.N. standoff following Iraq's suspension of
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors late last month.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Abdullah and Tarawneh reviewed, during
their talks, bilateral relations and means of developing them in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed on the necessity to press Israel to
respect signed agreements within the peace process after Israel
halted the debate and ratification of the interim peace agreement
it signed with the Palestinians in Washington on October 23.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also urged Iraq to implement the U.N. Security
Council resolutions and resume cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh, who arrived in Saudi Arabia earlier Tuesday, is
expected to meet Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz later in the day
and relay a similar message from King Hussein, who is currently
in the U.S. for medical treatment of cancer.

MAPUTO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese acrobats Tuesday added
much fun to the festivity of the 111st birthday of Maputo, the
capital city of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen young artists from the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe gave
their first performance at the Red Star Stadium in Maputo Tuesday
morning to the warm welcome of 500 enthusiastic Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by the light and happy Chinese traditional music,
the acrobats performed their feats, bringing down the entire hall
time and again.
</P>
<P>
For example, a young girl kicked a dozen of bowls onto her
head, without dropping even one. This item won a gold medal in
the world acrobatics competition in Hungary earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
One Mozambican lady said she really enjoyed the show, saying
"it is really beautiful."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese troupe is scheduled to offer five shows in Maputo
before leaving for other African countries including South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel of Wasting Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat on Tuesday accused Israel
of wasting time in the implementation of the peace agreement
signed by the two sides last month.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Britain's Duke of Kent in the West Bank city
of Ramallah, Arafat expressed his doubts that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would fulfill Israel's obligations
under the agreement immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that Netanyahu will waste a lot of time and he is
not going to implement the agreement honestly and quickly at all,"
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour also told reporters
that the agreement should not be implemented unilaterally by the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the PNA might stop fulfilling its
commitments under the agreement if Israeli cabinet failed to
ratify the accord in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel is to withdraw troops from a
further 13 percent of the West Bank in the second redeployment.
In return, the PNA will take tougher measures against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli government has delayed the implementation of the
agreement several times, which had been scheduled to begin on
November 2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister's Office said on Tuesday that
Netanyahu hopes his cabinet will reconvene on Wednesday to
continue discussion over the agreement, which was disrupted by a
terror car bomb attack in Jerusalem on November 6.

<HEADLINE> Panel Discusses State Role in Economic Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A panel of experts
Tuesday met at the U.N. headquarters here on the role of the State
in the management of Economy, also known as economic governance.
</P>
<P>
The discussion about the state role in economic management is
often characterized by extremes: a minimalistic State, or the
neoliberal view, with a restricted role in correcting market
failures, or an elaborate welfare State, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the discussion, organized by the Second Committee
of the General Assembly, is "The Third Way: Between Neoliberalism
and the Welfare State."
</P>
<P>
The "third way" concept tries to define a middle ground that
recognizes an active State role, but also the need to reform the
welfare State.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the concept stresses the need for effective public
management. This approach may combine a State role in providing
legal, regulatory frameworks for functioning markets, and in
setting a social policy, which recognizes the need for individual
responsibility, while assisting the truly needy.
</P>
<P>
The elaboration of practical policies to implement this concept
might provide a more realistic model for many countries, said a
U.N. report on Public Administration and Development.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no dispute concerning the essential role of
functioning national and global markets, there is a need for the
State to create the adequate institutional, legal and regulatory
frameworks.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it is seen as necessary for the State to engage in
active social policies, based on sound financing options that are
tailored to real needs and do not undermine incentives for
self-responsibility and work. This calls for adjustments in the
welfare and social security systems, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect of the "third way" concept is the need to
introduce new public management methods, in order to balance
efficiency and equity.
</P>
<P>
These include new innovative system, such as the reform of
the civil service, the application of information technology,
decentralization of decision-making and new approaches to human
resources management.
</P>
<P>
The discussion of adequate institutional and regulatory regimes
is seen as an important part of the efforts to foster
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The panel groups Anthony Giddens, director of London School of
Economics and Political Science, Jacques Baudot, director of the
Copenhagen Seminar on Social Policy, Linda Lim, director of the
Southeast Asia Program, School of Business at University of
Michigan, and Kwame Pianin, chief executive officer from New World
Investment, Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The Second Committee, in charge of economic and financial
matters in the world, considers annually issues relating to
public-sector economics and management.
</P>
<P>
This year, the relevant report of the U.N. Secretary-General is
being considered under a General Assembly agenda, entitled "Report
of the Economic and Social Council."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hails Substantive Talks for EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government has
welcomed the opening of substantive negotiations for Cyprus'
accession to the European Union (EU) in Brussels, Belgium, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said "we consider the start of substantive
negotiations as a very important event and an important landmark
in Cyprus' European course."
</P>
<P>
The EU started accession talks with the Greek Cypriot-dominated
Cypriot government last March, which was strongly opposed by the
Turkish Cypriots in the north and their ally Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 into Turkish Cypriot
controlled north and Greek Cypriot dominated south when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the east
Mediterranean island through a bi-communal formula. But the peace
talks were stalled last year when Turkish Cypriots opted out of
the negotiations to protest the EU's decision to began accession
talks with Cypriot government while excluding Turkey from its
immediate membership candidates list.
</P>
<P>
Some EU member states hold that the Cyprus problem should be
solved by political means before the island joins the EU.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that those who are trying to
associate in any way the island's accession course with the Cyprus
problem "do not help the peace process" because they "encourage
Turkey's intransigence."
</P>
<P>
Such words weaken EU's intention to act as a catalyst for a
settlement to the Cyprus problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Monday's joint statement by France, Germany and
the Netherlands that Cyprus' division poses "particular
difficulties" to the Common European Foreign and Security Policy,
Stylianides described it as only "an expression of intent," saying
that "what is important and legally valid are the official
documents and decisions by the EU."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the accession course is the only
substantive lever that will exert continuous pressure on Turkey to
change its position regarding a settlement on the island.

<HEADLINE> Africa, Good Place for Investment: OAU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Assistant Secretary-General Vijay S. Makhan said
Tuesday that Africa is a good place for doing business.
</P>
<P>
There should no longer be room for negative images and such
stereotypes that the whole of Africa is a place of war and
instability, Makhan said when he was speaking at a ceremony for
the launching of "World Investment report 1998" at the United
Nations Conference center here.
</P>
<P>
First, the African continent is a highly profitable investment
location, said Makhan, who doubles as assistant chief of the
African Economic Community (AEC). "Data for United States and
Japanese affiliates of trans-national companies operating in
Africa show that they received rates of return that exceeded
those in other developing regions," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Second, Makhan said, notwithstanding exogenous developments
during 1997 including the El Nino weather phenomenon and the
weakening of commodity prices, the macro-economic fundamentals in
most African countries remain sound, continuing the steady trend
of improvement that has been observed throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Third, he said that African governments have made enormous
efforts to improve their national policy frameworks for
attracting and retaining foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
According to Makhan, of the 53 African countries, 47 have
adopted liberal legal instruments to promote and facilitate
investment inflows.
</P>
<P>
In addition to these efforts, African countries have signed
bilateral investment treaties, which numbered 326 in 1997 mainly
with countries outside the continent.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, Makhan noted that efforts are being made throughout
the continent to reduce bureaucratic red tape, to streamline
procedures concerned with the administration of investment, and
to eliminate corruption.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five African investment promotion agencies are now
members of the World Association of Investment Promotion
Agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Makhan, four other elements are:
</P>
<P>
Fifth, despite all the constraints on many African countries
including an unsustainable debt burden, African governments have
been taking steps to improve the competitiveness of their
economies;
</P>
<P>
Sixth, African governments have created opportunities for
foreign direct investment by steadily expanding privatization
programs;
</P>
<P>
Seventh, at a sub-regional level, African governments are
factoring the advantages of regional cooperation and integration
into their efforts to attract foreign direct investment;
</P>
<P>
And eighth, although Africa's trade preferences have generally
been eroded by the Uruguay Round Agreements, most African
countries still have residual preferential access for exports to
the European Union through the Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
Makhan said in conclusion that international investors should
look at African countries afresh especially in the light of the
changes that have been taking place.
</P>
<P>
Launching this year's investment report here, Samuel Nyambi,
Resident Representative of the United Nations Development
Program, said that this year's investment report will open a
wider discussion on policy issues related to trade liberalization
and foreign direct investment flows and the relative advantages
of developing countries in the competition to attract foreign
capital.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Not Blamed by DRC: Says FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian foreign
ministry spokesman Simeon Ileta Tuesday refuted media reports
that the government has been criticized as double-dealing in
mediating the crisis of Democratic of Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Dar es Salaam, Ileta, who is also the
Head of Information Department of the ministry, said neither the
DRC government nor its embassy here has made any complaints about
Tanzania's policy towards the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The stories about DRC's criticism of Tanzanian government are
merely fabricated, he said, adding that the Tanzanian government will not
take them into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Since war erupted in DRC, Ileta said, Tanzania as a sovereign
state and a Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) member
has maintained that solution to the conflict can only be dialogs
by warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has distanced itself from military involvement in DRC
after rebels took up arms against President Laurent Kabila on
August 2.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have reportedly backed rebel troops while
Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad and Sudan have took sides with
the DRC government troops.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Tanzanian government's position after Rwanda
has acknowledged its military presence in DRC, Ileta said it is a
positive step towards solving the crisis in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that SADC states will convene a summit in the near
future to create an environment suitable for all warring parties
find a political solution to the DRC conflicts.

UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Tuesday convened a Technical Meeting on the Demographic Impact on
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the United Nations Population Division, in
collaboration with the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS,
the one-day meeting is to discuss current and future research
activities on the demographic impact of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the opening of the meeting, the United
Nations Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette said "HIV/AIDS
is a global human tragedy, which denies to the millions of its
victims the benefits of humanity's greatest achievement -- a
healthy, long life -- This indeed is one of the most serious
threats and challenges for the next century."
</P>
<P>
"The HIV/AIDS continues unabated, especially in developing
countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS now is
threatening the economic and social development gains that have

<HEADLINE> Former Russian Banking Officials to Face Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prosecutor General Yuri
Skuratov said Tuesday that his office will open an investigation
into the alleged abuse of funds by several former senior Central
Bank officials.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry started in the wake of the August 17 default on
Russia's debts, Interfax quoted Skuratov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He did not give the names of the officials, who were suspected
of abusing Central Bank funds earmarked for specific purposes.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov said several criminal inquiries had already been
opened, and that documents on securities trading by individuals
were seized from the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry showed that some senior officials had used
classified information about prices on the Treasury-bill market in
their own interests, Skuratov said.
</P>
<P>
The bank's previous leadership committed "gross violations of
legislation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Bank sometimes issued a permit for a deal two
years after the deal had been effected," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, ex-chairman of the Central Bank Sergei Dubinin, now
vice-chairman of the Gazprom executive board, said he did not know
"what gross violations of the law in the Central Bank" Skuratov
meant.
</P>
<P>
"I have not seen any official documents dealing with what
Skuratov spoke about. The Prosecutor-General's Office did not ask
me any questions within the framework of a probe into this
problem. Nor did Skuratov quote any facts regarding it," Dubinin
said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding criminal proceedings initiated by the Prosecutor-
General's Office against highly-placed officials who allegedly
used information on GKOs in their own interests, Dubinin said that
he "as an individual did not perform any operations with
securities."
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whom exactly the prosecutor-general meant," he
said. "I know nothing about the use of information about
quotations on GKOs by any official for his own interests," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "previous statements concerning violations of
regulations on the use of IMF credits by the Central Bank were not
backed by any facts."
</P>
<P>
Skuratov said two letters to the Central Bank's current
chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, have been prepared to notify him of
the early results of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to help the Central Bank's present leadership "to
avoid repeating the same errors," Skuratov added.

<HEADLINE> Oil-for-Food Program Fails: Iraqi Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food
program failed to alleviate the Iraqi people's suffering caused by
the trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for eight years, said a senior
Iraqi official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh made the remarks at
the closing ceremony of the 31st Baghdad International Fair which
opened on November 1.
</P>
<P>
Saleh told reporters that the fourth phase of the oil-for-food
program, which came into force last June, will expire by November
25. However, he said, only 10 percent of the contracted food has
arrived in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"What is even worse is that no contracted medicine under this
phase has reached Iraq at all," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is
allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount of oil Iraq is allowed to export will not
exceed 3 billion dollars due to the low prices on world oil
markets.
</P>
<P>
Saleh termed the U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq as "equivalent to
mass genocide of the Iraqi people", elaborating that 5,000 Iraqi
children died every month due to shortages of medicine and food.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has the ability to meet all the requirements of its people
if the U.N. lifts the ongoing trade sanctions, said Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed the crippling sanctions on Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. According to U.N. resolutions, the
sanctions cannot be lifted unless U.N. arms inspectors verify that
Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister also called on foreign countries to
strengthen economic and trade cooperation with Iraq, promising
that Iraq is able to cope with the current situation.
</P>
<P>
The 31st Baghdad International Fair, the largest since the
1991 Gulf War, opened one day after Iraq halted all forms of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership said it would not rescind its decision
until the U.N. Security Council considers lifting the economic
sanctions and restructuring the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution on November 5,
condemning Iraq's confrontation and urging it to resume
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, but Iraq has yet
turned a deaf ear to the U.N. call.

LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua)-- Stock markets in Europe drifted
lower Tuesday amid an air of profit taking and an absence of
positive news.
</P>
<P>
Poor trading in Asia overnight set the tone for an early
morning easing in Europe. A lackluster opening on Wall Street
further lowered sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The pick-up in the Dow in late afternoon european trade helped
the late-closing FTSE 100 to outpace its European peers.

While sentiment in London was generally bearish, traders noted
that volume was thin ahead of the Bank of England's quarterly
inflation report.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 ended the day almost unmoved, falling just 1.6
points to 5,432.3. But the FTSE 250 was 50.3 points lower at
4884.6.

Shares in retailer Marks &AMP; Spencer rose more than 4 percent, as

CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Tuesday reiterated a call
for continued diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to
the latest Iraq-U.N. standoff over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said that a diplomatic solution to the crisis must exhaust all
avenues, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided last month to halt cooperation with the United
Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM, charged with eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States has not ruled out military strikes to force
Baghdad's cooperation with UNSCOM, which must verify that Iraq has
destroyed its weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. can lift
the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Egypt said last Saturday that it "rejects the use of force
against Iraq," warning against "instability in the region." Cairo
insisted that political efforts be given a chance to defuse the
tension.

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on
Tuesday that its member states and the European Commission would
combine to contribute 101.8 million ECU (111.98 million U.S.
dollars) to central America that fell prey to Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
The 15 European Union member states put together a humanitarian
aid worth 71 million ECU while the commission, the executive body
of the union, garnered 30.8 million ECU, according to commission
sources.
</P>
<P>
Spain accounted for half of the 71 million ECU contributed by
the member states.
</P>
<P>
The European Union aid will cover food aid and rehabilitation
in central America, where the hurricane already claimed a toll of
26,000 deaths and missing and left 3 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
France also offered to annul the debts the central American
countries owe it while the Netherlands decided to annul the
payment of debt interest and this year's installment of debt
payment by Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Mitch triggered floods and mud slides that raked havoc
with the central American countries, especially in Honduras and
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Honduras and Nicaragua appealed for international creditors to
write off 11 billion dollars in debt owed by the two countries
whose economies have been ruined by the hurricane.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Implement Law Regarding Spying Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government will
implement law and order regarding the recent alleged espionage
case of two Israelis against the Cypriot army, government
spokesman Christos Stylianides said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government "has a duty and an obligation to implement the
law and order, to fully respect the laws and the constitutional
provisions and decisions of the courts on the issue," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Two Israelis - Udi Argov, 37 and Ig'al Damari, 49 - were caught
spying in Cyprus' southern coastal village of Zygi between
November 6-7. Cyprus police said they found sophisticated
listening devices and radio scanners, tuned into police radio
frequencies during their search for suspects' apartment.
</P>
<P>
They were remanded in custody on Saturday by Larnaca District
Court for eight days pending investigation on suspicion of spying
on the Cyprus National Guard.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli embassy in Nicosia, the two suspects
have denied the charges against them.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said in the daily press briefing that the
government does not wish to comment on any details of this case as
the legal procedure is still underway.
</P>
<P>
Referring to statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who said he will bring back home the two Israelis,
Stylianides said "it is his right to make any statements which
concern the repatriation of the two Israeli suspects."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, any repatriation must be done legally. The
Cypriot government will act according to the laws of the state, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the Israeli government did not make any
representations to the Cypriot embassy in Tel Aviv, nor did the
Cypriot government make any representations over Netanyahu's
statements.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Israeli President Ezer Weizman's message to
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides will not be made public, noting
that negotiations regarding the two Israelis are underway through
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
The message from Weizman, who paid a state visit to Cyprus last
week, was conveyed to Clerides by Weizman's Director General Ariel
Shumer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Justice and Public Order Nicos Koshis
said Tuesday that the Cypriot authorities will continue their
investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
All evidence will be submitted to the attorney-general for a
final decision, he added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Sets up Fund for Unemployed Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
provided 500 million Shillings (400,000 U.S. Dollars) as start-up
capital for educated but unemployed graduates for self employment
and income generation.
</P>
<P>
Radio Uganda reported that an agreement was signed for the
management of the fund at Cooperative Bank here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 400 million Shillings (320,000 Dollars) has already been
released to the Cooperative Bank who will manage the revolving
credit program. Another 500 million Shillings (400,000 Dollars)
have been budgeted this financial year for the scheme, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Entandikwa Secretariat will coordinate the scheme while
Uganda Manufacturers' Association and the Private Sector
Development Program will coordinate the training component.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries of the fund are youths from universities and
tertiary institutions between the ages of 18 to 30 years who must
undergo training in business skills development for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
After the training, the youths will be put in apprenticeship
attachments with ongoing successful enterprises in order to
orient them into real life situations of managing small
enterprises profitably.
</P>
<P>
They will then recommend to the Cooperative Bank to access the
loans which will be charged 16 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
Over 450 youths have received training for the scheme, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Firm Refutes Report of Buying Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Greenland Investment
Limited (GIL) has denied having bought the 49 percent shares in
Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) but vowed to participate in the
buying of the remaining 51 percent shares when they are floated.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference Tuesday, the GIL Chairman
Suleiman Kiggundu said his company has earlier showed interest
but lost to Westmont Land Behad Asia (WLBA), a Malaysian company.
</P>
<P>
A Radio Uganda report quoted the chairman as dismissing as
mere speculation that there have been agreements between his
company and the Malaysian partner.
</P>
<P>
Even if such agreements were contemplated, he said, they would
be inexecutable, null and void, since under the agreement between
the WLBA and the Ugandan government, the buyer has no powers of
selling the bank to any other party.
</P>
<P>
The WLBA finalized payment of the purchase of 49 percent
shares of UCB and assumed management and control of the bank in
April this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary of Finance Tumusiime Mutebile
has assured Ugandans who have deposits in UCB that their money is
safe and secure.
</P>
<P>
The intervention by the central bank to supervise the
commercial bank is a normal procedure monitoring all private
banks, he said, adding that UCB will continue to pursue a lending
policy that will guarantee that there is no non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Uganda temporarily suspended the operations of three
commercial banks here in September, sending waves of panic among
those who deposit money in commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The continued depreciation of Shilling also contributes to
people's sensitivity to any movement in the financial sector.

BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
Tuesday strongly criticized the recent interim peace agreement
signed between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The deal, which wiped out many Palestinians rights, is on a
road to wipe out Palestine's national identity," Farouk Kadoumy,
chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Political
Department, said in a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Under the United States-brokered Wye Plantation peace deal
signed in Washington on October 23, Israel agrees to withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for the
Palestinian authority's crackdown on anti-Israeli militants.

Kadoumy said the Palestinian cause is in fact going on a way of
compromise.

He called on the Arab countries to extend their support and
solidarity to object the deal.

Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said the Wye Plantation
accord is a real disaster for the Palestinian people, adding it
will lead to a civil war among the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> 35 Percent of Tanzanian Youth Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 35 percent of
Tanzanian young people aged 12 or above smoke tobacco regularly,
according to a seminar organized by World Health Organization
(WHO).
</P>
<P>
Prevalence of smoking varies from one region to another,
statistics made available at the two-day seminar on tobacco
control indicated.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which ended in the central region of Morogoro
Tuesday, was told that 42 percent of youth aged 12 or above in
the northern region of Kilimanjaro smoke, compared with eight
percent in Mara, a Lake Victoria region.
</P>
<P>
The findings show that male to female ratio is 30 to one among
smokers in Kilimanjaro and three to one in Mara, Tanzania News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Among secondary school students in Dar es Salaam, 1.6 percent
of them appear to be smokers.
</P>
<P>
In his paper "Tobacco the Killer," Joseph Mbatta from the
Ministry of Health said although the Tanzania Tobacco Processing
Board Act of 1984 demands licensing for the production and sale
of cigarettes, it does not stipulate the legal age limit for
purchasing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
He said attempts to prevent tobacco usage have not been
effective enough due to lack of well planned coordination and
commitment of the relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Ministry of Health in
collaboration with WHO, brought together about 20 participants
representing different non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Secretary to Visit Lebanon to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley is to visit Lebanon Thursday to boost bilateral trade
ties, the independent Central News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Daley's upcoming trip is described by local media as a sign of
renewed U.S. interest in Lebanon's multi-billion U.S. dollars
reconstruction drive, which was designed to rebuild the country's
war-striken economy following its 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. lifted a decade-long ban and allowed
Americans to travel to Lebanon where its hundreds of citizens had
been killed by militiamen during the 15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The move paved the way for American businessmen to invest in
Lebanon's cash-strapped economy, the agency said..
</P>
<P>
During his visit, at the invitation of Lebanese Minister of
Economy and Trade Yassin Jaber, Daley will meet with Lebanese
outgoing President Elias Hrawi, President-elect Emile Lahoud and
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to hold talks with Lebanese senior
economic officials and businessmen in private sector to study the
possibility for the U.S. investment in Lebanon, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is part of Daley's Mideast tour, which also includes
stops in Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian self-ruled
areas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reviews Iraq Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met with senior security advisors Tuesday to explore options for a
possible military attack on Iraq while Pentagon stepped up the
movement of U.S. ships into the region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his advisers also discussed diplomatic options.
Participants included Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and General Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
"The military option is still on the table," Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen said. The United States will consider "a
significant degradation" of Iraq's war-making capacity, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of public and private contacts with Iraq,"
said David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council. "We
feel he knows what he needs to do," he added, referring to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, speaking at a Pentagon photo session with Singapore's
Defense Minister Tony Tan, said he has decided to hasten the
movement of the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier and a group of
Marine warships into the region in case the United States chooses
the military option.
</P>
<P>
Asked what airstrikes against Iraq might achieve, Cohen said
the goal would be to make sure Saddam, in the absence of U.N.
inspections, is not reconstituting his weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
"We'd consider the possibility of degrading his capability of
manufacturing the weapons of mass destruction, or the means of
delivering them, of posing a threat to the region.... It would be
a significant degradation of his capacity," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that despite an accident on the USS Enterprise that
claimed the lives of several crew members, he'd ordered the
carrier and its battle group to cut several days from its planned
transit to the region.
</P>
<P>
That would put it in the Persian Gulf by November 23, Cohen
said. He'd also ordered a Marine task force led by the USS Belleau
Wood to do the same, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Enterprise was due to swap out of the region with the USS
Dwight D. Eisenhower, now in the Gulf. The Belleau Wood, which is
normally based in Okinawa, Japan, is slated to arrive by November
26, and replace the Marines there now, led by the USS Essex.
</P>
<P>
"This cannot go on indefinitely," State Department spokesman
James Rubin said. "Saddam Hussein is not an abstract threat."
</P>
<P>
With inspections suspended, Rubin said, "He will be able to
reconstitute his weapons in a matter of months, not years."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, at a weekend meeting, had asked for more diplomatic
and military options. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart
said Tuesday's meeting was "part of the military options process."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the meeting should send Saddam the message that
"the world community is determined that he reverse course and
allow full cooperation with (U.N.) inspectors. And that all
options remain on the table should he decide on his current
course."

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $16m Loan for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved a 16 million U.S. Dollar loan for Sierra Leone
to support the country's 1998/99 economic program aimed at
repairing the damage from recent civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
A report from Washington said the loan, approved by the IMF
Monday, will be extended under its emergency post-conflict
assistance scheme which was created in 1995 to help countries
trying to overcome the effects of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's economy has been laid waste by years of civil
unrest due to the rebel of the Revolutionary United Front and
most recently to the rule of the military junta led by Johnny
Paul Koromah from May 1997 to February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the IMF as saying that the rebuilding of
Sierra Leone's institutions will lay the basis for more extensive
reforms, possibly backed by more IMF money under its Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility from mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF, Sierra Leone's real gross domestic
Product is expected to grow by 0.7 percent this year and by a
more impressive 5.9 percent in 1999, after shrinking by 20.2
percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Ban Import of Ethyl Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia will ban the import of
ethyl alcohol until January 1, 2002, under a bill drafted by the
country's Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The move, coupling with earlier measures of tighter controls
over the production of ethyl alcohol inside the country, will
place the Russian alcohol market under full state control, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ban on alcohol import will make it easier for law
enforcement agencies to supervise the sales of alcohol in border
areas as all imported alcohol will be regarded as contraband.
</P>
<P>
According to Russia's State Taxation Service, two thirds of the
alcoholic products reaching the market are illicit as a result of
smuggling, bootleg distillery and unauthorized sales of ethyl
alcohol, vodka and other strong drinks, causing major losses to
the Russian economy, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Bill for Enforcing Anti-Bribery in Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday signed bill pushing and enforcing an international
anti-bribery agreement in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which requires major U.S. trading partners to
adopt anti-bribery laws, is part of a Clinton administration
strategy for pushing forward U.S. exports even amid Asia's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the few countries with laws against
using bribes to win foreign business deals. U.S. businessmen and
executives have complained for years that the 1977 Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act puts them at a disadvantage in trying to win
business contracts overseas.
</P>
<P>
Congress passed legislation making the United States part of
the agreement on October 21.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to say... it cost us a lot of business over the last
20 years to do the right thing, but it is clearly the right
thing," Clinton said. "American companies deserve a level playing
field... and now we will have it."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Town Hall Meeting of students, teachers, business
leaders and members of his advisory Export Council, the president
also expressed concern that U.S. steel companies are suffering
from a surge of cut-rate steel imports from Japan, South Korea and
other economically distressed Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The president, in remarks linked to an audience in six states
by video, telephone and the Internet, previewed his scheduled trip
to Asia this weekend to attend the annual gathering of leaders of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met at the White House last week with U.S. steel
industry executives concerned about rising imports of Japanese and
other foreign steel.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to a full, timely enforcement of our trade
laws... protecting this industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Commerce Department Tuesday released new
regulations on enforcing trade laws in the steel sector.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to visit Japan and South Korea after the
APEC summit. The APEC gathering coincides with strains in the
international financial system that began in East Asia in 1997,
spread this year to Russia and now threatens Brazil and other
Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
"We have heavy responsibilities here in the United States," he
said. "We must continue with our efforts to generate greater
economic growth, to seek freer and fair trade, to see that trade
and global financial systems are modified to meet the needs of the
21st century, to roll back the present financial crisis and to
design efforts that will lift the lives of all people over the
long run."
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of growth in Japan, which has been stalled now
for more than five years, is absolutely essential to the
restoration of growth in the rest of Asia," Clinton added. "The
rest of us look to Japan to move quickly."

discuss ways for a peaceful solution to the Ethio-Eritrean
dispute returned here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation said on arrival at Bole International Airport
that it had held talks with its Eritrean counterpart on ways of
resolving the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency said that the two religious
delegations reached consensus that the two countries which share
historical and cultural values should not go into war.
</P>
<P>
They also reached agreement that the religious leaders of the
respective countries should exert maximum efforts to resolve the
crisis between the two countries
</P>
<P>
Reverend Yadesa Daba, member of the Ethiopian delegation
representing the Ethiopian Evangellical Church said that high on

<HEADLINE> Cohen Warns Iraq Time Running Out to Comply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday that time was running out for Iraqi government to resume
cooperation with U.N. arms inspections and ordered the aircraft
carrier Enterprise to speed its transit to the Gulf to replace
another carrier.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference with visiting Singapore Defense
Minister Tony Tan, Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters
that impatience with Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was growing.
</P>
<P>
"We have all indicated that time is running out," he said when
asked if the United States was drawing closer to attack after Iraq
declared on October 31 that it would no longer cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"The military option is still on the table," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that he had ordered the carrier Enterprise, which
routinely left Norfolk Virginia, this week to replace the carrier
Eisenhower in the Gulf, to speed its transit and arrive on
November 23 instead of November 26.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he did not now plan to keep both carriers in the
region within striking distance of Iraq. The Eisenhower is winding
up a six-months overseas deployment and scheduled to return to
Norfolk in early December.
</P>
<P>
The Marine helicopter carrier Belleau Wood is also heading to
the Gulf from Japan to replace the helicopter carrier Essex and
will arrive on November 26, Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has about 170 warplanes and 21 ships in
the Gulf region, including the Eisenhower and seven other ships
capable of launching long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. An
eighth Tomahawk-armed ship, the cruiser Anzio, is moving toward
the Gulf through the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton again reviewed military and
diplomatic options with Cohen and other senior advisers on Tuesday
as the U.S. tried to determine the best response to Iraq's
defiance of the United Nations over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he did not expect
the meeting to produce a decision on whether the United States
would resort to military action to force Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to back down.
</P>
<P>
So far no final ultimatum or deadline has been outlined by
Clinton, who is scheduled to leave on Saturday on a 10-day
Asia-Pacific tour.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Says Its Concerns over Northern Iraq Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey heaved a sigh of relief
Tuesday following the declaration of an awaited trilateral
statement by Turkey, Britain and the United States on the future
of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that the
statement was "an encouraging development" and Turkey's concerns
were eased, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"A new era of relations is starting in northern Iraq," Ecevit
said.
</P>
<P>
The trilateral statement, which was first released by Ankara
and later by London and Washington, made it clear that Iraq's
territorial integrity should be fully respected.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was upset by a peace accord signed by two rival Iraqi
Kurdish groups - the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by
Massoud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by
Jalal Talabani - on September 17 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Turkey feared that the KDP-PUK agreement on power sharing and
future elections could lead to a Kurdish state in northern Iraq,
which would further encourage the activities of Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-U.S.-British statement also stressed that Turkey's
legitimate security concerns and its right to defend itself
against terrorism should be respected.
</P>
<P>
"We also welcome the clear commitment by the KDP and PUK to
deny sanctuary to the PKK, to eliminate all PKK Bases from the
region, and to safeguard the Turkish border," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Barzani, who visited Ankara last week, and Talabani, who is
still in Ankara for contacts with Turkish officials, have said
that they will join hands to fight the PKK and maintain peace and
tranquility in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to strengthen ties with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Talabani, who allegedly keeps closer relations with the PKK,
also said that he would shut down all the PKK camps in areas
controlled by his group.
</P>
<P>
The PUK leader is expected to repeat the promises he has given
to Turkey during his meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Edges Healthy 2.3 Pct Rate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. workers'
productivity growth rate improved in the third quarter after
nearly stalling during the previous quarter, the Labor Department
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers, measured
as output per hour of work, rose at a seasonally adjusted 2.3
percent annual rate in the third quarter, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
During the second quarter, productivity advanced at a scant 0.3
percent rate, the slowest increase in nearly two years.
Productivity was robust during the first three months of the year,
rising at a 3.5 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
After growing at a brisk 2.9 percent annual rate in the 1960s
and early 1970s, productivity slowed to a paltry 1 percent from
1974 through 1995. Since then, it's been growing at around a 2
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
That's led some economists to speculate that the economy has
embarked on a new era of productivity growth, driven by computers
and other high-tech innovations.
</P>
<P>
However, in Tuesday's report, there were signs of the strain
imposed on the economy by the world financial turmoil that began
in Asia last year and has depressed U.S. export sales.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output, which represents 18 percent of the
economy, declined at a 0.6 percent rate, the first drop since
1991, during the last recession.
</P>
<P>
Hours worked at factories fell even further, at a 4.1 percent
rate. So, productivity within the sector remained strong, growing
at a 3.7 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
For all nonfarm businesses, output rose at a moderate 3.5
percent rate. Growth in hours worked was the smallest in a year,
rising at a 1.2 percent rate. Unit labor costs, a key measure of
inflation pressures, rose modestly, at a 1.7 percent rate, after
shooting up at a 3.7 percent rate in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Wants Security Concerns Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Foreign Minister
Anastase Gasana said Tuesday his country is now committed to
pulling its troops out of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
but only on condition that its "legitimate" security concerns are
resolved.
</P>
<P>
Gasana predicted an early end to the fighting in the DRC
provided all parties involved in the conflict engaged in
political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that Rwanda had soldiers from its
45,000-strong army fighting alongside rebel forces in the DRC but
could not give an exact figure of the military deployment.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, Gasana
catalogued for the first time six political problems that he said
must be ironed out at the negotiating table to bring about a
peaceful resolution to the three-month-old crisis in the war-torn
DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The first one is the armed forces or elements coming from the
Congo which used to kill our people, making cross border raids to
kill Rwandans," he said at his Foreign Ministry headquarters in
the Rwandan capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The second legitimate security concern for Rwanda is what he
termed "stateless" people such as the marauding Interahamwe and
the nihilistic Mai Mai who were roving on the country's border
with Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Congo has a big problem of citizenship. There is a big
stateless population and this is not secure for us. We think
Congo has to solve its problems of citizenship of its
population," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Congolese President Laurent Kabila's government of
waging a campaign of genocide against the minority Tutsi
population in the DRC and said this is the third legitimate
concern for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
There was also a concentration of "terrorists" in the Congo
from such countries as Sudan, said Gasana, making this the fourth
security concern.
</P>
<P>
The fifth concern is the illegal trafficking in weapons of war
which he said was taking place in the DRC because the Kabila
government was not able to police its vast territory.
</P>
<P>
Next is the fact that Kabila and Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe had made declarations of war against his country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They made the declarations in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. We
think it is also a security concern for Rwanda coming from the
Congo," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the international community and all people involved can
give opportunities for these concerns to find a solution, Gasana
said, Rwanda is ready to bring its contribution for a peaceful
solution in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
These concerns can be addressed in negotiations between
Kabila, the rebels and their supporters, he added.

<HEADLINE> German Inflation Rate Lowest Since Unification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- German Inflation Rate rose 0.7
percent in October compared with the corresponding period of 1997,
the Federal Office of Statistics said Tuesday in Wiesbaden.
</P>
<P>
This is the lowest rate of inflation since German unification
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin and the former East Germany, the cost of living
was 0.6 percent, and in the former West Germany, the cost of
living was 0.7 percent, compared with the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office said that seasonal factors were the main
reason for low figure for October with prices for fresh fruit
dropping 4.7 percent, potatoes becoming 2.7 percent cheaper and
package tours costing 6.4 percent less.
</P>
<P>
The office noted that it was the first time since January 1997
that eastern German inflation was lower than that in western
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Declining energy costs also were a factor in the lower
inflation. The office said that they dropped by 0.4 percent from
September to October, with natural gas down by 1.5 percent and
light heating oil 0.3 per cent lower.
</P>
<P>
Normal heating oil rose by 0.3 percent in October, but compared
with October 1997 levels, these prices were 21.8 per cent lower.
Motor fuel costs were up 0.1 percent from September to October,
but were seven percent lower than in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Compared with October 1997 levels, overall energy costs were a
full 3.3 percent lower last month, the statistics office said.
Transportation and telecom rates were meanwhile 0.1 percent lower
on the year-to-year comparison.

<P>
LUANDA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan official Tuesday
accused the opposition National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) of killing 21 Angolans and three foreigners
last Sunday in a diamond mine in Lunda-Norte Province, east
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Alcides Pereira, Deputy Governor of the province, said Tuesday

destroyed mining facilities, vehicles as took away other
properties from the mine which belongs to a Canadian company
Diamondworks.

armed bandits in Bula Mine in Lunda-Norte. The Angolan
government believed the attack was made by the former UNITA rebel
movement, however, the U.N. observer mission in Angola failed to
identify the attackers.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Carpet Being Woven in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A 5,000-square-meter carpet,
expected to be the largest in the world, is being woven in
Iran's northeastern province of Khorasan, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ali-Asghar Zarandi, an official on carpet industry in the
province, said that the carpet is being woven in Baghshan village
by 200 female weavers, who complete 125 square meters each month.
</P>
<P>
Zarandi said that one third of the turquoise-colored carpet
has been woven with natural dyes in a period of nine months.
</P>
<P>
He said that the traditionally-designed carpet can fetch the
country 5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iran said the world's biggest carpet of 1,000
square meters was produced in Ben city in Iran's western province
of Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari. It was completed in three years by 84
weavers.
</P>
<P>
The carpet cost about 500 million rials (about 166,000
U.S. dollars) and was estimated to be priced above 1.2 billion
rials (about 400,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Iran is well-known for its traditional hand-woven carpet,
which ranks first in the country's non-oil exports. But during
recent years, the Iranian carpet industry was challenged by
products of China and India in the world market.

<HEADLINE> Strategies Formulated for Singapore's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Committee on Singapore's
Competitiveness (CSC) formed by the Singapore government Wednesday
has made public its report of proposals on the strategies for the
country's future competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The report underlines that even as Singapore takes steps to
deal with the current economic crisis, efforts should be focused
on the challenges that lie ahead beyond the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The CSC proposes that Singapore should develop into an advanced
and globally competitive knowledge economy within the next decade
with manufacturing and services as the twin engines of growth.
</P>
<P>
In order to realize the goal, CSC has recommended eight key
strategies for enhancing capabilities and managing cost
competitiveness in the economic area. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- To promote manufacturing and services as the twin engines of
growth and diversify dependence beyond any single industry, sector
or market;
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen and diversify external economic wing by
incorporating a global dimension;
</P>
<P>
-- To increase the depth of corporate profile, broaden the
economic base for sustained and resilient growth and strive to
nurture a stable of own world-class companies;
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen the base of small and medium enterprises to
entrench their relevance as important strategic partners to
multi-national companies and government-linked companies;
</P>
<P>
-- To develop a world class workforce comprising domestic and
foreign talent.
</P>
<P>
-- To leverage on science, technology and innovation
effectively as competitive tools;
</P>
<P>
-- To continually optimize allocation of the country's scarce
resources in a dual approach of increasing supply as well as
efficient usage;
</P>
<P>
-- And to highlight the importance of government's role in
economic and financial management.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan, who
doubles as CSC Chairman, told a press conference Wednesday that
CSC is confident these recommendations on strategies will ensure
Singapore to develop into a vibrant knowledge economy of the
future.
</P>
<P>
The CSC was formed in May 1997 on the advice of Singapore Prime
Minster Goh Chok Tong and was assigned to make a thorough review
of the country's economic competitiveness over the next 10 years.

<HEADLINE> NATO Blames Provocative Incidents in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) on Wednesday said provocative incidents in
Kosovo have led to the deaths of two Serbian policemen and have
also menaced the cease-fire there.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official said on condition of anonymity that a great
deal of concern was shown over the deteriorating situation in
Kosovo during Wednesday's meeting of the North Atlantic Council
(NAC), the decision-making body of the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
"NATO condemns very strongly all the incidents and the groups
that provoked them," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The alliance insisted that the Kosovo Liberation Army comply
fully with the cease-fire and cease further provocation.
</P>
<P>
NATO is also concerned with reports that the Yugoslav police
force has been setting up "flying (mobile) checkpoints" in Kosovo
and a heavy Serbian police presence has been found in the
province, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
During the day's meeting, the NAC discussed the formation and
operation, in the event of an engagement inside Kosovo, of the
extraction force, but did not reach a final decision.
</P>
<P>
NATO would like to get things right from the beginning and has
been very meticulous in planning the extraction force mission,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
The alliance is expected to finalize the extraction force
mission later this week, he added.
</P>
<P>
The extraction force, composed of 1,500 to 1,800 troops under
the command of France, is designed to provide security for a
2,000-member monitoring mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The same official confirmed that NATO has withdrawn some of the
war planes deployed for a possible air strike that was
indefinitely suspended.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is not withdrawing all the planes from the theater and
the planes can be re-deployed should air operations become
necessary. The Kosovo crisis is not over," said the official.

JOC officials said that Junsuke Inoue, 58, who would have been

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Arrangements for the
enforcement in Hong Kong of mainland arbitral awards will soon be
in place, Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 1998 International Dispute Resolution
Conference, Leung said it is hoped an agreement on the
arrangements between Hong Kong and the mainland will be signed by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"A draft agreement is being discussed, and a few minor issues
are still outstanding," she said.
</P>
<P>
Leung pointed out that although the Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards does not
apply as between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
the mainland, the approach adopted in the discussions with the
relevant mainland authorities is that the enforcement of arbitral
awards should be based on the provisions in that convention.
</P>
<P>
"When implemented, the proposed new scheme for enforcing
mainland awards would involve few, if any, changes of the scheme
that existed" before Hong Kong's return to China, she added.
</P>
<P>
"The progress that has been made is most encouraging. It is
further evidence that the differences between Hong Kong's legal
system and that of the mainland do not make mutual legal
assistance impossible, and that the concept of 'one country, two
systems' is working well," she said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian CPP Assures Security of Opposition Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) reiterated Wednesday that members of all
legal political parties, especially those sworn-in
parliamentarians will have full security and safety assurance.
</P>
<P>
"The King, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Royal
Government will assure you personal safety and legal security
during your stay in the country," Chea Sim and Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
It was the response CPP's president Chea Sim and vice-president
Hun Sen had made to opposition FUNCINPE President Prince
Ranariddh, who wrote a letter to them demanding security
assurance.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Chea Sim and Hun Sen earlier Wednesday,
Ranariddh seeks clarification from them about the politicians who
appear to be excluded from safety and security assurance, as a
statement by the Royal Government's spokesman on November 6 said:
"Those who have a prima facle case to answer to the Court, will
not be allowed to leave the country."
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also demanded that an agenda be set for any summit
meeting. However, he added that he was encouraged by the ideas
about the government Second Prime Minister Hun Senin said in his
October 22 speech, in which he said he had some common ground with
the political platform of the two oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim and Hun Sen in their letter put forward three agendas
for the summit, including the principle of cooperation between the
CPP and FUNCINPEC, the establishment of the system of the National
Assembly and the political platform of the new Royal Government.
</P>
<P>
They also noted the common point of view between Hun Sen's
speech and the political platform put forward by FUNCINPEC and the
Sam Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
Opposition members including Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
left the country in September, saying they were wary about their
safety. They demanded that any summit be held outside the country.
</P>
<P>
The King told opposition leaders on November 7 that he would
provide security and protection within the palace if they return
for a summit meeting with the CPP.
</P>
<P>
As the monarch is due to leave Cambodia for medical treatment
in Beijing on November 14, no more time is left to organize such a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The CPP has insisted that any summit must be held in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pressure from the international community
increased. The Japanese government Tuesday urged the opposition
leaders, particularly Prince Ranariddh, to return to their country
as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Date-Based Beef Export Scheme Proposed for Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
proposed on Wednesday to the European Council of Ministers that
British beef can be exported again under a date-based export
scheme (DBES).
</P>
<P>
When approved by the council of ministers, Britain can expect
to resume exporting de-boned beef and meat products that are
obtained from cattle born after August 1, 1996, and are over six
months but under 30 months of age.
</P>
<P>
A date for the resumption of exports can be established after
the DBES wins approval from the council of ministers, and after the
DBES application and control have been verified.
</P>
<P>
The DBES includes strict rules on identification of cattle and
traceability of cattle and meat, as well as on the slaughter and
destruction of offsprings from mad cow disease-infected cattle.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has been endorsed by the scientific steering
committee under the European Commission, the executive body of the
15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
It was also approved by a majority of the member states in the
commission's standing veterinary committee.
</P>
<P>
The European council of agricultural ministers is expected to
deal with the DBES issue during its November 23-24 meeting in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
If the council neither adopts the commission proposal by a
qualified majority nor rejects it by a simple majority, the
commission can make a final decision on its own.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends More Firepower to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send
more warplanes to the Gulf to reinforce its firepower in case
President Bill Clinton orders a military strike against Iraq, a
senior Pentagon official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that the
additional forces, which could be ordered to the Gulf on
Wednesday, would include perhaps 50 attack and support jets as
well as several radar-avoiding F-117A stealth fighters.
</P>
<P>
"It could come as early as today," the official said of Defense
Secretary William Cohen's expected order for the move.
</P>
<P>
The United States currently has more than 170 warplanes and 20
Navy ships -- eight of the ships capable of firing long-range
Tomahawk cruise missiles -- poised in the Gulf region near Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon official would not say where the additional
warplanes would be based, although stealth fighters have been
previously based in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
As the standoff escalated with Iraq over Baghdad's refusal to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspections, Clinton's top military
strategist warned President Saddam Hussein that the United States
could strike without warning.
</P>
<P>
"From my perspective, I would say that Saddam Hussein has been
given adequate warning... We have seen very strong resolve on the
part of the United Nations," said Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
"They are telling him that he needs to honor his commitments
and I think that alone should serve as enough warning," Shelton
said on Wednesday in separate appearances on several U.S.
television networks.
</P>
<P>
"We have a substantial capability. However, as of today, no
decision has been made... all options remain on the table,"
Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
"As we have said in the past, the ball is in Saddam's court. He
is the one that made the commitments after he was defeated in the
Gulf War in 1991... and we expect him to honour his commitments"
Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was expected to address the crisis during a Veterans
Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery scheduled for 11:15 a.m.
EST (1615 GMT) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have repeatedly said that Clinton has not made a
final decision on whether force will be used against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Downtown Tax-Free Shops in Large Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China plans to open a number
of downtown tax-free shops in several major cities next
year, an official source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, are the top candidates for the planned shops,
according to Ge Zhixin, general manager of the China Tax-Free
Commodities Company.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the new shops represents China's latest
move into tax-free businesses, which has been developing for the
past ten years or so, Ge said.
</P>
<P>
Though Shanghai has four tax-free shops at the airport and some
other places with large concentrations of overseas people, this is
far from adequate for the rapidly growing number of overseas
people arriving in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Shanghai's international tourism
industry has been growing at an average annual rate of 10 percent
in recent years, with overseas tourists numbering 1.65 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
Downtown tax-free shops will provide greater convenience for
overseas people in Shanghai, Ge said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Shanghai's first downtown tax-free shop will
be located at a spot convenient to traffic in Puxi, the older part
of the metropolitan, and will sell mainly high-grade brand-name
commodities imported from Europe and the United States.

<HEADLINE> EC President Appeals for Clinton's Attention to Banana Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to personally attend to the
renewed banana dispute between his country and the European Union
(EU), a commission spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EC president, Jacques Santer, has written a letter to
Clinton drawing his attention to a serious difficulty in bilateral
trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The problem risks much wider economic and political
repercussions, Santer warned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. published a list on Tuesday of EU export products for
possible punitive tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The listed products, ranging from wine, toys, perfume,
ball-pens, bread and vacuum cleaners, are worth an estimated total
of 1.3 billion ECU (1.43 billion U.S. dollars), according to the
EC which is the executive body of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Santer described the U.S. unilateral action for trade sanction
as a "clear breach of the United States' World Trade Organization
commitments.
</P>
<P>
"No WTO member has the right unilaterally to determine whether
another member is in compliance with WTO rulings," Santer said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. publication of the list came as a shock only one day
after the EU foreign ministers endorsed a Transatlantic Economic
Partnership action plan to enhance bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the commission, and U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky discussed the banana
issue Friday.
</P>
<P>
Santer said in his letter that pursuing the unilateral action
is a grave political misjudgement at a time when the
U.S. and the EU "should be working together in shared leadership
to alleviate the world's economic difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The commission chief also said the union would be obliged to
react if the U.S. chose to continue its unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
Santer notified Clinton that the EU would raise the banana
dispute at the November 23 meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement
Body unless the U.S. decided to desist from the unilateral action
before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
After a WTO ruling against EU's banana import regime, the union
modified the regime in July this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. argued that the new regime is still not
compatible with the WTO regulations.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the U.S. are each other's single largest trading
partner in the world. In 1997, they traded goods worth 277
billion ECU (304.7 billion dollars), or one fifth of their total
world trade volume.

CHENGDU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- An Airbus A340 jumbo passenger
plane ordered by China Southwestern Airlines arrived at this
capital city of southwest China's Sichuan Province today.
</P>
<P>
The new aircraft, the first of three 370-seat A340s ordered by
the Chinese airline company, is the first large, long-distance
passenger airplane in western China.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the three airplanes was made possible by
syndicated loans provided by banks in France, Japan, Germany and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The new plane will fly the Chengdu-Lhasa air route on November
20, and the second A340 are expected to arrive in Chengdu at the
end of this month.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Humanitarian Program to Continue: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. humanitarian program
for Iraq will continue though some non-essential staff of the
U.N. Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq (UNOHCI) will
be "temporarily relocated," said a U.N. envoy Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prakash Shah, representative of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in Iraq, said at a press conference here that about 30
essential officials of the UNOHCI will stay in Iraq and
humanitarian program will continue.
</P>
<P>
Shah said he held a meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz Wednesday morning and informed him of the decision of
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) to withdraw all its personnel
and the temporary relocation of some of the non-essential UNOHCI
staff.
</P>
<P>
He said Aziz has told him that Iraq will not reverse its
October 31 decision to halt cooperation with UNSCOM, which has
overseen the destruction of all Iraq's biological and chemical
weapons and long-range missiles, unless the U.N. Security Council
takes some actions that lead to the lifting of trade sanctions
imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. exerted sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, sparking the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council maintains that the sanctions will not be
removed unless UNSCOM certifies that Baghdad has eradicated all
its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, at least 400 weapons inspectors and other
U.N. staff left Baghdad as the U.N. began withdrawing all its
"non-essential" personnel to prepare for a possible U.S. military
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have warned that force will be resorted to
try to force Iraq into obedience of U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese School Teachers on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 11 (Xinhua) -- As part of their open-ended
strike, about 500 Lebanese public high school teachers Wednesday
staged a sit-in in front of the Education Ministry to protest
against the salary scales bill newly approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The strike, beginning on Monday, followed a two-day warning
strike in October to protest the parliament's failure to recognize
the teachers' demands in the new salary bill, a source of High
School Teachers' Union said.
</P>
<P>
Public high school and primary school teachers demanded that
their end-of-service payments be based on 100 percent of their
final salaries in the new pay scale bill for the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The new bill, approved by the parliament last month, stipulates
however that end-of-service payments would only be based on 85
percent of the teachers' final salaries.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our strike until our demands are met," Fouad
Saab, chairman of the teachers union told the protesters who
consist of teachers, students and a number of parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of National Education, Youth and Sport Jean
Obeid told the angry teachers that he supported their demands but
called on them to move their sit-in protest to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Nabih Berri dismissed the protest as
"inappropriate" and called on protesters to stop it.
</P>
<P>
The strike halted classes for some 350,000 public school
students across the country, but those in 800 private schools are
not affected.

<HEADLINE> France Marks 80th Anniversary of World War I Armistice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- France on Wednesday marked the
80th anniversary of the World War I armistice under the shadow of
the Germany's refusal to attend a ceremony in commemoration of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, who was invited to join the
traditional ceremony in Paris this year, laid flowers with French
President Jacques Chirac at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
</P>
<P>
The queen and Chirac also laid flowers before a statue of
Georges Clemenceau, the French prime minister during the World War
I. They were also due to inaugurate a statue of former British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the Cours de la Reine by the
Seine River late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Six former "Poilu" soldiers, aged from 98 to 107, who fought
during the World War I, attended the ceremony under the Arch of
Triumph.
</P>
<P>
At the request of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, France
and Germany cancelled a plan to issue a joint communique on
November 8 during a planned ceremony at Vrigne-Meuse in the
northeastern province of Ardennes, where the last major battle of
the war was fought.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder turned down the invitation from Chirac to attend the
ceremony with the excuse of "timetable."
</P>
<P>
The French press, which widely commented on the event, said
that Schroeder preferred to ignore the anniversary rather than
reminding his German compatriots of the unfortunate days of the
war.
</P>
<P>
The anniversary was also preceded by a dispute between Chirac
and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin over a declaration by Jospin that
the reputation of 48 French mutinous soldiers executed in 1917 at
the order of Marshal Philippe Petain should be rehabilitated.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada is preparing a
multimillion-dollar package of humanitarian relief for Russia's
remote Arctic regions to help avert starvation, the Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian assistance will include food, clothing and
possibly medicine and fuel. One official was quoted by the
newspaper as saying that the aid will be worth about 2 million
Canadian dollars (1.3 million U.S. dollars) in the first phase of
what could became a larger program.
</P>
<P>
The assistance was discussed at a private dinner in Moscow
Tuesday night between Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy and his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Many people living in isolated towns and villages in the
Russian far north are facing the danger of malnutrition because
of the Russian economic crisis which has hampered the shipment of
supplies. Food and fuel shortages have left many northerners in a
desperate situation.
</P>
<P>
Russia's 200,000 aboriginal people, concentrated primarily in
the far north, are among the worst-hit by the crisis, said the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Shilling Remains Strong Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) - The Kenya Shilling remained
unchanged against the U.S. Dollar in thin trade Wednesday,
commercial dealers said here.
</P>
<P>
Four leading commercial banks posted the Shilling at buying
rate of 59.55 and 59.65 selling to the Dollar, same as the
Tuesday's closing rates. Two banks quoted the Shilling at
59.50/62 to the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen inflows from the coffee and tea sector as it
is normally the case on Monday and Tuesday," one dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said some players in the two sectors were holding
Dollars, limiting the supply side.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these companies in the tea and coffee sector are
multi-nationals now preparing to pay their international
share-holders dividends in Dollars," said Philip Wambua, head of
foreign exchange at the Treasury Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Dealers' sentiment was shifting toward a weaker Shilling. One

<HEADLINE> Air Pollution in Beijing Still Not Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of
Beijing, the largest coal-user among the world capitals, does not
have air pollution under effective control, said Qu Geping,
China's most authoritative environmental expert, here today.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has suffered from moderate air pollution for five
consecutive weeks, according to air-quality reports issued by the
China Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
Qu, chairman of the Environmental and Resources Protection
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), told a
forum on environmental protection here that Beijing uses about 28
million tons of coal annually, which produces a huge amount of
smoke and dust.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has taken a series of measures to
control smoke pollution, but these measures have not begun to
catch up with the rapid increase of coal consumption, Qu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that another major pollutant comes from the dust blown
up from Beijing's 6,000 construction sites, Qu said that bad
management is a major factor contributing to construction-site
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is now focusing on motor-vehicle exhaust pollution
control, Qu said, adding that the number of motor vehicles in the
municipality is increasing by 15 percent annually, and has reached
over 1.27 million, one third of which are private cars.
</P>
<P>
Cars are a great convenience for people, and the government
cannot prevent them from buying cars, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the central government has issued a regulation requiring
all motor vehicles to use unleaded gasoline by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government has also required car
manufacturers to install exhaust purifiers on cars by the year
2000, and it will prohibit the sale of new cars in Beijing which
do not meet exhaust standards.
</P>
<P>
Because of this serious air pollution, China is resolved to
carry out the regulations in spite of possible great economic
losses, Qu said.
</P>
<P>
Many developed countries spent dozens of years on unleaded
gasoline projects, and it will be still difficult for China to
complete its project in only two or three years, according to Qu
Geping.

</P>

Gazette newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economic advisor to governor Diaa Eddin Omran said the
total capital of the enterprises stands at 860 million Egyptian
pounds (253 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
One project is an electrical appliances factory with a capital
of 260 million pounds (76 million dollars). It is expected to
produce an annual 180 million pounds (53 million dollars) worth of
products after its operation in five years.
</P>
<P>
A second is a car factory with a capital of 420 million pounds
(124 million dollars). It is located at an industrial zone on the
road linking Belbeis, a town 50 kilometers north of Cairo, with
the capital.
</P>
<P>
The third is an iron factory, which is designed to produce an
annual 100,000 tonnes of iron in the initial stage and increase
the production to 400,000 tonnes of iron within five years.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian General Authority of Investment and Free

</P>
<P>
He said under the agreement, the two countries will cooperate,

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Secretary General of the Arab League Economic Union

<HEADLINE> UK Government Rejects Cannabis for Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Reuters) -- The British government on
Wednesday rejected a call from a House of Lords committee to make
cannabis available on prescription.
</P>
<P>
Home Office Minister George Howarth said more clinical trials
are needed before a change in the drug laws could be considered.
</P>
<P>
"Until we get a product that's gone through all of the same
testing regimes as any other drug, it would be irresponsible," he
told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Patients groups, politicians and even anti-drug campaigners
welcomed a report released by the House of Lords' Science and
Technology Committee that recommends licensing the drug to help
alleviate the pain caused by conditions such as multiple sclerosis
(MS) and cancer.
</P>
<P>
But the British Medical Association, which represents the
medical practitioners, describes the move as "misguided."
</P>
<P>
The Lords' committee chairman, Lord Perry, said, "There is
sufficient evidence of benefit to many patients to make it
unjustifiable and inhumane to make them wait.
</P>
<P>
"We remain fully supportive of the view that the recreational
use of cannabis should remain illegal.
</P>
<P>
"But the fact is that heroin, morphine and cocaine are all
licensed drugs and that doesn't increase their misuse at all."
</P>
<P>
The committee estimated that about 1 percent of MS patients
use cannabis for pain relief, effectively making themselves
criminals under current law.
</P>
<P>
British doctors were allowed to prescribe cannabis until
1973. It was then removed from a list of prescription drugs which
still includes heroin and morphine.

Another concern was that draws also have to be planned well in

Officials have shrugged off fears that Asia's financial crisis
would overshadow the event. But already, some of the 41 competing
nations have been forced to scale down their teams, blaming

<HEADLINE> Indian Industrial Growth Declines in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial growth
rates went down to 1.4 percent in September, thus bringing the
overall industrial growth in the first six months of the current
fiscal year beginning from April 1 to 3.6 percent from 6 percent
during the same period last year, according to figures released by
the Indian government here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The overall growth rate of 1.4 percent in September 1998 was
far below the 8.5 percent recorded in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
All three major sub-sectors in the Index of Industrial
Production (IIP) -- manufacturing, mining and electricity --
showed sharp decline in September as compared to that of the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing grew by only 2 percent compared to 4.2 percent in
August and 8.7 percent reached in the fiscal year 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Electricity grew by 2.6 percent as against 6.8 percent recorded
in the previous month and 9.3 percent in September 1997 while
mining recorded a negative 4.9 percent compared to 0.6 percent in
August and 5.2 percent a year earlier, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Poor performance in September had further pulled down
cumulative growth figures with the manufacturing sector growth
declining to 3.4 percent from 6 percent a year ago and mining
sector posting negative growth of 0.4 percent in the first half
compared to 5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
However, growth of electricity showed a small improvement over
last year at 7.7 percent compared to 7.2 percent during the
April-September period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Both consumer durables and non-durables posted negative growth
rates of 2.5 and 5.2 percent in September compared to 9.8 and 12.2
percent reached respectively last September.
</P>
<P>
Basic goods also had a negative growth of 1.4 percent in
September resulting in half-yearly growth of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
There was some improvement in growth rates of capital goods and
intermediate goods in September at 8.5 and 8.2 percent
respectively compared to 7.2 and 7.1 percent in August.

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration Tuesday took its first
substantial steps to reinforce striking power in range of Iraq,
speeding deployment of a second aircraft carrier and a Marine
amphibious group as Defense Secretary William S. Cohen warned that
U.S. credibility is on the line and the "time is running out" for
Iraq to avert a military assault.
</P>
<P>

play out.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's MPR Factions Respond Seriously to Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Public calls for a thorough
investigation of state officials allegedly involved in corruption,
collusion and nepotism (KKN) received serious response from
factions of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of general views on the draft
decree during the second day of the MPR's special session,
spokesman for the ruling Functional Group faction Marwah Daud
Ibrahim said the more officials involved in such illegal
practices, the greater the impact on the legitimacy of the
government.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to uphold the law must be stepped up, and those
allegedly involved in KKN-tainted practices must be dealt with,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The faction, he said, is also urging the judicial apparatus to
be probative in investigating former and present government
officials, including former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the need to uphold the presumption of innocence
and the principles of human rights in probing these officials.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that one of the demands for reform is the
creation of good governance free from corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian nation, he said, is suffering from a crisis of
confidence originating from its economic and political crisis, the
result of poor control of administrative tasks due to the
concentration of power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman for the United Development Party (PPP)
faction Aisyah Amini said since Soeharto was formerly Indonesia's
number one person, he must be the first person to be subjected to
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
She emphasized the need for the special MPR session to
stipulate a decree authorizing the government to look into
Soeharto's hidden wealth.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the property of Soeharto and his family has
reached about 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing MPR special session, which opened on Tuesday, will
decide the timetable for the forthcoming general election in 1999
and approve some important decrees.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Confirms Reinforcing Troops in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Namibia Wednesday
confirmed that it was reinforcing its troops in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) ahead of an expected offensive in the
east of the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Namibian troops and equipment were being deployed in the east
of Congo (K), South African Press Association quoted Namibian
Defense Ministry spokesman Vincent Mwange as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mwange confirmed that the troops now being sent to Congo would
operate in the combat zone and would not be restricted to
logistical roles.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to comment on a weekend news report that the
number of troops was being increased to 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the decision to deploy more Namibian troops
was taken after Congolese President Laurent Kabila's allies
agreed in Zimbabwean capital Harare on October 28 to launch a new
offensive against the Tutsi-led rebels in east Congo.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola sent troops to Congo in August to
prop up the embattled troops loyal to Kabila. Congo claimed that
Rwanda and Uganda were backing the rebels in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite several regional peace initiatives to bring the
warring parties to the negotiation table in the past three
months, no solution is in sight to end the war in the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Namibian troops and arms arrived on cargo
planes in Kananga in Congo's Western Kasai Province over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Namibia has so far confirmed two deaths among its soldiers in
Congo (K).

<HEADLINE> China Lodges Protest Against U.S. Government for Erroneous Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China lodged a protest today
against the U.S. government for sending Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson to visit Taiwan recently and allowing the Dalai lama to
visit the United States and meet with U.S. leaders.
</P>
<P>
In a statement here today, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said that a few days ago, the U.S. government, in
disregard of the strong opposition and repeated representations of
the Chinese side, sent Richardson to visit Taiwan, and during the
visit, Richardson met with Lee Teng-hui and other senior political
figures of the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the U.S. side has allowed the Dalai lama to
visit the United States and made arrangements for him to meet with
President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government expressed its serious concern and
strong displeasure over these erroneous moves on the part of the
U.S. side and made a protest against the U.S. government," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese side has all along opposed any
official contact between the U.S. side and Taiwan, especially any
visit to Taiwan by cabinet-level officials of the U.S. side. "We
have demanded that the U.S. side confine its relations with Taiwan
strictly to those of a non-governmental nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sending of its Energy Secretary Richardson by the U.S. side
to Taiwan and his meetings with Lee Teng-hui and other senior
political figures of the Taiwan authorities constituted a serious
violation of the principles of the three Sino-U.S. Joint
Communiques and the U.S. commitments of not having any official
contact with Taiwan, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Dalai lama is a political exile engaged in
splittist activities against China and a long-time advocate of
"Tibetan Independence". "He is still trying to conduct
propaganda, shape international public opinion and cover up his
deceptive tricks and ulterior motives by cashing in on contacts
and negotiations with the Chinese Central Government," Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that by allowing the Dalai lama to visit the
United States and arranging his meetings with President Clinton and
other U.S. leaders and government officials in particular, the
U.S. side has seriously violated its repeatedly stated position of
recognizing Tibet as part of Chinese territory and not supporting
"Tibetan Independence".
</P>
<P>
"What the U.S. side has done is in total contravention of the
basic principles governing international relations such as
non-interference in other countries' internal affairs and mutual
respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and has seriously hurt the Chinese people's feelings," Zhu pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"Such acts on the part of the U.S. side are what we are
strongly opposed to and are absolutely unacceptable to us," he
continued. "The Chinese government demands that the
U.S. government strictly abide by the principles of the three
Joint Communiques and basic principles of the international
relations, honor its commitments in good faith, immediately
correct its mistakes and maintain the improvement and development
of Sino-U.S. relations with concrete actions."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Presidential Palace Says No Pork in '99 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Presidential Palace of the
Philippines said the proposed budget for 1999 contains no pork
barrel fund, a government appropriation for local improvements
designed to ingratiate legislators with their constituents, the
Philippines News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted the presidential spokesman Jerry Barican as
dismissing as "baseless" the allegations made by some congressmen
that the president has the biggest share of this supposed pork
barrel.
</P>
<P>
Barican said some lawmakers had mistaken the president's
priority projects to help the poor, such as building school
houses, roads and other vital infrastructure, as a form of pork
barrel.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives of the Philippines last month
passed virtually intact the 579.5-billion-peso (14.5 billion U.S.
dollars) budget proposed by the Presidential Palace.

<HEADLINE> 98'China Anti-Forgery Technology Exhibition Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The four-day 98' China
Anti-Forgery Technology Exhibition opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 technological research institutions and enterprises
from home and abroad are attending the exhibition, which is being
held jointly by the Ministry of Public Security and the
Anti-Forgery Technology Association of China.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech products on display, including anti-forgery
signets, watermarks, trademarks and technology applied in the
production of various cards and certificates, all reflect the
present state of such technology development in China.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of enterprises and research institutions will also
present lectures introducing their anti-forgery technology and
products during the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Many of these products are beautiful in design, and the use of
techniques such as signatures, microphotos and fingerprints in the
products make them extremely difficult to copy.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Ministry of Public Security pointed to two
reasons for the serious forgery problem in China: most enterprises
and consumers have not become aware of the importance of
anti-forgery technology, and the government's management system
has yet to be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that local governments have cracked 4,527 cases
of forgery, uncovered 625 factories producing fake products,
levied fines or confiscated illicit income in the amount of 9.7
million yuan (1.17 million U.S. dollars), and burned 90 million
yuan (10.7 million U.S. dollars) worth of fake products, in just
the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Ruling Golkar Agrees to Gradually Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling Golkar
(Functional Group) faction in the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR) agreed to limit the role of the Armed Forces (ABRI)
gradually and systematically as of 1999.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Golkar faction's spokesperson Marwah Daud
Ibrahim while making the statement during a general review on
various draft decrees at the Assembly's 1998 special session here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The faction holds that, gauging people's current aspirations,
discussion about ABRI's representation in the legislative
assemblies is urgent and needs to be carried out openly in the
special session.
</P>
<P>
Based on a comprehensive study and understanding on aspirations
of Indonesia's pluralistic people, the Golkar faction believes
that the limitation of ABRI's social and political role is closely
related with the development and empowerment of a civil society.
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the Golkar faction said, ABRI's presence in
legislative assemblies will only be retained in the MPR, and the
special session needs to emphasize that ABRI's representation in
the House of Representatives (DPR) is temporary.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces' sociopolitical role stems from the "dual
function" doctrine, accorded legitimacy during the heyday of the
New Order regime of former president Soeharto. Under this
doctrine, ABRI was recognized not only as a defense and security
force, but also as a sociopolitical one.
</P>
<P>
With Soeharto stepped down on May 21, Indonesian newspapers
said, the country is now striving to dismantle the repressive
political system that the autocratic ruler built. This includes
calls to review ABRI's political role, seen by critics as part and
parcel of the New Order regime.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to restore its tarnished image, ABRI has agreed
to scale down its sociopolitical role. On Monday, ABRI Commander
Gen. Wiranto announced that he was scrapping the strategic
sociopolitical chief post in ABRI headquarters, and would require
all ABRI personnel to retire from the service if they wished to
serve in non-military posts.
</P>
<P>
ABRI has also agreed to reduce the number of its 75
representatives in the 500-member DPR, but has left it to the DPR,
which is deliberating the new political bills, to determine the
precise number.
</P>
<P>
Chief of ABRI faction in the MPR Lt. Gen. Soesilo Bambang
Yudhoyono said that the military is now prepared to see a gradual
elimination of its presence in the DPR.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Wednesday reiterated Moscow's opposition to the use of
force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told reporters after his meeting with visiting Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy that force would not resolve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it "would wipe out the immense work done by the
international community over the past seven years and complicate
the situation in the region," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ivanov urged Baghdad to reconsider its "decision to
stop cooperating with the United Nations special commission for
the disarmament of Iraq and resume full cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the U.N. announced that it would withdraw
its non-essential personnel from Iraq to neighboring Jordan amid
rising concern of possible U.S. air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive revision of Iraq's disarmament files should be
carried out to determine which of them can be considered closed
and which should be considered open," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"This should pave the way for ending the sanctions against
Iraq," he added, noting Russia would continue working with other
countries, Baghdad and U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan in
finding a way out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said it will not cooperate with U.N. inspectors until
the U.N. Security Council begins to lift an embargo imposed after
Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990. The Security Council
maintains the embargo won't be lifted until U.N. inspectors
certify that Iraq has surrendered its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, rejected a proposal by the Liberal Democratic
Party of Russia (LDPR) on Wednesday that Russia stop observing the
international economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The proposal garnered only 126 votes, shorter than the 226
needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
The LDPR parliamentary group, led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky who
visited Baghdad last month, proposed that the Duma express concern
over the long duration of the sanctions and rule out their
extension.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq no longer represents a threat to international security
or the security of neighboring countries," said the draft
resolution prepared by the LDPR.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Resumes Peace Accord Deliberation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet resumed
its deliberations on the Wye peace accord Wednesday afternoon and
will probably vote on it later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet halted discussion of the accord last Friday after a
bomb attack in Jerusalem. Ministers said they would not reconvene
until they were satisfied that the Palestinians would wage all-out
war on anti-Israel militants.
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord, known as the Wye River Memorandum, provides
for the phased handover of 13 percent more of the West Bank to the
Palestinians over 12 weeks, matched by specific Palestinian steps
against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and other officials have
expressed frustration at Israeli delays in endorsing the accord,
signed at the White House last month by Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's legal counsel Yitzhak Molcho went to Ramallah
Wednesday morning to inform Arafat about Israeli cabinet's
scheduled meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton phoned Netanyahu Tuesday evening
and urged him to go ahead with ratification of the accord.
</P>
<P>
If the accord was approved by the cabinet, it would be sent to
the Knesset (parliament) for approval probably on Thursday or next
Monday, according to a senior Israeli government official.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five Israelis were injured and the two assailants were
killed in last Friday's car bombing near Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda
market. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (holy war fighters) claimed
responsibility for the attack.

<HEADLINE> Exporters to Sterilize Packaging for U.S.-Bound Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Local exporters have been
ordered to obtain quarantine certificates for goods exported to
the United States, which has stepped up efforts to prevent the
entry of the Asian long-horned beetle.
</P>
<P>
The order was made in response to a decree issued on September
11 by the American secretary of agriculture who asked for
certificates on packaging for commodities imported from China, in
a bid to curb the spread of the pest which is said to be a greedy
eater of trees.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree issued by the related Chinese governmental
departments, local exporters now must obtain certificates from
quarantine departments to prove that the wooden packaging for their
U.S.-bound goods have been fumigated or treated with antiseptics.
</P>
<P>
For U.S.-bound items shipped in packing material other than wood,
exporters must produce certificates on their own.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-bound exports which fail to meet these requirements will
be refused entry, or will have their wooden packages destroyed,
with the consent of the U.S. side, the orders say.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth flow of exports into the U.S., Chinese
authorities have urged local exporters to use packing materials
other than wood, and for goods that must be shipped in wood
packages, exporters must sterilize the packages and obtain the
certificates.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also have encouraged local exporters to use cheaper
and better packing materials, the orders say.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Expects to Attract 42 Billion Dollars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is expected to see a
inflow of 42 billion U.S. dollars in foreign capital in 1999 due
to a current account surplus and increased foreign investment, the
Bank of Korea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its report on the supply and demand of foreign exchange in
1999, the central bank said South Korea will receive enough
foreign currency to pay off 36 billion dollars of maturing
foreign debts and increase its foreign exchange reserves next year.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted that South Korea would register a surplus of
18 billion dollars in current accounts in the coming year by
reducing imports and falling international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Direct and indirect foreign investments are forecast to reach
15 billion dollars due to the nation's ongoing corporate and
financial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's long-term borrowing by banks will reach five
billion dollars next year, while loans from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations are expected to
hit four billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overseas obligations maturing next year will amount to 31
billion dollars, excluding five billion raised abroad by overseas
branches of South Korean companies, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The 31 billion dollars in liabilities include 17 billion
borrowed by financial institutions, four billion by private
enterprises, and 10 billion by the public sector.
</P>
<P>
"We won't have any trouble repaying foreign debts next
year. When corporate restructuring wraps up and our credit ratings
are upgraded, foreign investment is likely to increase further,"
said a spokesman of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will also be relieved of its borrowing rate burden
next year if the United States and other advanced countries cut
interest rates again, added the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> China Hands Over Water Facility to Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MBABANE, Swaziland, November 11 (Xinhua) -- An urban water
supply project was formally handed over to Swaziland Tuesday
afternoon by a Chinese engineering company.
</P>
<P>
The project, carried out by China Wanbao Engineering
Corporation, was part of a 50-million-U.S.-Dollar urban
development package funded by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The project, which pumps about 230 cubic meters of water per
hour to an altitude of 210 meters, will benefit 2,500 people. But
the fact that it has a reservoir of 3,200 cubic meters means that
there could be far more beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
It consists of a sole powerful pump station and an
11-kilometer pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The two-million-U.S.-Dollar project starts from downtown
Mbabane and ends upon a nearby mountain which is to be developed.
</P>
<P>
Head of the technical support unit of the project, John
Lowsby, said that more development projects would follow up and
the water supply project was expected to have its first
beneficiaries by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Swazi Prince Masitsela and Wanbao President Wang Xiao attended
a brief hand-over ceremony at the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The project is the first won by Wanbao in an African country
with which China has no formal ties.

<HEADLINE> HK Launches Training Center for Sports Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Asia's first-ever
commercial institute for the training of sports marketing and
entertainment management was launched here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the region's latest innovation in the high-profile field of
sports and entertainment, the Center for Sports Marketing &AMP;
Entertainment Management is designed to enhance the
professionalism of the event management/marketing industry, said
the center's chairman Steven Feuerstein.
</P>
<P>
It offers a highly specialized 12-week curriculum, addressing
subjects such as the sponsor's psychology, broadcasting and
advertising, public relations, negotiation and deal making, event
operations and logistics, client servicing promotional campaigns
and joint marketing ventures, he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The center's target markets include mid-level managers, first
and second-time job seekers who are in need of vocational
expertise, artists and athletes, and government employees, said
Feuerstein, a ten-year veteran of the industry and president of
Hong Kong-based Sports International Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"The training needed to work professionally within all sectors
of our industry is simply not available in Hong Kong or anywhere
else in Asia. Whether you're a brand manager, event planner,
promoter, ad agency or public relations executive, the necessary
management skills are traditionally only learned on the job. And
that is exactly what the center is going to change," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sports marketing and entertainment management is a
multi-billion dollars business, with over 17 billion U.S. dollars
being invested on event sponsorship alone each year, according to
Feuerstein.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the press conference was Andrew Ma, the chief
executive of the Sports Development Board. He said that the
center is exactly what the market needs and will clearly play a
major role in the further upgrading of the quality of the
industry in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The first series of the program started on October 19 and will
run through December 14, with participants meeting once a week
for a two-and-a-half-hour seminar held at the Sports Development
Board's Sports House.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Closing of Coal Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Shutting down coal mines that
are operating illegally or have been planned irrationally is
another major step in the current reform to pull China's coal
industry out of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo made this remark today at a national
conference on closing down coal mines and reducing coal output.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted the policy of reform and opening-up in the
late 1970s, the country has experienced a rapid increase in the
number of the coal mines, especially smaller ones, according to
Wu, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the normal operation of the industry has been
plagued with problems such as redundancy and the over-opening of
coal mines, illegal mining, environmental pollution, and excessive
production.
</P>
<P>
The central government has adopted three measures to offset the
negative impacts of the rampant coal industry, including handing
over all 94 state-run coal mines, which were under the former
Ministry of Coal Industry, to provincial governments, closing some
mines to reduce output, and dispatching special inspectors to the
mines, according to the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, 25,800 small coal mines will be shut down
to bring down the national annual output by some 250 million
tons. Mines to be shut down are those which have been operating
without official approval, those operating on the sites of
state-owned mines, and those which have obtained official
certificates but are now regarded as irrationally planned.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged carrying out the program strictly in accordance with
the relevant state laws. While this program is being implemented,
he noted, no new coal mines will be allowed to open, and those
which have obtained illegal permission and are shut down will
receive certain compensations.
</P>
<P>
This program will be carried out in combination with a
prohibition on illegally mined coal entering the market, Wu said.

HANGZHOU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Zou Jiahua, Vice-Chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has
called for a correct handling of the relationship between economic
development and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Zou made this call during an inspection tour of environmental
protection projects in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province,
from November 9 to 11. He also urged the use of more high-
technology for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental protection is a basic Chinese national policy,
and the relationship between resources and the environment should
be perceived from a strategic height," Zou said, after visiting
the Hangzhou Sibao Sewage Treatment Plant and several other
environmental protection projects in Hangzhou, an important
industrial and tourist city on China's east coast.
</P>
<P>
"We should rationally develop and comprehensively utilize
resources and protect and improve the environment to make good the
strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education,
and the strategy of sustained growth," Zou said.
</P>
<P>
On hearing that Hangzhou leads other Chinese cities in the use
of methane generated by rubbish dumps for power generation, Zou
said that much can be done in environmental protection when high-
technology is employed.
</P>
<P>
Zou also said that both legislative and law enforcement efforts
should be increased to curb pollution in the Beijing-Hangzhou
Grand Canal.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Zhejiang, Zou also visited the Qinshan
Nuclear Power Station. He said efforts must be made for
environmental protection in the process of the peaceful use of
nuclear energy.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Probing 300 Namibian Secessionists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Botswanan government
is investigating more than 300 Namibian secessionists who crossed
into Botswana in the past weeks seeking asylum, South African
state television reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite Namibia's request for immediate extradition of these
people, the Botswanan government said Wednesday that they would
assess each individual's status before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances of each member of the group have to be
individually assessed, and this will take some time," Botswanan
presidential spokesman Andrew Sesinyi said, adding that none of
them has been granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
"They are asking for protection against forcible return to
Namibia, where they claim their lives and freedom would be in
jeopardy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Namibians, who illegally entered Botswana in several
groups, were believed to be from a group planning the secession
of the Caprivi strip in northeastern Namibia. They reportedly
fled their country after their planned armed secession was
unearthed recently.
</P>
<P>
"We are working amicably with the Namibians over the issue. We
have no sympathy for anyone who wishes to harm or negatively
affect the Namibian government," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sesinyi said the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) had advised them not to sent these people back,
as they might face persecution upon return.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Namibians in Botswana has complicated the
already difficult relations between the two neighbors. The two
countries' dispute over the islands in the border river
Linyanti-Chobe is currently in front of the International High
Court for Justice.
</P>
<P>
Among the border jumpers are former Namibian opposition leader
Meshake Muyongo, a regional governor of Caprivi; Johnnie Mabuku,
a member of the Namibian House of Review; and national councilor
Francis Sizimbo.
</P>
<P>
About 100 border jumpers have already appeared before
Botswanan court, on charges of illegally entering the country and
being in possession of weapons of war, including AK-47 rifles,
mortars, bombs and anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma has called on Botswana to
extradite the "terrorist bandits" so they could be charged with
treason.
</P>
<P>
The Caprivi strip in Namibia's northeast covers an area of
about 20,000 square kilometers and has a population of close to
110,000.

OSAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Cuba beat Brazil 3-1 while
China crushed Russia 3-0 in the women's semifinals here on
Wednesday to set up a rematch of the Atlanta Olympic Games final
at the World Volleyball Championships.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's 15-10, 4-15, 15-11 and 15-10 victory over the South
Americans repeated their triumphs in the 1994 world championship
final and in the semifinal at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
China, world champions in 1982 and 1986, needed only 80
minutes to sweep past the Russians 15-4, 15-4, 15-9 and won the
chance to avenge their loss to the Cubans in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Before the match, the Russian team had a perfect winning
record through the group competitions and second-phase
competitions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which booked their semi-final berth thanks
to Bulgaria's surprise victory over South Korea, played their
best match in recent years.
</P>
<P>
They dominated the match throughout with their tight blocking,
powerful smashing and effective team combination.
</P>
<P>
The Russian team, to the contrary, suddenly found they lost
their winning touch in the group competitions and committed lots
of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first two sets with an identical score of
15-4, the Russian team again lagged 12-3 behind. They fought
desperately and narrowed the gap to 12-9 but their Chinese rivals
again pulled away to wrap up the match 15-9.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team will play Cuba in the final on Thursday.

KAMPALA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has been named among
the first eight African countries that benefit from foreign
direct investment (FDI).
</P>
<P>
According to a World Investment Report Launched Wednesday,
Uganda's FDI inflow from 1992 to 1997 were above the developing
countries' average, Uganda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The FDI inflow in Uganda has mainly concentrated in the
primary sector of agro-processing, mining, tourism and
manufacturing. It increased from 121 million U.S. Dollars in 1996
to 250 million Dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report was reportedly launched by the Minister of State
for Finance Sam Kuteesa who attributed the country's superior
performance to a stable macro-economic policy framework.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the Uganda Investment Authority to maintain
the trend of FDI flow to expand on the number of policies that
investors view as constituting a good investment climate.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staff in Baghdad Pull out of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- All U.N. staff except core
officials are leaving Iraq Wednesday amid the current
Iraq-U.N. standoff, said a U.N. spokesman Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in
Iraq, told reporters that they had received instructions from the
U.N. headquarters in New York asking them to leave for Amman,
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the uncertainty surrounding the current situation
and following instructions from U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate non-essential U.N. staff
to Amman, Jordan," said Falt.
</P>
<P>
He said that "this instruction applies to all U.N. staff
residents in Baghdad, and the measure is of precautionary nature
and is being instituted solely with the safety of U.N. staff in
mind."
</P>
<P>
Falt noted that a number of core (U.N.) officials will remain
in Baghdad including the Humanitarian Coordinator and designated
security official for Iraq Hans von Sponik who has informed the
Iraqi Foreign Ministry this morning of the movement which will
take place.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of 11 vehicles carrying U.N. personnel left the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) headquarters in Baghdad early
Wednesday, heading for the airport.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) for disarming Iraq
withdrew 20 of its about 120 inspectors last Saturday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some observers here speculated that the pull-out of all
U.N. staff clearly suggests the possibility of a U.S. military
strike against Iraq to force it to back down from its October 31
decision regarding stopping cooperation with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to halt all forms of cooperation with the UNSCOM
until the Security Council moves toward lifting the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last Thursday
which condemned the Iraqi non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
However it seemed that Iraq softened its stance when Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf on Monday expressed hope
that the current standoff over weapons inspections would be
solved peacefully.

<P>
The superpower's interest in an accelerated liberalization
process was very obvious, particularly from its role in the
establishment of the Free Trade Areas for America which groups 34
countries in the American continent, from Canada to Argentina, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian media had not been sufficiently reporting on these
developments, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kuntjorojakti said the U.S. would use the APEC Economic Leaders
Meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia this month as a
springboard to take advantage of the first post-Cold War decade to
accelerate liberalization of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
This must be watched by the Indonesian delegations to (the APEC
meeting) and the APEC Business Advisory Council to be attended by
about 1,500 business representatives from all APEC members, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that current economic conditions were posing no
problem to the U.S. to achieve its goal, he added.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- France will memorize on Wednesday the 80th anniversary of
the end of the World War I, during which 870 French soldiers were
killed and 2,300 injured each day. The echo of this massacre is
still heard 80 years later, as France is still disputing whether
the day should be the celebration of patriotism or the souvenir of
a great butchery.
</P>
<P>
-- Germany will not mark the 80th anniversary of end of World
War I. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has turned down an
invitation by President Jacques Chirac to commemorate the dead of
the World War I, because he prefers looking forward to letting
Germany locked up in the role of the defeated and the eternal
guilty, said an expert on Germany.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Queen Elizabeth II of Britain will join President Jacques
Chirac on Wednesday morning in paying homage to the tomb of
Unknown Soldier under the Arch of Triumph on the Champs Elysee on
the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War I, in which
1,383,000 Frenchmen and 1,822,000 Germans were killed, not to
account others who died.
</P>
<P>
-- Over the past 12 months, inflation rate in France stood at
0.4-0.5 percent, which was the lowest in Europe. The lowering of
the prices are due to the dropping costs of food and oil.

<HEADLINE> Fewer New Firms Set Up in Macao in First 9 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 379 companies were
established here in the first nine months of the year, a decline
of 31 percent from the same period of 1997, latest official
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The capital of the new companies added up to 109.3 million
patacas (13.66 million U.S. dollars), a decrease of 8.9 percent
compared with that of the same period last year, according to
figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of the year, 128 companies were set up, a
drop of 25.1 percent from the same season of 1997 but an increase
of 4.9 percent over the second season of this year.
</P>
<P>
The new companies are engaged mainly in wholesale and retail,
catering services, maintenance of vehicles, motorcycles and
personal and domestic goods. Other businesses cover fields of
construction, education, medical care and social services.
</P>
<P>
Between July and September of the year, 13 companies were
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the number of new firms was believed to be the
result of a continuous slowdown of the economic growth in Macao as
well as in its surrounding areas.

MACAO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Passenger arrivals to Macao by
means of marine, land and air routes reached 517,391 in September
this year, up four percent over the same month of 1997, according
to figures issued Wednesday by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department.
</P>

Between January and September, passengers from the Chinese
mainland and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region

an increase of 7.5 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, passengers from the Republic of Korea, Japan,
Southeast Asia and South Asia plunged to a great extent. The
decline is believed to be a result of the lasting financial crisis
 in these areas.

<HEADLINE> IPR System Faces Impact of Digital Technology (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide information
technology revolution has endangered the existing intellectual
property rights system which traditionally protected print and
audio-visual publications, trademarks and inventions.
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of various types of digital forms and the large
number computers connected to network and the Internet have
sparked a series of new copyright issues and had a strong impact
on the existing copyright protection system," according to Ying
Ming, a senior researcher with China's Ministry of Information
Industry.
</P>
<P>
"While digital technology has had a profound impact on the
current copyright system it is nonetheless unnecessary to abandon
the existing system," said Ying, an adviser with the ministry's
Computer and Microelectronics Industry Research and Development
Center."
</P>
<P>
"However, It might be necessary to introduce new concepts or
alter existing approaches in order to improve the current
copyright system," said Ying.
</P>
<P>
The existing Law on Copyrights focuses on various forms of
characters, figures, visual images and sound. A highly
sophisticated copyright protection system for related works has
been developed in many countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
However, broad applications of computer software have had a
strong impact on the existing copyright system and have sparked an
international debate in the field for the past 20-odd years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, high technology such as information
digitalization, multimedia and computer networking have greatly
altered our daily lives during the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Institute: S.Korean Economy to Grow in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean economy will bottom
out in the second quarter of next year and see an annual growth of 2.3
percent, the Korea Institute of Finance (KIF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The KIF, composed of a group of South Korean bankers, predicted
that the consumer price index will be lowered to 4.8 percent next year
from 7.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The institute also predicted that consumption will stop contracting
and investment in construction will increase next year.
</P>
<P>
"The economic recovery will be propelled by expanding domestic
demand following successful structural reform," it said.
</P>
<P>
Consumption will edge up slightly by 0.6 percent in 1999, a
turnaround from the projected shrinkage this year, and investment in
construction will rise by 2.7 percent, but facility investment will
shrink 1.0 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
As the economy will pick up steam, the facility investment will
increase by 4.1 percent in the third quarter of next year and 5.8
percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the nation will register a current account surplus
of 29.02 billion U.S. dollars next year, 26.3 percent down from
this year's estimated 39.4 billion dollars, as a result of the
decline in exports, it said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean exports are expected to drop 6.2 percent to
124.35 billion dollars next year as the markets in Asia and
other parts of the world will continue shrinking amid the global
economic slump, it added.

SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China plans to open duty-free
stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou during 1999, according
to Gai Zhixin, general manager of the China National Duty-Free
Merchandise Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The move represents yet another major reform measure. The
Chinese government introduced duty-free stores at ports of entry
over a decade ago, said Gai.
</P>
<P>
The new stores will help meet the growing needs of foreign
visitors and diplomatic personnel living in the cities, according
to Gai.

<P>
Shanghai, China's leading commercial and financial center, has
witnessed an annual 10 percent rise in the number of foreign
tourists in recent years, with the city hosting over 1.65 million
arrivals during 1997. However, the city's four duty-free stores
fell far short of increasing demand.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's first new duty-free store, which will be located in
the city proper, will offer high quality brand name products
imported from the United States and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Survey: 22% of S. African Voters "Unable" to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- About 22 percent of
South Africa's voters do not have the right identity documents
which are required for voter registration for next year's general
election, a survey has found.
</P>
<P>
About 5.6 million eligible South African voters do not have
the necessary bar-coded identity books, more than double the
figure estimated by the Home Affairs Department, according to the
survey by Markinor, a major independent research institute in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The result of the extensive survey, conducted in September,
means the Home Affairs Department would not be able to complete
processing all the documents before registration, The Citizen
paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Only 78 percent of about 25.6 million eligible voters had the
proper identity books to vote in the second democratic election
in five or six months' time, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
Significantly more black South Africans (82 percent) had the
correct identity documents than Indian (71 percent), colored (67
percent) or white (65 percent) people, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
This was because black people had had the most reason to get
the new, updated identity documents in the past four years to
replace their obsolete apartheid-era documents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found more supporters of the ruling African
National Congress (ANC) and black-based opposition parties had
the correct documents than those of white-based opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
About 82 percent of ANC supporters and 84 percent of Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) supporters had the right IDs.
</P>
<P>
But only 71 percent of those who favored the National Party
(NP) and 65 percent of likely Democratic Party (DP) voters had
the right documents.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the poll result, opposition parties criticized the
ANC government's decision to bar those without new IDs from
voting.
</P>
<P>
They said if the ID issue was not handled properly, they would
take the matter to the constitutional court to ensure their
supporters' electoral rights.
</P>
<P>
The survey found eight in ten South Africans wanted to vote
and were likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account of undecided voters, a voter turnout of
between 75 percent and 89 percent was expected next year, about
the same as the 86 percent turnout in 1994, according to the
survey.

<P>
KAMPALA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda have formed
a joint military command of dozens of senior officers from both
sides in eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A New Vision daily report said Wednesday that the command was
in response to President Laurent Kabila's allies sending more
troops for a showdown with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked for any comment on that in a telephone
interview Wednesday morning, officers in the Defense Ministry's
information office refused to confirm it.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the joint command, which is chaired
by Uganda's acting Chief of Staff James Kazini, is composed of 17
Ugandans, 10 Rwandans and five rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
The joint command is aimed at helping strengthen command
tactics, deployment and logistics, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were quoted as saying that the move marks another
stage in the evolution of the internal conflict in the DRC toward
a full-scale six country war.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda both admitted that they have military
presence in eastern Congo (K), but for the purpose of
safeguarding their national interests against rebels crossing
from Congo to attack targets inside their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
They have been accused of backing the rebels fighting to
dethrone Kabila, a charge they have strongly denied.

LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Government of
Nigeria and trade unions have agreed upon the basic salary of
1,299 Naira (about 15 U.S. Dollars) for three tiers of federal,
state and local government civil servants.

A communique issued at the end of an extraordinary meeting

Last September, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced
5,200 Naira minimum monthly salary for federal civil servants and
asked state and local governments to pay a total of 2,800 Naira
(about 32 Dollars) as the minimum wage or more if they could.
</P>
<P>
This directive aroused angry reactions from labor unions in
this West African country, leading to a wave of industrial crisis
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Following the threats of industrial actions by civil servants
in state and local governments, the Federal Government last month
set up the NCMW headed by the Chief of General Staff, Rear
Admiral Mike Akhigbe to have another look at the issue of minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the next meeting of the two sides
is scheduled on December 1 to receive feedback on the results of
the negotiations conducted at the state and local government
levels.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Reaffirms Decision of Moving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 11 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has reaffirmed that his government is determined
to move the capital to the central city of Dodoma though it is
backward in social services.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told a rally while on a tour of the Dodoma Region
Tuesday that as Tanzania's economy is reviving slowly, the Dodoma
City will be built into the new capital gradually.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted Wednesday by the press as saying that starting
with the newly established Ministry of Local Governments and
Regional Administration, more ministries will move to Dodoma, 450
km west of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The president said that from now on, he will spend more time
at the Chamwino presidential lodge in Dodoma, especially when he
is free from state activities in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that he will also invite donor nations and agencies
to fund the construction of Dodoma as a national development
project.
</P>
<P>
Sitting at the heart of Tanzania at an altitude of 1,133
meters above sea level, Dodoma has been designated as the new
capital since Tanzania got independence in early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Dodoma, formerly a small settlement of the Wa-Gogo Tribe, is
also a major stop of the Central Railway Line.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Armed Forces Ready for Democracy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has assured the nation that Nigeria's armed
forces are ready for democracy, saying that the military high
command is doing its best to prepare for a democratic government.
</P>
<P>
The New Nigerian newspaper Wednesday quoted the head of state
as saying in capital Abuja that their continued involvement in
governance was not in their best interest.
</P>
<P>
Receiving President Bill Clinton's special envoy to Africa
Reverend Jesse Jackson in capital Abuja Tuesday, he noted that
continued military rule had very adverse consequences for
professionism and discipline among the officers and men of the
service.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar advised the political leadership in the country that
would emerge on May 29, next year to realize that it had equal
responsibilities to both the civil populace and the armed forces
for the good governance of the nation.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the future political stability of the country, he
said that the next political leadership should avoid actions that
could alienate the military in the interest of peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting with General Abubakar, Jackson who
arrived in the country Monday told reporters that "Nigeria has
gone from midnight to daybreak and now morning has come for
democracy in the country."
</P>
<P>
The special envoy noted that Nigeria's role to Africa's
stability made it imperative that the United States will continue
to show interest in the country, adding that "we expect to come
back to Nigeria because Africa's stability rests on this country
with its huge population and enormous potential."
</P>
<P>
Jackson who is on the first leg of his four-nation West
African tour told Nigerian people that "it is essential for you
to have democratic values, also democratic culture that resists
corruption. The military culture has to be emphasized."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy who met with minority leaders in Niger Delta,
former Head of State General Ibrahim Babangida and others is
scheduled to leave for Ghana Wednesday and for Sierra Leone and
Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Steady in Quiet Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was
steady Wednesday at the close, having regained losses in offshore
trading Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In a quiet day's trade the local currency scrambled back from
the low of 62.20 U.S. cents reached earlier Wednesday morning in
New York.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the day, the Australian dollar was steady at
62.93 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
After trading between 62.65 and 62.85 for most of the local
session the Australian dollar experienced a small spike up in late
afternoon trade to a high for the day of 62.95 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
IBJ foreign exchange dealer Scott Lewis said the local currency
suffered a fairly quiet day except for the afternoon when it
rallied due to a weakening in the U.S. dollar against the Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
At the close the U.S. dollar was buying 120.80 Japanese yen
from 122.11 Tuesday and 1.6804 German marks from 1.6888.
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the fall in the greenback against the Japanese
currency was largely due to a long market that was squaring up
ahead of the Veteran's Day holiday in the U.S. Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics labor force figures
scheduled for release Thursday are on average expected to reflect
a modest seasonally adjusted 3,500 advance in total employment for
the month, compared to a gain of 41,300 jobs in September.
</P>
<P>
This would leave the unemployment rate unchanged at an adjusted
8.1 percent, a survey of economists forecast by MMS Standard &AMP;
Poor's showed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also finished the local session at 76.02
Japanese yen from 76.86 and 1.0576 German marks from 1.0625.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Rebels Continue Fleeing Towards Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) were continuing fleeing towards the Iranian
border amid a Turkish military operation in northern Iraq, the
Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of PKK rebels, who escaped from neighboring Syria,
were trying to force their way into Iran to take shelter from the
Turkish attacks.
</P>
<P>
Backed by fighters and military helicopters, about
20,000-strong Turkish troops started the cross-border military
operation in northern Iraq last Sunday in a bid to wipe out the
PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said earlier that the PKK members had been
encircled by Turkish troops in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The forces of the Massoud Barzani-led Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) were reportedly helping the Turkish government troops
fight the PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish troops were conducting military operations
against the PKK rebels in the southeastern Turkish province of
Sirnak, said Aydin Arslan, the governor of the Emergency Rule
Region.
</P>
<P>
The operations were mainly focused around the Gabar mountain
areas where six village guards were killed and seven others
wounded by the PKK militants, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish cross-border attacks were launched while Barzani and
Jalal Talabani, chairman of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK) operating in northern Iraq were holding talks in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Talabani, who allegedly maintains close relations with the
PKK, had promised Turkey to close all the PKK camps in the
PUK-controlled areas in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, which has been fighting a 14-year-old separatist war
in southeastern Turkey, has camps in northern Iraq where they
often launch hit-and-run attacks on Turkey's military and civilian
targets.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Stock Market Trade Heading Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- With Effectively six weeks of
trading remaining before the end of the year, business is headed
for a low point closing on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE),
Times of Zambia said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It has been a tale of contrasts about the stock market's
performance in the current year and its showing in 1997. As
reflected in the various trading indicators at the LuSE in the
last 11 months, the market has not been up to 1997 levels of
activity.
</P>
<P>
The trade during the year under review has been of flat growth
while trading volumes maintained a comparatively weaker profile.
</P>
<P>
Indicative of the waxing fortunes of the market has been the
falling levels of market capitalization. From a high 1,006,674
Kwacha (one U.S. Dollars equals 2000 Kwacha at present) at the
end of 1997, market capitalization levels had slid to 777,004 and
713,232 Kwacha by August and October this year respectively,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The LuSE free float index has fallen in the same period by 19
percent in nominal terms after opening at 210 and falling to 170
to date.
</P>
<P>
The price earning (PE) ratios for the listed companies
excluding the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines recorded modest
upward adjustments in the period reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Sugar, representing the agricultural sector has been
posting the highest PE ratios over this time at 10.5.
</P>
<P>
With favorable developments envisaged in the macro-sector, the
market is expected to post more positively by the beginning of
the new year.
</P>
<P>
Although not particularly a buoyant year for the investor,
said the paper, there is hope yet for both local and foreign
investors as the economy generally continues in a market
environment conducive of investment.

<HEADLINE> 10B Dollar Package Proposed to Cut Business Costs in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Committee on Singapore's
Competitiveness (CSC) formed by the Singapore government released
Wednesday a report on a 10 billion-Singapore-dollar package of
measures it has proposed with an aim to tide over the current
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Singapore economy has slowed sharply with its
growth rates contracting from 7.8 percent last year to 6.2
percent, 1.8 percent and -0.7 percent respectively in the first,
second and third quarter of 1998, and the unemployment rate has
edged up to 4.5 percent in September with retrenchments exceeding
20,000 people, the committee proposes a 15 percent cut in business
costs or reducing the costs by about 10 billion Singapore dollars,
which is equivalent to about 7 percent of Singapore's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Measures contained in the proposed package include cutting by
10 percent employers' contribution to employees' account of the
Central Provident Fund(CPF); reducing the annual and monthly
variable components of wages; significant slashing land and
factory rentals; trimming charges for services like electricity,
telecommunications and port services, lowering vehicle-related
overhead costs including customs duty and petrol (diesel) duty,
extending existing property tax rebate and suspending stamp duties
on share transactions, and cutting government taxes like corporate
and personal income taxes in fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan, who
doubles the CSC chairman, told a press conference Wednesday
morning that his committee recommends that the government promptly
implements the comprehensive and significant package of cost/tax
cutting measures to help companies compete during this difficult
period and minimize further job losses.
</P>
<P>
The CC was formed in May 1997 on the advice of Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Choke Tong and was assigned to make a thorough review
of Singapore's economic competitiveness over the next decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- All U.N. staff except core
officials are leaving Iraq Wednesday amid the current
Iraq-U.N. standoff, said a U.N. spokesman Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in
Iraq, told reporters that they had received instructions from the
U.N. headquarters in New York asking them to leave for Amman,
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the uncertainty surrounding the current situation
and following instructions from U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate non-essential U.N. staff
to Amman, Jordan," said Falt.
</P>
<P>
He said that "this instruction applies to all U.N. staff
residents in Baghdad, and the measure is of precautionary nature
and is being instituted solely with the safety of U.N. staff in
mind."
</P>
<P>
Falt noted that a number of core (U.N.) officials will remain
in Baghdad including the Humanitarian Coordinator and designated
security official for Iraq Hans von Sponik who has informed the
Iraqi Foreign Ministry this morning of the movement which will
take place.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of 11 vehicles carrying U.N. personnel left the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) headquarters in Baghdad early
Wednesday, heading for the airport.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM withdrew 15 of its inspectors from Iraq on Saturday
in response to the Iraq's decision to suspend cooperation with the
U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on October 31 announced its decision to halt all forms of
cooperation with the UNSCOM until the Security Council moves
toward lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after
its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last Thursday
which condemned the Iraqi non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Labor Wins Elections in 3 Major Israeli Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- TV polls showed Israel's
Labor Party firmly in control of three of the country's major
cities after it captured two from the Likud in Tuesday's municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv, independent Ron Huldai, who is identified with
Labor, Israel's major opposition party, won 50 to 52 percent of
the votes, while the ruling Likud's mayor candidate Doron Rubin
had won only 25 to 27 percent. Tel Aviv was controlled by Likud in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Ya'akov Terner, another independent candidate identified with
Labor, captured the mayor of Israel's southern city of Beer
Sheba from the incumbent mayor David Bunfeld (Likud) with 58
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Haifa Mayor Amran Mitzna of Labor was reelected by a large
majority.
</P>
<P>
But Likud's incumbent Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert won at least
66 percent of the votes, while Likud's candidate Miriam Feierberg
won 40 to 50 percent of the votes in Netanya, making her the first
woman in Israel's history to win control of a city.
</P>
<P>
The Likud's Benny Kiryati had a clear edge on Shas' candidate
in the northern city of Tiberias, according to TV polls.
</P>
<P>
Politicians gave a different picture of polls about Tuesday's
municipal elections. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the
Likud staff Tuesday night at Likud's Tel Aviv headquarters that
the Likud had preserved its power and the two major parties had
just changed places rather than changing the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
But Labor Party leader Ehud Barak was happy about the
results. He told his staff at Labor's Tel Aviv headquarters
Tuesday night that these elections would have an effect on the
national ones.
</P>
<P>
Israel has about 4 million eligible voters. On Tuesday, only
about 40 percent of them cast their votes. Final results will be
announced Friday.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Firmer As Big Caps Bounce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Strong buying interest in
large capitalization stocks inspired by the success of News
Corp's 1.76- billion-U.S.-dollar share offer in Fox Entertainment
in the U.S. helped the Australian share market close firmer
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index climbed just under 1.5 percent, or
38.3 points to close at its peak for the day of 2,720.7.
</P>
<P>
The rise was strongest in non-resource stocks with the all
industrials index up 77.0 points to 4,764.2 while the all
resources index added 5.1 points to 1,075.2.
</P>
<P>
Volume was strong with national turnover a healthy 348.5
million shares traded worth 1.129 billion Australian dollars
(711.23 million U.S. dollars) with 624 shares rising, 475 falling
and 397 steady.
</P>
<P>
News Corp's ordinary shares jumped 4.7 percent, or 51 cents, to
11.30 Australian dollars, while its preferred shares climbed 42 to
10.08 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones dealer Michael Blake said News Corp
was firmer largely due to positive news about the Fox
Entertainment Group Inc float in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said rises among other key industrials such as Lend Lease
and Brambles were also keeping the market firm.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse drew little direction from the Dow Jones
Industrial Average in New York which closed down 33.98 points at
8,863.98 overnight.
</P>
<P>
Westpac rose 31 cents after it delivered a 1.5-percent drop in
net profit after an abnormal loss in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
The other banking majors' strength also contributed to a
1.93-percent jump in the banking sub index to 5,976.0 points.
</P>
<P>
National Australia rose 49 cents, Commonwealth rose 46.9 and
ANZ gained 14 cents on turnover of 7.1 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The only major industrial to buck the positive trend was
Telstra, which drifted four cents on strong volume of 11.82
million shares.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the industrial sector, Lend Lease stacked on 58.5
cents and Brambles Industries soared 69.
</P>
<P>
Resource majors were generally much softer performers.
</P>
<P>
BHP gained a modest two cents, while Rio Tinto added 24 after a
weak start while fellow diversified miner WMC lost three cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index firmed 14.8 points to 1,180.8 as bullion gained
1.20 U.S. dollars to 293.10 per ounce in Sydney trading.

<HEADLINE> Measures Add Convenience to Hong Kong Business Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public
Security's Exit-Entry Administration has issued a series of
policies and measures adding convenience to the Hong Kong business
activities of inland enterprises and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The policies and measures include simplified application
procedures. Qualified enterprise staffers with approved
applications will only need to provide personal information on an
annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The time required for examinations and approvals has been
shortened to enable applicants to visit Hong Kong during specified
periods.
</P>
<P>
Provinces with a large amount of applicants will transfer the
examination and approval authority from the provincial
government to either their capitals or major cities.
</P>
<P>
Revised application requirements enable more inland enterprises
and individuals to conduct business activities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Limits involving valid periods and times for transit visas have
been abolished. All exit-entry administrations have the authority
to approve applications within the total quotas, in accordance
with the documented needs of applicants.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to enterprise staffers who have
consistently adhered to entry and exit laws.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials noted that Chinese staffers with
China-based branches of international organizations, foreign
embassies and enterprises, media organizations and inland
residents working for joint ventures, collectively-owned
businesses and private enterprises can apply to local exit-entry
administration for visiting Hong Kong for training or
business.
</P>
<P>
The administration requires all pertinent organizations to
publicize related procedures, policies, and regulations in order
to ensure convenient supervision of examination and approval
procedures.

<HEADLINE> Infrared Detectors Being Used In Search of South China Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are using
infrared detectors to search for South China Tigers in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to solve an old problem.
</P>
<P>
They say that it may have been a tiger that killed two cattle
earlier this year, so they have installed infrared detectors in
several places in the Huaping Nature Reserve, only 170 kilometers
from Guilin, to look for the culprit.
</P>
<P>
In June and July, the nature reserve reported that two local
cattle had been killed. One was completely eaten and only a bloody
leg was left of the other.
</P>
<P>
Local people saw fur and 10-cm-wide footprints at the scene and
animal excrement and tracks were discovered on a grassland nearby,
indicating that the killer had a good rest after it had eaten.
</P>
<P>
A team of Hong Kong zoologists who are doing field studies in
the region thought that the animal could be a South China Tiger.
</P>
<P>
The South China Tiger is on the brink of extinction that is
found in Guangdong, Fujian and Hunan provinces. There are only
about 20 of these animals in existence.
</P>
<P>
The infrared detectors have found bears, silver pheasants and
monkeys, but never tigers, said Cao Taiming, director of the
nature reserve, which was founded in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
It has a lot of primitive forest and in the past three decades,
people have reported several cases of tigers eating cattles and
people, but since the 1990s, no traces of tigers have been found
there, he added.
</P>
<P>
Better-protected parts of the forest here may attract tigers in
neighboring districts, Cao explained.

<HEADLINE> Energy Development In Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists and
specialists met to discuss the development and allocation of
energy in western China at a recent symposium in Kunming, the
capital of Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Western China has 56.5 percent of the country's land and 23
percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
It also has 70 percent of the country's hydro-electric power
resources, 64 percent of its coal resources, more than 40 percent
of its petroleum resources, and more than half of its natural gas
resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most of the country's exploitable coal-bed gas and
solar energy resources is in western areas.
</P>
<P>
But, a shortage of funds and lack of technology and transport
have held the development of these resources, resulting in a
shortage of energy. So, the country has developed policies to
speed up economic development in the western areas.
</P>
<P>
Priority is being given to the investment environment in these
areas, which need more technology for coordinated economic,
social, and enviromental development.

<HEADLINE> Official Says Philippine Economy in Good Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is in "the best
position" among Asian nations to take advantage of an improved
global economy along with the return of international investor
confidence, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Euro-money conference here, Espiritu said that
the government will continue to deal squarely with the monetary
crisis, which has crippling effects on most Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Philippines has "weathered the crisis quite
well" due to the following factors:
</P>
<P>
-- it has undertaken reforms much earlier that improved the
structure of the economy. The reforms include liberalization of
trade, investments and foreign exchange markets; deregulation of
the financial system, tax reform and privatization.
</P>
<P>
-- it has a very manageable and sustainable external debt
position; and
</P>
<P>
-- its banking sector remains strong as a result of
comprehensive banking reforms that have already been undertaken.
</P>
<P>
But the secretary admitted that the financial crisis has "a
significant social dimension" and "has severely affected large
sectors of society."
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that the government will provide "safety nets"
for the vulnerable sectors, such as basic education, primary
health care and nutrition, and housing.

<HEADLINE> Poor Infrastructure Affects Kenya's Horticulture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The crumbling infrastructure
has become a major constraint to the growth of Kenya's
horticulture industry, according to a report available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the Horticultural Crop Development
Authority, said farmers are unable to market their crop due to
poor roads, railway system and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
"Power supply has been a hindrance to cooling facilities and
irrigation," the report added.
</P>
<P>
Other factors for low horticultural production include lack of
suitable credit for small-holder farmers, lack of high quality
seeds,low levels of research and few available experts.
</P>
<P>
There is inadequate wholesale and retail facilities in the
urban centers, said the report, adding that the wholesale markets
are too small, poor and congested, and often lack cooling
facilities to enable produce last longer.
</P>
<P>
Last year, horticulture earned Kenya over 15 billion Shillings
(some 25 million U.S. Dollars) in foreign exchange. Horticulture
is reported to have earned farmers another 35 billion Shillings
(about 58 million Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China Punishes Tax Evaders to Ensure Fiscal Income (1) by Xinhua Writer Xu Xingtang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China's taxation departments
handled a number of major cases and rendered heavy punishment and
fines for tax evaders over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The effort marked the initiation of a nationwide campaign
against tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
China introduced tax reform in 1994 and has basically
established an effective modern taxation system which has
contributed greatly to the establishment of a market economic
system and sustained, rapid and healthy national economic
development.
</P>
<P>
However, taxation departments have exhibited great concern over
rampant tax evasions which have resulted in substantial losses in
state tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The central government adopted a requirement for the taxation
sector to increase tax revenues by 100 billion yuan to raise the
annual total to 855 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, statistics through the middle of October indicated
fulfillment of only 73.4 percent of the target, or 11.3 percentage
points less than the scheduled volume.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) said
the only way to reach the tax income target is to render heavy
punishment for illegal practices in terms of taxation, and adopt
effective measures to clear tax arrears in the remaining two
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said SAT measures adopted for the ongoing campaign include
exposing serious tax evasion cases; strengthening tax inspections
of key industries, including the tobacco, power and oil sectors,
as well as private and foreign-funded enterprises; and
strengthening relations with financial institutions to clear tax
arrears.
</P>
<P>
He said related measures are expected to enhance social
consciousness of the necessity to voluntarily pay taxes.

ISLAMABAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United
States started their talks on export-control programs to limit
nuclear proliferation here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expert team, which arrived here Tuesday evening, is

a common position on the issue of technology exports.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between the experts from the two
countries following their first meeting in New York last month.
</P>
<P>
The talks coincide with U.S. President Bill Clinton's
announcement of lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Pakistan
and India after their nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Washington is now pressurizing both India and Pakistan to sign
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).

Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed held parlays with
State Department officials in Washington on November 4-5 on
non-proliferation and security situation in South Asia among other

<P>
Companies from the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Japan,
Taiwan, and about a dozen other countries and regions are

<P>
One recent major tax evasion case involved 218 enterprises in
Jinhua County, east China's Zhejiang Province. An in-depth
investigation revealed that 218 enterprises in the county used
counterfeit value-added tax receipts to evade taxes of well over
6.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government handed down heavy punishment for local
officials involved in the case, with a number of individuals
expelled from the ruling Communist Party of China and dismissed
from their posts. Others were referred to legislative
departments in accordance with the law, and a few individuals
involved in the case received death sentences.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attempted to encourage investments
by formulating a series of favorable taxation policies covering
overseas-funded enterprises. However, various unqualified
enterprises resorted to illegal acts to gain tax exemptions and
created substantial losses in tax incomes.
</P>
<P>
Last week's case involving the Enwei Group in Chengdu, capital
of southwest China's Sichuan Province, was typical of related
practices. An investigation of the tax evasions of two of the
group's subsidiaries resulted in taxes and fines of 108 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments has also paid great attention to
individual income taxes, with famous pop star Mao Amin recently
ordered to pay all back taxes and a heavy fine.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments are preparing to publicize additional tax
evasion cases in the near future. Public security, industrial and
commercial bureaus, banks and taxation departments will jointly
work to strengthen taxation, and effective measures will be
adopted to promote public awareness of the importance in paying
taxes.

<HEADLINE> China Building Competitive Power Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to separate
power plant and power grid operations and let companies operate as
commercial entities, according to sources at the State Economic
and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
They said that power plants will have to compete in the years
ahead, and this is a major step in China's power industry reforms.
</P>
<P>
China's power sector has long been monopolized by the state and
a regional power corporation supervises both power plants and
local grids now. And, because of a lack of competition, there have
been management and pricing problems that keep it from being
efficient.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1980s, the country decided to develop
the power industry by pooling funds from various sources and a
current reform scheme will mean replacing the existing pricing
system with a more market-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
Rural and industrial electricity prices will depend entirely on
the market, but electricity for agricultural use will not go up a
great deal.
</P>
<P>
The country is now considering drafting laws and regulations to
coordinate the reforms.

<HEADLINE> Poor Roads, Disease Threaten Kenya's Pineapple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Pineapple farmers in Malindi,
coastal Kenya, have asked the government to take urgent measures
to repair poor roads around and help them fight a disease that
has hit pineapples in the area.
</P>
<P>
Poor roads, banditry, pests and diseases led to loss of more
than half of the pineapple production in the east African country
last year and now are bringing the industry to the total
collapse, the farmers warned.
</P>
<P>
The road around Malindi were wrecked by the heavy El Nino
rains which had lasted five months from October, 1997 and have
not been repaired so far, shooting up the transportation
expenditure, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The rains made the roads to Malindi completely impassable at
a time when the pineapple crop was flourishing and good returns
were expected," a farmer, Issac Kitsao, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Bawazir Fruit Processing factory, the only large scale
market for pineapple farmers in the area, is too far for most
farmers and much of the crop fetches poor prices at the factory
because it arrives damaged, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Large and small-scale farmers all complained that they are
unable to service loans advanced by the Agricultural Finance
Corporation as a result.
</P>
<P>
"If the extension officers do not help us control the disease
which broke out in the area last year, pineapple farming will
collapse in Malindi," pineapple farmer Paul Masha said.
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman of the Malindi County Council, George Baruk,
who is also a leading pineapple farmer, added that lack of fruit
processing factories and exploitation by middle men affected
farmers' morale and incomes in the coastal Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Returns to Happy Life in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhaxi Wangdue, a 74-year-old
Tibetan, was born into a military family, and was once a lama at
Salra Temple, but he left the country in 1959.
</P>
<P>
He returned to China and settled down here in 1985, and lives
in a 50-square-meter house provided by the Tibet Regional
Government and says that he feels exuberant and is becoming
younger and younger.
</P>
<P>
He was elected a deputy to the Fifth Lhasa City People's
Congress in 1987 and proposed that Tibetan youth be educated more
in the law, something that attracted a great deal of attention
from the local government.
</P>
<P>
He was then elected to the Sixth People's Congress of Lhasa and
became a member of the Lhasa City Committee of the Fifth People's
Political Consultative Conference. A dozen of his proposals have
been made into regulations.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi recalls 15 years of miserable life when he lived in a
refugee camp abroad and says that he was very confused about
guarding a land that did not belong to his.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, he returned to China for the first time. He said that
the government arranged a special car for him to visit Lhasa,
Xigaze and Shannan, and he also visited his sister in Qonggyai
County in Shannan Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
"My sister was very poor and her family lived in a run-down
house when I went abroad in 1959," he reports, but now she has a
two-story house and a tractor. Her family is provided with plenty
of rice and flour which were lacking in the past, he
continues. And concludes that, what is more important, is that
Tibetans have the freedom of religion.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Introduce Landmine Bill in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government will introduce legislation banning the use of
anti-personnel landmines into Australian federal parliament
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said he would
personally introduce the bill, which is supported by all sides of
politics, after it was approved at Wednesday's ruling coalition
party meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The government recognized early in its first term that more
needed to be done to rid the world of the landmines scourge,"
Downer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We were quick to announce Australia's support for a global ban
on anti-personnel landmines (APL) as well as the suspension of the
operational use of APL by the Australian Defense Force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer overcame strong opposition from the military last year
and succeeded in having the cabinet reverse its opposition to the
treaty banning the use of landmines.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Australia was one of the original signatories to
last year's Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use,
production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Once the bill becomes law, Australia will be required to
destroy its entire stockpile of anti-personnel mines, apart from a
small number retained for training purposes.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Assures PAL Employees of Job Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday assured Philippine Airlines (PAL) workers of job
security even if new investors take control of the airline's
management.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said
that PAL will honor the agreement reached by the airline's
management and labor union, which PAL employees overwhelmingly
ratified in September.
</P>
<P>
"Personnel will be retained, and excess personnel to be retired
will be given their separation pay," he said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu expressed optimism that PAL employees would cooperate
with the new management should Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific
Airways take over PAL operations.
</P>
<P>
Cathay and PAL's interim rehabilitation receiver announced
Tuesday that Cathay's conditional proposal for a possible
investment in PAL had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
The two parties would draw up together a comprehensive
rehabilitation plan for PAL and submit it to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and creditors for approval.
</P>
<P>
PAL shut down its operations on September 23 after the ground
crew union turned down a recovery plan proposed by the airline's
management.
</P>
<P>
The proposal included a 10-year suspension of labor's
collective bargaining agreement, in exchange for 20 percent
ownership of the airline, three board seats, no pay cuts, full
medical benefits and other privileges.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was approved by the workers in a second
referendum, enabling PAL to resume operations last month.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said that Cathay will limit its investment in PAL to
40 percent, as stipulated in the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Cathay is expected to raise 4 billion pesos
(100 million U.S. dollars) of the 6 billion pesos (150 million
dollars) needed to make PAL viable again.

<HEADLINE> Asia Faces Epidemic of Heart Disease: Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Asia faces an epidemic of
heart disease, Australian researchers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hypertension, high cholesterol and smoking are contributing to
rising numbers of men and women developing cardiovascular disease,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The first study to investigate how many people in the
Asia-Pacific region are in hospital for heart problems and why,
has alarmed Australian researchers.
</P>
<P>
The researchers presented the data to the American Heart
Association congress in Dallas, Texas, of the United States,
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, which involves 4,000 patients at 135 hospitals in 10
countries or regions, found surprisingly similar levels of
cholesterol to that in the West, said Professor Anthony Keech of
the University of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"While obesity is not generally a problem in Asia, we are
seeing higher rates of diabetes and hypertension than in the
West," said Keech, who is chief investigator for the study.
</P>
<P>
"Lifestyle changes as these countries modernize, start eating
more saturated fat and replace exercise with cars, which is
starting to have an impact on death rates," he told the Australian
Associated Press from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
"In the West these problems have peaked but we are quite
fearful that Asian countries are now starting to climb the hill
and their governments are not yet ready for the impact," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Professor Keech and study coordinator Gemma Ritchie found
smoking rates dramatically higher than similar Western
populations, and little effort to counter the habit.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of hypertension was as high as 80 percent in
some countries, compared to an average 50 percent in Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes was much higher than in Western populations and
although treated with drugs, dietary advice was less often
provided.
</P>
<P>
The big shock was the prevalence of high cholesterol, which has
been traditionally low.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, only 20 percent of heart patients had levels at
5.5 or higher, but other nations had a greater problem, with
Singapore reaching 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted in Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Eight people are now feared
to have died following a landslide struck Sunday in Maragua
District, Central Province of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight, three children were confirmed dead while five
people were missing, the Daily Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A single mother was left childless after her two children,
aged one and five respectively, were buried alive.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said Tuesday that the missing persons were with
him at the affected area as the land started tilting at a point
where a water pipe had burst two days ago before the incident.
</P>
<P>
The area affected is half a kilometer long and just over 10
meters wide.
</P>
<P>
During the catastrophe, an earth road connecting western parts
of the province was completely paralyzed and Irati River blocked.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Enhances Anti-Corruption Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is to quadruple the size of the public protector's
office in a bid to crack down on corruption, Business Day paper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The office's complement would be increased from 32 to 150 to
deal with the backlog of 2,500 cases, Public Service Minister
Zola Skweylya said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It also emerged that Justice Minister Dullah Omar could lead a
review of the role of agencies against corruption, such as the
Heath special investigating unit and the public protector.
</P>
<P>
More funds and resources would be granted to these units,
which are often cash-stripped, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The move coincided with the government's two-day conference
against corruption, which ends Wednesday. Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki, delivering a keynote speech at the conference Tuesday,
warned that corrupt officials would be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
"Zero tolerance will be offered to the parasites of our
land... who have sought their own self-enrichment at state
expense," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said government's campaign would include a review of
anti-corruption legislation, drafting of new laws, more efficient
monitoring and management systems, and a more comprehensive
"whistle-blowing" system.
</P>
<P>
Omar said if the cabinet decided that he should lead a review
of agencies against corruption, "I would be quite happy to do
that".
</P>
<P>
More than 200 delegates, including cabinet ministers,
parliamentarians and corruption-fighting officials, attended the
conference, which is aimed at stemming rampant corruption in the
public sector at all levels of government.
</P>
<P>
Omar said they would look at the experience of other regions
and countries such as Hong Kong, Germany and France, where all
role players are mobilized to improve the quality of the fight
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The conference will pave the way for a national summit on
corruption in February next year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Motorists to Face Stiff Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Transport costs and passenger
fares may spiral upward in Kenya if the parliament passes a bill
on a Road Safety levy.
</P>
<P>
The new levy is also expected to push up insurance premiums
and the various fees levied by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Amos Wako, when issuing the Traffic Amendment
Bill Tuesday, said that proceeds of the proposed levy will be
used to set up a national road safety fund and create the Kenya
Road Safety Authority.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposed stiffer penalties of up to 15 years in jail
for dangerous driving.
</P>
<P>
Reckless driving will expose a first offender to a fine
ranging from 5,000 Shillings (83 U.S. Dollars) to 50,000
Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Second or subsequent reckless driving offenders will face a
fine of up to 75,000 Shillings and imprisonment for up to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Conviction for dangerous driving will also lead to
disqualification from obtaining or holding a driving license for
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Overloading public service vehicle with passengers will
attract an enhanced penalty ranging from 20,000 Shillings to
50,000 Shillings.
</P>
<P>
The bill further seeks to prescribe the alcohol limit for
drivers to 35 micrograms of alcohol in 100 milliliters of breath
and a blood concentration of 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of
blood.
</P>
<P>
Wako explains that the hefty charges are deliberate and
intended to be in line with the inflation rate and moves to
regulate and improve general road safety in the east African
country.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 11, (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
been urged to continue its economic privatization program as this
is the only way to put the country's economy on the right track.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Times of Zambia Wednesday quoted Chairman of
Lusaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Gaudenzio Rossi,
as saying that Zambia will only develop through the privatization
of the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after his Vice Chairman for Industry Henry
Chipewo recently appealed on the government to discontinue with
the privatization, alleging that the exercise does not benefit
the country but only benefits foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Rossi said that discontinuing the program at this stage will
only spell economic doom because the government has no financial
resources to recapitalize companies.
</P>
<P>
"This is a harsh program and there are many casualties on the
way but once completed it will bear fruit and people should
accept the fact that privatization is the only way out for us,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is true that some privatized companies have closed
down but this is not an indication that the exercise has failed
because the only solution for some companies is liquidation.
</P>
<P>
Rossi said the official position of LCCI is in support of the
program.

<HEADLINE> China Facing Difficult Keeping Crested Ibis From Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Even though the number of the
crested ibis is increasing, ornithologists are sceptical about how
long the rare bird can survive.
</P>
<P>
One hailstorm could very likely kill all of them, and there is
still a lot to be done, according to Shi Dongchou, a fellow
researcher of the Northwest China Rare and Endangered Species
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The crested ibis is a wading bird that mainly feeds on small
fishes in Siberia, Korea, Japan and parts of China. It
disappeared from China in the 1960s, by the 1970s it was seldom
seen in Russia and Korea and it has fared no better in Japan where
there is reportedly only one still living, in captivity.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Chinese zoologists discovered some of the species
in the southern Qinling Mountains, its old habitat, in the early
1980s and have taken steps to protect it. Two breeding centers
were set up in Beijing and Yangxian County to breed the birds in
captivity. This has increased the number of crested ibis in China
to 136, with 70 kept at the breeding centers.
</P>
<P>
This is still no guarantee that the species is out of danger,
Shi warned, who continues the field work in Qinling.
</P>
<P>
In addition to natural disasters, inbreeding poses another
threat. The remaining birds are actually descendants of three
couples found in the wild.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the birds have enough to eat in winter, some
winter paddy fields need to be provided, but the most important
thing is to remove the threats to the natural habitat from human
beings, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
The ibis raised in captivity can not be relied on to continue
the species, Shi warned, saying that the birds' natural habitat
needs to be protected and experiments done on training the birds
to be released back to nature.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
wounded near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank Tuesday night,
Israel Radio reported Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the incident occurred near the Jewish
settlement of Otniel when the two soldiers were apparently
ambushed by Palestinian militants who hid by the side of a road.
</P>
<P>
The assailants opened fire on the military truck as the
Israeli soldiers stopped it at a junction.
</P>
<P>
One soldier was hit in the chest and in serious condition. And
the other had small fragments of glass in his head and his wounds
were mild.
</P>
<P>
Following the shooting, dozens of Israeli troops arrived on
the scene and sealed off the area.
</P>
<P>
The Otniel settlement is to the south of the West Bank city of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said findings of its initial investigation
were given to the Palestinian police. And the Palestinian police
set up roadblocks around Hebron and searched cars.
</P>
<P>
The shooting happened just hours after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu announced that his cabinet would continue
discussing the new peace agreement signed with the Palestinians
on Wednesday after two weeks of delay.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he had received new assurances from
Palestinian National Authority that it would take necessary steps
to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the cabinet meeting is scheduled for
Wednesday afternoon. However, it is not clear whether the
shooting incident will delay the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China's Market Survey Business Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Market surveys have found
their way into China as the country moves faster towards a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
At a recent seminar on market surveys, it was reported that
China has about 1,000 agencies involved in the business, with
300,000 employees, and 500 million yuan in business annually.
</P>
<P>
Surveys of economic life here started in the 1950s, when local
statistics offices were told by the central government to make
studies of social conditions and incomes of urban workers.
</P>
<P>
But, the business did not become popular until the 1980s when
different provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions all
established their own survey teams.
</P>
<P>
Market survey companies, most of which are based in urban
areas, now fall into three categories: government, private firms,
and overseas-backed agencies.

the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
During his first state visit to China, Kim is expected to meet
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji and some

<P>
TOKYO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi left here for Moscow Wednesday on a three-day visit to
Russia for talks with Russian leaders in a bid to resolve a
decades-old territorial dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the first official trip to Russia by a
Japanese prime minister in 25 years, Obuchi and Russian leaders
are expected to have wide-range discussions on bilateral ties as
well as negotiations on a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
In their summit talks Thursday, Obuchi and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin will reaffirm previous agreements reached by the
leaders of the two countries in November, 1997 and April, 1998 to
work for a conclusion of a peace treaty by 2000 after resolving
the territorial row.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the summit is Russia's response to a demarcation
proposal Japan reportedly made to resolve the dispute over four
Russian-held islands off Hokkaido, according to Japanese official.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the islands has prevented Japan and Russia
from signing a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Russia, Obuchi is also expected to meet with
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and visit Moscow State
University before leaving for home Friday evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Some progress has been made
in Zhejiang Province in dealing with the pollution problems of
Taihu Lake, one of China's biggest lakes, according to a recent
environmental protection team's inspection.
</P>
<P>
Some 76 percent of 257 enterprises discharging pollutants into
the lake have been equipped with pollution treatment facilities
and 61 enterprises are supposed to speed up construction, the
team, headed by Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration, found.
</P>
<P>
Taihu Lake, covering an area of 2,400 square kilometers, is an
important source of water for Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. The
lake valley in Zhejiang contains the cities of Hangzhou, Jiaxing
and Huzhou in the northern part.
</P>
<P>
The central government has a goal of making all polluters
around the lake reach certain standards by the end of the year,
and the provincial government has formulated policies to support
the effort.
</P>
<P>
Huzhou has spent 98.2 million yuan (about 12 million
U.S. dollars) on pollution treatment, and 49 enterprises have
reached standard levels of discharge and nine seriously polluters
have been closed down.
</P>
<P>
The Minfeng Group, which owns a paper mill in Jiaxing, has
spent more than 10 million yuan on a waste water treatment plant
with a daily capacity of 20,000 cu.m.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou has combined industrial pollution treatment with urban
environmental protection, with an 80 million yuan fund for 87 key
pollution treatment projects, and stress has been placed on waste
water treatment with a major waste water treatment project
increasing capacity from 400,000 tons to 600,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Political Parties Urged to Shun "Hartal" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of five Bangladeshi
prominent chambers and trade associations have reiterated their
fervent appeal to the political parties to shun the path of
"hartal" politics and to cultivate the culture of mutual tolerance
and accommodation, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued in Dhaka Tuesday, leaders of these
business bodies stressed that using "hartal" as the means of
expressing political difference "serves" no purpose because of the
harm it "inflicts" on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Their appeals, also made in a similar way in the past, would
continue to be ignored but they had no option other than voicing
it once again, they said, adding that their deep concern over the
problems caused to the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Trade and industry regrets that its repeated appeals during
the last several years to the political parties to make an
objective review, if 'hartal' serves any purpose, do not appear to
have been given any consideration," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The trade and industry is deeply aggrieved at the indifference
of political parties to such appeals and indiscriminate uses of
"hartal" to express their grievances, ignoring how "hartal"
affects the economy and hurts the poorer sections of the people,
small traders, rural industries and export trade, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "hartal" programs which ignore such
aspects of economic life of the people, can not be termed to have
the support of the people, particularly when nearly all sections
of the people have been badly affected by the recent floods.
</P>
<P>
Hartal is a special political phenomenon in Bangladesh. The
opposition party often finds reasons to hold hartals in opposing
the ruling party, while the latter always adopts some counter
measures to control the situation. Clashes between the two sides
always take place.
</P>
<P>
During hartals, all shops are closed, transport stops and
pedestrians are rarely seen in the streets. Therefore, almost all
the economic activities in the capital city and other major cities
in the country are at a standstill for a day or two days or even
more.
</P>
<P>
A day-long nation-wide hartal in Bangladesh will make the
national economy incur an estimated loss of over 3.8 billion taka
(78 million U.S. dollars), Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kabria said
at a press conference Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government to Curb Sugar Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
said it will make tough measures to curb dumping of imported
sugar so as to save local industries from collapse.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Tuesday the
government had already raised the tax on per ton of imported
sugar to 50,000 Shillings (834 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The cost incurred during the processing of a ton of local
sugar is about 36,000 Shillings, which is far lower than the cost
incurred in importing a similar amount of the commodity," he was
quoted by Wednesday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the high taxation, among other measures being
undertaken by the government, would ensure there was no more
dumping of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged local farmers not to sell their maize
stocks at the prevailing low prices as the prices are likely to
rise.
</P>
<P>
"The government is also encouraging relief organizations such
as the World Food Program to consider buying their crop supplies
meant for refugees from the National Cereals and Produce Board
instead of solely relying on imports," he said.

<HEADLINE> India, Largest Source of Toxic Chemicals in S. Asia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- India is the largest source
of highly toxic chemicals in South Asia with several restricted or
banned compounds freely available and stored in huge stockpiles
all over the region, Greenpeace said in a report published here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
India exported a total of nearly 800,000 kilograms of toxic
chemicals called POPs to a number of countries including the
United States and Japan, said the report entitled "Toxic Legacies;
Poisoned Futures; Persistent Organic Pollutants in Asia".
</P>
<P>
India exported about 175,795 kilograms of DDT, which was banned
in most countries of the world, to its neighbors and other
countries like New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Arab
Emirates between April 1997 and January 1998, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
It alleged that India is one of the three countries which
continue to manufacture and export DDT sometime to countries where
its usage is officially banned.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the porous border shared by Nepal and
Bangladesh with India facilitates the smuggling of large
quantities of hazardous chemicals by unscrupulous private
companies.

<HEADLINE> Post-Flood Agri-Loans Disbursed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
disbursed 5.89 billion taka (121.4 million U.S. dollars)
agri-loans among the flood-hit farmers till October 31 and the
process is still going on, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was quoted
as saying by press reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agri-loans are being disbursed among the farmers as her
proper guidelines, she told the parliament Tuesday, asking the
parliament members to monitor the process to check any
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to disburse a total of 32.69 billion taka
(674 million dollars) for agri-loans to help flood-affected
farmers minimize their huge crop loss by producing rice without
facing any financial problem.
</P>
<P>
Her government has also suspended realizing the previous year's
agri-loans up to 15,000 taka (206 dollars) and is also
distributing fresh loans to the farmers, the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
She also stated that the government had distributed 65.5
million taka (1.35 million dollars) in cash as gratuitous relief
and 22.43 million taka (462,470 dollars) for the reconstruction of
houses destroyed by the recent flood.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 120,000 tons of foodgrains have already allocated and
another 120,000 tons will be allocated under the food-for-work
program, and under the test-relief program, 50,000 tons of
foodgrains have been allocated and 50,000 tons more will be
allocated, she said.
</P>
<P>
For tackling a possible good shortage, she said that the
government has imported one million tons of foodgrains while 1-1.5
million tons are being imported at the private level and 700,000
tons coming from the donors.
</P>
<P>
The worst-ever flooding in a century in Bangladesh, which
gripped as much as two thirds of the country and seriously
affected over 30 million people for ten weeks, washed away about
one million hectares of paddy-field and paddy-seedlings, causing
an estimated loss of two million tons of rice.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Permit Armed APEC Bodyguards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
is to amend the law to enable foreign armed bodyguards to
accompany leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in Auckland next September.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion newspaper said Wednesday that the change is to
ease the concerns of U.S. authorities who "threatened that the
U.S. might not attend if bodyguards could not carry weapons".
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted Foreign Affairs and Trade
Minister Don McKinnon and Police Minister Clem Simich as saying
Tuesday that the Arms Act amendment would enable selected
bodyguards accompanying "some world leaders" at APEC meetings to
carry guns.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Peter Doone would personally issue permits
to the approved bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
the paper said the two New Zealand ministers said the permits
would be given "only to world leaders", but neither they nor Mr.
Doone would say who those leaders were.
</P>
<P>
"Background information they made public mentions the leaders
of the United States, Russia, and China in particular", the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Minister McKinnon said the law change is not something the
government is taking lightly.
</P>
<P>
"APEC is an unprecedented event for New Zealand. We are
expecting the world leaders of 20 economies to visit. The event
requires a level of security we have never had to provide before,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Launch Breast Screening Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's first
national free breast cancer screening program will start next
month.
</P>
<P>
The program was suggested in 1995 by Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley, who was then health minister, and was to have started
last year but was postponed after the merger of the four regional
health authorities into one agency.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion newspaper Wednesday quoted Bernie Mullin, manager
of public health program of the Health Funding Authority, as
saying that the breast screen program would help reduce the
number of premature deaths caused by breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper also quoted authority figures as
showing 10 percent of New Zealand women develop breast cancer and
600 die from it each year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mullin said all women aged 50 to 64 with no symptoms of
breast cancer would be invited to receive a free mammogram
(breast X-ray) every two years.
</P>
<P>
"The mammograms will be checked by at least two radiologists
who will be looking for small cancers. Women will be sent the
results within two weeks."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mullin said women who needed further checking would be
called back for more X-rays, an ultrasound scan or a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years the aim is to get 70 percent of the
eligible 241,000 women enrolled in the program and tested, Dr.
Millin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand resident
population was estimated at 3,797,100 at the end of September this
year, Deputy Government Statistician Dianne Macaskill announced
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Macaskill said this represented an increase
of 26,900 or 0.7 percent over the figure a year ago. The growth
rate was half the average annual growth rate of 1.4 percent
recorded for the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The release said that a substantial turnaround in the external
migration balance was the main factor in the slower growth.
Permanent and long-term departures exceeded arrivals by 3,900
during the year to September, compared with a migration gain of
12,900 in the previous year. Over the same period natural increase
(excess of births over deaths) rose from 30,000 to 30,800.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the median age of the New Zealand
population was estimated at 33.8 years at the end of September,
compared with 31.6 years in 1991. The population aged 65 years and
over now makes up 11.7 percent of all New Zealand residents, and
56.5 percent of these are women.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Trade Deficit Narrows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand merchandise
trade balance has shown an improving trend over the past five
months, turning around the decline that began in August 1997,
Government Statistician Len Cook said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Cook said this is because the exports trend
is rising, assisted by the lower New Zealand dollar, while imports
are showing a declining trend.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, New Zealand reported a merchandise
trade deficit of 210 million NZ dollars (111.3 million U.S.
dollars), down from a deficit of 308 million NZ dollars (163.2
million U.S. dollars) in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports in September, 1998, were 1,837 million NZ
dollars (975 million U.S. dollars), 9.6 percent higher than in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition to an increase of 23 percent in New Zealand exports
to Europe in September, exports to Asia also grew despite the
Asian economic crisis. New Zealand exports to Asia, at 632
million NZ dollars (335 million U.S. dollars), were almost the
same level as a year ago, the release said.
</P>
<P>
For the year to September, 1998, merchandise exports of New
Zealand were 22,102 million NZ dollars (11,714 million U.S.
dollars), 4.8 percent higher than in the previous year, it added.

<HEADLINE> A Nightmare for Filipinos by Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- It is a true story. When a
Filipino-
Chinese millionaire invites his friends out for dinner in evening,
he
never uses his luxurious Mercedes-Benz, but always sits in a
Toyota, or
Honda of his friends, for fear of being kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
He has become very nerves since one of his family members was
kidnapped for a ransom of 75 million pesos (about three million
U.S.
dollars) five years ago.
</P>
<P>
This is not an individual case any more in the country. For
many
Filipinos, particularly some well-to-do Filipino-Chinese, they
have been
living with a nightmare of kidnapping for many years, as such
incidents
are increasing year by year, despite the continuous crackdown by
the
government.
</P>
<P>
When a U.S. magazine described the Philippines as the capital
of
kidnapping in Asia last year, the Ramos administration was
outraged,
dismissing as "exaggeration" of the figures cited by the magazine.
</P>
<P>
Then, Ramos ordered an all-out war against the kidnappers, and
claimed
victories soon.
</P>
<P>
But cracking down on kidnappers is like fighting an endless
war,
kidnapping cases have not declined in the Philippines, but
increased
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
According to Kidnap Watch, a crime watch organization in the
Philippines, in 1993, 107 incidents were reported with 179 victims
and
the total ransom paid amounted to 2.5 million U.S. dollars, but in
1997,
152 incidents were reported with 249 victims. The total ransom
paid in
the year increased to 10.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
When President Joseph Estrada came to office on July 1, he
vowed to
improve his country's image by wiping out kidnapping syndicates in
six
months.
</P>
<P>
But to his dismay, since June 30, 61 people have been kidnapped
in 32
incidents.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, a 38-year-old businessman named Willyson Ong was
kidnapped and was killed by the abductors 39 days later before his
family
could pay any ransom.
</P>
<P>
Ong's death aroused strong reactions from the Filipino-Chinese
community. On October 11, some 2,000 Filipino-Chinese marched
during Ong's funeral procession to protest against the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Seven Major Filipino-Chinese organizations issued a statement,
urging Estrada "to use all his power to direct his men to go after
Ong's killers and all remaining kidnap-for ransom syndicates."
</P>
<P>
In response to the appeal, President Estrada ordered the
national police and the intelligence to work together against
kidnapping syndicates. In the past three weeks, scores of
kidnappers have been arrested and millions of pesos been
recovered. The government expressed its confidence that kidnapping
groups would be caught by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But in the Filipino-Chinese community, people are less
optimistic about the situation. In Manila's China Town, people
dare not go out for any functions after dark.
</P>
<P>
On November 3, just a week after the police arrested nine
suspects in the kidnap-murder of Willyson Ong, an old lady working
for her brother in a furniture shop in China Town expressed her
dismay to new kidnapping incidents. She said that her family
members are worried about her safety even when she was staying in
the shop during the day time.
</P>
<P>
She doubted that the government could wipe out all kidnapping
syndicates in such a short period, as Estrada's predecessors tried
their best for so many years but failed in the end.
</P>
<P>
Now, time seems running short. There are less than two months
left before the deadline, but many victims, including some foreign
nationals, are still in the hands of kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Who should be blamed for the increasing number of abductions?
</P>
<P>
The authorities say that the increasing kidnappings take place
simply because the families of victims failed to report the
incidents to the police.
</P>
<P>
But the victim families allegedly say that some criminal groups
have good connections with some policemen.
</P>
<P>
In Mindanao, the Southern Philippines, rebel groups often
kidnap people for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
As the problem is not so simple that kidnapping will not
disappear in the country quickly, at least in the coming months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges to Control Small Arms Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States -- the
world's number one arms seller -- will strengthen controls over
the export of small arms, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The State Department has increased scrutiny of export licenses
"to make sure end users are the real end users" and laws have been
tightened to prevent Americans from facilitating arms deals abroad
that would be illegal at home, Albright said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Customs Service has also increased efforts to block
illegal arms shipments and the Justice Department has stepped up
prosecutions of traffickers caught smuggling arms into Mexico, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the International Rescue Committee at an awards
dinner in New York, Albright talked about the challenge presented
by the "uncontrolled flow of arms, ammunition and explosives into
tense areas of the world."
</P>
<P>
"It is a tragic truth of our times that in many places where it
is impossible to find a wholesome meal or a warm bed, it is easy
to find a gun or a grenade," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. would also work to create an African
center for technical assistance and training, in order to
establish stronger law enforcement networks to fight uncontrolled
small arms trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Ask Malaysia to Ease Capital Curbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai will ask Malaysia to ease its capital restrictions, in a
bid to preserve trade and tourism between the two countries, a
foreign ministry official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan will make the request when he holds talks
with his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad on Monday, prior
to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The discussion will be the first between the two leaders since
Malaysia imposed capital controls in September.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation severely undermined Thailand's tourism
industry along the Thai-Malaysian border as Malaysian tourists are
not allowed to carry more than 1,000 ringgit (about 274 U.S.
dollars) when they travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
Local traders also find it difficult to exchange the ringgit
with other currencies as Thai commercial banks refuse to accept
it.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Chuan will also seek support from
Mahathir to strengthen cooperation among the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members during the economic
meltdown, the foreign ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan will also meet U.S. President Bill Clinton and New
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley on Monday. He will talk with
the leaders of Japan, Singapore, Peru, Mexico and ASEAN nations on
Tuesday, which is the first day of the two-day summit.

WASHINGTON -- Foreign aid has been highly successful in
reducing poverty in countries with sound economic management and
strong government institutions, the World Bank stressed in a new
report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of countries that use foreign aid efficiently has
increased dramatically in the 1990s. However, aid from the wealthy
countries has fallen to its lowest point in more than 50 years,
according to the bank's report entitled "Assessing Aid: What
Works, What Doesn't And Why."
</P>
<P>
"Aid is more than just money; it is about ideas or knowledge
creation," said Joseph Stiglitz, senior vice president and the
chief economist of the World Bank who presented the report.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz said that with more developing countries moving to
sound policies and donors promoting reform and
institution-building in these nations, there never has been a
better time for giving aid. (WB-Foreign Aid-Report)

<HEADLINE> China's "Universal-Joint King" Has Farmland Roots (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Lu Guanqiu is sitting in
front of a computer in his office, pulling up information about
the companies in his Wanxiang Group and the movement of China's
stock market.
</P>
<P>
"In the next five years, I hope my stocks can be listed on the
New York and Tokyo exchanges," the 53-year-old chairman of the
board of China's largest universal joint manufacturer says.
</P>
<P>
It's been a long road to this position. Lu was born into a
peasant family in the town of Ningwei in east Zhejiang province,
and 20 years ago never went any farther than the paddy fields
around his village. In the past, poor transportation kept China
backward.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, Lu and
six of his fellow villagers started a blacksmith shop, but they
continued to live in poverty. It wasn't until 1978, the year China
started its ambitious reform, opening-up, and modernization drive,
that the chance to change arrived.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Lu and his companions started manufacturing universal
joints, which they believed had a promising future in China, which
was trying to improve its transportation sector, because the
U-joint was such an important part of all vehicles.
</P>
<P>
These farmers-turned-industrialists started from scratch, doing
everything by themselves because of China's planned economy, with
everything under the sun controlled by state businesses.
</P>
<P>
They worked on drawings of universal joints and scoured state
factory dumps for raw materials, scavenging around for half-burned
lumps of coal, scrap iron and steel, and any old equipment.
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but they had to develop their own market, Lu
recalls, because in a planned economy, factories produced and
delivered everything in accordance with government orders.

<TEXT>
<P>
To make matters worse, the tiny township company soon ran into
a lot of competition from 54 state manufacturers with the same
product. But, Lu felt confident that lower costs and higher
quality could help a product survive on the market.
</P>
<P>
However, their first products failed to meet customers'
expectations and about 60,000 U.S. dollars worth of these products
went down the drain and were sold to scrap dealers. The company's
annual sales were only 500,000 U.S. dollars. "My employees will
never forget this costly lesson," he says.
</P>
<P>
But, that lesson made the budding industrialists aware of the
importance of information, and they now have a night school to
train personnel, and have even hired at least 1,000 college grads,
some with masters or doctors degrees.
</P>
<P>
Lu's businesses took off in the late 1980s, when the government
increased reforms. As early as 1984, this ambitious man began to
eye overseas markets and managed to sell 30,000 U-joints to Panax,
which was the largest U-joint maker in the U.S. at that time.
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1990, his Wanxiang Group came into being in the city
of Xiaoshan in Zhejiang, when they merged eight state factories,
because the government was selling some money-losing state firms
as part of its reforms. It soon had 65 percent of the domestic
market. Wanxiang's products are now doing well in 34 countries and
regions, and this year, Wanxiang started supplying the
U.S. automotive giants GM and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Wanxiang has had companies in the U.S., Britain,
Canada, and Latin America, and a number of warehouses in the U.S.,
Mexico, and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Although Wanxiang is still a township enterprise, it had 2.89
billion yuan in sales and 100 million U.S. dollars worth of
exports last year. The State Council has listed it among the
country's 120 enterprises that are experimenting with a modern
enterprise system and one of Wanxiang's companies has been listed
on China's stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Lu recently told an international seminar on enterprise
strategies in Shanghai that was attended by business people and
officials from all over the world, including Britain's Prime
Minister Tony Blair, "The flourishing township enterprises in
China have contributed not only to the development of the rural
economy, but also to the improvement of Chinese farmers."

<HEADLINE> Coffee Harvest Drops Sharply in Hurricane-Hit Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Coffee output in southern
Costa Rican plantations, severely affected by Hurricane Mitch in
October, has fallen by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Coffee Institute president Guillermo Canet said
Tuesday that Mitch had damaged saplings, reducing the country's
targeted output of three million bags of coffee by 92,000 bags
(each bag weighing 60 kilograms).
</P>
<P>
He warned that losses could increase if the government fails to
repair roads and bridges soon to allow trucks to carry coffee to
the docks.
</P>
<P>
Coffee matures earlier in southern Costa Rica, compared with
the north of the country where most producers are gathered.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Mitch did not affect the country's banana crops as
they were mostly planted on the Caribbean coast which was left
intact by the hurricane.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian National Debts Mount $14.9 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's national debts reached
14.9 billion U.S. dollars by the end of September, amounting to
48.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in the
period.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Minister of Finance Igor Michukov in a
speech to the parliament Tuesday. According to the minister,
foreign debts stood at 10.9 billion dollars and internal debts at
3.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that there is a slim possibility for his
country to encounter a debt crisis in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
According to international standard, the minister said, the
amount of the current national debts does not come up to the level
of crisis.
</P>
<P>
He told the legislators that foreign debts increased 1.4
billion dollars, or 14.4 percent over the same period of last
year, which were mainly used to balance budget deficit and provide
export credit guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the repayment of foreign debts cost the government
1.2 billion dollars, according to Michukov.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the total foreign debts are expected to fall
to 37.2 percent of GDP by the end of this year, and debt repayment
for 1998 will cost 25.7 percent of the government's spending, a
figure close to the internationally recognized crisis level of 25
to 30 percent, Michukov said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has exported 7.3
million bags (60 kilograms each) of coffee in the July-October

<HEADLINE> Investment Inflow to Thailand On the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in
Thailand has been increasing in 1998 despite the influence of the
financial crisis, said the World Investment Report 1998, which is
available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is likely to get 5.9 billion U.S. dollars this year,
compared with 3.6 billion last year, the Report said.
</P>
<P>
Mergers and acquisitions would likely account for almost 2
billion dollars, or one-third of the direct investment, compared
with 1.5 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, an official from the Thai Foreign Ministry said that
it had yet to be decided whether the increase in foreign direct
investment in Thailand this year was new or capital from parent
companies to help local ailing subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Increase in foreign direct investment this year are most likely
to be in developed countries, as well as Latin America and Central
and Eastern Europe, and also involve international mergers and
acquisitions among companies, said the Report.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Asia accounted for 58 percent of the foreign direct
investment in developing countries, but this year the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development expects a slight drop.

<HEADLINE> China, Britain Have Their First Financial Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) - Chinese Financial Minister Xiang
Huaicheng held talks Tuesday with British Chancellor Gordon Brown
on the occasion of the first China-UK Financial Dialogue in London.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions ranged widely over both domestic
macroeconomic and microeconomic policies and international
economic and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
Both sides recognized the importance of China's contribution to
international financial stability via its positive, commendable
and responsible policy with regard to the RMB exchange rate and
agreed on the importance of an orderly and progressive approach to
capital account liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Xiang outlined the measures implemented throughout the course
of the year to stimulate China's economy and to ensure sustainable
growth.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated China's commitment to moving towards a
socialist market economy, particularly to restructuring both its
state-owned enterprises and its financial system.
</P>
<P>
Brown set out the action taken to build a stable economy
capable of sustained and steady growth in Britain.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the Pre-budget Report, a strategy to address
the fundamental structural weaknesses that had held back the
British economy in the past.
</P>
<P>
Both sides recognized how the two issues of enterprise and
financial sector reform were inter-related, and how recent
experience elsewhere in Asia highlighted the need for sound
financial and regulatory systems.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also noted the numerous bilateral schemes
aimed at assisting with the development of the financial services
infrastructure within China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to take forward the China-UK Financial
Dialogue in China within the next 18 months.

<P>
HARMANLI (Bulgaria), November 10 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian troops
held an exercise Tuesday aimed at rescuing refugees in case of a
regional crisis in Harmanli in south Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
As the first exercise of its kind in Bulgaria and the Balkans,
the troops also practiced training of setting up a refugee camp in
a neutral country closed to the area of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The operation was carried out under the command of Maj.
Vesselin Tsekovski of the Karlovo-based rapid reaction
forces. Tsekovski was the only Bulgarian officer who participated
in a NATO exercise in Spain last year as commander of a refugee
camp.
</P>
<P>
"The exercise practiced peacekeeping activities which are
untypical for the armed forces", Chief of the General Staff
Gen. Miho Mihov said after the exercise. "We should be ready for
extraordinary situations."
</P>
<P>
The exercise will be held again by the 22nd Harmanli regiment

<HEADLINE> Lettuce, Garlic Center in Northwestern Chinese Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Qaidam Basin on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is being turned into a major lettuce- and
garlic-growing center for Qinghai Province and the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
With its long periods of strong sunshine and differences in
temperatures from day to night, the Basin is especially good for
growing lettuce and garlic from July to September, when the
weather in southern parts of China is less suitable.
</P>
<P>
This year, one farm in the city of Golmud planted 600 mu (40
hectares) of lettuce and had a per-mu output of 2,500
kilograms. Most of the lettuce is sold to Hunan, Sichuan, and
Shaanxi provinces and brings in about 3,500 yuan (420
U.S. dollars) per mu.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, there are plans to plant 20,000 mu of lettuce and
garlic, and by 2010, to expand that to 80,000 mu, making the
province a leading lettuce and garlic producer for the
country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Families Now Better Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A recent study has shown that
90 percent of the families in Shanghai are living comfortable
lives and 98.8 percent have annual incomes above 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A similar 1990 study showed that 23.4 percent of the families
considered themselves comfortable, but only 5.6 percent reported
annual incomes above 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The standard of living in Shanghai has obviously improved since
1994, and by 1997 about 93 percent of the families are living at a
comfortable level.
</P>
<P>
There is also a widening gap between different income
groups. Low-income families have seen a relatively moderate rise
in incomes, while high-income families have doubled or even
tripled their incomes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the changes are a result of Shanghai's
economic and industrial restructuring of the past decade, with the
unified income structure of the planned economy broken up and the
country developing a more diverse income structure.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian and Albanian leaders
Tuesday pledged to work together to fight organized crime and
gangs engaged in illegal immigration across the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed following talks between Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema and his visiting Albanian counterpart
Pandeli Majko, Italian police would "advise and assist" Albanian
authorities in fighting organized crime, including smuggling of
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
With help from Italian gangs, Albanian illegal immigrants
arrive on an almost daily basis on the southeastern coast of
Italy, in the Puglia region.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said at a press conference that Italy also promised to
promote political, economic and cultural cooperation with Albania
and help the country forge closer ties with the European Union and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Italy also agreed to encourage Italian businesses to invest in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian prime minister said on the same occasion that the
purpose of the bilateral cooperation was to "create a hopeful
living environment and create more jobs in Albania."
</P>
<P>
The Italian electric utility Enel and its Albanian counterpart
Kesh also signed an agreement on Tuesday, under which Italy will
provide 6 billion lire (3.6 million U.S. dollars) to help cope
with the energy crisis in the Albanian capital of Tirana this
winter.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Football Association to File to FIFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will file an
appeal to the International Football Association (FIFA), unless
the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) cancels its life-long
suspension of Mursyid Effendi, Antara News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the All Indonesia Football Association (PSSI) Agum
Gumelar said here Tuesday he was very dissappointed with AFC's
decision last week to suspend Mursyid from domestic and
international soccer matches permanently.
</P>
<P>
"AFC has put an end to our player's career, which is not
human, and we therefore hope they review their decision. If AFC
refuses to change the suspension, we will file an appeal to world
football federation," Gumelar said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian defender Mursyid had scored a controversial own
goal in the Tiger Cup tournament in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam,
last August.
</P>
<P>
In the last Tiger Cup qualification rounds, Indonesia and
Thailand, who have secured a place in the semi-finals, did not
wish to win the game, so they played for a defeat to avoid the
Vietnamese team.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Football Association has punished PSSI by a fine of
20,000 U.S. dollars for playing "negative football".
</P>
<P>
This week, PSSI general secretary Nugraha Besoes will leave
Jakarta for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where AFC's headquarters is
located, for talks with AFC officials.
</P>
<P>
Gumelar argued that the punishment on Mursyid should not be
heavier than on a player involved in bribery or doping.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Beer Market Becoming Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China's beer producers are
gradually scaling down production to adjust to a market glut and
decreasing efficiency, according to a recent issue of China
Business Times.
</P>
<P>
China produced 9.7 million tons of beer in the first half of
this year, an increase of 5.88 percent from the same period last
year. This compares with a growth of 14.39 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A State Statistics Bureau study found that beer stockpiles are
increasing and that nearly half of the brewers are losing money.
</P>
<P>
And, as the market becomes saturated, competition gets fiercer,
with the market share of small brewers being taken by bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
In Hebei Province, for instance, 69 percent of the brewers
produced less beer than last year but the province's total output
had an annual increase of 15.4 percent, with a few brewers
increasing output by more than 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Italy: European Central Bank Must Be More Decentralized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Italy governor Antonio
Fazio said Tuesday that Europe's national central bank chiefs must
fight to retain significant influence over monetary policy when
the single currency is introduced next year.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page interview with the Financial Times, Fazio said
that the European Central Bank, which is set to take over monetary
policy from the national central banks, could be the scene of
power clashes between the 11 national governors and the six
members of the permanent executive who together form the ECB's
governing council.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Everything that can be decentralized must be
decentralized.
</P>
<P>
"This is the basic principle even of the Maastricht Treaty."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the national central banks, he
said, "It is important to remember that the credibility and
strength of the council derives from the credibility and strength
of the national central banks themselves."
</P>
<P>
Italy, whose economy is expected to grow by 1.5 percent this
year, lower than that of the other 11 single currency states,
would have to fight harder for a euro zone interest rate that
suits its needs.
</P>
<P>
Fazio has often warned that Italy is not sufficiently prepared
for the rigor that the economic and monetary union entails.
</P>
<P>
"We have bought time," he said. "The country is enjoying a
virtuous circle of declining interest rates and lower interest
payment on its debt. I hope structural adjustments can be made,
otherwise the circle will turn vicious."
</P>
<P>
Fazio disagreed with the interest rate cuts proposed by Germany
and France.
</P>
<P>
"It is one thing to reduce (interest rates) from seven percent
to five percent but to go from four percent to two percent would
have no significant effect on the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said it would be necessary to cut costs and introduce
flexibility into the labour market in order to boost economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
"We need more flexibility in both (public and private)
sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we are moving to what is effectively a hard money
standard, the failure to create more flexibility will lead to
reduced employment."
</P>
<P>
Refuting criticism of his tight monetary policies in the
lead-up to joining the euro, Fazio said, "I delivered the right
dose of hawkishness for Italy given the circumstances of our
past."

<HEADLINE> Northwestern Chinese Kazaks Ending Nomadic Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kazaks of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are leaving the nomadic life
they've led for over 2,000 years behind.
</P>
<P>
The Kazak ethnic group began its nomadic life in the Altay
Grassland, Junggar Basin, Tianshan Mountain, and Ili River areas
as early as 2,000 years ago. A kingdom set up by Kazaks north of
the Tianshan Mountains was called the "Moving Kingdom" in Chinese
histories.
</P>
<P>
One family couldn't get used to the new life when they first
moved to a village in Xinyuan County in the eastern valley of the
Ili River.
</P>
<P>
"My great grandfather lived on the Kunes grassland and I lived
a nomadic life on the grassland for more than 70 years," said
Tohuda Mishi.
</P>
<P>
But, natural disasters and a tough climate in the region's
pastureland affected their daily lives a great deal.
</P>
<P>
And now he's quite satisfied with his changed lifestyle. His
family raises around 300 sheep and nearly 40 cows, about six times
the number they kept in the past. They feed the cows and sheep
with hay they put in storage except on the grasslands in summer.
</P>
<P>
They sell 100 sheep annually and make 30,000-40,000 yuan
(3,600-4,800 U.S. dollars), said Tohuda, adding "Mine is just an
ordinary family."
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 10,000 Kazak households, 70 percent of the
total, with more than 60,000 people, have given up their nomadic
life since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Kazaks have tried their hand in other areas
like growing maize and cotton, transportation, restaurants, and
other businesses. And improvements in their lives has caused them
to pay more attention to telephones, automobiles and
information. Many have even visited Australia and New Zealand, or
other countries that used to be just a dream several years ago.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Four Prominent Figures Hold "National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian four prominent
national figures finally were able to meet on Tuesday, issuing a
united stance on President B.J. Habibie's administration and the
Armed Forces' role in politics.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed a "national dialogue", the meeting was held at the house
of Abdurrahman Wahid, chairman of the 40 million-strong Muslim
organization Nahdlatul Ulama, in south of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Other participants were Amien Rais, chairman of the National
Mandate Party, Megawati Soekarnoputri, who leads a popular faction
of the Indonesian Democratic Party, and Yogyakarta Governor Sri
Sultan Hamengkubuwono.
</P>
<P>
The four top political leaders agreed at the meeting that the
country should have had a legitimate new government three months
after a snap election, scheduled for next May, was held to replace
the current transitional government under Habibie.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of next year, Habibie should no longer be the
president," said Amien, reading out the results of the 30-minute
meeting which students had strived to organize since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The "national dialogue" was a much-anticipated affair, given
the high profile and political clout of the participants. Hundreds
of students camped outside the residence to make sure that it took
place.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders supported growing public calls for the
sociopolitical role of the Armed Forces to end "within six years".
</P>
<P>
Several quarters including some students have demanded the
revocation of the Armed Forces' socio-political role.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman said it would not be possible to bring the era of
military involvement in politics to a close overnight.
</P>
<P>
"Nahdlatul Ulama respects the Armed Forces dual function, but
the role is now an anachronism," he said.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders called for national unity consistent and
demanded the return of the people's sovereignty by maximizing the
role and function of elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
They called for a fair and just general election monitored by
an independent team to be held next year.

<HEADLINE> UN's FAO Helping Southwestern China Reduce Grain Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Using grain storage techniques
from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Sichuan
Province has cut grain losses by some 10 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
A traditional grain production base in southwest China, Sichuan
has an annual grain output of over 35 billion kg, 70 percent of
which is stored by farmers themselves. But, about two billion kg
of grain is lost annually because of problems with traditional
bamboo and wood storage methods.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Sichuan introduced FAO storage methods using brick
rooms and fumigants, effectively putting an end to grain lost to
pests and rot.
</P>
<P>
This technique has been used in more than 60 towns in Sichuan,
with 6,000 new storage rooms. Each room can hold 1,500-2,000 kg of
grain and save about 10 percent in losses.

MANAGUA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Five Central American
presidents Tuesday urged the international community to help
rebuild their countries which were shattered by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after a meeting in San Salvador,
the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and
Guatemala said their rescue capacity could not cope with the huge
damage in the region, where at least 11,000 were killed and
millions made homeless by the deadliest Atlantic storm in two
centuries.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
the Interamerican Development Bank and the Central American
Integration Bank to collaborate with countries in the region to
prepare a rescue and reconstruction program for Central America,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The five presidents called for an emergency group to coordinate
financial aid to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Central America also hopes that the international community
support will include free access to its markets for all our
exports products, to contribute to our economic rehabilitation and
to the creation of jobs," the statement said.

WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
approved two large loans totaling some 3.03 billion U.S. dollars
for Argentina.
</P>
<P>
First loan of 2.52525 billion dollars is provided as a Special
Structural Adjustment Loan. This project will support the
continued efforts of the Government of Argentina to transform its
economy and to protect the gains achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
This project's operations are preventative, aimed at mitigating
the deleterious effect of the current international financial
instability on the economy and protecting vulnerable groups. This
project will also help meet critical foreign exchange needs of the
Government and will allow it to remain focused on longer term
reform issues.
</P>
<P>
Another loan of 505.05 million dollars is earmarked as Special
Repurchase Facility Support Loan.
</P>
<P>
This project, in conjunction with the Special Structural
Adjustment Loan above, will strengthen the country's financial

<HEADLINE> NBA Union to Discuss Strategy Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The NBA union's
negotiating committee and several player representatives will
meet Wednesday to discuss strategy on how to present another
proposal to the owners.
</P>
<P>
The sides haven't met since last Friday after a 90-minute
meeting failed to produce any results.
</P>
<P>
"My guess is we'll hear something from the union after their
meeting Wednesday," NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said
today.
</P>
<P>
Union director Billy Hunter has spent the past several days
speaking with players and agents by telephone, an action to fend
off what commissioner David Stern did in the past few days. Stern
lifted the ban that prevented team personnel from discussing the
lockout with players, and encouraged team general managers and
coaches to persuade players to accept owners' proposal.
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Suns owner Jerry Colangelo reportedly has talked with
at least five players, but wouldn't comment on the discussions.
</P>
<P>
The season should have started on November 3, but now it will
not be possible to begin until mid-December at the earliest.
Stern has said a deal needs to be reached before mid-December,
otherwise the cancellation of the entire season would be possible.
</P>
<P>
The league and union are fighting over how to divide about 2
billion U.S. dollars in annual revenues. The players, who
received 57 percent last season, now want 60 percent, while the
league is offering only a 50-50 split.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu's Township Enterprises Grow Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Rural and township enterprises
in east China's Jiangsu Province have developed steadily this
year, official figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
The incremental value of these enterprises in Jiangsu surged
15.1 percent on a yearly basis in the first nine months this year,
with growth rates for sales revenue and gross profits even higher.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed this rapid growth to the fast expansion of
joint-stock and private companies.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu is one of China's economic powerhouses and a vanguard
of the country's market reforms. Its rural and township
enterprises, especially those in the southern region, are among
the most developed in China.

<HEADLINE> Sheffield Wednesday Chairman Attacks Italian Duo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Sheffield Wednesday chairman
Dave Richards said he will happily sell the club's two Italian
forwards for the good of the team.
</P>
<P>
He is bitter at having to pay Paolo Di Canio's wages while he
sits idly on the sidelines completing an 11-match ban for his
shove on referee Paul Alcock.
</P>
<P>
Fellow Italian Benito Carbone has also come in for criticism
from Richards for his contribution, although the chairman has
expressed relief that a bid for Pierre van Hooijdonk did not come
off.
</P>
<P>
Richards has revealed that Di Canio's enforced lay-off is
costing the club 119,000 in wages alone.
</P>
<P>
That is despite Wednesday apparently fining Di Canio 68,000 --
two lots of two weeks' wages for each incident.
</P>
<P>
The chairman believes Di Canio should have had to pay the
price -- with a record-breaking 250,000 fine by the FA -- and
just a three-match suspension.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the FA's disciplinary commission only gave the
28-year-old a 10,000 slap on the wrist with the 11 match ban.
</P>
<P>
Richards is angry that he club is paying the price and not the
player.
</P>
<P>
"It's about time we started telling the truth. The club are
still paying his wages and yet we cannot use his services," said
the frustrated Hillsborough chairman.
</P>
<P>
"We paid 4.75 million pounds for this striker who is ever so
talented and is a nice guy. But these guys have got to perform on
the pitch, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He admits he would not stand in boss Danny Wilson's way if he
decided to get rid of Di Canio, as well as Carbone.
</P>
<P>
"If he said Di Canio and Carbone have got to go, then they've
got to go.
</P>
<P>
"To me, as an individual and a supporter, I love to watch
them. But I think their contribution to the team is not
sufficient, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Female Football Agent Attacks PFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's only female football
agent Rachel Anderson attacked the Professional
Footballers'Association (PFA) as "dinosaurs".
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Tuesday, the female agent made
her comments when she began a legal battle against the PFA - the
players' union - for alleged sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old, from Westcliff in Essex, was invited to the
PFA annual awards ceremony in April by West Ham defender Julian
Dicks, because she is his agent.
</P>
<P>
But the PFA refused to let her attend, saying it was a "men
only" event.
</P>
<P>
The mother-of-two is claiming "exemplary damages" against the
PFA for alleged breach of the Sexual Discrimination Act and
"injury to feelings".
</P>
<P>
A private hearing, which will decide if Mrs Anderson has a
claim, took place at Central London County Court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-minute hearing was adjourned until a later date which
was not fixed.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards Mrs Anderson, who did not attend the hearing, said:
"I find the PFA's attitude more insulting to their sex than to
mine, it's not the common attitude of men in today's world - they
are truly dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
"They are out of their little minds. How can they say I
haven't got a case? If it was a private affair they would be
quite right to say they can invite who they like, but the mere
fact that I can't go because I'm a girl ... that's absurd."
</P>
<P>
Mrs Anderson has been a football agent for seven years and is
the only woman agent accredited by FIFA, the sport's world
governing body.
</P>
<P>
She also represents Everton midfielder Don Hutchison and the
Wimbeldon and Northern Ireland international Michael Hughes.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked outrage among some football officials and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
British Sports Minister Tony Banks and FA chief executive Gra
ham Kelly both boycotted the ceremony in support of her.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair also wrote a letter of
support which stated: "The government deplores discrimination."

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: Conflicts Block Solutions to Refugee Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Increasing Conflicts
were slowing down and often blocking solutions to refugees
problems, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Even when political settlements are reached and people
voluntarily return to their homes, the peace established can at
best be described as fragile," Sadako Ogata told the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"From our perspective, the increasingly blurred lines between
war and peace, and the necessity to reach out to victims of
forced displacement across those lines, make the protection of
refugees and returnees a more complex exercise than ever
before," she continued.
</P>
<P>
"Where peace efforts are insufficient, or ineffective, the
ability of humanitarian agencies to help refugees, returnees and
other victims of conflict is greatly diminished," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"My request to you is that when you discuss ongoing or
potential conflicts, you do not overlook the human displacement
factor, which is often an effect, but can also be a cause of
conflict," Ogata told the Council.

<HEADLINE> Davenport in Action Tuesday at Advanta Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Top-ranked Lindsay
Davenport of the United States begins her final tuneup for next
week's Chase Championships when she takes on fellow American
Kimberly Po tonight in second-round play at the Advanta
Championships indoor tennis event in Philadelphia, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Davenport has won a WTA Tour-leading six titles this year,
including a victory over Switzerland's Martina Hingis in the
U.S.Open final to win her first Grand Slam singles title.
</P>
<P>
She has reached the final of three of the last four
tournaments she has played, including a victory at the European
Championships in Zurich in her most recent event. A sore right
arm kept Davenport out of action until this week.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old, who lost to Hingis in a thrilling three-set
final here last year, leads the second-ranked Hingis by only 266
points in the rankings heading into the final two events of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Three first-round matches were completed in the day session,
with one upset. Elena Likhovtseva of Russia was leading eighth
seed Sandrine Testud of France 7-6 (7-2), 6-7 (4-7), 1-0 when
Testud retired with a right knee injury.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japan's Ai Sugiyama, fighting for a berth in next
week's Chase Championships, crushed Maria Alejandra Vento of Ve
nezuela 6-1, 6-2; and American qualifier Brie Rippner beat
Alexandra Fusai of France 7-6 (7-1), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Former top-ranked Steffi Graf of Germany is battling for a
berth in next week's season-ending event in New York.
</P>
<P>
In her first tournament following wrist surgery, Graf claimed
her 105th career singles title, and first as an unseeded players,
at the Sparkassen Cup in Leipzig. Her victory moved her up to
17th in the Chase Championship standings, as only the top 16
qualify.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who won this event in 1992 and 1995, will take on
American Mary Joe Fernandez on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Like Davenport, Hingis and Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna of
the Czech Republic are also coming back from injuries.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Hingis has won only four events this year,
none since early May. Hampered by an injured ankle, Hingis lost
not only her quarter-final match in Filderstadt, Germany, last
month, but her 80-week reign as the world's No.1 player came to
an end.
</P>
<P>
The third seed Novotna strained her lower back in Filderstadt
and has not competed since. She has won four titles this season
and is currently ranked third behind Hingis.
</P>
<P>
French Open winner Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain is seeded
fourth, followed by Monica Seles of the United States, Nathalie
Tauziat of France. The top four seeds received first-round byes.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Circulates "Serbs to Jasenovac" Photo at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Mission to
the United Nations Tuesday circulated a photo which the mission
said was taken at a basketball game in Croatia showing supporters
of a local team holding a banner reading: "Serbs to Jasenovac," a
World War II death camp in Croatia where thousands of Serbs were
killed.
</P>
<P>
A news release, which was issued together with the photo, said
the basketball game was played in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on
November 5 between "Cibona" of Zagreb and "Red Star" of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Josenovac "was the largest concentration camp outside the Third
Reich," the Nazi regime in Germany (1933-1945), and was "set up
and run by the 'Independent State of Croatia,' the most loyal ally
of Nazi Germany in World War II," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
"The poster is not only illustrative of the way in which the
local fans displayed support for their club, but also of the
environment in which the Serbs in Croatia live and to which the
refugee Serbs now living in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
many other European countries are expected to return," the news
release said.
</P>
<P>
The news release said that the banner was "tantamount to
(Maccabee) Basketball Club of Tel Aviv, for instance, being
'greeted' in a German sports arena with a poster reading 'Juden
nach Auschwitz'," which means "Jews to Auschwitz" in English.

<HEADLINE> Hamed Sets to Dump Warren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- British boxing star Prince
Naseem Hamed is set to dump his promoter Frank Warren and
negotiate his own fights in a revolutionary move which could net
him 50 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant 24-year-old WBO world featherweight champion
has come to the end of a 10-fight contract with Warren -- and his
brother Riath says he is now ready to make his own fight deals.
</P>
<P>
Should Naseem make a success of the venture, he will become
one of the richest fighters in history and would revolutionise
the sport, transferring control from the promoters to the
fighters and their managers.
</P>
<P>
"Naz is exercising his right to retain his worldwide rights
and control his own destiny," Riath said.
</P>
<P>
"We have four years experience in boxing management now and
Naz has 17 years' experience of promoters and managers.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever decisions we make will not be done on a whim. We
will be taking advice from lawyers and commercial experts, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 million people worldwide saw Hamed score a points
victory over British rival Wayne McCullough last weekend and the
fighter and his advisors believe the huge interest is not netting
the cash it should.
</P>
<P>
If he carries through the proposals, Hamed will hire top
promoters to deliver opponents, venues and ticket promotions, but
the fighter himself will control all financial aspects, rather
than the current situation where he receives a cut of the overall
purse.
</P>
<P>
Warren refused to comment on the proposals but said he had
received communication from Hamed's brother.
</P>
<P>
"Riath Hamed has asked me to meet with Naz when he returns
from holiday to discuss the future at which time I will decide
what I am going to do," he said.

<HEADLINE> FA Appoint 'Sleazebuster' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Football
Supporters' Association (FSA) was appointed as the Football
Association's new so-called 'sleazebuster' on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Graham Bean, a 37-year-old serving police officer and the
national chairman of the FSA for the past two years, takes up his
post as the FA's first compliance officer in January.
</P>
<P>
Bean's role will be to oversee issues of financial
irregularities, drug abuse, racism, violent play and general
misconduct within the game.
</P>
<P>
An FA statement said on Tuesday: "As compliance officer, he
will be responsible for investigating and, where appropriate,
prosecuting disciplinary cases and alleged breaches of the FA's
rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"He will also be responsible for developing best practice in
the game as a whole through the promotion of codes of conduct and
policies such as anti-discrimination and child protection, " the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In high-profile cases of alleged misconduct by players,
managers or clubs, Bean will investigate the evidence and then
recommend to FA chief executive Graham Kelly - who remains the
overall decision-maker on such issues - whether action should be
taken.
</P>
<P>
If a personal hearing is then requested before an FA
disciplinary committee, Bean will take on the role of prosecutor,
which does not currently exist.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the FSA said: "We welcome the establishment of
the post and hope that the compliance officer and hopefully in
time any future compliance unit will make a significant
contribution to tightening up regulation within the game,
particularly in relation to the financial affairs of individual
clubs."

<P>
LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Charlton challenged football's ruling body FIFA by refusing to
release Irish midfielder Mark Kinsella and Yugoslav goal-keeper
Sasa Ilic for next week's Group Eight European Championship tie in
 Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Under FIFA's five day regulation, international squads can be
assembled early, but Charlton claim that neither country has
complied with the regulation that they be given a written request
14 days before the match.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition, however, Republic of Ireland boss Mick
McCarthy is happy with his decision to invoke the ruling.
</P>
<P>
"I have spoken to managers such as Alan Curbishley (Charlton),
Peter Reid (Sunderland) and Ruud Gullit (Newcastle), while Spurs
assistant boss Chris Hughton has also been in touch," McCarthy
said.
</P>
<P>
"They have been fine about it. I think they all accept they
would do the same if they were in my position, " he added.
</P>
<P>
The match was originally scheduled for October 10 but was
postponed because of the threat of NATO bombardments of military
installations in the Belgrade area.

<P>
By the resolution, the General Assembly would request that
the year be a special occasion for giving impetus to microcredit
programs throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly would also ask all those involved in the

income-generating activities to be made available to an
increasing number of people.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Designates 2002 as Year of Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly on Tuesday proclaimed the year 2002 as the
International Year of Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by adopting without a vote, a draft
resolution recommended by the Economic and Social Council. China
is one of the sponsors of the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
By the terms of the text, introduced by the representative of
Kyrgyzstan, the General Assembly called on governments, national
and international organizations, non-governmental organizations
and the private sector to make voluntary contributions, in
accordance with the Economic and Social Council's guidelines for
international years and anniversaries, and to lend other forms
of support for the Year.
</P>
<P>
The representative of Nepal said the Year was a modest first
step towards environmental stability and poverty eradication,
which would contribute to sustainable development of mountain
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the representative of France also voiced a welcome
to the initiative, underlining the importance of the Alps to his
country and region.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) to serve as the lead agency for the Year, in collaboration
with governments, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) and other relevant organizations.
</P>
<P>
It further encouraged all governments, the United Nations
system and all other sectors to take advantage of the
International Year of Mountains to increase awareness of the
importance of sustainable mountain development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Make Mouse Grow Elephant Egg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from U.S.
Purdue University succeeded in producing elephant egg by
transplanting ovarian tissue from African elephants into lab
mouse, according to a report from the latest issue of Animal
Reproduction Science.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that this technique could someday be used to
help save some of the world's endangered species. They said that
the eggs could be fertilized and used to impregnate the
endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
Purdue researcher John Critser took ovarian tissue from
three freshly killed African elephants in South Africa. The
tissue was frozen, then thawed a year later and transplanted
into the lab mice which are commonly used in biomedical research
and bred not to reject foreign tissue.
</P>
<P>
Several of the mice developed egg-producing follicles and one
contained a mature egg though misshapen.
</P>
<P>
Critser said that the technique could also help cancer
patients to have baby after they beat the disease, by removing
their ovary tissue, freezing it and then returning it to their
bodies before undergoing fertility-destroying radiation and
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Other scientists said although it is a very important step,
it is clearly a long time to go to make an elephant out of
this.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Japan to Act on Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday again urged Japan to move quickly to carry out banking
reform, spur domestic growth and open its markets to help revive
economies throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a "town hall" meeting on trade, Clinton told
students and business executives that restoring growth to Japan
was critical to the entire Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"We will work on speeding the economic recovery in Asia,
strengthening the social safety net, helping companies there to
restructure their debt so they can emerge from the crushing
burdens they face," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president is scheduled to leave Washington on Saturday
to attend the November 17-18 summit of leaders from the 18-member
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of growth in Japan, which has been stalled now
for more than five years, is absolutely essential to the
restoration of growth in the remainder of Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The rest of us look to Japan to move quickly to implement the
good banking reforms which have been passed, to spur demand for
goods and services in the home market, to reduce unnecessary
regulation, and to open its markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton pointed out that the flow of money in capital markets
dwarfed underlying trade in goods and services and spoke of the
"challenge" of preserving trade in the event of a financial market
collapse.
</P>
<P>
"Today the financial markets, more than any other time, are
operating as an independent economic force," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars a day was changing hands in
international currency exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"That is many, many times the total value of goods and services
traded in any given day. And that is at the bottom of a lot of the
challenges we're facing today," he added.
</P>
<P>
"How do we continue to support the necessary free flow of
capital so that we can have the trade, the investment we need, and
avoid the enormous impact that a financial collapse can have when
the money being traded on its own is so much greater than the the
total value of goods and services being traded or investments
being made?" he asked.

LONDON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government Tuesday

<HEADLINE> World Bank Stresses Importance of Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign aid has been highly
successful in reducing poverty in countries with sound economic
management and strong government institutions, the World Bank
stressed in a new report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of countries that use foreign aid efficiently has
increased dramatically in the 1990s. However, aid from the wealthy
countries has fallen to its lowest point in more than 50 years,
according to the bank's report entitled "Assessing Aid: What
Works, What Doesn't And Why."
</P>
<P>
"Aid is more than just money; it is about ideas or knowledge
creation," said Joseph Stiglitz, senior vice president and the
chief economist of the World Bank who presented the report.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz said that with more developing countries moving to
sound policies and donors promoting reform and
institution-building in these nations, there never has been a
better time for giving aid.
</P>
<P>
"The bad news is that just as aid is poised to be its most
effective, the volume of aid is declining and is at its lowest
level" since the end of World War II, Stiglitz said. In the 1990s,
the report said, foreign aid has declined from 69 billion U.S.
dollars in 1991 to some 48 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
While the list of countries that can use aid effectively has
risen, foreign aid has fallen to only 0.22 percent of donor
countries' GDP in 1997, its smallest volume since it was first
institutionalized with the Marshall Plan in 1947. Taking into
account inflation, financial aid from rich countries to poor
countries is one-third lower today than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
At times, foreign aid has been a spectacular success, in South
Korea in the 1960s, Indonesia in the 1970s, Bolivia and Ghana in
the 1980s and Uganda and Vietnam in the 1990s, the report said.
But there also have been some failures in using aid.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign aid has thus been highly effective, totally
ineffective and everything in between," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that if yearly aid was increased by 10
billion dollars and the new money was targeted to poor countries
with sound economic policies, it would raise an extra 25 million
people out of poverty. However, the same 10 billion dollars in
aid, allocated across the board in the way aid is currently
distributed, would lift only 7 million people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Donor countries could do a better job of allocating aid,
focusing a larger amount on poor countries with sound policies,"
said David Dollar, the lead author of the report and a senior
research economist in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The report said such policies include open trade, secure
private property rights, the absence of corruption, respect for
the rule of law, social safety nets and sound macroeconomic and
financial policies.
</P>
<P>
The report found that in countries with these characteristics,
every dollar of foreign aid attracts 2 dollars of private
investment, because aid increases the confidence of the private
sector and helps to provide public services that investors need,
such as education and infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Studies Idea to Review Cuba Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
sees some merit in a proposal to review policy toward Cuba through
a national commission, a State Department spokesman James Rubin
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a group of 15 senators, backed by former U.S.
officials, wrote to President Bill Clinton proposing such a
commission carry out the first comprehensive review of Cuba policy
since 1959.
</P>
<P>
As one of the substantial responses from the administration,
Rubin told his daily briefing that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was studying the idea.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright sees some merit in that idea. But she has
not made a final decision and the president hasn't made a final
decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying the proposal. We need to consider several
issues, such as the composition and mandate of the commission,
whether in view of (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro's unwillingness to
undertake any reform," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"We are reviewing our options and studying the possibilities
that it could entail," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin also defended the old U.S. policy of trying to
isolate Cuba diplomatically and economically.
</P>
<P>
"We think our policy has been very effective. We think
increasingly around the world there has been a rejection of the
ways of Fidel Castro," he said.
</P>
<P>
The letter from the senators, led by Virginia Republican John
Warner, said more and more Americans were concerned about the
effects of Washington's Cuba policy on U.S. interests and on the
Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
The commission should include representatives of U.S.
interests, including the public health community, the military,
the churches, human rights groups, the business community and the
Cuban American community.

<HEADLINE> GA Debates Setting Up 2001-2010 Decade for Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly Tuesday began its consideration of establishing
2001-2010 the international decade for culture of peace and
non-violence for the children of the world.
</P>
<P>
Member states welcomed the proposal and voiced their support
for the move.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Chinese delegate Xie Bohua said peace
and development were indivisible. "Without peace and stability,
economic and social development would lose its basis. Without
economic and social development, peace and stability would be
difficult to sustain and consolidate."
</P>
<P>
"To realize peace and development, the international community
should establish a just and reasonable new international,
political and economic order based on the principles of the basis
of the Untied Nations Charter and the five principles of peaceful
coexistence," the delegate said.
</P>
<P>
He said a culture of peace was a process to be undertaken
individually, collectively and through institutional
transformation, and such a culture grew out of the beliefs and
actions of the people themselves and was developed in each country
within that nation's specific, historical, socio-cultural and
economic context.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China believed that the concept of the culture of
peace was not rigid. "To promote its realization, the
international community should pay full attention to the diversity
of the world and respect the different approaches and means
adopted by each country, according to its national conditions."

<HEADLINE> FDI May Reach Record High in 1998: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Global foreign direct
investment (FDI) may reach a record of 430-440 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, after rising 19 percent in 1997, the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This year's growth is projected despite slower world economic
growth and the crises in financial markets, UNCTAD said in its
annual world investment report.
</P>
<P>
FDI flows to developing countries amounted to 149 billion
dollars in 1997, accounting for 37 percent of the global total,
double the share at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial crisis, FDI inflows in Asia have remained
strong and outflows have been significant, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the impact of the crisis, the report predicted that
Asian and Pacific is to remain at the best at the same level of
1997 in FDI inflows.
</P>
<P>
The region attracted a total of 87 billion dollars of FDI, a
8.75 percent rise over 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of FDI inflows occurred in East and
Southeast Asia with China, including Hong Kong, sharing 48 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Latin America saw a 28 percent FDI inflow surge, the highest
among the developing world. Total FDI flows to the continent
amounted to 56 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Increases in FDI flows to the region accounted for two-thirds
of the overall rise in flows to all developing countries in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Brazil stood as number one FDI attractor for the region with an
inflow of 16.3 billion dollars for 1997 against 1.3 billion
dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Central and Eastern Europe saw a significant rise in FDI to a
record of 19 billion dollars in 1997. Russia accounted for one
third of the region's total FDI inflows.
</P>
<P>
FDI flows to Africa, excluding South Africa, captured only 3
percent of total flows to the developing world with a volume of
4.7 billion dollars, against 4.8 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
FDI flows to South Africa rose to 1.7 billion dollars in 1997
from 760 million dollars in 1996, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Car Industry Stays in High Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Despite signs of a slowdown in
new orders, Germany's automotive sector continued to speed along
in high gear in October, producing 583,200 vehicles, a 32 percent
increase over October 1997 levels, the industry said Tuesday in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The Automobile Industry Association (VDA) in Frankfurt
cautioned about a slowdown in new orders at home. These fell in
October by 10 percent, at the same time foreign orders rose by
four percent.
</P>
<P>
The VDA said Germany's carmakers were starting to live off the
robust order book volumes chalked up during this year, with
production remaining high despite a slackening seen in demand.
</P>
<P>
The October production figures included 546,600 private cars
and vans, up 33 percent from October 1997 levels, with commercial
vehicles output up 17 percent to 36,600, the VDA said.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the month came to 322,100 cars and vans, up 30 per
cent, while those of commercial vehicles were up 22 percent at
22,600.
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months, German carmakers produced 4.73 million
vehicles, or 13 percent over the volume for the same period last
year. Exports amounted to 2.8 million, up 14 percent in the
10-month period, the VDA said.
</P>
<P>
But new vehicle registrations in Germany - one measurement of
the strength of the domestic market - came to 3.4 million in the
first 10 months, up five percent. In the month of October, the new
registrations came to 355,500, up seven percent over October 1997.

member countries and 15 associate delegations from Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
With NATO'S 50th anniversary six months away, the four-day

</P>
<P>
The conclusions and recommendations arising from the report
will be submitted for consideration to NATO governments and
parliaments as the alliance prepares for the next stages of
enlargement and plans for the future, according conference
sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kosovo crisis, NATO's response and the
implications for the organization's future role in regional
peacekeeping are expected to be at the forefront of discussions.
</P>
<P>
Also, the ongoing revision of NATO'S strategic concept, the
document that will guide the alliance's policies and actions in
the coming years, the evolving relationship with Russia, and the
process of NATO enlargement, including the imminent entry of three
new members, are key issues of concern to the legislators,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
The assembly's five committees started discussions Tuesday, but
the annual session won't formally open until Friday, when keynote
speakers, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, North
Atlantic Assembly President William Roth and NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana will address the plenary session.
