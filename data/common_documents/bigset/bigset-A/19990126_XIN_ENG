<HEADLINE> China's Tax Refunds Are Not Subsidies: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the official said that after the
refund rate adjustments, which took effect on January 1 this
year, the average tax rebate rate for exporters reached 12.56
percent, still below China's value-added tax rate.
</P>
<P>
The adjustments were made on the principle of refunding as
much as the tax levied, the official explained.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant provisions of the World Trade
Organization, exemption of taxes or refunding taxes to exporters
cannot be regarded as government subsidy to exporters or
"subsidies in disguise," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said that the tax rebate adjustments
will serve to boost China's falling export growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking measures to prevent and crack down on
illegally tax refunds through the use of false export documents
created by joint collusion among customs official, taxation
bureaus and government bodies regulating foreign trades.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the export-tax refund rate has been
raised to 17 percent for electro-mechanical products including
electronics products, meters, transportation instruments, and
some machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The export-tax refund rate also has been raised to 13 percent
for agricultural machinery, textile fibers, porcelain, rolled
steel and cement.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural products now will have a five percent export-tax
refund rate, and the rate for raw chemicals, plastic products,
toys and products related to tourism is now 11 percent.

<HEADLINE> CAS Promises to Boost Hi-Tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's top scientific advisor
has promised to encourage application of results of knowledge
innovation in a bid to strengthen national power.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) would maintain a team of
elite to conduct basic research and hi-tech innovation while
pursuing its major goal of serving national economic and social
development, the CAS's president Lu Yongxiang said at the
academy's annual meeting, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 major hi-tech firms under the CAS created more
than 22.1 billion yuan ( 2.7 billion U.S. dollars) in total
incomes and about one billion yuan in profits last year.
</P>
<P>
Legend Group, the CAS's flagship, solely earned 16 billion
yuan from its computer-making sector in 1998, a rise of 28
percent over the 1997 figure.
</P>
<P>
Lu has revealed a series of favorable policies towards hi-tech
enterprises under the CAS, such as encouraging them to have
stocks listed.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the meeting pointed out that more hi-tech
products were in need to stimulate domestic consumption since the
market has remained to be over-supplied.
</P>
<P>
They also predicted a promising future for hi-tech firms in
export sector because the majority of exported products were
still labor-intensive.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Initial results from Lebanon's
first case of heart transplant show that the operation has been a
success so far, the Voice of the People radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The operation, which lasted for 10 hours, was carried out at
the Hammoud Hospital in the southern port city of Sidon last
Saturday, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors Mohammed Saab and Fayez Abu Jawdeh, who performed the
surgery, announced on Sunday that Abdullah Dora, the 37-year-old
patient, was in a stable condition.
</P>
<P>
The patient was under monitoring for a period of 48 hours
before the results were declared to the public.
</P>
<P>
Jawdeh said the heart came from an anonymous donor who had
recently been pronounced brain dead.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects of success for such operations in Lebanon are
high, however, the problem lies in the shortage of donors," he
added.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of four such operations performed in Israel,
Lebanon is the second country in the Middle East, which has seen a
successful heart transplant operation, said the radio report.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Kicks Off Another Phase of Island Reclamation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Monday kicked off
another phase of its most ambitious land reclamation project of
Jurong Island by signing a 1.3-billion-Singapore-dollars (788
million U.S. dollars) contract with a joint venture and holding a
symbolic offshore ceremony at the reclamation site.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Jurong Town Corporation Lim Neo Chian, on
behalf of the Singapore government, and chiefs of five foreign
contractors that form a joint venture, signed the largest single
reclamation contract ever awarded in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the joint venture will reclaim a total of
977 hectares of land within three years under the Phase 3B of the
Jurong Island Project by filling seabed between some original
islands.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has embarked on a 7-billion-Singapore-dollar (4.25
billion U.S. dollars) program to amalgamate the seven islands off
Jurong and develop them into an integrated world-class
petrochemical hub.
</P>
<P>
The seven original islands have a total mass of 991 hectares
and the first phase of land reclamation began in March 1995 with
an aim to link them by filling seabed and combine them into an
island named Jurong Island.
</P>
<P>
To date, A total of 650 hectares of land have been reclaimed
through Phases 1, 2 and 3A and Jurong Island has become home to 36
petroleum, petrochemical and chemical companies and 10 support
companies that together contribute some 25 percent of the
manufacturing output in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Phase 3B is projected to be completed at the end of 2001. With
its completion, Jurong Island will have a total land area of 2,650
hectares, about three times the total area of the original seven
islands, and can support up to five cracker plants and about 150
companies, providing employment to some 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Lim said at Monday's ceremony that the commencement of Phase 3B
marks a major milestone for Singapore and the reclamation work
will bring his country a step closer to realize the vision of
raising an island from the seas and developing it into a
world-class petroleum, chemical and petrochemical hub.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Attack Iraqi City of Basra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes patrolling
the no-fly zone in southern Iraq Monday fired missiles at the
southern city of Basra because of Iraq's "provocation," the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
"There were airstrikes in the south, in the vicinity of Basra
as a result of provocation," Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mike
Milord said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, U.S. warplanes airstruck at least two
residential areas in and around the city of Basra Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first attack occurred at 9:30 Iraqi time (0630GMT), which
immediately was followed a second airstrike at 10:10 (0710GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency said the second airstrike hit the village
of Abu al-Khaseeb near Basra -- "heavily populated areas."
</P>
<P>
A reporter from Fox News, a U.S. cable television network, said
he was in Basra and saw a house that was completely destroyed and
three others that were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Basra, 350 miles south of Baghdad, is part of the southern
no-fly zone that the United States and its allies set up after the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Humam Abdel-Khaliq, the Iraqi information minister, said the
incident would harden Iraq's resistance to American and British
patrols in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said American jets
fired at an Iraqi surface-to-air missile site and associated
air-defense systems north of Basra Monday "in response to Iraqi
incursions in the no-fly zone."
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Gunnery Sgt. Frank Leyhew said the U.S. fighters were
threatened by Iraqi ground artillery and four Iraqi MiGs.
</P>
<P>
Air Force and navy jets were involved and all returned safely
to their bases, Leyhew said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqi actions and intentions pose serious threats to our air
crews, and our actions today are an appropriate response to these
threats," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Aims for 6.5 Pct Rise in Tourists Arrivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) has set a goal of 8.23 million tourist arrivals for
this year, 6.5 percent higher than the 1998 target, Thai News
Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The TAT has also set tourism revenue at 309.7 billion baht (8.6
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
To promote tourism, the TAT has launched a campaign, the River
of Kings, as the main marketing theme that highlights the
country's heritage and culture which are linked to the Chao Phraya
River and its tributaries.
</P>
<P>
The TAT will promote water-related tourism destinations and
activities such as the floating markets, raft and canoe tours. The
highlight of the year will be the royal barge ceremony to
celebrate the 72nd birthday of His Majesty the King Bhumibol
Adulyadej.
</P>
<P>
"Under the 'River of Kings' theme, besides encouraging people
to care more about the environment to pay respect to His Majesty
the King, we are going to promote ways for people to return to the
Thai culture and lifestyle," Seree Wangpaichitr, the TAT governor,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The TAT will encourage residents of riverside communities to
clean up their surroundings and decorate their homes and
businesses to join the celebration.
</P>
<P>
The TAT will also continue to promote domestic tourism by
developing 189 destinations in 50 provinces. It expects 53.5
million domestic trips to generate 201 billion baht (5.58 billion
dollars) in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Last year Thailand attracted 7,790,639 foreign tourists and
reaped 272 billion baht (7.55 billion dollars) in tourist
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and South Korea, two of the Asian countries which
sought financial bailouts from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) in 1997, were the only two Asian countries that enjoyed an
increase in tourist arrivals last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourist arrivals in Thailand in 1998 were 7.8 percent
above target, despite economic woes in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Thailand floated the baht in July 1997, sparking the Asian
financial crisis. The weak baht, which has fallen from 26 baht to
the dollar in the pre-devaluation period to about 36 baht to the
greenback now, proved a major boom to the tourism industry last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday recommended extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) until July 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan urged
the Georgian and Abkhaz sides to engage in dialogue and expand
their contacts at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the stalled negotiations on the return of refugees
and displaced persons, Annan appealed to both sides to treat the
matter with the utmost urgency. "The issue of return is a strictly
humanitarian question, which should not be used as an instrument
to advance political causes," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Although the political process towards a settlement has been
slow, and at times blocked, the report said, the UNOMIG has been
able to carry out its mandate, thus lessening tensions, preventing
an exacerbation of potentially serious incidents and providing a
climate for substantive political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The mission's political and civil affairs and public
information capacity need to be strengthened, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An additional modest civil affairs capacity would allow the
UNOMIG to maintain better relations with the humanitarian agencies
and non-governmental organizations, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams Statements by Arab FM Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official on
Monday lashed out at the just-concluded Arab foreign ministers'
meeting, calling it "part of" a broader anti-Iraq scheme.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency, Information
Minister Hammam Abdul-Khaliq said the Cairo meeting was "changing
the game being played against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Instead of condemning the U.S.-British air strikes and
demanding a lifting of sanctions against Iraq, he said, the
meeting issued a silly statement, giving the two countries
green-light for more strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the one-day meeting on
Sunday, Arab foreign ministers called for joint Arab efforts to
work for the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It at the same time urged Baghdad to cooperate with
U.N. weapons inspectors, who were authorized to oversee Iraq's
disarmament of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes on Iraq for four
consecutive nights on December 16-19 with a declared aim of
punishing it for not cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation was enraged with the tone of the meeting,
and Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf walked out Sunday
night in protest.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis had looked to the meeting for support in condemning
the U.S.-British aggression against a sovereign Arab state, and in
breaking eight-year-old, crippling U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Khaliq was quoted by INA as saying that the U.S. and
British warplanes were continuing striking Iraqi targets in the
no-fly zones, imposed in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War in northern
and southern Iraq to protect Kurds and Shiite Muslims there.
</P>
<P>
He aid warplanes, caming from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
Monday morning, attacked at least two residential areas in and
around the southern city of Basra at about 9:30 a.m. (0630 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Many civilians were killed and injured, he said without
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that U.S. and Britain have hit
residential quarters since the mid-December air raids. Basra, 550
kilometers south of Baghdad, is part of the southern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes patrolling the zones have been firing missiles
regularly since the December bombardment at Iraqi air defense
positions in response to being locked onto by radar from the
military positions.
</P>
<P>
Another strike was reported by INA at 10:10 a.m. (0710 GMT), in
which it said the foreign jets targeted heavily populated Abu
al-Khaseeb village near Basra, the Basra airport and the North
Rumaila oil field.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has said that it did not recognize the restricted
zones, as they were imposed by the U.S. and its allies without
U.N. authorization and thus illegal.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Khaliq defended Iraq's sovereignty over its territory
against allegations that Iraq violated no-fly zones. "Do you think
that we violate our air space? Such a claim is ridiculous," he
said.

<HEADLINE> University of Chicago to Set Up Campus in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business Monday announced its plan to establish
a permanent campus in Singapore to teach an Asian international
executive M.B.A. program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony attended by Singapore Minister for
Education and Second Minister for Defense Teo Chee Hean and U.S.
Ambassador to Singapore Steven Green, the school's dean Robert
Hamada said the classes will begin mid-year 2000 and will be
taught by the same faculty who teach at the school's Chicago and
Barcelona campuses.
</P>
<P>
Hamada said the executive M.B.A. program is intended for middle
to upper level managers with at least 10 years of experience and
their ages are expected to range from the early 30's to about 50.
</P>
<P>
Enrollment will be limited to 80 business executives per year
drawn from throughout the region and most students will commute
from countries out of Singapore, Hamada said.
</P>
<P>
The program in Singapore will be taught in 16 one-week modules
spread over 19 months and this format was chosen to allow business
executives to continue working full time and travel from
throughout the Asia-Pacific region to attend classes for intense
periods of group study, Hamada elaborated.
</P>
<P>
The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business is the
fifth institution brought in by Singapore's Economic Development
Board under its initiative to attract 10 world-class educational
institutions to the island country.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Teo Chee Hean said the University of Chicago
has chosen the House of Tan Yeok Nee, an historical house within
the central business area, to locate its campus in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"With the influx of talent and knowledge that these
institutions bring, we will have much to gain from the resulting
enhanced intellectual and academic environment," Teo said.

Motawwakil and Governor of Kandahar Mulla Hasan, the Associated
Press of Pakistan quoted Afghan sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The details of the talks were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. withdrew its staff from Afghanistan after an Italian
U.N. soldier and two Afghan staff members were killed in street
protests last August following U.S. missile attacks on the eastern
Afghan town of Khost.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the U.N. staff had badly affected some 70,000
widows and orphans in Kabul alone.
</P>
<P>
Taliban authorities and the U.N. signed a "Security Agreement"
in Islamabad last October, listing several conditions for the
return of the U.N. staff to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for full security for the U.N. staff
working in Afghanistan and investigations into the killing of the
U.N. soldier and other employees in Kabul and the eastern town of
Jalalabad.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows Crackdown on Illicit Broadcasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Television and Radio
Service (FSTR) will move to stop illegitimate broadcasting of
foreign programs without licenses, Itar-Tass reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to FSTR chief Mikhail Seslavinsky, Russian
communications operators are providing unlicensed broadcasts for
the Voice of America, BBC, Deutsche Welle, International French
Radio of Russia from Paris, Radio Sweden, and Radio Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to Russian State Communications Committee
chairman Alexander Krupnov, Seslavinsky said that providing
unlicensed broadcasters with communications services is a breach
of the federal law on communications.
</P>
<P>
However, Seslavinsky told Tass that his appeal for proper
licensing of the broadcast services was not "an attempt to drive
these broadcasters from the territory of the country or from the
Russian air."
</P>
<P>
He said Radio Liberty had obtained the broadcasting license
last summer and that others should follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The foreign broadcasters are given a deadline of February for
licensing with the Russian authorities or face being barred from
the air, Tass said.

Yugoslavia will meet this week in London or Paris to coordinate
their stands on the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell you the date for this meeting, but I confirm to
you that it will be held this week," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is now
president of the contact group, is contacting his counterparts of
France, Russia, Germany, Italy and the United States on holding
the meeting as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The political directors of the foreign ministries or their

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Attack Iraqi Targets in Both No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes Monday
launched a new wave of attacks at Iraqi targets in both southern
and norther no-fly zones in Iraq in response to what the United
States called Iraqi's "provocation," U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
"There were airstrikes in the south, in the vicinity of Basra
as a result of provocation," Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mike
Milord said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, U.S. warplanes airstruck at least two
residential areas in and around the city of Basra Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first attack occurred at 9:30 a.m. Iraqi time (0630 GMT),
which immediately was followed a second airstrike at 10:10
a.m. (0710 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency said the second airstrike hit the village
of Abu al-Khaseeb near Basra -- "heavily populated areas."
</P>
<P>
A reporter from Fox News, a U.S. cable television network, said
he was in Basra and saw a house that was completely destroyed and
three others that were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Basra, 350 miles south of Baghdad, is part of the southern
no-fly zone that the United States and its allies set up after
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Humam Abdel-Khaliq, the Iraqi information minister, said the
incident would harden Iraq's resistance to American and British
patrols in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said American jets
fired at an Iraqi surface-to-air missile site and associated
air-defense systems north of Basra Monday "in response to Iraqi
incursions in the no-fly zone."
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Gunnery Sgt. Frank Leyhew said the U.S. fighters
were threatened by Iraqi ground artillery and four Iraqi MiGs.
</P>
<P>
Air Force and navy jets were involved and all returned safely
to their bases, Leyhew said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqi actions and intentions pose serious threats to our air
crews, and our actions today are an appropriate response to
these threats," he added.
</P>
<P>
Several hours later Monday, a spokesman for Operation Northern
Watch based at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, said that U.S. aircraft
patrolling the northern no-fly zone in Iraq were targeted and
fired upon by at least one Iraqi surface-to-air missile and by
anti-aircraft artillery near the city of Mosul.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Jane Rinell said that an Air Force F-15E strike
aircraft encountered anti-aircraft artillery fire, and two other
F-15E fighters dropped one laser-guided bomb each on the air
defense system.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident near Mosul, a Marine Corps EA-6B
electronic warfare plane fired a missile at an Iraqi SA-2
surface-to air missile installation that "posed a threat" to U.S.
and alled aircraft, Rinell said. Afterward, an Air Force F-16CJ
plane attacked a different SA-2 surface-to-air missile site that
also was deemed to pose a threat, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
In all of Monday's incidents the American airplanes returned
safely to their bases, officials said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Visits International Committee of Red Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan visited Monday the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) during his four-day stay in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made at the ICRC headquarters, Annan said that
the ICRC and the United Nations are good and effective partners.
"Our common aim is to prevent and ease the suffering caused by
war," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian work carried out by the ICRC and the United
Nations has some under unprecedented stress in recent years," he
told ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1999 brings us several timely opportunities to
reflect on the challenges we face," he said. "We will mark the
50th anniversary of the the Geneva Conventions and the 100th
anniversary of the Hague Conventions."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Rome Statute for the International
Criminal Court was adopted last year in the midst of the
world-wide commemoration of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the Genocide Convention.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of implementation.
</P>
<P>
"That gap between policy and practice, between laws on the
books and facts on the ground, between what is said and what is
done, is something that plagues us across the spectrum of our
agenda, whether we are talking about development or disarmament,
the environment, literacy or the fight against disease," the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
After concluding an official visit to Ireland, Annan arrived in
Geneva on January 23, where he will stay until January 26.

<HEADLINE> Council on Foreign Relations Establishes Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Council on Foreign
Relations announced here Monday that it is establishing an
independent commission on future international financial
architecture in an effort to help deal with the world financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Peter Peterson and Carla Hills, co-chairmen of the commission
said in a news release that the council's move is a response to
the call from U.S. President Bill Clinton and other leaders in the
world to tackle the continuing global economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the council last September, Clinton said the
present situation was "the biggest financial challenge facing the
world in a half century." He called on the council to use its
resources to help deal with this problem.
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen said, "Our aim is to bring a highly diverse and
experienced group to basic agreement on a strategy for stabilizing
the world economy and promoting growth, and then to present a plan
for putting that strategy into action."
</P>
<P>
The 29-member group includes not only economists, bankers and
other financial experts, but also manufactures, labor leaders,
political scientists, strategists and regional specialists. "This
is one of the most important and potent groups ever put together
by the council to tackle an international problem," said Council
President Leslie Gelb.
</P>
<P>
The commission will review the substantial research done and
proposals made in this area. It will issue a report this summer on
whether the international financial architecture should be changed
and if so, how to make a change.
</P>
<P>
Peterson is chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations and
also of the Blackstone Group. He was secretary of commerce during
the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
Hills is a council director and chairman and CEO of Hills &AMP;
Company. He was U.S. trade representative during the Bush
administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian lawmaker
Monday condemned U.S. air raids on the Iraqi city of Basra as
"utterly inadmissible and unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"Today's air strikes by Americans at blocks of flats in the
city of Basra, as a result of which, according to preliminary
data, civilians, including women and children, were killed, are
utterly inadmissible and unacceptable in the civilized world at
the end of the 20th century when a great amount of mechanisms have
been worked out to achieve mutually acceptable understandings
without the use of military force," Deputy Speaker Mikhail
Gutseriev of the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, said.
</P>
<P>
Gutseriev is in charge of Middle East affairs at the State
Duma.
</P>
<P>
He said the raids in Iraq would aggravate the already
"explosive" state of affairs in the region, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to take measures to prevent further such
actions. This is out stand, and we abided by it earlier and abide
now," he said, adding that he would express the opinion to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is on an official visit
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Gutseriev urged the United States and Britain to heed the
opinions of other members of the international community "when
tackling such questions connected with the use of military force
against sovereign states."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Delegation on Assessment Mission to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian delegation left
here Monday for Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, to assess the
situation in that country where a Nigerian-led regional
peace-keeping force is battling against the rebel troops.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of Defense Staff, Air Marshal Al Amin Daggash, led
the delegation which also includes Foreign Minister Ignatius
Olisemeka as well as Sierra Leone's Ambassador to Nigeria, Joe
Blel.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the delegation would be briefed by military
commanders as part of efforts to appraise the situation in the
tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
After a fortnight of fierce fighting, the 15,000-strong
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG has successfully flushed out
the rebels from Freetown, but the rebels are reportedly still
active in the hilly areas near the town.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United Nations special envoy to Sierra Leone,
Francis Okelo, visited Nigeria to brief the Nigerian foreign
minister on the situation in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the visit, the two issued a statement which
called for international aid to enable the deployment of more
peace-keepers from west African countries.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Air Marshal Daggash has refused the
demand by some groups in Nigeria that its troops should be pulled
out immediately because of the harsh economic situation facing the
oil-producing country as a result of sustained low oil price.
</P>
<P>
The chief of defense staff said at the weekend that Nigeria
could not ignore the crisis within the sub-region because of the
possibility of spill- over in the country as well as the
imperative for Nigeria to play the big brother.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Panel on Rwanda Genocide Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The inaugural session of
the International Panel of Eminent Personalties (IPEP) to
investigate the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the surrounding events
was formally opened at the United Nations Conference Center here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The inauguration of the panel today is important because it is
the first time that such a panel has been set up to investigate a
genocide," Ketumile Masire, former president of Botswana and
Chairman of the IPEP, said in his opening remarks.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the search for the truth is an important
step toward reconciliation, harmony, peace and sustainable
security in Rwanda, the Great Lake region and many African
countries."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his appeal to all African governments and peoples
as well as to the international community for assistance and
support for the newly established panel.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), said in his address at the opening ceremony
that the establishment of the panel has attracted considerable
interest and attention within and outside Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the main objective of the panel is to draw
lessons from the events related to the tragedy in Rwanda, with a
view to preventing such an occurrence in future."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that "the investigation by the panel should also be
considered as a momentum in our efforts at preventing conflict
situations in the continent."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said in his remarks at
the same function that "Africa was bound to repeat the tragedy if
it failed to draw the proper lessons from that horrendous man-made
calamity."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that "finding the truth behind the genocide in Rwanda
would contribute toward enhancing Africa's and OAU's capacity to
prevent the widening of the conflict situation in the Great Lake
region."
</P>
<P>
Half a million people in Rwanda were reportedly killed between
April and June 1994. The establishment of the IPEP follows the
proposal made by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles in November 1997
to the Seventh Ordinary Session of the Central Organ of the OAU
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution at
Ministerial Level.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was then submitted to various organs of the OAU by
Salim, and was subsequently endorsed by the 67th Ordinary Session
of the OAU Council of Ministers in Addis Ababa in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly of Heads of State and Government, at its 34th
ordinary session held in Ouagadougou in June 1998 endorsed the
appointment of six eminent personalities as its members.
</P>
<P>
The six members are: former president of Botswana Ketumile
Masire, former Head of State of Mali Amadou Toumani Toure,
Chairperson of the Swedish Committee for the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Lisbet Palme, Canadian Permanent
Representative to the U.N. Stephen Lewis, former Liberian
government minister and Director of Regional Bureau for Africa of
the U. N. Development Program (UNDP) Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, and
former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India and
Vice-Chairman of U.N. Human Rights Committee P.N. Bhagwati.
</P>
<P>
The panel has established its Secretariat in Addis Ababa after
its preparatory meeting last October.

<HEADLINE> Birth Rate Falls in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Birth rate in areas under the
control of the Cypriot government fell to 14.2 per thousand in
1997 from 14.9 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The latest demographic data released by the official
Department of Statistics and Research said that 9,275 children
were born in 1997, compared with 9,638 a year earlier, the Cyprus
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total population in Cyprus is estimated at 746,000 at the
end of 1997, with 658,000 living in the government-dominated south
and 88,000 in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared an independent republic
in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, the ethnic composition was estimated that
84.1 percent was Greek Cypriots and 11.8 percent Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of children, aged below 15, dropped to 24.2
percent in 1997 from 25 percent in 1996, while the elderly of 65
and above rose to 11.2 percent from 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy was 75 years for males and 80 for females while
infant mortality fell to eight per thousand, according to the
statistics.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- An African regional capacity
building meeting on tackling information needs for the education
agenda opened in Harare Monday with a call to provide more
information on the state of education.
</P>
<P>
Opening the week-long meeting, Zimbabwe's Education, Sports and
Culture Minister Gabriel Machinga said that statistical
information is important for purposes of evaluation and monitoring
the performance of education systems on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said information is also necessary to enable the formulation
of effective policies.
</P>
<P>
"Reliable, timely and relevant information is a strategic tool
for resources management and improvement of the efficiency of the
education systems themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting seeks to identify information needs for the African
 Education Agenda and assess problems as well as offering some
solutions.
</P>
<P>
With just less a year before 2000, Harare's meeting has the
task of reviewing preparations for the Education for All (EFA2000)
program.
</P>
<P>
Most of African countries, faced with declining economic
performance and rising poverty levels, have seen achievements made
in education development being eroded, dimming hopes of the
EFA2000, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
About 80 participants from African ministries of education and
international agencies attended the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations search
team Monday reached the site of a second U.N. aircraft crash in
central Angola, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team arrived at the site after their departure from
Bailunduo, a stronghold of the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), he said.
</P>
<P>
The team, which consists of 25 members, is expected to be back
in Bailunduo at the end of Monday, he said, adding that the U.N.
headquarters here is waiting for further information from the team
as to what they might have seen at the site.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give the specific location of the site,
neither did the Angolan warring sides at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-chartered cargo plane was shot down shortly after its
takeoff from a central Angolan airport, with nine people on board,
on January 2, eight days after the first crash on December 26.

<HEADLINE> Senior Aide: Azerbaijan to Host NATO Military Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A top aide to Azeri President
Heidar Aliyev has said that his country is ready to host U.S. or
NATO military bases on its territory, Interfax reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vafa Gulizade, foreign policy aide to Aliyev, said, "The U.S.,
NATO or Turkey should set up bases in Azerbaijan to guarantee its
security."
</P>
<P>
The pronouncement prompted strong condemnation from Russia,
which has all along opposed the eastward enlargement of NATO.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released last Friday, the Russian Foreign
Ministry said such statements by "some Azerbaijani officials" were
attempts "to make the public accept the need to change the
historical geopolitical balance of strength in the Caucasus, the
creation of new division lines and to worsen Azerbaijan's
relations with Russia."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, such exercises do not stem from concern about peace
and stability in the region or from the desire to promote regional
cooperation and secure a lasting solution to existing conflicts,"
the document said.
</P>
<P>
"Bearing in mind that these exotic speculations do not reflect
Azerbaijan's official position, Russia, nonetheless, hopes that
its statements will be properly assessed and responded to," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Sustained Development in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
 Commission for Africa (ECA) Monday called on African governments
to "integrate population, environment, and agriculture concerns
into national development plans and poverty alleviation
frameworks" to ensure sustained development.
</P>
<P>
Opening the five-day first meeting of the Committee on
Sustainable Development at the United Nations Conference Center
here, ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako said that in sub-Saharan
Africa "between 1986 and 1997, while the population grew by over
35 percent, food production per capita declined by about eight
percent, and agricultural land per capita decreased by about 25
percent."
</P>
<P>
"Today, more than three-quarters of countries in sub-Saharan
Africa produce less food than they did in the 1980s," he said,
warning that "reversal of these trends constitutes a major
challenge."
</P>
<P>
Amoako urged African countries to "grips with the mutually
reinforcing forces of high population growth, environmental
degradation, low agricultural productivity, low economic growth,
and growing poverty in Africa."
</P>
<P>
"These are the key issues in defining a sustainable development
strategy, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "sustainable development in Africa requires
advancements on several fronts: harmonization of population growth
with the level of food production; sustained increase in
agricultural productivity; better stewardship of the environment;
better and equitable use of water; and utilization of science and
technology as the foundation for productivity increases and
international competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, which is organized by ECA's Food Security
and Sustainable Development Division, will discuss such topics as
population and development strategy, agriculture-environment
inter-linkages, implementation of plans of action in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Sustainable Development is one of ECA's inter-
governmental machinery. It was established to serve as a forum of
experts to provide advice and to help ensure focus and relevant of
ECA's work program in the inter-linked areas of food security,
population and environment, according to Amoako.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Two political parties in Nigeria,
the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and the All People's Party (APP)
have decided to go ahead with their controversial working
alliance.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to state chairmen of the two parties, AD
Chairman Mahmud Waziri and his APP counterpart Ayo Adebanjo said
that they have agreed to present joint candidates in all the
federal constituencies for the February 20 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter which provides guidelines for the
selection of joint candidates, a joint executive committee would
be established for this purpose in each of the 36 states as well
as the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The selection would be done by consensus while the list of all
candidates should reach the secretariat of the alliance working
committee by January 29, said the letter.
</P>
<P>
The two parties last week announced their plan to field joint
candidates in the legislative as well as the presidential
elections, but the move has received strong opposition from the
leading People's Democratic Party, which said the alliance is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
The Independent National Electoral Commission has earlier ruled
out of joint candidacy by any parties, but it has yet to make a
final decision.

HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- African countries should
formulate relevant policies to protect environment, Zimbabwean
Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Moyo said in capital Harare
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A better understanding of linkages between the economy and the
environment would be realized through such policies, Moyo said
when opening a four-day Commonwealth African Region workshop on
integrating economic and environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
"In many of our countries, environmental degradation is
imposing high costs on economic development and some economic
policies are also hurting the environment," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Markets for environmental goods and services were often not
there, Moyo said, adding that as a result some environmental
values were not taken into account in marketing.
</P>
<P>
"The evolution of market economies unsupported by environmental
policies and regulations is one of the reasons hurting our
environment," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was attended by representatives from 13
Commonwealth countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel in Secret Talks Over South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai disclosed Monday that Israel is holding "secret
talks" over its occupation of south Lebanon, which was confirmed
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later.
</P>
<P>
"Some type of negotiation is being conducted," Mordechai said
during a tour to northern Israel hours before leaving his post.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the negotiations will result in achievements,"
he added, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu later confirmed what he termed as "intensive
contacts" over south Lebanon, stressing that the talks took place
under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear whether Israel is holding talks with
Lebanon, or Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, or a third
party.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai was sacked Saturday night by Netanyahu over his
alleged disloyalty to the ruling Likud party. He will officially
join the centrist party later Monday, which was formed by ex-Army
chief Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, former finance minister Dan Meridor and
former Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo.
</P>
<P>
As a moderate minister in the right-wing government, Mordechai
has succeeded in the last two-and-half years in preventing several
possible military escalations with Lebanon or Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks. It is also occupying
the Golan Heights which it captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East War.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said his guiding principle for the Israeli army and
the whole defense system has been to avoid wars and to strengthen
the foundation for peace.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who is expected to run for the premiership as head of
the new centrist party in the May elections, said one of the main
efforts of the next government should be opening a direct dialog
with Syria over the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Syria and Lebanon rejected an Israeli withdrawal
proposal, saying Israel should unconditionally pull out its troops
from south Lebanon in line with relevant U.N. resolutions instead
of following negotiated security guarantee from Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which broke up its peace talks with Israel in 1996,
wants to use the south Lebanon issue as a leverage to force Israel
to resume the talks over the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
After Israel signed a new interim peace agreement with the
Palestinians last October, reports said that Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad has sent messages through indirect channels to
Netanyahu, expressing his willingness to reopen the talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu confirmed the reports, but Assad denied them.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Development of Pan-European Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany said here Monday that
the central task for Germany's presidency of the Council of the
European Union will be to prepare the union's structures and
procedures to develop from a western European into a pan-European
union and also a union capable of acting on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU foreign ministers met here for their one-day EU
General Affairs Council meeting. In a statement in the council's
public debate on the presidency's program, German Federal Minister
Joschka Fischer, who is the current president of the council, said
the start of the German presidency comes at a historic time for
Europe, when the integration process has moved up a gear while it
is as yet impossible to assess the far-reaching importance that
the introduction of the euro will have for Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We must now make a concerted effort to take advantage of the
opportunities arising from that step. We must strengthen the EU's
political ability to act and gear its internal constitutional
arrangements to the new tasks. Enlarged political union bringing
in new member states must from now on be our lodestar, being the
strategic consequence of economic and monetary union," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the German presidency has set four priorities for
its six-month rotating term, mainly the Agenda 2000 negotiations,
an effective employment policy, EU enlargement and the EU's
ability to act in the foreign policy sphere.
</P>
<P>
He called on his colleagues from all member states to complete
the Agenda 2000 negotiations in time for a special European
Council meeting to be held in Brussels from March 24 to 25.
</P>
<P>
"Solutions need to be found for a more effective structural
policy, a thorough overhaul of the common agricultural policy and
a more equitable financial framework," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ahead of us lie tough negotiations in which we rely on the
support and willingness to compromise of all member states in
order to arrive at a balanced solution," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He also said that during the six-month period the European
Council will, at its Cologne meeting, adopt an employment pact
reflecting an active labor-market policy and taking to a more
preventive approach than before, while maintaining national
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the eastward enlargement, Fischer said the EU
needs both a strategic vision and a great deal of practical
realism. "The applicants have to get themselves into shape for
membership, while the union's structures also need to be adjusted,
meaning above all the adoption of Agenda 2000 and the tackling of
institutional reforms." But the president said it is too early at
present to set a date of accession for those central and eastern
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Fischer also urged member states to strengthen the EU's ability
to act in the foreign policy scope. "Past events, as well as
current developments, show that the EU still has a long way to go
towards a common foreign and security policy. We need tangible
progress in order to be able to deal with crises," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the achievement of a common foreign and security
policy involves a European security and defense identity. "This is
particularly true in the light of the latest developments in the
direction of greater unilateralism in international politics.
During our twin presidency of the EU and WEU (Western European
Union) we shall strive to use the new momentum and to progress in
that task," he said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, he acknowledged that the EU has major deficits now in
the areas of political integration and democracy. "How can we make
progress here? Following Maastricht and Amsterdam, the question of
a European constitution is going to arise far more pressingly than
in the past," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Opens "One Stop Internet Shop for Business" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union's executive body, said here Monday that it has
created a One Stop Internet Shop (OSIS) for Business on the
internet with a new website of http://europa.eu.int/business.
</P>
<P>
EU Single Market commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement
that the OSIS aims to give business better and easier access to
information and advice on single market rules and opportunities.
"We also expect the internet shop to provide us with valuable
feedback from business on the problems companies encounter in the
single market, which will help us to improve the single market
framework further."
</P>
<P>
The commission also said the most important added value of the
new website is to offer direct access to those parts of existing
sources of information and advice which are most relevant to
companies operating in the single market.
</P>
<P>
While showing how to surf in the shop, a commission's expert
said that by simply "bookmarking" the OSIS, companies and
individuals can obtain a fast track to the information and sources
of advice most relevant to them without having to sort through the
wealth of data available on the World Wide Web. This access is
likely to be of particular value to small and medium-sized
companies which may lack the resources to track down such
information on their own.
</P>
<P>
The one stop shop also offers direct access to over 230 Euro
Info Centers (EICs), the commission's largest business advice
network, while giving free, direct access to public procurement
tender notices published on the EU's Tenders Electronic Daily data
base and to Contract Points for Citizens and Business in member
states' administrations for resolving single market problems, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive also said the One Stop Internet Shop,
available in the 11 languages of the 15 EU nations, is part of its
Dialogue with Citizens and Business set up under a EU's Single
Market Action Plan.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Delays Law Aimed at Nuclear Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder delayed Monday planned cabinet approval of a law aimed
at closing nuclear power stations after a meeting with energy
industry executives.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder decided to postpone legislation, which was to have
been approved by his cabinet Wednesday, government spokesman
Uwe-Carsten Heye told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's government with the Greens was elected last year
pledging to close Germany's all 19 nuclear stations which produce
more than 30 percent of Germany's electricity.
</P>
<P>
Fearing multi-billion dollar lawsuits, Schroeder has promised
nuclear stations will only be closed in consensus with German
power companies. This could mean existing plants would be allowed
to operate until the end of their normal lives of 30 to 40 years,
according to observers here.
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder has so far refused to name any timetable for
plant closures.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally arguments of the (nuclear) industry must be
studied," said Heye, adding that the government was not interested
in any solution which would cost taxpayers a great deal of money.
</P>
<P>
The German Greens Party wants a much faster closure but as the
junior coalition partner it lacks the influence to force
Schroeder's hand.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Green Party Environment Minister Juergen
Trittin attacked the delay as a "grave" breach of the coalition
pact between Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons for this move must be revealed," Trittin's
spokesman Michael Schroeren said, adding, however, that the
100-day old coalition was not in any danger of a break-up.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting with Schroeder were chief executives from
German energy giants RWE, Veba, Viag and Energie
Baden-Wuerttemberg.

ATHENS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the northern Greek
city of Thessaloniki Monday protested against the European Union
(EU) farm polices by camping out in front of the Agricultural
Bank's central offices.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are demanding a higher production ceiling for cotton
crops and government intervention in Brussels to prevent what they
claim will be a 30 percent reduction in cereal crop prices this
year if the EU does not alter its regulations.
</P>
<P>
In statements, the two federations of farmers in Thessaloniki
prefecture described their action as "a message" for Greece's
Agriculture Minister George Anomeritis to immediately meet their
demands, saying that the farmers' response would be harsh if their
demands were not met.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Greek farmers blocked roads with hundreds of tractors,
causing unprecedented chaos around the country.
</P>
<P>
They demanded cheaper fuel and higher prices for their
products.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republicans Reject Effort to End Trial Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- With U.S. President Bill
Clinton's Senate impeachment trial at a crossroads, Republicans
and Democrats met separately Monday to decide whether to seek a
swift end to the proceedings without a partisan struggle over
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Democrats backed a proposal for final votes on the articles of
impeachment Friday, with no chance of witnesses. But Republicans
"summarily rejected" the idea during a closed-door meeting,
according to John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Senate Majority Leader Don Nickles said of the plan
supported by the Democrats, "I'm sure that there would be an
objection if it precludes witnesses, and it does."
</P>
<P>
The meetings came as House prosecutors held a private meeting
of their own to draw up a list of witnesses they'd like to
testify, former White House intern Monica Lewinsky among them.
</P>
<P>
One Republican senator, Gordon Smith of Oregon, indicated a
vote on calling witnesses may fail, even though the Republican
Party holds a 55-45 majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of my colleagues who will not likely vote
for witnesses," Smith said on CNN. "I think there is reason to
wonder whether or not the votes are there."
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky met with the prosecutors at a Washington hotel Sunday,
and her attorney said afterward she had provided no information
not previously given Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
The Senate was scheduled to debate two rival motions beginning
Monday -- one sought by Democrats to dismiss the charges, the
other sought by the House prosecutors to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
He is the first president in the U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to
convict Clinton and remove him from office, which most still
consider to be unlikely.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- MOzambique approved 50 projects
of some 60 million U.S. Dollars invested by the Portuguese in
1998, according to the data released Monday by the Mozambican
Center for Promotion of Investment (CPI).
</P>
<P>
The projects will create 7,562 jobs for the Mozambicans, said
the CPI.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the CPI said that the Portuguese investments have
entered almost all sectors of the Mozambican economy because of
the advantage of the common language and the help from the
Maputo-based Investment, Commercial and Tourism of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Portugal is second to South Africa
among the 10 major investors.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to the end of 1998, Portugal has directly invested
some 169 million Dollars into 225 projects in the poor southern
African country while South Africa's investment of some 180
projects amounted to 762 million Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia Imposes Duty on Crude Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government Monday
imposed export tariffs for crude oil, the government's information
department said.
</P>
<P>
The export duty will be 2.5 euro per ton for crude oil sold at
a price of 9.5 U.S. dollars to 12 dollars a barrel, and five euro
for oil sold at a price above 12 dollars, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
If the oil price falls below 9.5 dollars a barrel, no export
duty will be charged.
</P>
<P>
Customs authorities will start to charge the duties seven days
after the official publication of the government resolution, Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Fuel and Energy, though against export duties
on crude exports, expressed satisfaction with the final rates. As
a result of the ministry's pressure, the duty was cut from 10 euro
to 2.5 euro.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies, however, are still against the export tariffs,
saying the introduction of even temporary export duties in the
midst of a financial crisis would impact adversely on oil
companies' performance.
</P>
<P>
LUKoil Vice-President Leonid Fedun said the move could lead
to a drop in investments in oil companies by up to 20 percent in
1999, Tass reported.

<HEADLINE> Estonia Vows Not to Put Vast Airfield to Military Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Estonian Armed
Forces Johannes Kert said here Monday that his country does not
intend to use the airfield for strategic bombers in Tartu for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
Kert, now visiting Russia, said Tartu, believed to be Europe's
best airfield, would not be used by NATO airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Estonia, a former Soviet republic, is trying hard to join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
"At present the airfield is not used by NATO airplanes. At
present it houses Europe's largest car sale market. It will
continue to be used as such," Kert told the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Anatoly
Kvashnin, who met Kert, said, "We conducted a conversation to the
effect that the Baltic region cannot be anyone's bridgehead. It is
natural."
</P>
<P>
Moscow is strongly against the transatlantic military
alliance's eastward expansion, saying it threatens Russia's
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Kert, for his part, said that Estonia does not feel any
military threat from Russia and neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"If the Armed Forces of Russia develop as they are developing
now and if relations between our countries evolve normally,
Estonia has no apprehensions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kert also held a meeting with Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, who stressed that "Russia and Estonia are destined to
enter the 21st century as good neighbors," Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Kert will also tour the Russian General Staff's Military
Academy before wrapping up his visit Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Condemns Fresh U.S.-British Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Monday condemned fresh U.S.-British air strikes on
Iraqi residential quarters and civilian targets in the southern
province of Basra, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Monday's U.S.-British attacks on Iraq is a
continuation of aggression against the country. In mid-December,
these two Western allies launched four-night missile attacks on
Iraq to retaliate its "non-cooperation in U.N. arms inspections."
</P>
<P>
Aziz slammed Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which provide military
bases for U.S. and British forces, for facilitating the aggression
and held them responsible for the damages, INA reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq would continue its confrontations with U.S. and British
jets patrolling the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq,
said the Iraqi official.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has declared that it does not recognize the illegal
no-fly zones, imposed by the U.S. and its allies without
U.N. authorization, with the claimed aim of protecting Kurds and
Shiite Muslims from the Baghdad regime.
</P>
<P>
Aziz linked the fresh U.S.-British air raids with the position
taken by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in the name of the Arab League on
Sunday's Arab foreign ministers meeting held in Cairo, said INA.
</P>
<P>
"Washington welcomed the position of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
in the Cairo foreign ministers meeting, because the position
serves its interests," INA quoted Aziz as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Information Minister Hammam Abdul-Khaliq said earlier in
the day that warplanes from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on
Monday morning attacked at least two residential areas in and
around the southern city of Basra, causing civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
INA reported that the U.S. and British warplanes bombed a
number of heavily populated districts of Abu Flous and al-Khaseeb
in Basra province, Basra airport and the northern Rumaila field at
10:10 a.m.local time (0710 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It added that a residential quarter in the city of al-Jumhuriya
in Basra was attacked by U.S.-British missile at 9:30 a.m. local
time (0630 GMT) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment led to the killing of a number of children,
women and the elderly, said INA. The specific figures of the
casualties are not available so far.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time since mid-December U.S.-British air
strikes against Iraq that residential quarters were attacked.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Rise to Record in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sales of existing homes
rose 13.5 percent in 1998 to 4.78 million, the best year on
record, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It said that in December, sales increased 3.1 percent from the
month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.03 million,
also a record.
</P>
<P>
Strong buying demand pushed the inventory of homes for sale,
1.58 million, to a record low level -- a 3.8 month supply at the
December sales rate.
</P>
<P>
"Continuous low interest rates and the healthy economy have
created a steady flow of buyers moving up to second and third
homes, and they feel comfortable doing so because there are so
many first-time buyers in a solid position to buy," said Realtors
President Sharon A. Millett.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have remained
below 7 percent since mid-June, the longest stretch at such a low
level in three decades.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the 4.5 percent unemployment rate of last year was the
lowest in 29 years. Strong stock market gains have also supplied
many well-off Americans with the werewithal to buy a larger home
or vacation house.
</P>
<P>
Economists here expect home sales to remain strong this year,
though at something less than 1998's record.
</P>
<P>
The big sale propelled a healthy increase in the value of many
homes. The median price of an existing home last year was 130,600
U.S. dollars, up 5.2 percent from 1997.

UNITED NATIONS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The painting exhibition
of Yuan Xikun, a celebrated Chinese artist, opened Monday at the
United Nations towers.
</P>
<P>
The paintings of animals and figures, which are the finest
works by Yuan over the recent years, include horses, lions and
tigers.
</P>
<P>
"Yuan's paintings show a harmony between the national Chinese
paintings and the Western oil paintings," Qin Huansun, Chinese
permanent representative to the United Nations, said at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The most impressive are two large paintings, both 2 meters by
2.5 meters, which are entitled Remembrance and Awakened Lion. The
former depicts Yuan's encounter with a wild tiger in the dense
forests in South China's province of Yunnan Province, and the
latter is a masterpiece that mirrors his extensive study of
traditional Chinese paintings.
</P>
<P>
Among visitors at the opening of the exhibition are Kensaku

OTTAWA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy Monday reiterated his full support for the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) resolutions and mediation
efforts to end the nine-month Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Canada urges both countries to exercise restraint and use all

</P>
<P>
"We urge Ethiopia and Eritrea to cooperate fully with OAU and
to accept and implement their mediation proposals without further

</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has announced its formal acceptance of
these proposals, while the Eritrean government so far has not
accepted them.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Framework Agreement called for Eritrea's troop
withdrawal from the disputed border area to the original
boundaries held before May 6, 1998, for the presence of OAU
military observers with U.N. support and for the demarcation of the
border under U.N. auspices.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebel Movement Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD) fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila has
implemented the restructuring of the movement, the Rwanda News
Agency (RNA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The RCD has set up three new organs to run its activities,
notably the Assembly, the Executive Committee, and the Political
Council, the RNA said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a press release issued Sunday by the RCD as saying
that ''the number of the Assembly passed from 28 to 147, including
22 from the military."
</P>
<P>
It is said that the Executive Committee which plays the role of
the government is comprised of 23 departments, instead of eight at
the launching of the movement.
</P>
<P>
This will enable the RCD to cover all the sectors of the
Congolese society, rapporteur of the RCD's assembly, Jacques
Depelchin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The RCD general assembly which gathered from November 12, and
was concluded on January 24, decided to ''open and extend the
assembly to the new members in respect of the criteria of
representatives as well as collegiality.''
</P>
<P>
The assembly opted for 10 representatives from totally
liberated areas, seven from partially liberated provinces, and
five persons from provinces still under government control.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 members of the Political Council.
</P>
<P>
RCD political leader Professor Ernest Wamba dia Wamba becomes
Chairman of the Permanent Bureau with Moise Nyarugabo as the first
Vice-Chairman and Jean Pierre Ondekane the second Vice-Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Mbusa Nyamwisi is the Chairman of the Assembly and the
Vice-Chairman of the Assembly is Arthur Z'ahidi Ngoma.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lunda Bululu becomes Coordinator of RCD Executive
Committee with Bizima Karaha as Deputy Coordinator.
</P>
<P>
A new innovation that came out of the general assembly was the
willingness to ensure more cohesion between the movement and its
military wing, said the RNA
</P>
<P>
From now on, the army will participate in all deliberations and
 decisions of the RCD. To concretize this symbiosis, it was
decided that a political training will be provided to the
military, while the military training will be given to
politicians.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases 16 Lebanese Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel Monday released 16
Lebanese prisoners from a detention center in south Lebanon under
the mediation of the International Committee for the Red Cross
(ICRC), the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 16 prisoners were set free from the Khiam Detention Center
in the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The center, which is run by the Israeli allied South Lebanon
Army (SLA), currently holds over 100 Lebanese on charges of
collaborating with anti-Israeli guerrillas or refusing to join
SLA.
</P>
<P>
Henre Furieh, the chief of the ICRC in Lebanon, said the
release was made after a week-long talks with SLA commander
Antoine Lahd, during which he presented the militia leader the
poor health condition of some detainees who badly need to be
treated.
</P>
<P>
After the release was announced, Lebanon's National Committee
of Lebanese Prisoners in Israeli Jails issued a statement
expressing welcome to the move.
</P>
<P>
However, the humanitarian organization complained that more
children, women, elderly and sick prisoners are still held in the
center. It demanded that Israeli authorities release them as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli forces from the country.

<HEADLINE> 3 Russian Oil Companies Set to Merge Into Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia will merge three of the
country's largest oil companies into a holding conglomerate where
the state commands a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
The merger of Rosneft, Slavneft and Onako, announced by Deputy
Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak Monday, would result into the
world's largest oil company in terms of prospected oil reserves,
Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Bulgak said the new company, where the government will have a
75 percent stake, "is not nationalization but the restructuring of
oil companies, connected with the general economic situation on
the oil market."
</P>
<P>
He said the consortium may be joined by the Tyumen Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
Bulgak predicted that the new company will be able to extract
an annual 58 million tons of oil, ranking one of the world's 10
largest oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Russia's leading oil producer is LUKoil, which
extracts 63 million to 65 million tons each year, ranking fourth
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Fuel and Energy welcomed the announcement of
the merger, saying it will help stabilize fuel supplies to the
regions and strengthen state regulation in the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Despite an increase of over 11 million tons of oil exports last
year, Russia earned 4 billion U.S. dollars less than a year
earlier because of the plunge in world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, harsh extraction conditions and poor management make
Russia's cost of oil production 33-50 percent higher than that of
their U.S. and European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Russia hopes the merger would "build up (its) oil muscles," cut
production costs and improve production, Bulgak said.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai to Run for Israeli Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai announced Monday that he joins a new
centrist party and will run for the prime minister in the coming
general election due on May 17.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Tel Aviv, which was broadcast live
nationwide, Mordechai said he officially joined the party which
set national unity and peace with Arab neighbors as its top
priorities.
</P>
<P>
He will launch his election campaign as head of the new party,
co-founded by ex-army chief Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, former Finance
Minister Dan Meridor and former Tel Aviv mayor Roni Milo.
</P>
<P>
Firing his first shot, the 53-year-old former general said the
first and foremost goal of the party is to unite the country which
is severely divided between rich and poor, left and right,
religious and secular.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said his party sees peace as the strategic goal of
Israel and his party will work to achieve real peace through
continued talks with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
While providing security for the public and the country, the
party will take a series of measures to solve social and economic
issues, Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Mordechai's announcement, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu branded the new party as a leftist party which he said
is willing to give up national interests to Arabs.
</P>
<P>
There are only two roads in Israel and anyone who diverts from
the Likud is a leftist, Netanyahu said, adding that while the
Likud stands for Israeli rights on lands and sovereignty over
Jerusalem, the leftists will do the opposite.
</P>
<P>
He told Israel Radio that he believes Mordechai will make
territorial compromise on the Golan Heights, the Syrian territory
seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has insisted that the Golan is of strategic
importance to Israel and he will not cede it to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In publicizing the new party's platform, Mordechai cited
measures such as encouraging immigrants, adopting free-market
policy and providing better education for the people to solve
social and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Shahak, Meridor and Milo said they are confident that
Mordechai will win the elections.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited announcement came hours after Mordechai was
officially sacked by Netanyahu defense minister. Netanyahu ousted
his defense minister Saturday night, accusing him of being
disloyal to the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Mordechai's defection from the Likud and
participation in the elections deal a severe blow to Netanyahu's
chances of getting re-elected in the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai was as a moderate in the right-wing government, and
now his party was seen as a mild Likud, which will absorb votes of
moderate hawks.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll showed that about one-thirds of those voted for
Netanyahu in the 1996 elections will vote for Mordechai.

ADDIS ABABA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Monday called on
the international community to apply "effective and meaningful"
pressure on Eritrea in the political, diplomatic and economic
fields to force it to accept the peace proposals of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued here
that "the governments of Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and the
United States as well as the European Union and the U.N. Security
Council have clearly recognized Ethiopia's acceptance of the
internationally-backed OAU peace proposal."
</P>
<P>
"These latest moves by the international community need,
however, to be put in perspective and should be looked at against
the backdrop of the complete deadlock in the peace process created
by Eritrea's obduracy," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The OAU peace plan calls for Eritrea's withdrawal of troops to
positions before May 6, 1998 and the restoration of the Ethiopian
civilian administration there.
</P>
<P>
"The issue at hand is Eritrea's withdrawal and the restoration
of the status quo ante. Yes or no is what is expected from Eritrea
with regard to the only remaining issue -- the implementation of
the OAU peace proposal," said the statement.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian lawmakers told U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Monday that the U.S.-led
airstrikes against Iraq hardened the legislator's resolve to block
the START II nuclear weapons reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We said that the Americans have thrown its ratification back
by what they have done in Iraq," Speaker Gennady Seleznyov of the
State Duma, or lower house of parliament, told reporters after the
meeting with Albright.
</P>
<P>
However, he told Albright that the START II ratification has
been included in the Duma's plan of work in the spring session,
but did not specify the exact time frame, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"We felt that Madeleine Albright is interested in working out
mutually understandable formula through a dialogue in order not
to foment animosity between the two countries," Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the State Duma "favors multifaceted
development of Russian-American relations in all fields" despite
their differences over a number of issues such Kosovo, and NATO
expansion.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed assistance to Russia from the International
Monetary Fund. Seleznyov complained that "the impression is that
the IMF mission is taunting our government."
</P>
<P>
Albright, however, said she did not think that the IMF was
doing this intentionally.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lukin and Roman Popkovich, chairmen of the Duma
International Affairs and Defense committees, also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here early Monday on a two-day working

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Air
Tanzania Corporation (ATC) will increase fares for domestic
flights by 15 percent effective on February 1, the company's
managing director, Dominic Rwehumbiza, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rwehumbiza said in a statement issued in Dar es Salaam that the
increase has been necessitated by rising costs in operation,
maintenance, insurance, spare parts and other sectors, as well as
the devaluation of the Tanzanian Shilling against the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Given the market condition, the corporation has to increase
ticket prices so as to stay afloat, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republicans Oppose Plan to End Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican senators
Monday "summarily rejected" a proposal to vote on the two articles
of impeachment against President Bill Clinton without hearing from
witnesses, Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"This idea has been summarily rejected by Lott and the
Republican caucus," spokesman John Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
Republican and Democratic senators were discussing that plan,
proposed by Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman and Republican
Senator Slade Gorton and others in separate closed-door meetings.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Senate Republican Leader Don Nickles said the
proposal had been just "one of many, many options" under
discussion. The plan would have eliminated a motion to dismiss the
case as scheduled on Monday, and another motion on whether to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Instead, House of Representatives prosecutors would have
presented a rebuttal to the White House defense, followed by a day
for closing arguments by each side. The Senate would have debated
and voted on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Republican rejection leaves the Senate back where it began,
with a motion to dismiss the case scheduled for consideration on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.

CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Undersecretary
Nabil Negm on Monday said Iraq's relations with the other Arab
countries will not be affected following the Arab foreign
ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving here for Baghdad, Negm told Egypt's Middle East
News Agency, Negm ruled out the possibility that Baghdad would
sever ties with Cairo or any other Arab capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country has recently brokered two trade deals
with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the Arab foreign ministers' reluctance to condemn
the U.S.-British attack on Iraq, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf stormed out of the meeting held here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On the future of Iraq's relations with the Arab League, Negm
disclosed that Iraq is to downgrade its representation in future
Arab League's meetings.
</P>
<P>
He said his country's will nurture relations with Asian
countries, focusing on the economic domains.
</P>
<P>
The drive comes in light of the Arab country's negligence of
the needs of the Iraqi people and their inability to stand up to
the U.S.-British attack and international economic embargo on
Iraq, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched four-day air strikes
against Iraq in mid-December for what the U.S. alleged as
Baghdad's defiance of the United Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions the U.N. Security Council imposed on
Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted until

LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Two European Journalists were
kidnapped Monday by Sierra Leonean rebels who later freed one to
deliver their demand to the authorities, a report reaching here

improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The 15 ministers expressed welcome for the fact that the

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Political Situation Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
staged a dawn-to-midnight hartal on Tuesday, the day for
submitting nomination papers for the upcoming municipal elections
scheduled for late February, in protest against the government's
rejection of their four-point demand.
</P>
<P>
This was part of the opposition's campaign to challenge the
government, marking the start of political uncertainty in the
country, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
When the Election Commission announced the schedule of
municipal elections early this month, the opposition alliance
grouping the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya Party
(JP), the Jaamat-e-Islami and others, announced a four-point
demand for joining the elections - resignation of the chief
election commissioner, reorganization of the commission, issuing
voters' identity cards before the elections, and stopping
harassing opposition workers and leaders.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said the election commissioner had failed to
maintain neutrality, and the election commission had been in favor
of the ruling party, the Bangladesh Awami League (BAL), charges
which were immediately denied by the ruling party and the chief
election commissioner.
</P>
<P>
With the demand rejected, the opposition had also planned a
four-day hartal on February 22-25, coinciding with the dates for
holding elections in 143 of the country's 182 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the opposition boycotted the speech made by the
country's president at the first session of the parliament in the
new year, accusing it as "the cabinet's speech" not "the
president's speech," because it had been approved by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Only a faction of JP law-makers, led by Communications Minister
Anwar Hossain Manju, attended the session, defying party chairman
E.M. Ershad's directives to boycott the session. Manju was
expelled from the party last year when he refused to step down
from his government post as minister after the JP decided to
withdraw its support to the government.
</P>
<P>
Without support from the JP, the BAL now faces a strong
opposition after the BNP, the JP and other opposition parties
joined forces late last year to oust the government.
</P>
<P>
The BAL had already announced its intention to hold the general
elections in the year 2000. The polls are due by 2001 when the
government's five-year tenure ends.
</P>
<P>
As the aim of the opposition is to dislodge the government
before it could finish its term, the municipal elections are seen
as a best chance for the opposition this year, said the analysts.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 would be one full of political and economic
uncertainties for Bangladesh, which was severely hit by floods
last year inflicting heavy losses, the analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Tuesday Moscow would not trade in its national
interests despite the economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after his enlarged meeting with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Ivanov said the
American side did not bargain for political benefits in exchange
for its economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries' differences on some issues should
not stand in the way of developing their partnership.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Albright's visit was an indication that the two
sides could jointly remove obstacles in the understanding of their
similarities in strategic goals.
</P>
<P>
"Discussion of all problems went in the spirit of frankness, in
the spirit of partnership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, for her part, voiced concern over Russia's current
economic situation, expressing the willingness to assist Russia on
its road toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that the Russian State Duma, or lower
house of parliament, would have ratified the START II arms
reduction treaty when she visited Moscow next time.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma was close to approve the treaty late last year,
but U.S.-led air strikes against Iraq fueled anti-U.S. sentiments
in the country and furthered hampered the document's passage in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Washington's announcement of sanctions against three Russian
institutes for their alleged part in assisting Iran's nuclear and
missile weapons programs further chilled bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has repeatedly denied the charges, but Ivanov said
Tuesday that Russia is strengthening export control and working
together with the U.S. on non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed Kosovo, where Russia wants to have
a political solution while Washington urges the maintenance of
military pressure to that area. Albright is here on a two-day
working visit. She is scheduled for wrapped up the trip early
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> General Quality of China's Products Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the State
Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision said today that
selective examinations carried out last year of some 7,800
products made in China showed that the general quality of Chinese
products is improving steadily.
</P>
<P>
The examinations indicate that the qualification rate for
large enterprises was 93 percent, and the rate for small
enterprises was 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
And in terms of qualification percentage, the products of
state enterprises proved to be much better than those of private
enterprises, 84 percent compared to 63 percent, while in between
these two figures were the products of foreign-funded ventures,
stock companies and collectively owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that low-quality products manufactured by
small and privately owned enterprises have had a negative impact
on the general image of China's products.
</P>
<P>
He attributes this problem to the fact that "private
enterprises generally lack a sense of quality and quality-control
facilities."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision is scheduled to organize training classes
for managers of enterprises which manufacture low-quality
products in order to effectively improve their management cap
abilities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bureau plans to strengthen its market
supervision and strike hard at those enterprises or individuals
which manufacture or sell low-quality products in order to better
protect the rights and interests of consumers.

<HEADLINE> Government to Intensify Anti-Corruption Efforts: Zhu (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- The results achieved in the restructuring of the State
Council should be consolidated while advancing the restructuring
of local government. Government functions and working style must
be changed along with the restructuring. Local governments must
also formulate their codes of conduct and publish them for public
supervision;
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts shall be focused on self-discipline among top
government officials. They must also look into the conduct of
their spouses, children and secretaries.
</P>
<P>
-- Government supervisory departments shall intensify their
crackdown on illegal activities of officials at and above the coun
ty level, and of those in economic regulating bodies and
administrative law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
-- Special campaigns shall be launched to address heated
public complaints against certain administrative law-enforcement
agencies, government-monopoly industries, and public service
departments.
</P>
<P>
-- As the army, armed police, judiciary and government bodies
at the national level have severed their ties with business
operations, local governments should also follow suit by
producing their specific timetables for so doing.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said it is required that government bodies shall observe
the Party's new anti-corruption responsibility system, which
stipulates that a top official be held responsible for major
corruption cases in the institution under his charge.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia have
returned 21 Iranian trucks seized along with Iranian drivers last
August, an Iranian official announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trucks were returned to Mashhad, the capital of Iran's
northeastern Khorasan province, via Turkmenistan border, Mohammad
Reza Forqani, a Foreign Ministry official, told the Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Forqani said that another 21 trucks would be returned to Iran
within the next two days. But he did not mention how many Iranian
trucks have been confiscated by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Taliban released 51 Iranian
citizens, mainly drivers, who were arrested by the Taliban in
Mazari Sharif, northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that the Iranian drivers were carrying commercial
goods to Afghanistan and the Central Asian states, but the
Taliban claimed earlier that the Iranians were sending arms to
the opposition Northern Alliance headed by ousted Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.

LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The United kingdom said on
Tuesday that it would not rule out the use of ground troops in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo but adding at the same time that
it did not see the use of force by NATO as in urgent need.
</P>
<P>
"We don't rule out any options, but it doesn't mean it's the
direction we are heading," Foreign Office junior minister Tony
Lloyd told a parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
He was also cautious about the possibility of closing the
border between Albania and Kosovo in order to stop arms supplies
to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
"The practicalities are enormous. I would not give the
committee the false idea that we believe this is the way to
control the situation in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, speaking to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs
Committee, said it was not yet the time to talk of planning to
send British ground troops to Kosovo as part of an international
force.
</P>
<P>
The top priority was to push Yugoslavia and the leaders of the
Kosovo Albanians back to the table of peace talks, Lloyd said.

<P>
BONN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Berlin will introduce
breathalyzer tests for underground train drivers, a spokesman of
the Berlin's transport authority Klaus Wazlak said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The transport authority already conducts such tests on bus and
tram drivers. The capital's transport authority will be
conducting random alcohol tests following the incident, that a
train driver collapsed on the job last week in a drunken stupor
and had to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old woman lost consciousness while driving a
subway train in Berlin last Friday. Tests revealed that the
level of alcohol in her blood was seven times the legal alcohol
limit.
</P>
<P>
Passengers had noticed her erratic driving, with sudden starts
and abrupt stops. She also had trouble bringing the train to a
standstill in the right place. When the train stopped, about a
third of the train was stuck in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Wazlak said the case of the drunken train driver was an
isolated incident, but added that she would be fired.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Bombard Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- United States warplanes
bombarded three ground targets in northern Iraq Tuesday, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted U.S. official Patricia Langf, who is working
at the Incirlik air base in Adana of southern Turkey, as saying
that warplanes bombarded two radar units and one anti-aircraft
system in Mosul in northern Iraq between 12:25 and 12:50
a.m. local time (1025 and 1050 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Seventeen U.S. warplanes, one tanker, one transport and one
AWACS plane, taking off from the base between 10:30 and 11:30
a.m. (0830 and 0930 GMT), took part in the action.
</P>
<P>
Following a discussion on Iraq with U.S. Ambassador to Turkey
Mark Parris Monday, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that
Turkey is reviewing its approach towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit has previously said Turkey would not support further
attacks on Iraq and would not allow the U.S. to use military bases
in Turkey for such strikes.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Turkey now supports the U.S. air strikes
against northern Iraq as Turkey is a member country of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a partner of the
U.S. during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, the U.S. and its allies set up two no-fly zones in
southern and northern Iraq with the claimed aim of shielding the
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British forces in the Gulf launched four consecutive
days of air strikes on Iraq in mid-December last year to retaliate
what they said Iraq's non-cooperation with the United Nations
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has delivered three Patriot missile batteries to
Incirlik air base based on the "developments in northern Iraq,"
after Iraq threatened to attack those neighbors which allow the
U.S. to use their bases for strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of the allied forces being stationed at
Incirlik as part of Operation Northern Watch to patrol the north
no-fly zone.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Attack Iraqi Targets in Northern No-Fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. fighter jets on
Tuesday fired missiles at three targets in northern Iraq for the
fourth consecutive day, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col Steve Campbell said the three
incidents occurred between 1:25 p.m. and 1:50 p.m. Iraqi time
(1025 and 1050 GMT) near the city of Musul in the northern no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the U.S. warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone
fired missiles after being targeted by Iraqi surface-to-air
missiles and anti-aircraft artillery systems.
</P>
<P>
The pilots all returned safely to their base at Incirlik in
Turkey after patrolling mission. And damage to Iraqi forces was
being assessed.
</P>
<P>
There were two Iraqi MiG planes that had entered the southern
no-fly zone on Tuesday, but no clashes happened as U.S. and
British planes were not patrolling the area at the time,
according to the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, which
oversees operations in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said they did not have any reports on
damage assessment from Monday's clashes, the most violent since
Operation Desert Fox last month. Iraq claims U.S. missiles
killed 11 civilians and injured dozens more.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Adopts Administrative Reform Outline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on
Tuesday adopted an outline for administrative reform aimed at
slashing the country's bureaucracy and giving more power to the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The outline was adopted by the administrative reform promotion
headquarters headed by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and all
cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
The main point of the outline is the reorganization of 22
ministries and agencies into 13 entities by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Under the outline, an economic and fiscal policy committee he
aded by the prime minister will draw up basic policy on budget
formation and fiscal management.
</P>
<P>
The outline also includes an agreement reached last week
between the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Liberal Party
(LP) to reduce the number of cabinet ministers from the current
18 to 14.
</P>
<P>
An additional three ministers could be appointed to special
tasks with 17 being the upper limit for the number of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The coalition partners also reached consensus on reducing the
number of central government employees by 25 percent over 10
years through year-on-year cuts in new hiring from fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to strengthen the role of the cabinet,
the plan calls for the merger of councilor's offices under the
cabinet into one.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, a number of government organizations,
including hospitals and the Transportation Ministry's automobile
inspection division, will become new entities independent from
the government.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and thirty-one advisory councils, which account
for more than 60 percent of all such panels, should be abolished,
the outline says.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Apply to Be Masters of Their Own Fate By Zhang Yongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- For the 420,000 residents of
Macao, a territory now under Portuguese rule, democracy and
self-governance used to look like a faraway dream, but the dream
is going to come true.
</P>
<P>
At about nine this morning, Macao teacher Chan Sou Teng was
amazed to find that he became the first one to apply for
admission into a Selection Committee which will vote the first
chief executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee is organized in accordance with an
annex to the Macao Basic Law which was passed by China's top
legislature in 1993 following thorough deliberations by people
from both Macao and China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
"The masses of Macao people will be able to elect their own
chief executive (of the SAR) for the first time," Chan Sou Teng
said, noting that such a "first" is worthy to be written into
Macao's history.
</P>
<P>
To handle affairs associated with the establishment of the
SAR, a Preparatory Committee, which consists of 60 members from
Macao and 40 members from the mainland, was set up in May last
year. The committee has worked out a number of key resolutions
for founding the SAR, including a method for forming the
Selection Committee passed in last November.
</P>
<P>
At its latest plenary session in the middle of the month, the
Preparatory Committee announced some detailed procedures on
forming the Selection Committee, which will be composed of 200
permanent Macao residents coming from various social sectors.
</P>
<P>
The first step is that Macao residents apply to become members
of the Selection Committee between January 26 to February 14. The
application site was set at the Macao Office of the secretariat
of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged woman who only gave her surname as Fung, also
came in the morning with the company of her husband.
</P>
<P>
"To elect the chief executive is a great matter of all people
in Macao," the lady said after having her name, ID card number
and other personal materials registered.
</P>
<P>
"We want to elect one who is truly able to bring benefits to
us, especially one who can manage Macao's economy and public
security well."
</P>
<P>
Throngs of people came to the application site, asking for
application sheets and going out with excitement and pride. By
7:00 p.m., a total of 302 application sheets were issued.
</P>
<P>
Application sheets will be collected before 7:00 p.m. on
February 14, and will then go through deliberation and assessment
among members of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the end, 200 people will be selected in early April.
Following that, the first chief executive is supposed to be
elected in late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ziying, secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee
and vice-director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under
China's State Council, is making a special trip to Macao
supervising the application process.
</P>
<P>
"To form the Selection Committee and elect the first chief
executive of the Macao SAR will be the first step to practice the
concepts of 'one country, two systems' and 'Macao people governin
g Macao'," Chen Ziying said.
</P>
<P>
"What's important, it will be a gratifying beginning for Macao
people to manage their own affairs," he added. "It is well-known
that Macao residents do not have such a right at all for hundreds
of years."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Chen noted that the customs and culture of
Portuguese descendants in Macao will be respected and their legal
rights will be protected.

guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The sudden influx of refugees to the Huambo and Kuito cities
has added the refugees population from 200,000 to 500,000, ever
since military conflicts re-started between the government forces
and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Many people are living on humanitarian aid in the cities where
prices for daily necessities have risen many times, the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. suspended its humanitarian flights to the areas after two
U.N. cargo planes were downed respectively on December 26, 1998
and January 2 this year.

<HEADLINE> Malaria on Rise in Canada, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is making a comeback in
Canada, especially among new immigrants from high-risk regions of
the world, said scientists at the University of Toronto in a new
report published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.
</P>
<P>
The report cited the reason as many new immigrants do not take
proper precautions when returning to high-risk regions for visits.
</P>
<P>
Researchers interviewed 324 travelers departing from Toronto's
Pearson International Airport on flights to India and found that
only 7 percent had obtained the recommended drug prescriptions to
prevent malaria.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,036 cases of malaria reported in Canada in 1997,
up 141 percent from 430 in 1994. The rate of reported cases is
now five to ten times higher than that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The real number is probably much higher because many cases
were not reported to medical authorities.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is the most devastating parasitic disease in the
world, killing two million people annually.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Credit Card Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC) has issued advice on the use of banking cards in a bid to
improve the management of the facility and prevent risks from
banking card abuse.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC says that the term "banking cards" refers to any and
all ways of credit payment issued to the public by commercial
banks, including credit and debit cards.
</P>
<P>
The policy will become effective on March 1, 1999, while the
earlier Procedure for Credit Card Use issued by the PBOC in 1996
will be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks and foreign financial institutions are
required to apply to the PBOC for permission before they begin
any new such business activities.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for PBOC said the new methods of using the cards,
introduced as a result, will be conducive to protecting the legal
rights and interests of commercial banks, card holders,
franchised units and other parties concerned, as well as
encouraging a standardized service.
</P>
<P>
The rules and regulations provide clear and concise advice on
the classification of banking cards, business ratification,
interest and charging rates, account and trading management, risk
management as well as outlining the responsibility of the parties
concerned and the punishments for anyone carrying out illegal
practices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson's next opponent would
not be Axel Schulz, the German fighter's manager said in
Frankfurt of Germany on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pay-per-view television operator Showtime was not interested
in the fight between Tyson and Schulz scheduled for April 24,
said Wilfried Sauerland, the manager of the German heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of all dreams. The subject is closed. Axel is
very disappointed," Sauerland said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Sauerland had said that the contract for the fight
had been drawn up and ready for signing.
</P>
<P>
But Showtime was concerned about lower than expected income
from Tyson's last bout against Francois Botha and was now looking
for a different opponent, possibly Donovan "Razor" Ruddock,
Sauerland said.
</P>
<P>
Sauerland said he would now try to set up a fight between
Schulz and the WBC champion Lennox Lewis.

<HEADLINE> New Cambodian Army Commander-in-Chief To be Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces' chief of the general staff Ke Kim Yan will become the
commander-in-chief, replacing Prime Minister Hun Sen, said a royal
decree signed by King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen tendered his resignation to the king Monday, asking to
step down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces in order to
silence criticism that the military is controlled by the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
The king accepted Hun Sen's resignation and signed a royal
decree, which was available here Tuesday, to appoint Ke Kim Yan as
Royal Army Commander-in-Chief and other six generals as deputy
commanders on the proposal of Hun Sen. A ceremony is scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, Gen. Pal Saraenn will become Deputy Commander
and joint chief of staff, and Gen. Meas Sophea will be named as
Deputy Commander and Army Commander. Gen. Khan Savoeun and Khem
Sophoan will also become Deputy Commanders, while Lt. Gen. Ung Sam
Khan will be appointed Navy Commander and Lt. Gen. Soing Sam Nang
as Air Force Commander.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Ke Kim Yan, born in Pursat province, was
nominated as General in November 1991, and later became first
vice-Minister of Defense.
</P>
<P>
On July 5, 1993, Gen. Ke Kim Yan was nominated to the post of
Chief of the General Staff of National Army Forces.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts described the changes in the military as a
gesture to appease international donors.
</P>
<P>
But Om Yentieng, a senior advisor to the prime minister, said
the move was less to appease the international community than it
was an independent government initiative to strengthen democracy
and reform the military.

<HEADLINE> Government to Intensify Anti-Corruption Efforts: Zhu (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji told
government bodies at all levels today to be strict in running the
government and to wipe out corruption by instituting effective
mechanism to build a cleaner and more honest government.
</P>
<P>
"We shall never fail the expectations of the people and tasks
bestowed by history," he said at an anti-corruption conference of
the State Council, China's cabinet, attended by vice premiers,
ministers and top disciplinary officials of the Communist Party
of China.
</P>
<P>
Since its inauguration in March last year, the government has
listed the anti-corruption drive as one of its top priorities,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The drastic restructuring of the State Council has been
carried out smoothly and many organizations have been streamlined
and their personnel reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government also took measures to step up
anti-corruption efforts by introducing new mechanisms such as
abolishing the affiliations between government and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also warned that there are still many problems to be faced
in building a clean and honest government, and specified
extravagance, government waste, embezzlement, distortion of the
law, and arbitrary fines and fee collections as among the most
prominent.
</P>
<P>
"Some officials working at grass-roots levels have also been
found to be rude and violent in their work or even bullying
toward the masses," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Aboriginal Australians Call for Federal Govt Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Aboriginal Australians Tuesday
demanded the federal government sign a treaty of reconciliation
within two years, as they marked Australia Day with ceremonies of
mourning.
</P>
<P>
On what they call Invasion Day, a group of 57 Aboriginal
leaders and organizations put their names to a national newspaper
advertisement calling for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement called for a referendum late this year to
select treaty delegates and determine the form of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The treaty should be concluded by January 26, 2001, the
advertisement said, with the British government urged to press the
Australian government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Our dispossessed and oppressed peoples are impoverished and
outcast in society," it said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a citizenship ceremony in Sydney, Prime Minister
John Howard, who resists a treaty, said Australia Day should be
used to celebrate the achievements of the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
But Howard also stressed: "It is also an occasion to recognize
that our history has contained its blemishes, and there are those
amongst us, fellow Australians, who are in need of our continuous
companionship and our continuous help."
</P>
<P>
He said Australians should recognize the debt they owed to the
indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
"We do owe the Aboriginal Australians, the indigenous people of
this country, a debt for the contribution they have made to our
current identity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to work ever closer with them to achieve greater
cooperation, greater harmony and a greater common understanding."
</P>
<P>
However, Howard refused to consider a treaty with Aboriginal
Australians, although he has promised to achieve a document of
reconciliation by the centenary of federation in January 2001.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Aims for Profitability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry is to
turn around losses and become profitable this year, according to
the Director of the State Administration of Textile Industry Du
Yuzhou.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates at a textile industry conference here today
that the industry will further reduce losses by three billion
yuan (360 million US dollars) this year after improving its
balance book by 2.6 billion yuan (310 million US dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry was 1.91 billion yuan in the red last
year.
</P>
<P>
Du said that the Government has set a target of turning 150 of
the 281 large and medium-sized state-owned textile enterprises
into profitable ones by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the industry will slash cotton weaving
production capacity by 4.8 million spindles and lay off 440,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister in charge of the State Commission
of Economy and Trade, said that the job is much harder than last
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 21 of the 36 provincial portfolios of the state-owned
textile industry failed to meet targets of loss reduction.
</P>
<P>
Shi attributed the shortfall to the impact of the Asian
financial crisis and devastating summer floods. He also pointed
out that inadequate reemployment of laid off workers was another
factor affecting profits.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 660,000 workers laid off last year, one
third are still receiving financial support from their former
factories.
</P>
<P>
Shi urged local governments to re-allocate these workers to
other posts instead of keeping them under the wing of their
former employers.
</P>
<P>
"Unless this is done textile enterprises cannot really reduce
their burdens and become profitable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another one-third of the textile workers laid off last year
have already reached the age of retirement.
</P>
<P>
"We did the easy part of the job last year. Now, there are
tough tasks ahead of us this year," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed confidence that the goals of turning the
whole industry into profits could be achieved, explaining that
the Government will grant at least 12 billion yuan to state-owned
textile enterprises to get rid of debts.
</P>
<P>
Currently the asset-liability ratio of these textile
enterprises stands at 73 percent. One-sixth of the provincial
ones even have a ratio as high as 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China will encourage loss-making state-owned
enterprises to declare themselves bankrupt this year, stressing
that it is a more effective way of wiping out losses than
restructuring or mergers.
</P>
<P>
"But we won't set a maximum limit on how many state-owned
enterprises will go bankrupt this year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Large Quantity of Narcotics Seized in Khartoum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese police have arrested
nine drug smugglers and traffickers and seized 15 sacks of
narcotics valued at 417,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
General Sayed Al Hussein Osman, the director of the
anti-narcotic departmeas, said the smugglers and traffickers were
armed with machine guns and huge quantities of ammunition, besides
three vehicles, an official Sudanese daily "Al Anbaa" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
He added his department had had information about the operation
ever since the shipment moved from the South Darfour State until
it reached Khartoum on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the anti-narcotic branch of Om Durman, one of the
three towns that constitute the capital city of Khartoum, traced
the vehicles loaded with narcotics and captured the suspects after
 a fierce exchange of fire between the smugglers and a police
force early Monday morning. But no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Osman said his department is engaged in a relentless war
against drug smugglers, traffickers and pushers.
</P>
<P>
The South Darfour State is located southwest of the Sudan,
about 2000 kilometers from Khartoum. It is in this state that drug
trading is active. Two months ago, police
seized large quantities of narcotics valued at about 1,042,500
U.S. dollars.

<P>
SINGAPORE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew will attend the annual meeting of the World Economic
Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, from January 28 to February 2
and be an opening speaker at two plenary sessions, the Prime
Minister Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Information and the Arts and Second
Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo will also be present at
the WEF.
</P>
<P>
Lee will be an opening speaker at the two sessions respectively
 entitled "What conditions for a renewed Asian Miracle?" and "Is
global Capitalism Delivering the Goods?"
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister Office (PMO) did not reveal what Lee would
say at the WEF. But his recent essay entitled "Fix the Global
financial System," which is contributed to the Time magazine, is
an expression of his mind over these issues.
</P>
<P>
In his essay to be published in the February 1 issue of the
American magazine, Lee called for global financial reform, noting
that the Asian crisis had shown how fragile the world financial
system was and it also revealed the perils of globalization for
small open economies.
</P>
<P>
He said the international financial system should be
restructured in such a way that countries which participate more
fully in it will derive more benefits.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that steps be taken in the meantime to reduce the
volatility in the exchange rates of the currencies of the United
States, the European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
If the three could reduce the wide fluctuations in their
currencies' exchange rates, he said, those of developing countries
would become less volatile.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize the global financial system, he underlined, the
U.S., the EU and Japan need to agree on the institutions and
standards that regulate international financial movement.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the IMF, the World Bank and key
regulatory agencies like the Bank for International Settlements
should draw up codes of best practices on monetary, financial and
fiscal policy and corporate governance, which countries could use
as benchmarks.

During the talks, it was decided that a tripartite meeting of
senior officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkmenistan will
take place in the next two months at either Ashkhabad or Islamabad
to "not only suggest ways and means but to take concrete steps to
activate the project."
</P>
<P>
Both ministers agreed that the gas pipeline project has the
potential for serving as the basis for future regional cooperation
between Central Asian and South Asia, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Pakistan on Monday, Shikhmuradov flicked off
the possibility that the prospect of the project would dim after
the U.S. company UNOCAL abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
"Companies may come and go but the national interest is
decisive. We will definitely like to see this project
implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
A consortium of foreign companies signed an agreement in
November 1997 to construct a 915-mile gas pipeline from
Turkmenistan's Daulatabad gas field to Multan in Pakistan, passing
through war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, UNOCAL, which has a 46 percent share in the
consortium, recently announced its decision to withdraw from the
project for sighting "uncertainty in Afghanistan."

<HEADLINE> Flood-Relief Fund Not Diverted For Other Uses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Municipal Red
Cross said today that no flood-relief funds and materials donated
by people from all over China in 1998 have been diverted for
other uses.
</P>
<P>
The report, approved by the Shanghai Municipal Auditing
Bureau, revealed that between August 10 and October 31, the Red
Cross received 23.11 million yuan in flood-relief donations. It
also received food, medicines and other materials worth 33.87
million yuan and 17.2 million tons of quilts.
</P>
<P>
Some of the food, medicines and quilts have been sent to
flood-hit Anhui and Fujian provinces in east China, Hunan and
Hubei provinces in central China and Heilongjiang Province in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Shanghai Red Cross allocated 2.13 million yuan to
help 2,500 students from flood-hit areas and flood-stricken
families of army officers and soldiers stationed in the city.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Red Cross plans to set up 10 primary schools,
22 township clinics and six epidemic prevention stations at
county level in cooperation with its local counterparts in Hunan,
Hubei and Jiangxi provinces and in Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region. Medical equipment worth 1.7 million yuan will be donated
to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, heavy floods hit central, east, north and
northeast China, leaving over 3,000 people dead, affecting more
than 200 million people, and causing a direct economic loss of
more than 280 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Education Department to Play New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Education Department
(ED) of the Hong Kong SAR will play a role of a "facilitator" and
"regulator" instead of the usual "controller" in ensuring the
smooth implementation of education policy and the overall quality
of school education.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference on the broad direction of
reform for the ED here Tuesday, Director of Education Fanny Law
said that within five years, the department will become a more
efficient organization with fewer staff and better co-ordination
and communications among divisions as well as between
headquarters and front-line staff.
</P>
<P>
To realize this vision, Mrs. Law said that a series of
measures would be initiated within this year.
</P>
<P>
On organization and structure, Mrs. Law said that the senior
management structure would be de-layered with the two senior
assistant directors reporting directly to her.
</P>
<P>
"Where additional staff are required, we will employ contract
staff instead of civil servants in the next two years to allow
flexibility in adjusting the establishment in due course.
</P>
<P>
To enhance ED as a learning organization, Mrs. Law said that
cross-grade posting among ED staff would be increased to broaden
their perspectives while a study on simplification of the grade
structure would be carried out in tandem.
</P>
<P>
Staff training would be stepped up to enhance their
professionalism, and workshops for staff at different levels
would be conducted to align their vision and mission with the
overall direction of the department.
</P>
<P>
"The department would participate actively in international
education fora so that the best theories and practices could be
brought onto our education system," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the role of government schools, Mrs. Law said they would
become the district resource center for sharing good practices
among schools in the same district.
</P>
<P>
More government schools would take part in pilot projects such
as integrated education, information technology, student exchange
program with Mainland schools.
</P>
<P>
These measures would be implemented, as a matter of priority,
by the Implementation Team headed by Deputy Director of Education
Anthony Tong.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a series of staff briefings have been conducted
within the department on how best to bring the change program
forward.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met visiting Lao Prime Minister Sisavat Keobounphan at the
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was delighted to make Sisavat's acquaintance and
asked him to convey cordial greetings and good-will to Khamtay
Siphandone, the Lao state president and president of the Central
Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
Sisavat passed on reciprocal greetings from President Khamtay
to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He told Jiang that he and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji held very
good talks yesterday in which the two sides reached wide
consensus. According to Sisavat, the two countries reviewed the
progress made in bilateral cooperation and outlined the framework
for furthering the bilateral relationship in the future. "My
visit can be said to be crowned with success," he added.
</P>
<P>
As close neighbors, Jiang told the guests, the two countries
cemented deep friendship during the long-term revolutionary
struggle and construction. He was pleased to see the further
expansion of Sino-Lao traditional friendship. With mutual
understanding and support, the two countries also carried out
successful cooperation in regional and international affairs, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"There is neither a historical problem nor any real divergence
and disputes between the two countries," Jiang said, adding that
this provided a sound foundation and bright prospects for the
growth of bilateral ties. "The Chinese Communist Party and the
government have always attached importance to Sino-Lao ties. As
the new century is approaching, China is willing to make common
efforts with its Laotian comrades for the establishment of
long-term, stable, mutually trusting and good-neighborly
cooperative ties between the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, he believed Sisavat's China visit will push forward the
development of friendly and cooperative ties between the two
parties and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Jiang briefed the guests about China's
progress during the two decades of the reform and opening-up
drive and detailed future development goals.
</P>
<P>
Sisavat told the Chinese host, "We are happy to see the great
socialist construction achievements made by China resulting from
the new theory created by late Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Laos has
paid close attention to the rich experience accumulated by the
Chinese party and government during the process of reform and
opening-up and hopes the two sides can strengthen mutual
exchanges and learning in the future."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Prevents Returning Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli parliament gave
its final approval Tuesday to a bill aimed to prevent the
returning of the Golan Heights to Syria by any Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed its first reading in December, was
ratified by a vote of 53 against 30 in the 120-seat Knesset, or
Parliament, in its final reading.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, any decision by the government to remove
"Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration" from the Golan
Heights would require the approval of at least 61 Knesset members
and then the ratification of a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Porat, chairman of the Knesset's law committee, said
he wanted the bill passed before the elections in order to
handcuff any new government before it enters into negotiations
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong opposition from the international community,
Israel adopted a law in 1981, formally annexing the Golan
Heights. Since then, the parliament has passed several bills
strengthening the law.
</P>
<P>
Israel's talks with Syria over the Golan Heights have frozen
over the last three years. Syria wants the talks restarted from
where they left off in early 1996, but Israel insists they be
reopened from the scratch.
</P>
<P>
According to Knesset members, the bill on Golan Heights also
applies for Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim to
be the capital of their future state.

BRUSSELS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
issued here today a presidency declaration on the current
political situation in Haiti, deploring the Latin American
country's "political and constitutional crisis."
</P>
<P>
It said it considers dialogue between the president of the
Republic and the political forces concerned to be essential to
democracy in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
A lasting solution to the crisis there can only come about
through elections conducted in a free, honest and open
atmosphere, it added.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc also believed that preparing for such
elections and establishing a new Electoral Council is a task that
"must involve all the political forces concerned."
</P>
<P>
It emphasized that its strong commitment to Haiti since the
end of 1994 is based on the wish of seeing democracy return to
that country.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility for consolidating democracy in the country
falls to the president, the government and the parliament in
their capacity as representatives of the Haiti people. At the
same time, that consolidation is the major criterion in relations
between the European Union and the Republic of Haiti."
</P>
<P>
It also called on all the parties to embark on a political
dialogue in order to establish a new Electoral Council with a
view to organizing elections as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The EU reaffirmed its readiness to help offer electors "the
widest possible choice of political opinions and candidates and
to encourage everyone to participate."

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
Tuesday criticized some Arab states for their "shameful act
collaborating with their masters."
</P>
<P>
Some Arab states "will only heed the voice of the devil, after
have shut their ears and minds to the voice of reason..." said
Saddam in a message to the people in Basra hit by U.S. missiles
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saddam did not mention them by name, but It is apparent that he
was referring to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has held the two countries partially accountable for the
human and property losses caused in the U.S.-British air strikes
because they allow the two countries' warplanes to use their air
space and bases for the bombardments.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the official al-Jumhuriya daily reported
that Saddam has ordered to compensate for those, whose houses and
properties were destroyed by Monday's air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Some residential quarters near Basra, about 550 kilometers
south of Baghdad, were attacked by U.S. missile and bombs Monday,
killing 11 civilians and injuring 59 others, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Iraqi residential neighborhood has
been hit by the U.S.and Britain since they launched air strikes in
mid-December against Iraq for what Washington said punishing
Baghdad for not cooperating with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Basra people have stood the test in defense of Basra, setting
a good example for others to follow when confronting all evil
slaughters in the past and present," Saddam said in the message.
</P>
<P>
Basra was a major battlefield in the 1991 Gulf War, which was
touched off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Saddam called on his people to be patient, saying "victory
comes with patience... your blood will not go in vain."

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Tax Rebate for Textile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China is to raise tax rebates
for textile exports by two percentage points this year, Shi
Wanpeng, vice-minister of the State Commission of Economy and
Trade announced today.
</P>
<P>
The current rebate rate is set at 11 percent of the total
export value and will be raised to 13 percent, Shi told a
national textile industry conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that this move is part of China's efforts to stop a
landslide in textile exports which witnessed a six percent slump
last year after experiencing double-digit growth in the previous
consecutive years. The growth rate of textile exports reached
22.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the Southeast Asia financial crisis was far
more serious than expected," said Du Yuzhou, director-general of
the State Administration of Textile Industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, textile exports to Japan, Korea and Southeast Asian
countries dropped by 3.8 billion US dollars over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
China plans to turn around the negative growth of textile
exports this year.
</P>
<P>
The current average tax rate for exported textile products is
13.3 percent. It is estimated that the two percentage points of
additional tax rebate will add four billion yuan (500 million US
dollars) to exports value of textiles this year.

Mahathir Mohamad met here Tuesday Chinese People's Liberation Army
(PLA) Chief of the General Staff Gen. Fu Quanyou.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the Chinese general, Mahathir said it was very
important for leaders of the armed forces of the two countries to
have direct contacts and build up friendship so that they can
discuss issues of common concerns.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir hoped the visit by Gen. Fu would further strengthen
the relations between the two countries and the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that more PLA officers would come to Malaysia for
visits to enhance the relationship between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Touching the South China Sea issue, Mahathir said Malaysia
upholds that the issue should be solved bilaterally without the
interference of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has refused the mediation proposed by Americans on the
issue and believes the issue can be smoothly solved if both sides
have the willing to do so, he said.
</P>
<P>
Appraising Malaysia's attitude on the issue, Fu said on the
occasion that China's stand on the South China Sea issue is very
clear, China holds that the dispute among the countries involved
should be solved through bilateral friendly consultations and that
the involvement of any force from outside is undesirable and would
only further complicate the situation.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Fu said China attaches great importance
to the development of Sino-Malaysian relations and is active in
promoting its relations with Malaysia as both countries belong to
the same region of Asia-Pacific and have common interests and
common responsibilities in maintaining peace and stability in the
region and in the world as well.
</P>
<P>
Fu believed that his visit, the first official and goodwill
visit by a Chinese PLA chief of the general staff to Malaysia, is
conducive to further promoting understanding, strengthening trust,
developing friendship and enhancing cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese general arrived here on Sunday night for a five-day
official and goodwill visit to Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan for CIS Economic Integration: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Uzbekistan supports the
establishment of a free trade zone within the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) as economic integration is the priority
in the development of the CIS, Uzbek President Islam A. Karimov
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with visiting CIS
executive secretary Boris Berezovsky in Tashkent, he also said
that Uzbekistan firmly opposes the setting up of a
"ultra-national institution" in any form, the Central Asia Interf
ax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At its present development stage, Karimov added, the foremost
task for the CIS is to establish a free trade zone and push
forward the process of economic integration, two moves that will
help the integration process in other areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the president stressed that his country
opposes the setting up of a "collective leadership" of any form
within the CIS to replace the current executive committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee should not become a "ultra-national
institution," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Karimov also expressed his concern that the alliance between
Russia and Belarus might go beyond the concept of state
sovereignty, thought he noted that this was the "internal
affairs" of Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Karimov, Berezovsky noted that economic
integration should be given priority and economic alliance become
an integral part of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky left Tashkent on Monday for Belarus.

<HEADLINE> China to Lower Telecom Fees (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua)-- China is considering
significantly lowering telecom fees and costs this year in a bid
to boost the industry and stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Information Industry (MII) disclosed at a recent meeting that the
MII has drafted a plan to readjust tariffs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the general level of overall charges for telecom
and postal services will be significantly dropped, according to
well-informed sources.
</P>
<P>
China's telecommunications industry posted a hefty growth rate
of 35.7 percent last year, much higher than the country's
national growth rate of 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, telecom charges remain high due to the virtual
long-term monopoly of the sector. Experts noted that if this
monopoly situation is not broken up, it will eventually hinder
the sustained and prolonged development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the expansion of the telecom network and the
introduction of new technologies, telecom authorities have readj
usted charges on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
In December, 1996, for example, phone installation fees and
international long-distance call charges were reduced, and the
charges for domestic long-distance calls were made simpler.
</P>
<P>
However, it is acknowledged that current telephone charges are
still too high compared with other countries.
</P>
<P>
For example, a phone call from Beijing to New York costs 18.4
yuan (US$2.2) per minute, about 3 times the charge to make the
same call from New York to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Other aspects such as high charges for telecom lines rental
and long distantance calls to Hong Kong and Taiwan, and low costs
for inner city calls still stand in the way of further expansion
of the telecom market.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rebound on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rebounded on
Singapore Stock Market Tuesday after a 80-point plunge Monday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) rose by 19.12 points to
end at 1417.14, again climbing above the 1400 mark.
</P>
<P>
The total volume contracted to 265.79 million units valued at
499.96 million Singapore dollars (297.15 million U.S. dollars).
Gainers outnumbered losers by 214 to 65 with 141 shares unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was a 10.99 million units parcel of SemCorp
which transacted at 2.25 Singapore dollars per share. DBS Land was
the second most heavily traded share with a turnover of 10.05
million units. ST Engg was next with a volume of 9.56 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 was the top mover of the day with a 60-cent gain to
25.50 Singapore dollars. It was followed by Elec &AMP; E that gained
35 cents to close at 5.95 U.S. dollars. OCBC edged up 30 cents to
finish at 7.65 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, DBS F led the falls of the day as it shed 40
cents to 12.60 Singapore dollars. C &AMP; C and Goodwood closed 30
cents lower to 6.40 and 18.70 Singapore dollars respectively. SPH
100 sank 20 cent to end 18.30 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said STI plunged Monday in tandem with regional bourses
on Wall Street's fall last week and rumors about a China's Yuan
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
They noted the speculation of devaluation of China's Yuan
proved to be groundless rumors and collapsed of itself following
solemn clarification by China' central bank -- the People's Bank.
</P>
<P>
They said China's statement to hold the Yuan firm calmed
investors and pushed the STI to its intraday high of 1445.66
points.
</P>
<P>
A rise in the U.S. share market overnight was another factor
leading to the turning-round of the market, they said.

<HEADLINE> Government Suspends Talks With Marcos Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Tuesday that he suspended talks with the family of
the late president Ferdinand Marcos for recovering the family's
alleged ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, President Estrada said that he halted the
preliminary talks with the Marcos family after the three Marcos
children asked the Supreme Court to allow them to pursue the 75-25
deal with the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise agreement reached in 1993 between the
government and the Marcos family, 75 percent of the recovered
Marcos assets would go to the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the Supreme Court voided the deal and declared it as
"unconstitutional" last December, saying the deal should be
approved by the congress.
</P>
<P>
"In as much as it is in the Supreme Court, let the court decide
it. We will just wait for the decision of the Supreme Court,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"Let's leave it to the wisdom of the justices... That's
precisely why they (the Marcos children) filed their petition in
court, for the Supreme Court to decide," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada said that he was willing to forge a compromise
agreement with the Marcoses to hasten the recovery of their
alleged ill-gotten fortune so he could use the money to bankroll
his pro-poor projects.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Supreme Court Rejects Rapist's Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the
Philippines Tuesday denied with finality the motion lodged by a
lawyer of a convicted rapist seeking a reconsideration of its
earlier decision to lift the temporary restraining order (TRO) on
his execution.
</P>
<P>
The court said Leo Echegaray failed to present any new legal
argument to warrant a reversal of the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
The TRO, issued by the court hours before the convict was
scheduled to die by lethal injection on January 4, was meant to
give the congress time to review the death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
But the House of Representatives passed a resolution against
any such review, prompting the tribunal to lift the TRO on January
19.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada welcomed the Supreme Court's decision
denying with finality the last ditch bid of the convicted child
rapist to stop his execution on February 5.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said Estrada views the
ruling as a triumph of the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"The president welcomes this decision of the Supreme Court.
With this development, there is no longer any judicial obstacle
for the law to take its course," Barican said.

<HEADLINE> Official Says Government Loans to PAL Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it will not provide loans to Philippine Airlines
(PAL) to help the national flag-carrier meet the demand of its
creditors for a 100 million dollar "goodwill payment."
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barrican told reporters here
Tuesday afternoon that government financial institutions will not
enter into any loan agreement with PAL "except on a strictly
commercial nature and with the entry of a strategic partner."
</P>
<P>
But he said the creditors of the financially-stripped airline
"do have the option of calling on their loans to the airline."
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation plan of PAL seeks to address these and other
concerns to restore the airline back to viability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Major creditors of the Philippine Airlines (PAL) are planning
to take legal action against the national flag-carrier unless it
makes partial payments on its 2.1 billion dollars of debt by the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin newspaper Tuesday quoted Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Perfecto Yasay as saying that
the creditors are demanding up to 100 million dollars by the end
of January.
</P>
<P>
He said that unless PAL services some of its debts in the next
few days, the creditors will take legal action and will not
approve a management rehabilitation plan to turn the carrier
around.
</P>
<P>
PAL has not made any payments on its debt since last July, when
it was granted a moratorium by the SEC pending approval of a
rehabilitation plan.

High Internet fees, a big headache for most net users and

Due to the monopoly of China Telecom, clients have to pay 200

some 30 times the net-surfing fee in the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Abdullah Assumes Duties as Jordanian Crown Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Prince Abdullah Bin Hussein
assumed duties and responsibilities of the new crown prince of
Jordan early Tuesday morning after King Hussein sacked his
brother Hassan as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
Prince Abdullah should be vested with all rights and privileges
of the crown prince of this Hashemite Kingdom, Hussein said in a
brief Royal Decree issued at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prince Hassan has handed over the Royal Decree of designation
of crown prince to Abdullah at a ceremony at the king`s private
residence in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The move by Hussein to remove Hassan as crown prince is widely
anticipated in Amman as the 63-year-old monarch has given strong
signals of a possible change of his successor since he returned
home on January 19 after a six-month cancer treatment in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Hassan was named the crown prince in 1965 when Hussein ordered
the amendments to the constitution to allow a brother to became
heir apparent to the throne of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said earlier this week he named Hassan as the crown
prince because "there was no other alternative close-by to take
over," since Prince Abdullah was only three years old at that time.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Cable News Network (CNN) on
Monday, Hussein said that he reconsidered the heir to the throne
in the best interests of the kingdom instead of personal
considerations.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp-worded 14-page letter to prince Hassan Monday
night, Hussein accused those unnamed "climbers" around Hassan of
trying to destroy Jordan, and try to divide and politicize the
army.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the letter on major newspapers in Amman
also highlighted for the first time the difference between Hussein
and Hassan over the succession to the throne.
</P>
<P>
"We have differed, and we still do, over the succession,"
Hussein said in the letter to Hassan, adding the conditions that
prevent primogeniture succession no longer existed.
</P>
<P>
The new Crown Prince Abdullah, who turned 37 in January,
is Hussein`s son from his second marriage to Tony Bardiner of
Britain, who adopted the name of Mona Al-Hussein when she
converted to Islam upon her marriage to the king in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is an army major general and in charge of an elite
special force that is responsible for the security of the Royal
Court.

for the new year.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the second project coordination committee meeting
of the International Jute Organization (IJO), Secretary at the
Nepali Ministry of Agriculture Surya Nath Upadhyaya said that the
production of jute has decreased mainly due to competition by
synthetic products.
</P>
<P>
But the production of jute can raise the income of farmers
through extensive dissemination of improved varieties and
technologies, he added.
</P>
<P>
IJO Director Henri Jason said that the production of jute has a
good future in terms of environment protection.
</P>
<P>
He said that the second project coordination committee aims to
transfer the improved varieties and technologies to the
participating countries to raise the income of their farmers.

<P>
At the three-day meeting, the participants from Nepal, India,
China, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand will also review the
research and development activities in the past year.

Sisavat said China is a reliable close neighbor of the Laos,
and at this trans-century juncture, Laos, from a strategic
perspective, hopes to establish long-term and stable relationship

<HEADLINE> China to Publish More Excellent Works in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Yu Youxian, director of the
State Press and Publication Administration, today emphasized that
China's press organizations must publish more excellent works in
1999, in an effort to greet the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference of press and publication
heads that closed here today, Yu said China's publishers must
give priority to completing major works including 100 books and
500 VCDs on prominent Chinese drama and film topics, as well as
multi-media CDs that feature celebrations of the founding
anniversary of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they must go all out to finish publishing projects
to mark the 80th anniversary of the May 4th Movement and the
return of Macao to the motherland in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that China's press and publication sector achieved a
sales volume of 61.5 billion yuan (about 7.4 billion U.S.
dollars) with profits totaling 4.4 billion yuan last year,
despite the ongoing Asian financial crisis and severe floods in
many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
As 1999 imposes hard tasks and demands for the press and
publication organizations in the country, Yu asked them to get on
with their reforms speedily and lay a sound foundation for
China's press industry development in the 21st century.

JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A political alliance of
Botswana's opposition parties has been formed in the country,
Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
SABA quoted Botswana state radio as saying that the new group

</P>
<P>
It said Botswana faces serious economic, political and social
problems, but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
It said efforts to address the problems had always been

<P>
AMMAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein Ibn Talal
Tuesday left here for the United States for emergency medical
examinations again after dethroning crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The departure of the 63-year-old monarch came as a surprise to
most Jordanians, as reports had said that Hussein would leave for
the U.S. for routine physical checks in March.
</P>
<P>
Hussein just returned home on January 19 after a six-month
cancer treatment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The king has said on several occasions that he had "fully
recovered" from the illness after his six-round chemotharapy for
lymphatic cancer at the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the U.S..
</P>
<P>
After his return home, Hussein deposed his brother the Crown
Prince Hassan and throned his oldest son Abdullah as his successor.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, who served as the Crown Prince for the last 34 years,
has been accused of trying to destroy the army and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The new Crown Prince assumed duties and responsibilities as
Hussein's successor as of Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Secret Negotiations with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss Tuesday denied an allegation that Beirut is conducting
"secret negotiations" with Israel on its troops withdraw from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We do not agree with any form of negotiations with Israel on
the implementation of the U.N. Resolution 425," Hoss told the
official National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the resolution, which calls for an immediate
and unconditional Israeli pullout from Lebanon, is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' remarks came one day after Israeli outgoing Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said that some type of talks is being
conducted to reach an agreement with Lebanon over withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later confirmed
Mordechai's remarks, adding that negotiations had been underway
for "a long time" under his guidance.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear if Monday's sudden disclosure of "secret talks"
was political maneuvering in the run-up to the Israeli elections
in May.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been
spearheading a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Israel offered to withdraw its troops from south
Lebanon if Beirut provides security guarantee for Israel's north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its close ally Syria rejected the offer, asking
the Jewish state to withdraw unconditionally in line with the
U.N. Resolution 425.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Computer hackers who broke
into the railway ticket network and forged and sold counterfeit
tickets have been arrested by police in this capital of south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The gang of 51 members had earned 4.4 million yuan from
selling more than 8,000 forged tickets of No. K92 railway line
linking Guangzhou and Shenyang City in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, since May last year.
</P>
<P>
Local police began to track the suspects in June and found the
gang members had divided up their criminal duties.
</P>
<P>
Some specialized in breaking into the computer network of
three tourist companies to steal sleeping-berth allocations.
Others bought short-distance tickets and altered them to
long-distance destinations as well as stealing seat reservation
numbers. They also had special channels to sell the stolen
tickets.
</P>
<P>
The police seized 40,000 yuan from a frozen bank deposit of
310,000 yuan and confiscated equipment such as computers, offset
plates, mobile phones and cars used in the criminal activities.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Estrada Says No War Against MILF Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Tuesday that the on-going offensives by government
forces in Mindanao cover only lawless elements and do not include
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
"I'm not declaring war against them (MILF members). I'm
declaring war against those who violate the law and those who go
against our laws," Estrada told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was reacting to news reports that he had ordered the
military to pound hard against the MILF, following a rebel attack
on a military camp in Maguindanao, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his policy is "if the MILF starts firing
against our soldiers, we will fire back at all costs."
</P>
<P>
"As long as they follow our cease-fire there will be no
offensives, there's nothing to talk about going after them. But as
I said, if they violate our laws, I have no choice but to go after
them," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the government will exhaust all means to
ensure peace in Mindanao, it also has the constitutional duty to
safeguard its citizens and protect public property.
</P>
<P>
The president said he may meet MILF leaders when he goes to
Mindanao on February 23, and that he may stay there for one to two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF are scheduled to resume preliminary
peace negotiations on February 8.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent clashes between government forces and MILF
rebels, the government remains optimistic that the peace talks
will yield positive results, said Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes off From Turkey for Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen U.S. warplanes took
off from Incirlik Air Base in Adana in southern Turkey for
northern Iraq Tuesday morning, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that one tanker, one transport plane and one
AWACS plane also took off from Incirlik at hours between 10:30 and
11:30 a.m. (0830 and 0930 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Following a detailed discussion on Iraq with U.S. Ambassador
Mark Parris Monday, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit stated
that Turkey is reviewing its approach towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Turkey supports the U.S air strikes
against northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies set up no-fly zones in southern and
northern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War, triggered by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, with the claimed aim of shielding the
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warplanes patrolling the zones have been firing
missiles regularly on Iraq's ground targets since the mid-December
air strikes on Iraq for what Washington said punishing it for not
cooperating with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has delivered three Patriot missile batteries to
Incirlik Air Base based on the "developments in northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of the allied forces being stationed
at Incirlik base as part of Operation Northern Watch to patrol
the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.

<P>
GENEVA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday urged the Conference on
Disarmament (CD) to start meaningful negotiations for a fissile
material treaty.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on 61 CD members to "make full use of the mome
ntum thus created, and embark on meaningful negotiations for a
non-discriminatory, multilateral and effectively verifiable
treaty."
</P>
<P>
"By doing so you will greatly help the cause of nuclear
non-proliferation, and the process of general nuclear disarmamen
t," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan also stressed the importance of establishing effective
arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon states against the use
or threat of use of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Security Council Resolutions 225 of 1968 and 984 of 1995,
together with the unilateral declarations made by the five
nuclear-weapon states, provide a good framework for solving this
important issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, further steps are needed to harmonize the unilateral
security guarantees offered by the five nuclear-weapon states in
a single equally-binding instrument, he added.
</P>
<P>
The CD, created in 1978 and working on the basis of consensus,
is holding the first part of its three-part 1999 session between
January 19 and March 26.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China is to introduce a
combined supply administration for its navy, army and air forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Liberation Army Daily", the Central Military
Commission has approved a plan for restructuring the supply admi
nistration of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at cutting back red-tape and providing a
flexible supply of equipment and services. It is the biggest
reform since the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949.
</P>
<P>
The provision of materials, equipment and general services
will be provided by this combined administration force, including
all stores and warehousing, the running of hospitals and the
supply of materials and equipment for the different services of
the military.
</P>
<P>
However, specialist admin units attached to each of the forces
will continue to provide certain medical care services, fuel
supplies for aircraft and ships, as well as handling airports,
military harbor facilities, and emergency food rations for the
army and navy.

<HEADLINE> Removal of Advertising Signs Won't Hurt Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's groundless for some overseas media to report that the
Beijing municipal government has broken contracts by taking down
such signs, because all of them are temporary and all the
contracts expired at the end of last year," added the official.
</P>
<P>
The move, aimed at "cleaning up" the center of Beijing ahead
of the 50th anniversary celebrations of the People's Republic of
China on October 1, will target more than 500 buildings and 300
ad-boards on the avenue, which runs through Tiananmen Square at
the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of alternatives for those companies to
advertise their products along other bustling streets, since many
other downtown areas are still able to accept neon advertising
signs," added the official.
</P>
<P>
As the political and cultural center of the nation, Beijing
has been criticized for the rather overt flourishing of the
commercial culture in its central areas, and many people regard
it as damaging to the image of the capital, which runs counter to
its development plans.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up project along the boulevard, which kicked off
last October, is aimed at transforming Chang'an Avenue into a
"serious, simple, graceful and harmonious" thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that advertising hoardings are banned from
central locations in many overseas metropolises, the official
acknowledged that investors may incur slight losses with the
elimination of such a prominent showcase in central Beijing, but
only in the short term.
</P>
<P>
"But the improvement of the environment in many other cities
has proved to be conducive to attracting overseas investment and
the long-term development of overseas businesses," stressed the
official.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is now home to more than 150 multinationals out of the
top 500 companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We can understand the government decision to remove the neon
signs along the Chang'an Avenue," said an advertising agent for
Japan's Toshiba company. "Although the fame of the avenue has
attracted many companies to set up ad-boards there, the signs are
incompatible with the avenue's image," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony
Blair is considering nominating former Hong Kong governor Chris
Patten as European Union (EU) commissioner, a British newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Guardian report said other European Union governments
confirmed on Monday that they have been told "at a very high
level" by British government that Patten, a former chairman of
the Conservative Party who is pro-European, "would be nominated
in the near future."
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper also quoted British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook as saying that "no final decision has yet been taken on what
is clearly a very important and serious appointment."
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the European agenda is now so important for Britain
that the national interest requires that we send a very strong
commissioner," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
If nominated, Patten, who has expressed interest in the job,
would replace Sir Leon Brittan, one of Britain's two EU
commissioners, at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
It had been strongly expected that the job had been reserved
for Conservative member of parliament Sir Alastair Goodland, the
Guardian said.
</P>
<P>
Blair would risk a major row in parliament for defying the
Conservative Party wishes by nominating Patten, the report said.

MAPUTO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Preparatory committees are being
 established throughout Mozambique to make preparations for the
30th anniversary of the death of Eduardo Mondlane, the first
chairman of Mozambican Liberation Front (Frelimo), on the Hero's
Day which falls on February 3.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias daily published here quoted Bernardo Cherinda,
Mozambican Frelimo National Mobilization and Propaganda Secretary
as saying Monday that mass rallies and various cultural and sports
activities will be held in memory of the national hero who gave
his life to the independence of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Memorial activities will last for a whole year in a bid to
carry forward Mondlane's spirit, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Frelimo will also have a monument of him erected in
front of the headquarters building of the party.
</P>
<P>
Mondlane's family members said that some VIPs like South
African President Nelson Mandela, Ugandan President Yowery
Museveni and Zambia's former President Kenneth Kaunda, Tanzania's
former President Julius Nyerere will be invited to the memorial
activities.
</P>
<P>
Mondlane was killed in Tanzania on February 3, 1969 by a letter
bomb allegedly done by the Portuguese colonialists who then had
their rule in the country. February 3 was named as the Hero's Day
of Mozambique after it won its independence in 1975.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to
increase investment in water control this year in the wake of
severe summer flooding in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to issue special bonds for water control
projects and environment protection along rivers this year, in
addition to funds already budgeted.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned this from a working meeting of an inspection
group, jointly organized by the Ministry of Water Resources and
the State Development Planning Commission. But the officials did
not specify the amount of special bonds to be issued this year
for water control use.
</P>
<P>
The group is to inspect water control facilities along the
Yellow River, and its officials have urged the local authorities
to increase efforts on water control before the rainy season
comes.
</P>
<P>
China plans to invest 1.67 billion yuan for water control
projects along the Yellow River this year, which will be used to
conserve water and prevent soil erosion at the upper and middle
reaches, fortify the dams, and clear up silting.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Apply for More Patents in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Patent applications submitted
by foreign companies in China reached 23,602 during the first 11
months of last year, representing a nine percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Songyu, general manager of China Patent Agent (Hong
Kong) Company Ltd., attributed the growth to foreign investors'
confidence in China's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that intellectual property rights always accompany
investment and trade. The total number of patent applications
reached 109,719 during the first 11 months of last year and was
due to China's stable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Increasing foreign companies that have invested in China have
now realized the importance of protecting their intellectual
property rights (IPR) since China has begun enforcing those
rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Zheng, the top three patent applicants were Japan
with over 8,600 applications, the United States with some 5,800
applications, and Germany with 2,290-plus applications. The
increase in patent applications from the three countries all
surpassed 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
China originally had only three agents, authorized in the
early 1980s, dealing with patent applications from foreigners but
the number had increased to 14 by the end of last year.

PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Young hooligans burned a dozen
cars during pre-dawn hours on Tuesday in the suburbs of the
northern city of Rouen, said officials on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
No one was killed or injured in the violence which began at
midnight until 4 o'clock in Canteleu near Rouen, reported Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected that the violence was linked with the death
of an 18-year-old man, Abdelaziz El Ouali, whose body was found
buried in a working class district of Canteleu last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police said El Ouali could have been killed in a settling of
account among drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, the French government and the media
have been debating how to better prevent and fight increasing
crime committed by teenagers living in the relatively poor
suburbs of cities.

<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in China
resumed growth in 1998 despite the Asian financial crisis,
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shi made his comments at a national conference on foreign
trade and economic cooperation which opened here on Tuesday. He
pointed out that overseas investment in China has resumed growth
following two years' decline in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment in contractual volume reached 52.132 b
illion U.S. dollars, up 2.21 percent from 1997. The amount of
materialized investment hit 45.582 billion U.S. dollars,
maintaining a continuous growth of 0.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of newly-approved overseas investment projects
declined 5.7 percent in 1998, reaching 19,846.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the total number of overseas projects in
China added up to more than 324,000, involving a contractual
investment of 572.52 billion U.S. dollars. The arrived investment
totaled 267.45 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Investment from the European Union, America and some free-port
zones all continued to increase last year, with the proportion of
investment in industrial projects rising some 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, overseas investment in the central and western
areas of China grew much faster than in the eastern parts of
China. While the central and western parts reported a contractual
investment volume of 7.33 billion U.S. dollars, up 10.9 percent,
overseas investment in the eastern part of China only climbed
0.01 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- World No.1 Lindsay Davenport
won a controversial Australian Open quarter-final over fifth seed
Venus Williams in Melbourne on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Davenport advanced 6-4, 6-0 and will meet unseeded Amelie
Mauresmo of France in a semi final.
</P>
<P>
However, Williams was clearly upset after a point was awarded
against her because several beads fell from her platted hair.
</P>
<P>
The decision could not have come at a worse time as it meant
she lost serve in the third game of the second set.
</P>
<P>
She disputed the decision with tournament referee Peter
Bellenger for several minutes without luck and walked to her end
with tears streaming down her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
It's the second consecutive year that Williams has been
bundled out by Davenport in the quarter final in Melbourne,
however last year the match lasted three sets.

</P>
<P>
It took seven years for the constitution to be made, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a signatory to the U.N. Charter and that of African Unity,
Uganda attaches great importance to basic human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
No one including the leaders is above the constitution and it
is the duty of every Ugandan citizen to be governed by it.
</P>
<P>
He said that transparency, rule of law and accountability are
the basic essentials of democracy.
</P>
<P>
In his 20-minute speech, the 54-year-old president also
explained the making of local laws and other regulations.
</P>
<P>
The NRM was formed in 1981 and took power after more than four
years' painstaking struggle. It has been the ruling party of this
east African country since then.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov has proposed a compromise between President Boris
Yeltsin and the legislature to ensure Russia's stability.
</P>
<P>
Primakov hoped, in a letter to the State Duma (the lower house
of parliament) circulated Monday night, that the legislature
could consider a draft political agreement with the president,
Interfax reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft proposed by Primakov, Yeltsin should pledge
not to use his right to dissolve the Duma and the government
while the Duma should drop its impeachment proceedings against
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Russia's political situation has been troubled by an intense
power struggle between the Duma, dominated by the Communist
Party, and the president.
</P>
<P>
"If you approve the approach proposed, I could coordinate the
draft agreement with the president," Primakov said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Primakov planned to
discuss the proposal with faction leaders at the beginning of
next week.

<HEADLINE> High Price, Low Speed Impede People's Access to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Many Internet users in China
are unhappy with the high charges, low speed and narrow
information sources.
</P>
<P>
 A survey carried out by the China Computer Association found
that nearly one third of people polled, or 31.5 percent, consider
the high fees as a major impediment to their Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Almost a quarter, or 24.6 percent, expressed dissatisfaction
with the low speed which some users said was as "slow as a
snail".
</P>
<P>
And over one fifth, or 21.6 percent, complained that there
was few useful information about China on the net.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the first two problems were attributed to the
monopoly held by China' domestic telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China inputs only 0.01 percent and outputs 0.05
percent of all information offered on the Internet as a whole.
And much of that information is of no benefit to net users.
</P>
<P>
Computer experts point out that the development and use of
information resources is very weak in China's information
infrastructure. Thus, the enthusiasm of Internet users is
restrained and Internet servers are experiencing serious
management difficulties, and as a result information services on
line are declining.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
slightly wounded in south Lebanon on Tuesday in a clash with
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said the two soldiers were wounded when they
were patrolling in the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied
border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has issued a
statement claiming responsibility for the attack, saying at least
four members of the Israeli patrol were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The incident raised to three the number of the Israeli
soldiers wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been leading the country's
resistance movements to oust Israeli occupying forces and its
proxy South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns U.S. Missile Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi Tuesday condemned the U.S. air strikes
on Iraq Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asefi also expressed concern over escalation of tension in the
region due to the U.S. military actions against Iraq, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes raided residential quarters in and around
the southern Iraqi city of Basra, the Basra airport and the north
Rumaila oil field Monday, killing 11 people and injuring at
least 58 others.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the U.S. warplanes hit residential
quarters in Iraq since the mid-December air strikes aimed at
punishing what Washington said Baghdad's failure to fully
cooperate with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Basra, 550 kilometers south of Baghdad, is part of the no-fly
zone in southern Iraq, which was set up by the U.S. and its allies
to protect the rebellious Shiite Muslims following the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces also established a no-fly zone in northern
Iraq with a claimed aim of shielding Kurds from the suppression
of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warplanes patrolling the zone have fired missiles at
Iraqi targets from time to time since the mid-December bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Washington has claimed that U.S. warplanes launched the attack
Monday after they were tracked by Iraqi ground radar.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military official Monday expressed regret that some
civilians were killed or injured in the attack, admitting that
U.S. warplanes may have misfired and at least one high-explosive
missile may have killed civilians in and around Basra.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible we did have a missile that did not perform as
expected," said General Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces
in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Urges Moratorium on Regional Territorial Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Tuesday urged an immediate moratorium on territorial
disputes within Russia.
</P>
<P>
At a national conference on the advancement of federal
relations, he said about 30 territorial claims have been made
from one region to another, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Primakov disagreed with the idea of decentralization, saying
it was impermissible "to give the status of national borders
inside the federation."
</P>
<P>
"The improvement of federal relations and the strengthening
of the Russian state system is the single task today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the constitution declares Russia a country
governed by democratic law but "this is not the recognition of a
fait accompli but an objective which we should reach."
</P>
<P>
"A federation is not only the optimal form of regime for
Russia but also the only possibility of preserving and
strengthening the country's unity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PM To Visit Russia for Regular Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji will
pay an official visit to Russia in February, the new Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier will meet his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny
Primakov, and exchange views on issues of common concern in this
fourth regular meeting between prime ministers of the two
countries, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The new spokeswoman, 40, has also made a positive comment on
the four-party talks on the Korean Peninsula, which has just
concluded in Geneva with the participation of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, China and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have achieved positive progress, and the major
achievement is that two working groups on the establishment of a
peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula and on easing tension
there have been launched," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"The two working groups have already started concrete
discussions, and a common understanding has also been reached on
the operational procedures in the future," said the spokeswoman.
She expressed the hope that relevant sides will proceed from the
peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and further push
forward the four-party talks based on the already achieved
results.
</P>
<P>
The new spokeswoman also reaffirmed that China will uphold the
value of its currency, the Renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
The policy of the Chinese government of not devaluating the
RMB yuan has already been emphasized here and on other occasions,
the spokeswoman said. "China encountered great difficulties and
made great sacrifices last year, but we have followed this
policy."
</P>
<P>
"The country will continue to uphold this policy in 1999," she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also expressed the hope that Arab countries will
strengthen consultation and coordinate their stances so as to
contribute to world and regional peace and stability. She made
the remark when commenting on the emergency meeting of foreign
ministers of the Arab League which was convened on January 24 in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Zhang, the third spokeswoman for the ministry since its
founding, studied at Beijing Foreign Studies University from 1978
to 1982. A simultaneous interpreter, Zhang served in the United
Nations Secretariat, New York Headquarters and the UN Office in
Geneva from 1983 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has worked in the ministry's Department of International
Organizations and Conference, and the Permanent Mission of China
to the UN ever since.

ADDIS ABABA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Customs
Authority said it has collected over 1,217 million Birr (162
million U.S. Dollars) in revenue during the past half budget year
beginning from July 8, 1998, 167.7 million Birr (22.3 million
Dollars) more than the same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to Tuesday's paper the Ethiopian Herald, the revenues
were collected from various tax sources including customs duties,
excise and sales taxes as well as coffee export taxes.
</P>
<P>
Among the revenues, 35.9 million Birr (4.78 million U.S.
Dollars) were collected from fines imposed on contraband goods
seized at eight check points across the nation.
</P>
<P>
However, the six-month collection was 14.1 percent below the
target performance due to the low volume imports and the fall in
world coffee prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has denied a report that it
will pardon a German businessman called Helmut Hofer, who was
sentenced to death for having sex out of wedlock with an Iranian
Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
The recent report by German news agency DPA said Hofer might
be freed under an amnesty to be announced on the occasion of the
20th anniversary of the Islamic revolution next month.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency on Tuesday quoted an
informed source at the Justice Ministry as saying Hofer's case is
proceeding at court in line with the laws of the country.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September, 1997 and was sentenced to
death in January, 1998 on the charge of having illegal sexual
relations with an Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
Iranian laws banned relations between a non-Muslim man and a
Muslim woman. However, Hofer argued he has converted to Islam
before having an affair with the Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said on
Monday Germany is trying to convince Iran to release Hofer and
German Chancellery Minister Bodo Hombach will visit Iran in
February over the issue.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Railways to Sell Land for Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Railways (KR)
Corporation is selling part of its land to raise funds for staff
retrenchment, KR managing director Eric Nyamunga has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Monday at a seminar organized by the International
Union of Railways in Nairobi, Nyamunga said the KR required one
billion Shillings (around 16 million U.S. Dollars) to pay its
6,400 workers under the on-going program.
</P>
<P>
He said 3,000 workers had retired in the two-phase retrenchment
program. The pensionable staff will be paid a monthly pension and
those non- pensionable will be given half their current salary
until the terminal benefits are fully paid.
</P>
<P>
The KR had identified land which, if sold, could fetch the one
billion Shillings, he said, adding that his corporation was faced
with stiff competition from road transporters.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Transport Minister William Ole Ntimama told the seminar
that his ministry would welcome any "home-grown initiative" aimed
at removing the railway expenditure from the government budget
within the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
He urged local and foreign investors to continue investing in
the railways sub-sector, particularly in the development of
infrastructure, and appealed for investment from large volume
long-distance freight transporters such as shipping and freight
agents in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Oman Destroys Pirated Cassettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Heaps of video and audio
cassettes have been burnt in a bid to stop copyright piracy in
Oman, the Gulf News daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Heritage and Culture, responsible for
censorship, joined hands with the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry to ensure that no illicit cassettes remained in the
country in conformity with the Copyright Law, the Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two ministries watched as a huge pile of
cassettes went up in flames on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cassette dealers were given six months to put their shops in
order after the adoption of copyright laws in June.
</P>
<P>
They tried to dispose of the material quickly, selling it at
throwaway prices. They were, nevertheless, left with big stocks
which were finally collected by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
And a good many shops, unable to cope with the new
requirements, had to put down their shutters.
</P>
<P>
But the government's job is far from over. It has yet to
cleanse the computer software market.
</P>
<P>
Adherence to international copyright laws is an essential
pre-requisite for a country wanting to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Oman, which applied for membership in 1996, hopes to join
the organization by the middle of this year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects European Parliament' Resolution over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran has turned down a
resolution adopted by the European Parliament (EP) on the recent
political murders of several Iranian dissidents, Iranian Tehran
Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily that Iran has sent back a
copy of the resolution handed over to the Iranian Embassy in
Belgium by the EP, which called on the Iranian officials to
clarify the issue of the killings.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has refused to accept the letter, which contains
baseless claims about the issue," the source said. "This is a
blatant interference in internal affairs of Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also denied the report on the dispatch of an EP envoy to
Iran to investigate the murders.
</P>
<P>
Darius Forouhar, leader of the opposition Iran Nation Party,
and his wife were stabbed to death at home and at least three
dissident writers were found dead following mysterious missing
late last year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry announced earlier this month that
some of its "willful" agents were involved in the killings. The
revelation shocked both Iranian society and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
International human rights groups have demanded dispatch of
envoys to Iran to investigate the murders, but Iranian authorities
rejected the demands and claimed that Iran has the capability to
find out the root of the killings.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, the moderates backing President Mohammad Khatami
have since called for a fundamental change in the country's
security and intelligence organs under the control of the
conservatives, and the hardliners counterattacked by claiming that
supporters of Khatami were behind the killings.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot, Lebanon Tackles Illegal Immigrants Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Interior Minister Dinos
Mikhaelides is currently on a visit to Lebanon in a bid to settle
down the illegal immigration which have strained bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who arrived in Beirut on Monday, is to hold talks
with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss and his Lebanese
counterpart Michel Murr on the issue on Tuesday, the Daily Star
reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Cypriot officials threatened to "review"
relations with Lebanon after the latter refused to accept illegal
immigrants arrested just off the southeastern coast of Cyprus
January 13.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government had described the case as "extremely
dangerous" and said that it will take the issue up with the
European community to seek collective measures against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beirut took back only six of the 29 immigrants because they had
legal Lebanese entry papers, and refused to accept the rest of
them.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss the issue within the framework of the
friendly relations that we have with Lebanon and I'm sure
that we'll reach an understanding," Mikhaelides said.
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget that Lebanon and Cyprus have had traditionally
friendly relations for many years," he added.

<HEADLINE> Pak, Turkmenian FMs Call for End to Afghan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkmenian Foreign
Ministers Boris Shikhmuradov Tuesday stated here that his country
wanted to work closely with Pakistan for an early ending of the
Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who arrived here Monday evening for a
two-day official visit to Pakistan, held talks Tuesday morning
with his Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz with a focus on the
situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on the urgency of restoring durable peace
and stability in that country, which would open up enormous
possibilities of economic and commercial cooperation between
Pakistan and Turkmenistan, said a Foreign Office statement.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their complete support for the efforts by the
United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to
bring peace and normalcy to war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on the proposed
meeting of the "Six Plus Two" in Tashkent on the "Points of Common
Understanding" reached by the foreign ministers of the group in
September 1998 in New York, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the positive response of the Taliban to some of
the elements in the "Points of Common Understanding" and expressed

militia.

The "Six Plus Two" group consists of the six countries with
common border with Afghanistan plus Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two foreign ministers also stressed the
need to take steps to further enhance bilateral cooperation in

<HEADLINE> Record Tourism Season for Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite the financial crisis
in Asia last year, Zhejiang Province in east China had a record
breaking tourist season, according to the provincial tourism
bureau.
</P>
<P>
The province hosted 819,600 overseas tourists and 42 million
domestic tourists in 1998, an increase of one percent and five
percent over 1997, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zhejiang earned a total of 35.65 billion yuan from
its tourism industry, a 16.4 percent rise, accounting for seven
percent of the province's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange earned from overseas tourism stood at 360
million U.S. dollars, up 4.3 percent, while earnings from
domestic tourism reached 32.7 billion yuan, an increase of 17.7
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The results were attributed to the measures adopted by the
local tourism departments to expand markets in Japan, Australia,
New Zealand, France, Russia and the United States as southeast
Asian countries were hit by a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province launched new tourism destinations in
cooperation with neighboring Jiangsu Province in order to attract
more domestic tourists.
</P>
<P>
At present, Zhejiang has 380 restaurants and hotels which are
authorized to receive foreign tourists and 465 travel agencies.
The number of people engaged in the tourism industry stands at
575,000.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Takes Lead in Ningxia's Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Animal husbandry has become
the most vigorous industry in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, with its 1998 output value accounting for 33
percent of the total agricultural output value.
</P>
<P>
The output value of animal husbandry increased 14 percent
annually on average in the past six years, and reached 2.3
billion yuan last year. Farmers' per capita income from that
reached 530 yuan, making up more than 40 percent of their total
in 1998, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is one of the ten largest areas of pastureland in
China. It has 3 million hectares of natural grassland. Animal
husbandry, however, developed very slowly, with its output value
reaching only 200 million yuan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the regional government exerted great efforts to
develop the processing and circulation of animal husbandry
products, build large-scale production bases, and set up a number
of special animal husbandry markets to help the industry take off.
</P>
<P>
The number of cattle, sheep, and hens raised in Ningxia has
also increased by big margins in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that technological advance contributed about 40
percent to the increase of the output value of the animal
husbandry.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Put Liberian President on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister
Ignatius Olisemeka has said in Freetown that his government will
do everything possible to put Liberian President Charles Taylor on
trial for backing the rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria "will do everything (it) can with the help of the
international community to bring people like Charles Taylor and
his collaborators to justice," media reports Tuesday quoted him as
saying while meeting with Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah Monday.
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka said he is speaking for Nigerian leader General
Abdulsalami Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The minister arrived in the Sierra Leonean capital Monday to
assess the situation in that country, where the Nigerian-led west
African peace keeping force ECOMOG has been fighting against rebel
troops for the control of Freetown since January 6.
</P>
<P>
Together with him are the Nigerian Chief of Defense Staff, Air
Marshal Al Amin Daggash, as well as Sierra Leone's ambassador to
Nigeria, Joe Blel.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels launched their
offensive last October and eventually captured the whole northern
half of the country, before they attacked and entered Freetown on
January 6.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were chased out of Freetown by ECOMOG last week but
remain active on the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and its allies, including the United States and
Britain, have repeatedly accused Liberia, Burkina Faso and other
countries of supporting the rebels in the form of arms supply and
mercenaries.

<P>
CHANGSHA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A 4-story private house under
construction in Changsha County in central China's Hunan Province
collapsed yesterday afternoon, leaving three people dead and
seven injured.
</P>
<P>
The ten victims were the only people at the construction site,
when the accident happened at 2:30. They included nine
construction workers and the wife of the house owner. They were
dug out from the ruins by a rescue team early this morning.
</P>
<P>
An initial investigation indicates that Peng Fujun, the house
owner, may be responsible for the tragedy. He had changed the
construction design by reducing the number of reinforcing bars in
the prefabricated parts and used cheap construction materials.
</P>
<P>
Peng ignored warnings and advice about the potential danger on
several occasions and insisted on having his own way. Work was
progressing on the roof and ceilings, when the prefabricated
parts cracked suddenly and triggered the accident.
</P>
<P>
The county government has started a thorough examination on
construction quality and construction material market in the
Xinsha Development Zone to prevent similar such accidents.

<HEADLINE> 2 Australians and a New Zealander Arrive at South Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Australians and a New
Zealander Tuesday successfully reached the South Pole after 84
days trekking Antarctica's harsh landscape.
</P>
<P>
Australians Eric Philips, Jon Muir and New Zealander Peter
Hillary reached the South Pole at 3.17pm (Australian East Standard
Time) Tuesday, Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The trio faced blizzards, frostbite and illness on the 1,425km
journey.
</P>
<P>
They had initially planned a return journey unassisted to the
pole, retracing Captain Robert Scott's ill-fated 1911 trip which
ended in the death of all the party.
</P>
<P>
However, blizzards kept the IceTrek team tent-bound for several
days, disrupting their tight schedule.
</P>
<P>
The team decided to abandon the return trek and opted to be
flown from the South Pole to New Zealand's Scott Base.
</P>
<P>
"A small contingent from the American base were there to meet
us when we reached the South Pole. They had a camera and took a
few photos for us," Hillary said on arrival.
</P>
<P>
"Then we found a quiet spot to reflect on our shared experience
and put up our own ceremonial south pole.
</P>
<P>
"It's a piece of driftwood Jon Muir brought all the way from
the Victorian coastline."
</P>
<P>
Hillary is the son of Edmund Hillary who was the first
westerner to climb Mt Everest. Muir's wife Brigitte also achieved
fame climbing Mt Everest.
</P>
<P>
Expedition spokesman Marc Spendlove said the three men would
have a shower and a meal at the station Tuesday night and would be
flown out to Scott Base Wednesday, returning to Christchurch on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We're relieved they are there and that they are safe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They'll have to sleep in their tents at the South Pole tonight
because of a lack of accommodation at the pole station."
</P>
<P>
Hillary, Muir and Philips left Scott Base, New Zealand's
Antarctic station on McMurdo Sound, on November 4 to ski and walk
to the pole, pioneering a new route via the Shackleton Glacier.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Culture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are some facts and
figures about the development of ethnic culture in the Tibet
Autonomous Region:
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are over 50 Tibetan studies institutes all
over the country, with over 2,000 people engaged in such research
and related auxiliary work. The state has set up the Chinese
Center for Tibetan Studies in the nation's capital of Beijing,
and there are a dozen Tibetan studies institutes in Tibet itself,
which have completed over 100 significant research projects.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Tibetan studies institutes in China have held
more than 60 seminars, single- or multi-disciplinary, on Tibetan
history, language, religion, ethnology, philosophy, literature,
art, education, calendar and traditional medicine. More than 300
significant projects have been completed and more than 400 books
on Tibetan studies have been published or are about to be
published.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language is a main course of study at all schools
in Tibet as well as in special Tibetan classes and schools in
other parts of the country. Tibetan students are required to read
and write the Tibetan language proficiently upon graduation from
middle schools. Tibet has finished the editing and translation of
500 kinds of primary and middle school textbooks for the
compulsory education stage. The editing, translating into Tibetan
and publishing of a catalogue of technical materials has started,
as has the work on the collection and collation of technical
materials in the Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the standardization and modernization of
information processing in Tibetan, the region has been working on
drawing up international standards for Tibetan character coding
using information technology since 1994, which has received
strong support from related departments of the state.
</P>
<P>
The research project was approved at the conference of
international standards verification for multi-language coding
held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1996. This has laid a good
foundation for Tibetan-language access to modern information
processing and network exchange. In 1995 a committee for the
standardization of Tibetan terminology was set up to standardize
the Tibetan language and social terms.

Autonomous Region, and Tibetan medicine is available in over 60
hospitals at the county level. At present, Tibetan medicine
establishments at all levels throughout Tibet give over 500,000
out-patient consultations annually. A total of 100,000 kg in over
350 varieties of finished Tibetan pharmaceuticals are produced
each year. Some one dozen types of valuable Tibetan herbs have
won national gold or silver medals or prizes at international
conferences on traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
The work to systematically investigate, collect, record,
collate, study, compile and publish the traditional cultural
heritage of Tibet on a large scale is continuing apace.
</P>
<P>
With over 800,000 words and some 300 pictures, the Chinese
Drama: Tibetan Volume was published in December, 1993. The
1.37-million-word Collections of Chinese Folk Songs: Tibetan
Volume was published in 1995. A 10-volume collection of Tibetan
folk and religious arts is to be published one volume at a time.
</P>
<P>
The popular "Life of King Gesar," the oral epic of the Tibetan
people handed down for generations by ballad singers, has been
included in the Region's key research projects, with a special
institute founded to take charge of collecting more than 5,000
cassettes and several hundred video tapes dealing with the epic.
In addition, over 40 million words have been collated, and more
than 1,000 research papers and over 30 books on the "Life of King
Gesar" have been published.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the early 1990s, the survey of traditional relics
in the Tibet Autonomous Region was almost finished, with cultural
relics found in 1,768 places. Large numbers of rare cultural
relics have been put under full protection.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s the State Council has put 18 key historical
sites in Tibet under state protection and determined 67 key
historical sites under regional protection. The famous Potala
Palace was added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1994.
The Tibet Autonomous Region Archives is one of the best
establishments for keeping local archives in China. The Tibetan
Museum, funded by the state to the tune of more than 90 million
yuan and with a total floor space of 22,500 sq m, opened in
October, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's air quality could
improve hugely if suggested plans for constructing a large nature
and forest reserve on the upper reaches of the Miyun Reservoir
are given the green light.
</P>
<P>
According to Ji Yanshou, deputy director of the China
Biodiversity Conservation Fund (CBCF), if the area, which is also
a major source of the capital's water supply, is transformed in
this way it will conserve much needed water, regulate the climate
and act as the 'lungs' of the city.
</P>
<P>
A study into the biodiversity and sustained usage of the
Labagou Forest which skirts the reservoir is being carried out by
the CBCF involving environmental experts, professors and college
students.
</P>
<P>
Ji, speaking at a press conference in Beijing today, revealed
that the CBCF, a non-governmental organization which attempts to
improve public awareness of nature and the need for biodiversity
protection, has submitted a proposal to the Beijing Municipality
Government detailing how such a nature reserve would be of huge
benefit to the region.
</P>
<P>
CBCF was founded in April 1997 and so far has proposed seven
projects to the World Bank and European Union's Beijing offices
seeking international cooperation in biodiversity protection.

CSPC sold a total power volume of 410 billion kwh, up six
percent, and absorbed contracted overseas investment of 1.79
billion U.S. dollars up 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country will step up construction of the urban and rural
power transmission grids, and give priority to developing 87
urban grid projects and 1,590 rural ones.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China intends to restructure its power generation
industry by closing small thermal power plants with high coal
consumption and low efficiency.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, small thermal power generators with a
total capacity of 2.84 million kw, which were the cause of severe
pollution, had been forced to cease their operations.

<HEADLINE> China Determined to Eliminate Excess Production Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) has drafted a list of production capacities,
techniques and products which will be eliminated in a bid to
reduce severe overproduction plaguing the country's industries.
</P>
<P>
The list will be implemented following State Council approval.
</P>
<P>
Overproduction has been the primary reason for low returns and
losses suffered by industrial enterprises and must be dealt with
immediately, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the State Statistics Bureau
revealed that the use ratio of production capacities, including
equipment, for close to half of 900-odd major industrial products
has reduced to below 60 percent, with the lowest level dropping
to 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The idle equipment problem continues to plague wide-ranging
industries, including the textile, steel, color television,
bicycle and container manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the overproduction problem has failed to halt the
blind introduction of new projects in various sectors. For
example, China's color television production capacity hit 44.67
million units in 1995, with total output for the year standing at
only 20.58 units and the use ratio standing at a mere 46.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The coexistence of excess production capacities and obsolete
equipment, as well as outdated techniques and low economic scales
accounts for China's irrational industrial structure," according
to one analyst.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the overproduction capacity for many machinery
products, China is still forced to spend vast amounts of foreign
currency to import complete sets of equipment and key products
which are in short supply. The case is also true with various
rubber products such as motor vehicle tires and steel
products.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Largest Park Under Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has sped up the pace
of constructing Chaoyang Park, which will be larger than the
famed Summer Palace park situated in the northwest part of
Beijing and currently the capital's biggest.
</P>
<P>
The new park is adjacent to the foreign embassy zone of
eastern Beijing and eight km away from Tian'anmen Square. Work
began in 1984.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Yunxiang, general manager of the Chaoyang
Park Development and Operation Corporation, the new park will
have a total area of 320 hectares; 13 hectares more than the area
of the Summer Palace. It will be a multi-purpose park, which
will boast 67 hectares of lakes, four times that of Beihai Park
in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
So far work has been completed on a range of entertainment f
acilities, a number of forestry areas, and several cultural,
tourist and catering venues.
</P>
<P>
Four new scenic sites and nine fountains will be added to the
park this year, Zhang said, adding that the entire park will be
finished by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Ends Visit to Madagascar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTANANRIVO, MADAGASCAR, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
Vice-President Hu Jintao Tuesday wound up his three-day official
visit to Madagascar and left here by special plane.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president, who came here on January 23 as
guest of the Malagasy government, will proceed to Ghana to
continue his 13-day four- nation African tour which aims to "make
friends, increase understanding, deepen friendship and expand
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Seeing Hu off at the airport was Malagasy Prime Minister
Tantely Andrianarivo and some other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the same plane for Ghana included Hu's entourage who
were accompanying him on the three-day Madagascar tour.
</P>
<P>
During the visit here, Hu called on Malagasy President Didier
Ratsiraka, met National Assembly President Ange C.F.
Andrianarisoa, and had working talks with Andrianarivo on
promoting bilateral ties, and on international and regional issues
of shared concern.
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening, Andrianarivo presided over a ceremony to
offer Hu an honorary medal "grand cross" and three other medals to
three vice-ministers who are accompanying Hu on the visit.
</P>
<P>
The two nations also signed two documents: one on economic and
technological cooperation, and the other on China's supply of
preferential loans to Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that Hu's first African trip would serve to
push the Sino- Malagasy friendly relations of cooperation onto a
new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
Hu is one of the top Chinese leaders to visit Africa in recent
years, following the African trips by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng and Zhu
Rongji.
</P>
<P>
The other two African nations that Hu will soon visit after his
Ghanaian trip are Cote D'ivoire and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Advanced Naval Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese military scientist
has reportedly developed an advanced cannon which will enable
naval vessels to switch from ship-to-air to ship-to-ship shells
in only 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The new cannon reduces the time required for the changeover
from three minutes to a world record of 10 seconds, according to
military experts.
</P>
<P>
Chinese weapons experts have hailed the invention as "a
miracle" in the realm of military weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily reported that the cannon passed an
assessment carried out earlier this month in Beijing by 40
weapons experts. The invention has also elevated China to the
forefront in the development large-bore cannons for naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the accident risk coefficient for the new
weapon has been reduced to zero.
</P>
<P>
Kang Li, a naval engineer, developed the cannon over an eight
year period.
</P>
<P>
Kang has worked out over 1,000 software programs and
established a complete mathematical and physical models to ensure
safe firing and greatly reduce the reloading time.
</P>
<P>
Kang has published more than 30 papers in academic magazines
and a number of his new techniques have been included in military
training manuals.

<P>
NANCHANG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi
Province, an area hit heavily by last summer's record flooding
along the Yangtze River, plans to invest 56 billion yuan in fixed
assets this year, up 18 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the province's largest investment program in
history is to achieve 9-10 growth in this year's gross domestic
product (GDP), according to Deputy Governor Huang Zhiquan.
</P>
<P>
The program will also emphasize efficiency needed to optimize
the economic structure, said Huang.
</P>
<P>
The capital will mainly go to the sectors of agriculture,
forestry, water conservancy, transportation, power,
telecommunications and urban infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Key projects include the second phase project to harness
Poyang Lake, the reinforcement of Yangtze River levees, the

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Three adventurers from New
Zealand and Australia finally reached the South Pole Tuesday
afternoon after a trek of 84 days and nearly 1,500 kilometers,
the Television New Zealand (TVNZ) reported.
</P>
<P>
It has been one of the toughest treks in history through one of
the world's most hostile environments. Along the way, New
Zealander Peter Hillary and Australians Jon Muir and Eric Philips
have conquered bad weather, illness and frostbite.
</P>
<P>
The trio left New Zealand's scientific research station, Scott
Base on Ross Island, on November 4. They originally planned to
use 100 days during Antarctica's summer in their journey to the
South Pole and then return to the Antarctic coast.
</P>
<P>
However, bad weather and illness have left them way behind
schedule, forcing the cancellation of the return journey.
</P>
<P>
The team will be picked up at the South Pole and airlifted back
to Scott Base.
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to be here," Hillary was speaking by satellite
telephone from the South Pole. He told the TVNZ the first thing he
was looking forward to was "a wash".

COLOMBO, Janaury 26 (Xinhua) -- Top Asian sprinter Susantika
Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka will possibly face a two-year suspension
for testing positive for doping, a newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News pointed out that even after serving the ban,
Jayasinghe could still compete at the Olympic Games in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the country's athletics body has been informed

recommending to its International Arbitration Panel that
Jayasinghe be banned for two years from the date she tested
positive.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, now training in the United States, won a silver
medal in the 200 meters at the 1997 world championships in Athens.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Continues Bid for WTO Top Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand seemed undaunted in
its bid for the top post of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
despite the U.S. refusal to back a Thai official and a split in
the EU over his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Members of the largest world trade body have been busy
choosing a new director-general to replace Italy's Renato
Ruggiero, whose term expires at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The United States has expressed support for Roy Maclaren,
Canada's high commissioner in London, as the WTO's new chief,
while EU countries are split on north-south lines over Thailand's
bid to secure the WTO top job.
</P>
<P>
Among the generally more free trade-oriented northern EU
states, including Britain, Maclaren is widely regarded as the
strongest candidate. But southern EU states such as France, Italy
and Spain, with traditional close ties to north Africa, have
indicated that they will support Morocco's Hassan Abouyoub.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and New
Zealand's former premier Michael Moore are also on the candidacy
list.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, also Thailand's Commerce Minister, has said the race
for the job of the director-general was close and complicated by
the European divisions.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure (about the EU's position) but I want the EU to
have unity for the benefit and development of world trade,"
Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
He said he gave himself no more than a 50 percent chance of
winning the WTO top post.
</P>
<P>
Supachai had emerged as an early favorite to get the job after
a straw poll of delegations at the WTO's Geneva headquarters last
week.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by Swiss ambassador William Rossier,
revealed that Supachai already had the support of 40 delegations.
That put him well ahead of his main rival, Abouyoub, who was
backed by 23 delegations.
</P>
<P>
Rossier had told the WTO's General Council that 40 of its 133
members made Supachai their first choice in an earlier poll.
Abouyoub had 23 first preferences, Maclaren 15 and Moore 13.
</P>
<P>
But in a later poll, Moore came top with 26, while Supachai was
second with 19, Abouyoub third with eight and Maclaren fourth with
five. A total of 28 delegations have given no indication of their
views.
</P>
<P>
However, only 91 of the WTO countries expressed a clear
preference, leaving everything to play for in a game in which the
EU, if it decides to back one candidate, could be decisive.
</P>
<P>
More important is that the U.S. preference may put pressure on
Supachai to withdraw his candidacy, as a number of countries might
gradually follow Washington's lead.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, although facing mounting difficulties to win its bid,
will continue its bid for the WTO top post, Thai government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Foreign Ministry, while acknowledging that the
intentions of most WTO member states remained unclear, has issued
a statement to the effect that the ministry and other concerned
agencies would continue to lobby support for Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among WTO members have been going on for months
and they are to establish which candidate can be appointed by
consensus. Only if that cannot be established could a formal vote
be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer to
avoid such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general has
to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure whose
appointment is opposed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
The world trade body chief will have to steer the organization
to the expected launch in December of fresh global trade
organizations, to last until 2003.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the WTO and its predecessor the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade have always been headed by a European, and
developing countries have been increasingly vocal in calling for
appointment of a figure from their midst.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has promised to bridge the gap between developing
economies and richer nations if he wins the position.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has already won backing from Japan and other Asian
countries and has earned international respect for his role in
ensuring that Thailand resisted pressure to put up trade barriers
in reaction to the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Display of Vietnam's National Flag in US Is Legal: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANNOI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The display and raising of
Vietnam's national flag and the picture of Vietnam's late leader
Ho Chi Minh in the United States is legal and in conformity with
the international law, stated a spokesperson for Vietnam's Foreign
Ministry in Hanoi on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Vietnam News Agency (VNA), the
spokesperson made the statement in response to a question by
Vietnam's national radio "the Voice of Vietnam" relating to an
attack on Tran Van Truong, a Vietnamese national residing in Los
Angeles, California.
</P>
<P>
Truong displayed a picture of president Ho Chi Minh and the
Vietnamese national flag at his video shop. He was then assaulted
by some Vietnamese extremists for his display.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam and the U.S. normalized their diplomatic ties in
1995," the spokesperson said, adding that "the U.S. government
recognized the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN) hence its
national flag. The display and raising of the national flag of the
SRVN and the picture of president Ho Chi Minh in the U.S. is legal
and in conformity with the international law."

<HEADLINE> Romanian Jobless Population Tops One Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Romania's jobless rate hit
10.6 percent by last Wednesday, the highest since 1996, with more
than one million people thrown out of work force and numerous
enterprises running into red in the privatization process, offic
ial sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the central coal producing region of Hunedoara,, where
miners had just called off a massive strike, the jobless rate has
shot up to 18.5 percent, while in the eastern Moldova region, it
is above 16 percent, according to the latest statistics released
by the Minister of Labor and Social Protection.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, which put the number of the unemployed at
1,048,872 nationwide, said the country's jobless rate continued
to climb in the past few years -- 6.6 percent in 1996, 8.8
percent in 1997 and 9.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government, which won the general elections at
the end of 1996, has been speeding up privatization of large and
medium-sized enterprises, leading to widespread bankruptcy and
lay-offs.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that nearly 30 percent of the new
businesses went broken within one year with only 20 percent
reporting profits.
</P>
<P>
However, the unemployment rate remained under six percent in
the capital city of Bucharest and several western provinces which
enjoy a relatively booming economy, triggering fears for a
widening gap between the western and eastern parts of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Holds First Privatization Commission Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar held the first meeting
in 1999 of the Privatization Commission here Monday to review its
undertakings since January 1995 when it announced the first phase
of the privatization scheme.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, told
departmental officials to transfer the undertakings to national
private entrepreneurs who are financially strong and can deal with
foreign counterparts, if they can not run the undertakings
effectively.
</P>
<P>
"National private entrepreneurs are able to think and decide
freely and carry out works effectively," said Khin Nyunt, who is
also chairman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the move will serve the interests of the
state, urging departments concerned to boldly decide for the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its state economic enterprises (SEE), aimed
at transforming them into effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the scheme covers 51 SEEs including
processing and manufacturing factories, livestock breeding farms
and cinemas, and is being implemented in various forms --
auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or establishing joint
ventures with local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In the privatization process, the government is striving to
ensure that in transferring to the private business people, local
Myanmar citizens take precedence over foreigners.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 134 state-owned
cinemas and more than two dozen saw mills have been privatized in
Myanmar. Some 42 factories and two livestock breeding farms have
also been designated to be sold through competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
In a significant move to accelerate the privatization of heavy
industries, Myanmar transferred Ywama Steel Mill, the biggest
state-run enterprise leased out since the privatization plan
began, to local private entrepreneurs last September for
continuous operation.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the first-phase privatization of all
small-scale SEEs has been completed and the second phase which
deals with about 1,760 medium- and larger-scale SEEs is underway.
</P>
<P>
The official statistics also showed Myanmar's gross domestic
product in the 1997-98 fiscal year grew by 4.6 percent with the
private sector contributing 75.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The private sector investment accounted for 53 percent of the
total, rocketing from 5.6 billion kyats (18.6 million U.S.
dollars) in 1989-90 to 75.9 billion kyats (253 million dollars) in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
According to official data, there is a total of 53,338
manufacturing enterprises in the country in 1997, of which 51,101
are private run and 1,600 state-owned.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Yong, a 24-year-old student who will complete graduate
studies this year, noted his preference for the new operating
system. "Most of the people lose their drive and creativity if
they stay in one place too long. The new system offers
flexibility which will enable people to exhibit their potential
and inspires competition in the workplace," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
More than 340 researchers have been hired under the new
system, including 10 senior researchers with an average age of
41, and 29 team leaders aged 39 and below.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shudong, 33, director of the Environmental Engineering
Section, expressed confidence in his colleagues. "Many people who
used to arrive late now come early, and some work well into the
night. The new system has inspired competition," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The reform has also sparked rising unemployment problems,
particularly in terms of older researchers. "The system is
sometimes unfair to older researchers who have contributed
greatly to the field of science and the institute." said Qu, a 50
-year-old female researcher who has worked at the institute for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
"We face an arduous task in carrying out step by step reform
and everyone is worried abut the consequences. Nonetheless,
individuals must exert effort to find the job which suits them
best. We will never succeed if we refuse to change our thinking."
according to Deng Maicun, director of the institute.

<HEADLINE> Non-Resident Bangladeshis Remit 1.6 Bln Dollars Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Non-resident Bangladeshi workers
remitted about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, 4.82 percent
higher in comparison to that in the previous year, the Financial
Express daily newspaper reported Tuesday, quoting a provisional
estimation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 267,667 people, both skilled and unskilled, got
employment in 15 countries last year as against some 230,626 in
the previous year. The remittance earned from the manpower sector
in 1997 was about 1.53 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The highest amount of remittance was earned from expatriate
Bangladeshis in Saudi Arabia, followed by the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Economic meltdown in the South Asian region, where about
300,000 Bangladeshis were employed, has forced many of them to
quit their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Although Bangladesh achieved an impressive progress in
exporting manpower last year, remittance flows is not encouraging
when the total number of migrant Bangladeshi labor force is taken
into consideration, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Shortage of Nurses, Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's health system is
facing serious shortage of nurses and doctors because a lot of
them are leaving the nation to other countries, according to
Secretary of the Health and Child Welfare Ministry Paulinus
Sikhosana.
</P>
<P>
The Herald daily Tuesday quoted Sikhosana as saying that
Zimbabwe's 214 hospitals were losing an average of about 300
nurses a year to other countries, particularly the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"While other nurses are moving to the private sector, Britain
is recruiting a large number of nurses in Zimbabwe. At the moment
there are 1,400 vacancies for nurses," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are operating with only 8,797 nurses while we need far more
than that if the health sector is to function efficiently. What
has worsened our problem is that our hospitals have only 1,500
doctors while in reality we need at least 4,000 doctors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the shortage has severely hit district
and provincial hospitals who were operating with three and 14
doctors respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare has also made
recommendations on how best they can attract doctors and nurses to
remain in the system to enable smooth operations in the country's
hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Addresses Juvenile Delinquency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislator Wan Shaofen
recently called for families, schools and the society as a whole
to exhibit greater concern about increasing juvenile delinquency
in China and shoulder their responsibility to create a sound
environment for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's juvenile delinquency rate has
doubled over the past decade, with a substantial increase in the
number of serious cases involving teenage gangs, according to the
Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
The prevention and reduction of juvenile delinquency have
attracted great attention throughout the world, with a number of
countries adopting laws to quell the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out preparatory work over the past four
years and is expected to adopt a law on juvenile delinquency in
the first half of 1999, according to Wan, vice-chairwoman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Committee for Internal and
Judicial Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Wan told the Guangming Daily that the law will place juvenile
delinquency on the legislative track and fill a legal void in
China.
</P>
<P>
She noted more cultural products and venues should be
developed to promote the healthy maturation of teenagers. Wan
also pointed out that teenagers are currently exposed to an
excessive number of movies and publications involving violence
and pornography.
</P>
<P>
She urged concerned departments to strengthen management over
the cultural market, and carry out a resolute campaign against
pornographic products.
</P>
<P>
Wan stressed that more recreational venues for teenagers must
be established and concerned departments must restore venues
which have been turned into dance halls and video game
arcades.

<HEADLINE> More Australians Want Directly Elected President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A poll shows that more
Australians want a directly elected president, according to direct
election advocate Phil Cleary.
</P>
<P>
Australians were unhappy with the Australian Republican
Movement (ARM) model that emerged from last February's
Constitutional Convention to have an Australian head of state
appointed by a two-third majority of both houses of parliament,
Cleary said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I looked ARM founding member and former New South Wales
premier Neville Wran in the eyes at the convention and I said to
him, 'the model you are putting on the table is the model to bury
the republic'," Cleary, a former federal independent MP, said over
ABC Radio.
</P>
<P>
The latest AC Nielsen poll, published in The Age and The Sydney
Morning Herald, showed a referendum on the issue would have been
defeated in every state if held last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The poll found only 41 percent of Australians would vote "yes"
to a republic at a referendum, and 55 percent felt the idea of
becoming a republic by 2001 was unimportant.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 69 percent said they would be more
likely to vote for a republic with a president elected directly.
</P>
<P>
This was particularly marked among those intending to vote "no"
at a referendum: 74 percent said they were more likely to vote for
a republic if they had a direct say in electing a president.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Oil Output, Exports Fall in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Production from Thailand's oil
refineries and natural gas separation plants slipped year-on-year
by 6 percent last year to an average of 704,000 barrels per day
due to the fall in domestic oil demand and exports, according to a
report released by the Commercial Registration Department
available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand for refined oil products dipped 10 percent last
year to 636,000 barrels per day, while exports of
locally-processed oil products plunged 5 percent to 95,000 barrels
per day because of the supply glut in world market.
</P>
<P>
The report said that local daily production of diesel oil was
down 4 percent to 45 million liters; fuel oil down 11 percent to
21 million liters; gasoline down 5 percent to 24 million liters;
and LPG down 4 percent to 6,000 metric tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of finished oil products plunged 54 percent
last year to 23,897 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a similar trend, daily demand for high speed diesel
oil dropped 13 percent to 41 million liters, fuel oil down 13
percent to 22 million liters; gasoline down 2 percent to 20
million liters; jet fuel down 6 percent to 9 million liters and

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb parliament
on Monday voted against President Nikola Poplasen's latest
nomination for prime minister by 46 to 29.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four abstentions were reported in the vote on new
nominee Brano Miljus, who was put forward by the president on
December 31, 1998, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, the president had offered his nomination of
Dragan Kalinic, chairman of Serbian Democratic Party (SDP), for
the top government post, but it was also vetoed by the parliament
in the following month.
</P>
<P>
The last veto reportedly met with firm opposition from Carlos
Westendorp, U.N. High Representative of the Peace Implementation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Viewing sitting Prime Minister Milorad Dodik as "the most
suitable nominee", Westendorp threatened that the international
community would suspend its financial aid to Republika Srpska if
Dodic was not picked as the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Dodic has also announced Miljus had been expelled from the
SDP, blasting the president's latest nomination as "a retreat".

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Reports Big Profit in Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T, the largest telephone
company in the United States, Monday reported a 58 percent
increase in profits in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a report that profits rose to two billion
U.S. dollars in the last quarter, compared to 1.26 billion
dollars a year earlier. Revenues increased 4.8 percent to 13.53
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company registered a good performance in wireless and
business services. Revenues from wireless services grew 25
percent to 1.51 billion dollars as a result of its new Digital
One Rate promotion.
</P>
<P>
The Digital One Rate, which was introduced last May, is a
pricing package, charging users from 11 to 15 cents a minute, no
matter where they are calling from. The plan has attracted more
than 850,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
In business services, which include long-distance and data
transmission services, the company achieved a 4.7 percent
increase to 5.74 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But revenues from consumer services fell 3.6 percent to 5.54
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company said it will develop services for large
businesses, which need advanced telecommunications, and for
consumers, who want personalized packages of services from mobile
phones to Internet access.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Motion to Debate on Dismissing Impeachment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Monday
rejected a motion that would have opened up its debate over
dismissing the obstruction of justice and perjury charges against
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 57-43 against the motion offered by Democratic
Senator Tom Harkin. It would have required a two-thirds majority
to pass. The Senate then approved, by voice vote, a motion to
close its debate on the dismissal question.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is cha
rged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by
the House along partisan lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
He is the first U.S. president to be subjected to a trial
since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one vote in
1868. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to convict
Clinton and remove him from office, a prospect which most still
consider to be unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Russia Objects to UNSCOM Report on Iraqi Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of Iraqi disarmament did
not officially distribute a report on Iraqi weapons on Monday
because of Russia's objection, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's permanent representative to the U.N. Sergei Lavrov
said he doesn't believe the Security Council has a consensus
regarding information from UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Since the military strikes launched by the United States and
Britain against Iraq in December, Russia has toughened its stance
in seeking the abolishment of UNSCOM. France supports the idea
and is calling for its replacement by a new arms monitoring body.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM, led by Australian diplomat Richard Butler, has been
blamed for withdrawing from Iraq in mid-December without
reporting to the Security Council first.
</P>
<P>
The December 16-19 attacks on Iraq, the heaviest since the
Gulf War in 1991, were taken on the basis of an UNSCOM report,
which said Iraq did not cooperate with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain are the only permanent members of the
Security Council to call for the return of UNSCOM to Baghdad to
continue arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq said UNSCOM is dead following the U.S.-Britain
military action. It has called for the lifting of sanctions on
Iraq imposed following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attacks EU in Banana Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
accused the European Union (EU) of undermining the global trading
system by blocking the World Trade Organization's consideration
of U.S. sanctions against EU goods in a banana trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
The United States accused the EU of being behind a move by
Dominica and Santa Lucia to block a meeting of the WTO dispute
settlement body on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move prevented the United States from requesting a WTO
approval of some 520 million U.S. dollars in trade sanctions
against EU products.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely dismayed that the EU would jeopardize the
operation of the WTO in this way," U.S trade representative
Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The EU has prevented the WTO from holding a meeting,
prevented the United States from exercising its WTO rights, and
prevented any other dispute settlement business from going
forward," she added.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. trade official said it was the first time since the WTO
was created four years ago that any country has tried to block a
meeting of the dispute settlement body.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan to impose 100 percent tariffs on a number of EU
goods to compensate for lost trade on bananas was one of a number
of items on the body's agenda on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"What the EU appears to be attempting is to return the WTO to
the old GATT system," said a U.S. trade official.
</P>
<P>
The WTO dispute settlement system allows countries which win
trade cases to seek compensation for lost trade by raising
tariffs on goods if the losing country fails to comply with a
ruling.
</P>
<P>
A WTO panel ruled in 1997 that the then EU banana export
regime broke global trade agreements and had to be changed.
</P>
<P>
The EU says a new regime, in place since January 1 this year,
conforms to that ruling, but the United States says it does not
and argues WTO dispute settlement accords give it the right to
retaliate.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Reports Trade Surplus for Third Year in a Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stockholm, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sweden recorded a 133.7
billion krone (17.3 billion U.S. dollars) in trade surplus in
1998, the third annual surplus in a row, official figures showed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Exports totalled 671.4 billion krone (87 billion dollars), up
six percent from a year earlier, while imports went up seven
percent to 537.7 billion krone (69.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian country recorded a 120.5 billion krone (15.6
billion dollars) trade surplus in 1996 and 131.7 billion krone
(17.1 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Germany still ranked as Sweden's largest trading partner in
1998, masking up roughly 11 percent of Sweden's total imports and
taking 18 percent of exports. Also notable was a one-third
increase in Sweden's trade with China.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's good trade performance could be attributed to the
fact that its top 10 trading partners are mainly West European
and North American countries which went almost unscathed through
the Asian economic crisis and maintained a relatively high
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
A weak currency also helped exports, said local analysts.

<HEADLINE> Governor-General Salutes Success of Multiculturalism on Australia Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Governor-General William Deane
Tuesday saluted the success of multiculturalism in his Australia
Day address, in which he said multiculturalism had changed racial
and religious intolerance so common in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The governor-general said he was particularly proud of the lack
of racial and other forms of prejudice among young Australians.
</P>
<P>
"I am often conscious of the contrast between the tolerance and
breadth of vision of most of today's young Australians and the
racial and religious intolerance which was so common in our
country when I was a boy growing up in the 1930s and 1940s," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"One sometimes hears suggestions that multiculturalism is
divisive. I disagree.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that it is our multiculturalism which has made
possible our national unity notwithstanding that we Australians
directly or indirectly come from all the regions, races, cultures
and religions of the world.
</P>
<P>
"For me, multiculturalism means inclusiveness. Its essence is
mutual respect and acceptance. It has enabled us to blend the many
into a pretty harmonious whole without bringing to this new land
old hatreds, old prejudices and old conflicts."
</P>
<P>
He paid special tribute to the elderly in the United Nations
Year of Older Persons and to the countless indigenous and
non-indigenous Australians working for reconciliation.

The job creation figure was based on the breakdown in the

<HEADLINE> Albania Calls for Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian authorities Monday
again called for international intervention in the troubled
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, including further diplomatic
initiatives and use of force by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
People's Assembly President Skender Gjinushi made the appeal
at a meeting here with a delegation from the "Kosovo parliament",
which is not recognized by Belgrade and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The speaker stressed that the ongoing dialogue should be
continued and that the Kosovo issue should be solved by dialogue
with the international community playing an active role.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian parliament supports the self-determination of the
ethnic Albanian population, who outnumber Serbs nine to one in
Kosovo, said Gjinushi.
</P>
<P>
The People's Assembly released a statement last week, accusing
the international community of being unreasonably tolerant of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the Racak massacre of 45
ethnic Albanians and appealing for NATO military intervention in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo also
met the delegation, reiterating Tirana's call for NATO to send
troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Idriz Ajeti, head of the delegation, thanked Albania for the
support it had given to strengthen the solidarity of ethnic
Albanians and to find a way out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The invitation to the Kosovo parliament delegation was part of
Albania's efforts to coordinate differences among various ethnic
Albanian political factions. Adem Demaci of the Kosovo Liberation
Army and representatives from some other ethnic Albanian groups
had earlier been invited to visit Tirana.

HAVANA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Santa Lucia Prime Minister
Kenny Davis Anthony called here on Monday for the unity of all
Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
Davis, who ended Monday afternoon a 72-hour visit to Cuba,

island, inhabited by about 150,000 people, faced problems due to
world globalization.

<P>
He said the dispute between the United States and the European
Union which scrapped preferential banana import tariffs for the
Caribbean had led Santa Lucia to lose 50 percent of its exports
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Davis said that he backed Cuba's full membership in the new
Lome Convention which grants special trade privileges between
European countries and their former colonies in Asia, Africa and
the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Chile's IOC Member Urged to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Chile's top representative to
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been urged to
resign by the country's political and sporting leaders on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Santander has been temporarily suspended his IOC membe
rship by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and would probably
face expulsion in March.
</P>
<P>
The IOC's ruling was "a disgrace for national sport and the
country," said Jorge Pizarro, a former national rugby player who
is now senator.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that once and for all this gentleman, in a minimal act
of decency, resigns from public sporting links," Pizarro said.
</P>
<P>
Julio Ruitort, the director of Chile's national sports body
Digeder said Santander is "morally out of action" to continue in
his IOC post.
</P>
<P>
"As an institution, we believe that Santander must resign his
post in Chile. He did not measure the consequences and his
attitude was not correct," said Ruitort.
</P>
<P>
Santander's lawyer Guillermo Campos told local radio on Monday
his client was calm but was expecting a ruling against him
because of "contradictions in the leadership of the IOC."

<HEADLINE> China to Control Building Materials Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China will close a number of
outdated glass and cement plants over the next two years,
according to Zhang Renwei, director of the State Administration
of the Building Materials Industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national work conference on Monday, Zhang said
the move is part of China's effort to reduce the industry's
excessive production capacity and to improve the product
structure.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for reducing the production of small cement plants
by 40 million tons during 1999, and by an additional 60 million
tons in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The plan for reducing glass production calls for closing 257
outdated plants and an additional 12 production lines between
1999-2000. The closures will reduce the production capacity
shrinkage by an estimated 30 million standard cases.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the administration show excessive
production accounts for a third of China's total plate glass and
cement output.
</P>
<P>
A large number of small operations will be closed due to
inadequate technological improvements, high energy consumption,
heavy pollution and poor product quality.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also pointed out that hundreds of illegal operations
producing low quality products "pose a serious threat to
construction and personnel safety."
</P>
<P>
He said China will closely monitor the establishment of new
production facilities over the next three years.

<P>
TIRANA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on Monday
started its "weapons for development" test program in the
Albanian city of Gramshi to recover weapons from civilians.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the U.N. will give the country 500,000 U.S.
dollars for projects such as road repairs, communication
development, and improvement in medical services. In return,
civilians in the country are expected to turn in their weapons
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The resulting projects, it is reported, will create hundreds
of jobs.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the start of the program, residents of
Gramshi joined with singing and dancing performers, chanting
slogans such as "let flowers replace bullets."
</P>
<P>
Gramshi police estimated that about 10,000 weapons are in the
hands of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The program was agreed upon by top U.N. disarmament official
Jayantha Dhanapala and then Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano in
June 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in 1997, riots throughout the country had
resulted in about 600,000 weapons falling into the hands of
civilians. The Albanian government tried to confiscate these
weapons as early as August, 1997, but had little success.

<HEADLINE> NBA No. 1 Pick Olowokandi Released from Italian Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Michael Olowokandi did not
impress his first professional employer and today the No. 1 pick
in the 1998 NBA draft was released from his contract with Kinder
Bologna of the Italian League.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi's contract had ordered him to stay in Italy until
February 15, but according to European sources, Kinder released
the center today, allowing him to return to the United States and
sign with the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
Just two days before NBA players and owners agreed to a labor
settlement January 7, Olowokandi signed a deal with Kinder
Bologna that reportedly would have paid him a minimum of $1
million and up to $3 million if he stayed the entire season.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown if Olowokandi asked to be released from his contr
act, but the Italian team likely opted to save a portion of his
salary.
</P>
<P>
According to European scouts, the poorly conditioned
Olowokandi was not met with rave reviews, playing ineffectively
from the start. In an 84-67 victory over Verona on Saturday, the
Pacific University product was scoreless with two rebounds and
four fouls in five minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi is free to sign a regulated three-year, $8.44
million contract with the Clippers, the richest among 1999
rookies as per the new collective bargaining agreement. The deal
would include a club option for a fourth center.
</P>
<P>
The second straight center selected first overall, Olowokandi
has been playing basketball only since 1993. He was born in
Nigeria and raised in England.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi averaged 22.2 points and 11.2 rebounds his senior
season at Pacific, placing 10th in the nation in scoring and
fifth in rebounds. He also blocked 92 shots and finished as the
school's all-time leader with 157.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Venezuela signed here on Monday a double taxation avoidance
agreement in a bid to boost investments.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel
Angel Burelli and U.S. ambassador John Maisto, will have to be
ratified by the senates in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Burelli said that the importance of the pact lies in the fact
that Venezuela is currently the seventh most important foreign
investor in the United States, with more capitals in the United
States than U.S. funds in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The United States is Venezuela's main export market and main
supplier.
</P>
<P>
Most Venezuelan investments in the United States come from the
state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela through its branch
company Citgo, one of the 10 top oil refiners and sellers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has already signed 10 similar accords with other
countries, including Canada and Italy. A new reciprocal tax pact
is in the process of being signed with Chile.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Introduce Reinsurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to introduce
a reinsurance system in the country in an effort to develop its
insurance market.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on the introduction of the system, sponsored by the
state-run Myanma Insurance and the Swiss Re of Switzerland, was
held here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second seminar of its kind held in Myanmar since
last December when the first seminar, organized by the Myanma
Insurance and the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co Ltd of
Japan, took place.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Minister of Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein said
at the seminar that reinsurance system is a system which assures
security for direct underwriters, urging the participants to study
the reinsurance techniques for application.
</P>
<P>
Attending the seminar were officials of the Central Bank of
Myanmar and the Myanma Insurance as well as the Swiss Re.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Myanma Insurance also held a seminar with
the Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Group of Australia to discuss
liability insurance, social insurance and health and workers'
compensation insurance.
</P>
<P>
After the enactment of the country's Insurance Business Law in
June 1996, Myanmar opened up its insurance sector to local private
and foreign businessmen as part of its efforts to develop the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of insurance licenses to private companies is seen
as an initial step in introducing the reinsurance system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, three Japanese marine and fire insurance companies
-- Mitsui, Yasuda and Tokio -- have signed memorandums of
understanding with the Myanma Insurance respectively to set up
insurance joint ventures.

<HEADLINE> Millions Hit by Water Crisis in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- More than four million people
in Thailand's 34 provinces have been affected by the growing water
shortage, according to the Civil Defense Office of the Thai
government.
</P>
<P>
The shortage has already hit nine provinces in northern
Thailand, 13 provinces in northeastern Thailand, eight provinces
in central Thailand, two provinces in western Thailand and one
province in southern Thailand, affecting 4.57 million people, the
office was quoted Tuesday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority, the reserve
in Thailand's biggest dam, Bhumibol, has already shrunk to a
35-year low, with the rainy season still more than half a year
away.
</P>
<P>
This year's drought has also caused seven roads in Bangkok and

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Urged to Boost Immigration Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia should boost
immigration to further efforts in creating a prosperous nation,
leading businessman David Smorgon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our current intake numbers of 50,000 annually
is not enough," Smorgon, a leader of the Smorgon family and
investment company chief, said at the Australia Day breakfast in
Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"There is mounting evidence that Australia needs more
immigrants, and that a well structured skill based migration
program will add to our prosperity," he was quoted by Australian
Associated Press from Melbourne as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has been greatly enhanced by the social, cultural
and professional skills of our migrants," Smorgon said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the migrants had created large successful family
businesses such as the Pratts, the Lowys, the Valmordas, the
Grollos, the Adlers, standing alongside the Packers and the
Murdochs as icons of the Australian business community.
</P>
<P>
Family businesses were worth about 1.2 trillion Australian
dollars (762 billion U.S. dollars) in Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said most family businesses that contributed to charitable
trusts had been created by immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Quake Kills 255, at Least 1,000 Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 255 people
were killed and 1,000 injured when a strong earthquake rocked
Colombia's central coffee-growing region on Monday, Radionet
reported citing official sources.
</P>
<P>
The towns of Armenia, Pereira and Calarca -- all located near
the epicenter -- were the hardest hit, with Armenia, the capital
city of Quindio province, reporting at least 150 dead and some
500 injured, said the official Social Solidarity Network agency.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was 100 kilometers beneath the ground in Obando
town in western Valle del Cauca province, 225 kilometers west of
Bogota. Unconfirmed reports said two villages in the state had
virtually been wiped off the map by the powerful tremor.
</P>
<P>
The National Seismological Institute said the quake, which hit
at 1:19 p.m. local time (1819 GMT), lasted for about 15 seconds
and measured 6.0 on the open-ended Richter scale. There were at
least eight aftershocks, triggering numerous landslides affecting
a total of five provinces.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana, scheduled to leave for a
European tour on Monday, delayed his trip and traveled to Pereira
to head the rescue work there. The presidency announced that at
least 195 people died in the single province of Quindio.
</P>
<P>
Armenia and Pereira authorities ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew
and banned entry of non-emergency personnel into the disaster
areas. "There's no way to measure this crisis," mayor of Armenia,
Alvaro Pulido, told the radio.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry declared a state of emergency in the
region while the local Red Cross asked the headquarters in Bogota
to send in as much blood as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Coffee Growers' Federation said it had
no reports yet of damage to the coffee crop, but said that phone
communications to many plantations in the affected area had
failed.
</P>
<P>
Monday's earthquake was the worst to hit Colombia in 16 years.
More than 300 people were killed and 1,200 injured when a quake
struck Popayan town in early 1983.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Ground Troops Deployment Possible in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
said it did not rule out the possibility of deploying ground
troops to help enforce a Kosovo peace accord but said such a
notion was premature.
</P>
<P>
If it were necessary to deploy some kind of international
force to help implement an agreed peace settlement on Kosovo, "we
would examine ... what role, if any, the United States might play
in such a scenario," State Department deputy spokesman James
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"But really, that is premature. At this stage, what we're
talking about, what we're facing, rather, now is far from that
prospect," he told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Although that (peace agreement) is our hope, we are faced
also with the more immediate challenge of across-the-board Serb
noncompliance (with an October cease-fire) and the possibility
that the international community, NATO in particular, may have to
use force to achieve compliance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the five Western powers of the Contact Group on the
former Yugoslavia are expected to finalize a plan by the end of
the week to put to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the
leaders of the Albanian ethnic majority in Kosovo, the troubled
province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Foley would not rule out that Contact Group foreign ministers w
ould meet later this week but he said details had not been
finalized.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Have Fired Stray Missile in Southern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes patrolling
the southern no-fly zone in Iraq may have misfired and at least
one high-explosive missile may have killed civilians in and
around the city of Basra, a U.S. general said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible we did have a missile that did not perform as
expected," said General Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces
in the Gulf, adding the military was reviewing intelligence to
see if the errant missile has caused civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said five civilian sites were hit in its southern oil hub
of Basra by U.S. missiles, killing 11 civilians and wounding
dozens more, and vowed to continue to challenge the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
Zinni told reporters at the Pentagon, "We deeply regret any
loss of civilian lives or civilian casualties or injuries."
</P>
<P>
But he said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was ultimately
to blame because of his "attacks against us and his history of
disregard for the welfare of his own people".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. general said attacks against U.S. and British
aircraft patrolling the two no-fly zones had increased since
Operation Desert Fox last month when U.S. and British forces
launched bombing raids on Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
"What we are seeing now is an increase in frequency, intensity
and coordination of their entire air defense system against our
planes flying in both the north and south," he said.
</P>
<P>
Five clashes occurred in both southern and northern no-fly
zones on Monday with U.S. warplanes firing missiles at Iraqi air
defense sites.

<HEADLINE> China to Arouse Public Awareness of Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Land and
Resources is expected to publicize activities related to the
prevention and control of geologically related disasters during
the next four months.
</P>
<P>
The activities are scheduled to culminate on April 22 when
the world celebrates the Earth Day, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries most threatened by geological
disasters, especially landslides, mud-rock flows and collapses
resulting from natural or artificial reasons.
</P>
<P>
With expansion in scope of human activities, man-induced
geological disasters are increasing, and are causing more harm
than natural ones, said Jiang Jianjun, deputy director of the
Ministry's environment department.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled large amount of landslides, collapses and
mud-rock flows occurred in last summer's floods. Most of the
disasters took place in areas where people were least
economically prepared to endure big disasters.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of the ministry and concerned
departments in geological disaster monitoring, prevention and
control, 52 large landslides and mud-rock flows were successfully
forecast and at least 4,300 deaths were avoided during the 1998
floods.
</P>
<P>
Many have not been taught what to do, Jiang said, although geo
logical disaster-monitoring has achieved a lot in preventing
losses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prosecutors Alert Against Flood Relief Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese prosecutors have been
on the alert against corruption that might occur in flood relief
distributions.
</P>
<P>
Investigations conducted since the end of summer's deluge
along the Yangtze River have revealed that while oversight has
deterred crime to a great extent, a few officials could not
resist trying to skim money from the relief effort, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Bi Wei, deputy director of the Anti-Corruption
Bureau under the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), wrongdoing
in use of flood-relief materials and funds has been limited. Only
four or five cases have been reported to the SPP.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangxi Province, Xu Bingrong, director of a
township civil affairs office and Guo Guogan, deputy director of
Xinjian County Civil Affairs Department, were recently indicated
for alleged corruption and embezzlement of over 200,000 yuan
(about 24,100 U.S. dollars) worth of relief materials.
</P>
<P>
"Corrupt behavior has been deterred this year because the
distribution of relief supplies has been more closely monitored,"
Zhang Zhijie, assistant director of the SPP Department of
Discipline Inspection on Law Enforcement, was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Offers Tax Incentives to New Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
offering new investors in pioneering industries income tax
holidays of up to eight years in a new bid to boost investment in
the country, according to a presidential decree published on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tax holidays apply to 22 categories of industry, including
textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, steel, seamless pipes,
turbine engines, automotive components, machine tools, processing
machines, heavy machinery components, oil refineries, electronic
components, information technology, instrumentation equipment and
oil and mining equipment.
</P>
<P>
The decree says that new investment in the 22 industries
located in Java and Bali will receive three-year tax holidays,
while investments located elsewhere in the country will receive
five-year tax holidays.
</P>
<P>
An additional one-year tax exemption is available to projects
which employ a minimum of 2,000 workers and a second one-year tax
break is available for ventures which are at least 20 percent
owned by cooperatives. Both conditions must be met at the start of
commercial operations.
</P>
<P>
A third one-year tax break can be obtained by projects worth
200 million U.S. dollars and over, not including land and
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Losses incurred during the period of tax relief cannot be
deducted from taxable profits after the facility ends.
</P>
<P>
The decree states that tax exemption shall begin at the start
of commercial operations, or five years after the project is
licensed, which ever comes first.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's International
Olympic Committee (IOC) member Jacques Rogge told the media on
Monday that he thought further evidence of bribery may come out.
</P>
<P>
Rogge told VRT television: "We indeed had suspicions of fraud,
but we never had any hard proof...We carried out inquiries
several times but each time we ran into a wall of silence."
</P>
<P>
Rogge, a member of the IOC commission investigating the
bribery allegations, said the suspension of the six was "the
start but probably not the end of the big clean-up operation".
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there was more to come, he said: "That's what I
fear. We'll search further, we want the entire truth, we'll
uncover everything. It's the only way to make a new start and win
credibility again."
</P>
<P>
Six IOC members were suspended temporarily on Sunday in the
"votes for cash" scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's successful
bid to stage the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Rogge said Samaranch had tried three years ago to ban visits
by IOC members to cities bidding for the Games but that his

<HEADLINE> Chinese Researchers Calls for Protection of Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers recently
reminds the public of protecting the traditional cultural relics
in the old city of Beijing, amid the current urban construction,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The remark came following an exhibition on Mendun hosted by
Kimio Iwamoto, a Japanese old man, who spent years in collecting
them in China.
</P>
<P>
Mendun, carved stones in various shapes, are usually seen on
both sides of the front and central gates of Beijing's siheyuan,
the old quadrangle home of Beijingers. They are used to fix the
gate frame and the door axle.
</P>
<P>
Through the course of history, the outer mendun have grown
into diverse statues symbolizing the social status of the family
in the siheyuan.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dake, member of the Architecture History Society under the
China Architecture Institute, speaks highly of Iwamoto's work in
the preface to "Beijing Mendun."
</P>
<P>
He said that mendun represents the profound Chinese
architectural tradition, and Iwamoto's study is valuable in that m
ost Chinese researchers are still working on more general
subjects.
</P>
<P>
"We should try our best to preserve what our ancestors have
left us as intact as possible and pass them on to our next
generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu thinks it's irrational to demolish the old city and
replace it with modern skyscrapers capped with ancient roofs. But
he admits that the residents in the old city do need better
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dilemma we must deal with," he said.
</P>
<P>
While researchers argue over how to protect the old parts of
Beijing, the Beijing Museum of Ancient Architecture has been
racing against the demolition of the old city in gathering
valuable relics including mendun.
</P>
<P>
Dong Shaopeng, director of the Protection and Gathering
department of the museum, said they have salvaged over 40
precious mendun since the municipal government started
reconstruction of the four old districts in 1991.

<P>
ROME, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Big Italian companies are leading
the way in adjusting computer and accounts systems to transact
business in the single European currency, the euro, according to
a survey released by European Union (EU) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, 51 percent of the equipment overhauls
planned by Italy's big companies ahead of the euro's full entry
in 2002, had been completed, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
Following Italy are Germany at 48 percent, France at 43
percent and Spain at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by U.S. computer giant IBM on the
basis of interviews with 330 industrial groups in four euro-zone
countries.
</P>
<P>
It did not say whether the adjustments planned by companies
for the coming euro-age were adequate or to what degree they
varied from one country to another.
</P>
<P>
According to the IBM's study, European companies will invest
40 billion U.S. dollars by 2001 in adapting their information
technology, but the total cost of transition is estimated to 160
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Creditors Threaten Legal Action Against PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Major creditors of the
Philippine Airlines (PAL) are planning to take legal action
against the national flag-carrier unless it makes partial payments
on its 2.1 billion dollars of debt by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin newspaper Tuesday quoted Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Perfecto Yasay as saying that
the creditors are demanding up to 100 million dollars by the end
of January.
</P>
<P>
He said that unless PAL services some of its debts in the next
few days, the creditors will take legal action and will not
approve a management rehabilitation plan to turn the carrier
around.
</P>
<P>
PAL has not made any payments on its debt since last July, when
it was granted a moratorium by the SEC pending approval of a
rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
However, its creditors have become increasingly impatient in
recent months and are demanding a token payment on their loan
principal.
</P>
<P>
Yasay said that the airline's majority shareholder, Lucio Tan,
has pledged to infuse 150 million dollars of new capital into the
carrier.
</P>
<P>
PAL's management has confirmed its aims to make a payment to
major creditors by the end of this month but has not said how
much.

20.
</P>
<P>
The FARC rebels said in a statement that it would give the g
overnment three months to prove that it is willing to crack down
on violent right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to postpone a meeting scheduled for January
26 to discuss swapping prisoners until April 26. About 500
guerrillas were scheduled to be released in exchange for some 300
soldiers and policemen.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, government representatives and FARC leaders ended
their first rounds of meetings aimed at restarting the peace
process in the demilitarized zone of San Vicente del Caguan.
</P>
<P>
Formal talks between the government rebels began earlier this
month. On January 19, the FARC suspended the talks, charging that
the Colombian government was not doing enough to crack down on
violence from right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
A rise in paramilitary violence, however, has accompanied the
talks, with at least 130 dead in the first week of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Brazil To Unify Exchange Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's central bank
announced Monday that the national monetary council under it will
adopt a single exchange rate on February 1 to unify commercial
and other fluctuating rates.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's currency, the real, ended the day at 1.79 to the U.S.
dollar, down from 1.71 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The real has lost 32 percent of its value since the
devaluation started on January 15. The central bank let the real
float against the dollar after four years of using its hard
currency reserves to prop up the currency and keep inflation down.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government expected to stop the flight of
capitals from the country after the devaluation, but it did not
succeed. More than 45 billion dollars have fled the country since
August.
</P>
<P>
Brazil finally stepped in to ease the pressure on its plunging
currency last Friday, selling at least 300 million dollars of its
hard currency reserves through the central bank Banco do Brasil,
after the real tumbled to an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said all eyes are on dollar outflows from Brazil this
week as a thermometer of investor confidence and as a sign of how
much pressure the real could face.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Witnesses Growing Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, a multi-ethnic area in northwest China, ranked at the
national forefront in terms of the 1998 export growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The region's import-export volume hit 313 million US dollars
in spite of the financial crisis sweeping Asia, with export
growing by 11.9 percent on the previous year to 282 million
dollars, according to an official with the regional foreign trade
department.
</P>
<P>
The rise has been attributed to Ningxia's efforts to readjust
its foreign trade structure. The region not only consolidated
traditional markets in Asia, but also opened new markets in south
America, Africa and the Middle East. Exports to the United States
grew by 21 percent, with the volume to Islamic countries rising
by 110 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia enjoyed respective 40 percent growth for export
specialty items such as cashmere sweaters, tantalum products and
coal. The number of products with annual export values of over 10
million dollars has grown from seven to 11.
</P>
<P>
The regional government approved 45 foreign-funded projects
last year, with the total contracted value for related ventures
hitting 160 million dollars. Total allocated foreign investments
grew by 17 percent on 1997 to 70 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Marcoses Ask Court to Approve Compromise Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The three children of the late
president Ferdinand Marcos Monday asked the Supreme Court to
reconsider its recent ruling declaring "unconstitutional" a
compromise deal with the government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Tuesday that Marcos'
children Monday asked the Supreme Court to set aside its December
1998 decision junking the controversial agreement, under which the
government would get a 75 percent share of the recovered wealth of
Marcos and the Marcos family 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is the first legal acknowledgment by the Marcos children
that the court ruling stands in the way of negotiations with the
government, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During their informal talks with the Estrada government on a
possible out-of-court deal dividing the Marcos assets, the heirs
have made no mention of the court's ruling, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But according to the paper, the three asked the tribunal to
allow them to pursue the 75-25 deal, which includes a condition of
criminal immunity for the Marcoses, with the government.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada said earlier that his government may
start formal negotiations soon with the Marcos family and the
talks on recovering and dividing Marcos wealth could end within
this year.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Province Controlling Fishing Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province, which has
the longest coastline in China, has set a goal of holding marine
fishing growth to zero this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Zhiqiang, the vice-director of the Provincial
Aquatic Product Bureau, Zhejiang's total marine fishing output
this year will be no more than last year's 3.16 million tons.
This is mainly in response to the agreement between China and
Japan and the Republic of Korea on protecting marine resources,
which have been threatened by years of over-fishing.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has over 37,000 fishing boats and 200,000 fishermen.
Its fishing output has been growing at more than 5 percent a year
for 15 consecutive years. Lin says that it is now time to halt
the growth because the province has an adequate supply of aquatic
products and its exports to Southeast Asia have been declining.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the province will clamp down on its summer
fishing ban that began in 1995 in the East China Sea, and a
greater effort will be made to promote aquaculture and aquatic
product processing.

QUITO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's member in the
International Olympic Committee said on Monday he would not quit
and would appeal against the temporarily exclusion from the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Agustin Arroyo told reporters that he did not feel he was gu

</P>
<P>
"I'm not thinking of resigning for two reasons. One, because I
don't think it is an elegant exit to the problem. And two,
resignation might give the impression that I am leaving because I
feel guilty, that I don't want to be investigated," Arroyo said.
</P>
<P>
"Leave to prevent an investigation? No, no, I don't accept
that."
</P>
<P>
He added, "I'll ask to be heard by the IOC. Fortunately I
don't have anything to hide in my 30 years as a member of the
IOC."
</P>
<P>
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch on Sunday said Arroyo and
other five members had been suspended pending a vote on their
permanent expulsion in March for their alleged role in the

<HEADLINE> Manchester 'May Sue IOC' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Manchester could sue the
International Olympic Committee for compensation following the
corruption scandal, according to British Culture Secretary Chris
Smith.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the expulsion of six IOC members, but insisted
that the bidding for future games would have to be honest and
above board if Britain is to take part again.
</P>
<P>
Manchester lost out in the bidding process for the 2000
Olympics to Sydney, center of the latest bribery allegations, and
Smith said the issue of the city's organizing committee seeking
compensation had yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC reports, Smith said: "I don't think we
really know the answer to that at the moment, because we'll need
to know much more about what happened and did not happen in
relation to the Sydney decision for the Olympics next year."
</P>
<P>
"Also of course it will depend very much on whether Sydney
itself makes a substantial profit out of the games. If it's
indeed the case, and if it's proved there was some underhand me
ans that went on in order to get that decision, then I think the
question will be very much an open one," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Tony Banks backed his Secretary of State by
calling for a wholesale clean-up of the process for choosing host
cities.
</P>
<P>
"To restore confidence in the Olympic movement it has to go
back to the early Eighties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is cleaned up, then perhaps we can proceed towards a
freer, fairer Olympic selection process."
</P>
<P>
Swedish city Stockholm is also considering claiming a refund
of the money its organizing committee paid to the IOC in
connection with its failed bid to host the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
But Bob Scott, who headed two unsuccessful bids by Manchester,
admitted that the compensation process could be difficult to
complete.
</P>
<P>
"It is an absolute disgrace what is going on," he said, "but
it won't be very easy to get the money back."
</P>
<P>
Scott resisted the chance to join in the growing chorus
calling for IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to quit his post.
</P>
<P>
"We have a habit in this country of falling on our swords, but
I don't think that is particularly appropriate here - I think he
has to stay to sort it out," Scott said.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely clear he did not know about the cover up. He
has pleaded for people like me for evidence.
</P>
<P>
"Of course he has known about all these rumors, but it wasn't
until someone blew the whistle on the inside of the Salt Lake
City set-up that these things have come out. It's the first time
there has been evidence," he added.

<HEADLINE> Gas Pipeline From Turkmenistan to Pakistan to Be Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkmen Foreign
Minister Boris Shikhmuradov Monday asserted here that a 1.9
billion-dollar gas pipeline project from Turkmenistan to Pakistan
won't be affected by a U.S. company's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The gas pipeline project is "absolutely intact," he told
reporters soon after his arrival in Pakistan for a two-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmuradov is scheduled to meet Pakistan's Minister of
Petroleum and Natural Resources Nosar Ali Khan to discuss the gas
pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkmenistan President Saparmurat Niyazov and Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were interested in building the gas
pipeline project, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Companies may come and go but the national interest is
decisive. We will definitely like to see this project
implemented," Shikhmuradov said when asked to comment on an
American company's decision to withdraw from the grand project.
</P>
<P>
A consortium of foreign companies signed in November 1997 an
agreement to form a joint venture company under the name of the
Central Asia Gas Pipeline Limited.
</P>
<P>
They were to construct a 915-mile gas pipeline from
Turkmenistan's Daulatabad gas field to Multan in Pakistan while
passing through war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmuradov said there were "a large number of projects to
link Turkmenistan and Pakistan," including pipelines motorways and
roads.
</P>
<P>
"There are large prospects of expansion of trade between the
two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen foreign minister said he was here to fulfill his
"very important mission" to Pakistan as he was carrying a special
message of his president for Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif.
He will deliver the message to him on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with his Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz, he
will exchange views on bilateral issues.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sprinter Greene Wants to Shatter World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Maurice Greene of the
United States said today he would like to beat the world indoor
60-meter record this season again.
</P>
<P>
"The record is liable to go -- to the low 6.30s or the high
6.20s," said Green, who set the record of 6.39 seconds at Madrid,
Spain last February, and won the world 100 meters title in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said his goals this season include winning the world indoor
title and defend his outdoor championships.
</P>
<P>
"I've set some goals and I'm confident I can achieve them. I'm
going for the word every time I step on the track."
</P>
<P>
Greene will open his 1999 season Friday at a meet in Kansas,
then come to New York's Madison Square Garden for the Millrose
Games on February 5.
</P>
<P>
Later in February, he will take part in the United States
Championships in Atlanta, where he hopes the record to be ousted.
</P>
<P>
He will complete his indoor season in March at the World
Indoor Championships at Maebashi, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Greene takes his training together with Jon Drummond, world
No. 5 sprinter last year, and Ato Boldon, the world 200 meters
champion from Trinidad and Tobago, who will skip the indoor
season.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Greene's outdoor best mark was 9.90, slower than
his world title winning-clocking 9.86, and the world record of 9.8
4 set by Canada's Donovan Bailey.
</P>
<P>
"I can't run to break the world 100 meters record. That is the
mistake I made last year. I will have to run after the world
record," said Greene.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The China National Petroleum
Corp. has introduced a new software platform to aid the search
for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The software was developed by three Chinese petroleum research
institutes to reduce the amount of time needed to tap a gasfield,
according to Dr. Ran Xinquan of the company's Development
Department.
</P>
<P>
He explains that the software can be used with many servers to
collect and analyze oil-bearing structure data and has already
been put to use in four large fields in Sichuan, Changqing,
Tarim, and Qinghai..
</P>
<P>
China has 38 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves and the
CNPC had found 2.1 trillion cu.m. in proven reserves by the end
of last year. Its current production capacity, however, is not
big, at about 10 billion cu.m. a year and is expected to be
increased to 30 billion cu.m. by the year 2003.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Dalian in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, one of China's biggest ports, wants to
increase its handling capacity by attracting more foreign
partners to improve its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is the leading port for three northeastern provinces,
Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region. Last year it handled a total of 75.1 million
tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
The handling capacity of Dalian is an important indicator of
the economies of the three provinces and the regions, a local
official told Xinhua. The expansion of Dalian comes in large part
from foreign investment, which has improved the port's basic
facilities and efficiency. The port is now running a container
terminal with a Singaporean partner, and investors from Norway
and Japan have built a liquid-container wharf.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Italy agreed on a
diplomatic solution on the Kosovo crisis, but the solution must
be backed by "the immediate use of force, if necessary," said
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana here Monday.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema,
Solana said he hoped diplomatic steps "might be transformed into
success in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that, in the Italian view, solving the Kosovo
crisis is the key to achieving Balkan and Medditerranean
stability.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also noted that Italy is waging all possible efforts
to push the Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanians to the table
of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The project Italy is working on, with other countries, is the
pacification of the region through substantial autonomy for the
Serbian province while maintaining the territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Solana said Italy's support will be "a crucial factor if we
are forced to use force to reach a political solution" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO's efforts to stabilize Kosovo "would not be possible
without the solidarity, political guidance and active
contribution of Italy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Heat Adds Weatherspoon, Eyes Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Miami Heat bolstered
its reserves by signing Clarence Weatherspoon to a three-year
contract and the team could be in the market for another free
agent forward Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
The former Chicago Bulls star recently expressed interest in
playing for Miami or Orlando. Heat coach Pat Riley said he hasn't
pursued Rodman, but didn't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking about it," said Riley. "I don't know if he's
messing around, if he's serious or whatever. It wouldn't be my d
ecision. I'll put it to the team.
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting notion. I'll have to think long and hard
about it."
</P>
<P>
Rodman is expected to be in Miami this week for the Super
Bowl, and Riley said the Heat might talk to him.
</P>
<P>
The Heat used its $1.75 million salary-cap exception to sign
Weatherspoon, and his three-year deal totaled just under $5.8
million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rodman's former team played its first preseason
game at the United Center in front of empty seats. Some 18,000
free tickets were sent to Bulls season-ticket holders and another
3,000 to charities, but still United Center was not full for Tim
Floyd's NBA coaching debut.

Exports were worth 5.28 billion U.S. dollars, up 15 percent,

<HEADLINE> Suns Finally Get Gugliotta for Six Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Phoenix Suns finally
signed with Tom Gugliotta for a contract of six-year, $58.5
million today.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta turned down a more lucrative package from his
previous team, the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
One day after losing free agent Antonio McDyess to the Denver
Nuggets, the Sun can relax and insert one of the game's best
all-around forwards into their lineup. Gugliotta is expected to
join the Suns early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly something that helps ease the pain of
losing McDyess, no doubt about that," Suns general manager Bryan
Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
"This was real risky," Suns coach Danny Ainge said. "We let a
lot of free agents go by but we were patient and waited. We got a
guy we were excited about."
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta's departure is a blow to the Timberwolves, who have
made the playoffs the last two years with a three-pronged attack
that included Kevin Garnett and Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
Suns owner Jerry Colangelo was upset when McDyess turned down
a more lucrative offer to sign with the Nuggets. McDyess snubbed
the Suns a second time after initially hedging on Denver's offer,
then finally signed a six-year, $67.5 million deal with the
Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta is a two-time All-Star who is coming off an
injury-shortened season. He averaged 20.1 points, 8.7 rebounds
and 4.0 assists while shooting 50 percent from the field in 41
games last season.
</P>
<P>
He was a first-round pick of Washington and spent two-plus
seasons with the Bullets before being traded to Golden State
early in 1994-95 season.

<HEADLINE> Collymore Receives 'Stress Counselling' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa's Stan Collymore
intended to seek counselling to help him overcome "pressures and
stress".
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in response to Collymore's
non-appearance for Villa's FA Cup clash with Fulham on Saturday,
the club said: "Stan Collymore has made it clear that pressures
and stress have been building up for a long period of time, which
culminated in the decision by the club not to consider him fit to
play on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Following this, Stan has declared that he wishes to seek
further counselling to help him overcome his current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"Following extended meetings throughout the day with both Stan
and his representative, the manager and board of directors of
Aston Villa FC have expressed their desire to help Stan through
his current problems as it would with any of its employees."
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report, Villa manager John Gregory had
insisted the England striker will definitely not be in his team
to play Newcastle next weekend.
</P>
<P>
Reports suggested the seven million pounds man stormed out of
Villa Park after discovering he had been left on the bench, with
Paul Merson picked to replace the injured Dion Dublin up front.
</P>
<P>
But Collymore's agent Paul Stretford dismissed the
speculation, claiming the ex-Liverpool player declared himself
not well enough to play after consulting a member of Villa's
medical team.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said: "Stan would have been in the squad of 16 without
any doubt, but due to unforseen circumstances it was decided on
the morning of the game that we should let him stay away.
</P>
<P>
"We had to crack on without him. Most players go off in a bit
of a huff if they're not in the starting line-up but some can
cope with it better than others.
</P>
<P>
After an encouraging start to the season Collymore's form
slumped and he found himself out of the side in recent weeks, as
Julian Joachim partnered Dublin in attack.
</P>
<P>
Last week, after again being selected as a substitute, he hit
out at Gregory, insisting he was worthy of a place in the team
and was unhappy at playing a "peripheral part".
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of Collymore is just the latest episode in a
high-profile career that has been dogged by controversy.
</P>
<P>
He was fined 20,000 pounds at Liverpool for not attending
training and eventually left the club amid claims of bust-ups
with his team-mates.
</P>
<P>
In March 1998 he accused Liverpool's Steve Harkness of racist
abuse in Villa's 2-1 home victory. And he was sent off for a
shocking foul on the same player when the two sides met this
season.
</P>
<P>
Last June during the World Cup he was involved in an
altercation with his then girlfriend, TV presenter Ulrika
Jonsson, in a bar in Paris. He publicly apologised and announced
that he was "beside himself with remorse".

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Standard &AMP; Poor's on Monday
raised South Korea's foreign currency long-term and sovereign
credit ratings to triple B minus from double B plus, the company
said in a press release here.
</P>
<P>
It also raised the country's foreign currency short-term credit
rating to A-3 from B and its local currency long-term sovereign
credit rating to single A minus from triple B plus.
</P>
<P>
The outlook on both the foreign and local currency long-term
ratings remain positive.
</P>
<P>
The S &AMP; P said the restoration of an investment grade rating
for the country hit by the Asian financial crisis since summer
1997 reflects the government's progress in corporate and financial
sector restructuring and its restored external position.
</P>
<P>
The country's sovereign ratings are supported by an aggressive
fiscal stance to boost demand, with general government deficits
estimated at 5.3 percent for 1998 and forecast at 5.6 percent in
1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
The country's external position has been restored with fewer
vulnerabilities, as its net external debt is forecast to be cut to
23 percent of exports in 1999 from 38 percent in 1998, S &AMP; P said.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the New York-based rating company said the
country's credit standing could continue to improve in a
one-to-three-year time if private sector restructuring continues
apace.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: King Hussein Names Son as New Crown Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein Monday
removed his brother Hassan Ibn Talal as heir to the throne, and
named his eldest son Abdulla as crown prince, according to a Royal
decree reported by the state-run Petra news agency.
</P>
<P>
The move by Hussein is widely anticipated in Amman as the
63-year-old monarch has given strong signals of a possible
change of his successor since he returned home on January 19
after his six-month cancer treatment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Royal decree did not give any direct reasons for the
change of heir to the throne, but analysts in Amman believed that
Hussein was apparently unsatisfied with the domestic and foreign
policies adopted by Hassan during his six-month absence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cable News Network (CNN) earlier
Monday, Hussein said that he reconsidered the heir to the throne
in the best interests of the kingdom instead of personal
considerations.
</P>
<P>
Prince Abdullah, the new crown prince, is Hussein`s son from

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mostly Higher after Fall Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mostly higher Monday after a fall last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,203.32, up 82.65.
Last Friday, the index lost 143.41 to close at 9.120.67.
</P>
<P>
The Dow sank as much as 9,063.26, down 57 points in morning
trade and later gained as high as 9,170.36, up 49.64 points before
retreating. The composite climbed again before the closing.
</P>
<P>
The swing came as a result of earnings reports released by a
number of Dow components. AT&AMP;T Corp. reported a 58 percent rise
in fourth quarter profit while American Express gained 1.16 U.S.
dollars a share in net income in the same period, up from 1.04
U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
But earnings reports from other components were disappointed.
Procter &AMP; Gamble suggested that its third quarter earnings might
disappoint although its second quarter net earnings of 78 cents
per share were on target with expectations. Merch, the drug
maker, said it suffered a setback in the development of a new
depression treatment.
</P>
<P>
Broad stock indexes were also higher at the close. The
technology heavy Nasdaq was up 30.43 at 2,369.31, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index was up 8.79 at 1,233.98.
</P>
<P>
NYSE index was up 2.31 at 586.05 and American Stock
Exchange Index was up 1.32 at 706.01.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Style Co-exists Comfortably </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Art Institute of U.S. George Mason University has set up an
independent art research center for him to continue his artistic
pursuits.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Xikun loved animals from since his childhood. During the
chaotic years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Yuan studied
at Yunnan School of Art in Yunnan Province, Southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Instead of staying in the school to learn, he left school with
a drawing board, an oil lamp and painting brushes, and followed an
animal study team of Southwest China into the dense forests which
bears the name of "the Animal Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
The hard training enabled him to absorb nutrition for his
artistic inspiration and to lay a solid foundation for artistic
creation. It also cultivated his ever-deepening feelings for
nature and the creatures living in it.
</P>
<P>
What he could never forget was his encounter with a Bangladesh
tiger. Within a few yards, they stared at each other with eyes
flaring like lightening, he said. "At the moment, I experienced
the power and majesty of the 'King of Forests.'"
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the tiger showed him a cold shoulder because it
was the one with a full stomach! He suddenly came to realize
that even in the animal world, there was a law that all animals
would follow: when they are well fed, they would not "store up
grains for a better price."
</P>
<P>
This experience gave him the determination to paint animals
with his own brush to warn human beings of the danger of the
unfair extinction of animals.
</P>
<P>
"I want to let people know that they should treat animals --
our friends and our mirror -- kindly," he said, "We human beings
have learned the power of nature. If we do not promptly give
nature its due consideration, our disaster will be at the door and
later generations will likewise suffer."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Snow flakes are dancing
in bitter coldness, a lion is walking in the wildness. The lion's
flying hair, raised head and strong form make one feel the bluster
of the mountain wind and hear the long roar vibrating in the open
air.
</P>
<P>
The lion, living in the framed world, is part of the
masterpiece painting entitled "Awakened Lion," put on exhibition
on Monday at the United Nations tower.
</P>
<P>
The painting by Yuan Xikun, a celebrated Chinese artist, is a
masterpiece that manifests his extensive study of traditional
Chinese oil paintings.
</P>
<P>
"Yuan's paintings show a harmony between the national Chinese
painting and the Western oil painting," said Qin Huasun, Chinese
permanent representative to the United Nations, at the opening.
</P>
<P>
"They are nice paintings, and I like the lion and tiger most,"
Kensaku Hogen, U.N. under-secretary-general, told Xinhua, "the
style is modern, but it is also traditional."
</P>
<P>
The "Awakened Lion" painting "represents the rise of the
Chinese people out of poverty. It symbolizes China as an awakened
lion, no longer subjugated under the humiliation of foreign
powers," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan's works fully embody the inner world of Chinese culture
and exemplify the full development of traditional painting. The
artist emphasizes the essence of traditional painting --
conciseness and vividness. His paintings of animals fully
illustrate his love for animals and his praise of life.
</P>
<P>
Under his brush stroke, the tigers are wild but not savage,
aweinspiring but not fierce.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what form, color and temper a type of animal have,
they are result of the miracle Nature," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The line used in his paintings are resolute and free, and what
he pursues are accurate composition and coherent momentum. The
vitality of animals lies in the unity of "energy" and "power." The
tiger, from head to tail, is woven with overwhelming energy.
</P>
<P>
Each line, smooth and natural, expresses the exciting moment in
the movement of animal. Yuan even uses the simple lines to express
the richest space levels, with the thickness and fullness of
sculptures, and his paintings show a likeness both in appearance
and in spirit.
</P>
<P>
While carrying on traditional Chinese techniques, Yuan also
incorporates Western sketching methods. He has sensed that, in the
real material world, there exist no purely lines, but connecting
surface.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that using lines is not merely beneficial
in analyzing various dimensions of a whole appearance, but is able
to conclude numerous small surfaces out of shape.
</P>
<P>
The famous Chinese artist follows the rule that lines serve
composition. Therefore, when a painter composes, what he stresses
is still the spirit. "That is the essence of the freehand
brushwork in traditional Chinese painting," he said.

<HEADLINE> Asia Biggest Source of Net EU FDI Earnings: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Investors in the 15-nation
European Union (EU) saw over 7.6 billion euro or 62 percent of net
foreign direct investment (FDI) receipts from Asia in 1996, said
Eurostat, the EU's statistical office, in its report available
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest share, up a fifth over 1995. Among the
Asian countries and areas, Japan was an exception to the trend
with EU net FDI earnings falling by 25 percent compared to that in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong ranked as the top contributor to net EU FDI receipts
since EU investors received 21 percent (2.6 billion euro) of total
net earnings from there. While Australia and Singapore each
returned a net 1.8 billion euro and Brazil 1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1996, the EU recorded a rate of return of 8.2 percent
on its total of 543 billion euro of direct investment assets held
abroad. In contrast, direct investors from abroad received gross
income worth 7.6 percent of EU FDI liabilities (422 billion euro).
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, the report said, rates of return on EU FDI assets
were highest in Asia at 13.5 percent. On the other hand, assets in
America and Switzerland yielded below-average rates of around 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, least profitable were EU assets in the group
of newly industrialized countries of the second wave in Latin
America (5.8 percent) and in central and eastern Europe (4.8
percent). But the latter nearly doubled between 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among foreign investors in the EU, America enjoyed the highest
return at 10.3 percent. At the other end of the scale, Asia saw
returns of only 2.5 percent, in contrast to the high earnings of
EU investors there, the Eurostat said.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Focus on Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The 15-country European Union
(EU) foreign ministers on Monday discussed how best to ensure
consistency between the reform of the EU common agriculture policy
(CAP) and the financial means to be made available under an
agriculture-oriented financial perspective in the forthcoming
period.
</P>
<P>
The 15 ministers in their General Affairs Council meeting in
BRUSSELS agreed that recent CAP reforms have made it possible to
maintain strict budgetary discipline when drawing up annual budget
plans.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was presided over by German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer, current president of the EU Council of
ministers, the ministers called on the EU Agriculture Council of
ministers to pursue such a policy, consistent with achieving a
worthwhile and equitable reform.
</P>
<P>
In presidency conclusions on Agenda 2000, Germany emphasized
that the council takes the view that the ceiling on
agriculture-oriented financial perspective for the 15 member
states should be more in keeping with actual spending.
</P>
<P>
In his statement in the council's public debate on the
presidency's program, Fischer called for his colleagues from all
member states to complete the Agenda 2000 negotiations in time for
a special European Council meeting to be held in Brussels from
March 24 to 25. "Solutions need to be found for a more effective
structural policy, a thorough overhaul of the common agricultural
policy and a more equitable financial framework."
</P>
<P>
"Ahead of us lie tough negotiations in which we rely on the
support and willingness to compromise of all member states in
order to arrive at a balanced solution," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"We can not afford a crisis, and the failure of Agenda 2000
would certainly be a crisis. Our citizens would not understand
should we prove unable to strike a compromise acceptable to all,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece's secondary school
students Monday blocked a number of roads in the capital city of
Athens in protest against the government's education reforms which
introduce sweeping changes to the structure of secondary
education.
</P>
<P>
Students blocked the central Kifissias avenue, lit fires in
skips while another group closed off the major road in Kalamaki
and more road blocks were reported from Thisseio, near central
Athens.
</P>
<P>
A few secondary and primary school teachers also rallied
outside the Education Ministry as part of Monday's 24-hour strike
against the education reforms.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 500 of Greece's 3,170 secondary schools
are still under student occupation.
</P>
<P>
Students have threatened to continue their protest, which began
in early November.
</P>
<P>
They are forcing the Greek government to abolish the education
reform law, but the Greek government-led by Costas Simitis has
refused to do so, saying that it is aimed at getting secondary
education for Greek children closer to that of their counterparts
in the rest of the European Union (EU).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Democrat Introduces Motion to Dismiss Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- As U.S. senators from both
the Republican and Democratic Parties struggled with the question
of calling witnesses, a senior Democrat Monday introduced a motion
asking the Senate to dismiss the two articles of impeachment
against President Bill Clinton and end his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors immediately opposed the request from
Democratic Senator Robert Byrd, saying that dismissing the charges
without calling witnesses would be "inconsistent with the
constitutional standards and harmful to the institutions of our
government."
</P>
<P>
Charles Canady, a Republican lawmaker, told the senators that
the White House arguments -- that Clinton's offenses in concealing
an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky didn't
rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors -- "will debase
and degrade the institution of the presidency."
</P>
<P>
"I ask you to consider the harm he caused, the indignity he
brought to the institution of the presidency," Canady said.
</P>
<P>
Even before Byrd made his plea, Senate Republican Leader Trent
Lott declared he had enough Republican votes to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
"We have the votes, I believe, not to dismiss it at this
point," Lott said. "I think that is a short-circuiting of the
process that would not be fair. The American people would not
agree with that."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Republicans summarily rejected a plan that would have
brought the trial to an end on Friday with no witnesses. The White
House criticized the decision.
</P>
<P>
Lott said senators would vote Tuesday or Wednesday on the more
difficult issue of whether to allow House prosecutors to call
witnesses. As both sides met in private, Lott declined to predict
the outcome of that later floor vote.
</P>
<P>
With all 45 Democratic senators united in opposition to
witnesses, one Republican senator conceded there could be enough
Republican defections to defeat the plan. Republicans hold a 55-45
majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.

BAGHDAD -- A residential area in southern Iraqi city of

KHARTOUM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail held talks with a mission of the
Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks failed to produce any tangible results on holding
peace talks between the Sudanese government and the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the major rebel movement in
southern Sudan led by John Garang.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister said that the SPLA sought, through the
partial cease-fire, to build up its forces in some battlefields to
intimidate the people and scare off the humanitarian relief
workers in the region.
</P>
<P>
He urged the IGAD partners to be fully impartial in the peace
process in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD groups Kenya, Uganda, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and
Sudan.

The IGAD partner states, including Canada, Italy, Britain, and

</P>
<P>
The IGAD mission arrived here on Sunday for a visit to the
Sudanese capital as part of its efforts to bring to the
negotiating table the Sudanese government and the SPLA militia.

<P>
Several rounds of talks between the two warring sides have gone
to no avail in Kenya capital Nairobi and Ethiopian capital Adis
