<P>
HONG KONG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
Ltd. (HACTL) announced today that its output reached 1.489 million
tons during the past year, overtaking the 1995 record of 1.397
million tons.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest yearly total registered in HACTL's 21-year
operating history at Kai Tak International Airport and represents
an increase of 6.6 percent over the previous year's total.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by HACTL show that export cargo for 1996
totaled 703,522 tons, import cargo amounted to 607,594 tons and
transshipment goods accounted for 178,032 tons.
</P>
<P>
HACTL remains optimistic about its forecast that Hong Kong's
air cargo volume will continue to grow steadily towards the turn
of the century, supporting the air cargo operator's plans to turn
its new air cargo handling facility at the New Airport,
SuperTerminal 1, into Asia's largest air cargo handling hub.
</P>
<P>
In terms of international air cargo tonnage, the 1996 figures
will likely secure Hong Kong's position as the world's second
busiest airport after Japan's Tokyo Narita Airport.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accuses Greece of Rejecting Proposal on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today accused Greece of
rejecting the U.S. proposal for a ban on military flights over
the island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel said that the latest development
had indicated that the Greek government was reluctant to ease
tensions in the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Cyprus special envoy Carey Cavanaugh reiterated the
military flight ban proposal during his visits to Athens and
Ankara last week.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was first put forward last summer by Madeleine
Albright, former U.S. permanent representative to the United
Nations and now new U.S. secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece turned down the proposal again as it did last
summer, according to Turkey's media reports.
</P>
<P>
Akbel said that the rejection of the proposal fully showed
who preferred tension and clashes instead of compromise,
adding that "Greece opposes to any kind of improvement which
will ease tension on the island."
</P>
<P>
The relation between Greece and Turkey has always been tense
for the Aegean and Cyprus issues, and has become even worse as a
result of the Cypriot government's plan to buy Russian-made
S-300 missiles with a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
by supporters of union with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen met here today with his Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama,
and the two discussed bilateral ties, Macao and other issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that maintaining contacts and exchanges and
enhancing trust and understanding will be of great importance to
the smooth development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also China's vice-premier, said Sino-Portuguese relations
in various fields have been developing smoothly since the two
countries established diplomatic ties 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said China is preparing for the upcoming visit to Beijing of
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio next month, adding that the
visit will add new momentum to bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On economic and trade cooperation, Qian said trade volume has
been rising gradually as a result of efforts on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Gama, for his part, thanked China for supporting its bid to
become a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council, adding that the two sides should have closer
consultations at the United Nations in the future.
</P>
<P>
On Macao, Qian described the work of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Liaison Group as effective, expressing the belief that the smooth
reversion of Macao to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 and the
maintenance of Macao's stability and development benefit both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Gama pledged continued cooperation with China on the Macao
issue.
</P>
<P>
He said, Portugal, as a member of the European Union (EU), will
strive to strengthen EU relations with China and play a positive

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Privatization Drive Moves Ahead in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 15,000 small businesses were
privatized in Ukraine in the first 10 months of last year, 22
percent more than the government's target for the whole year,
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
But the privatization of large state-owned enterprises was less
successful, with sales, at the beginning of November, 25 percent
short of the 1996 target.
</P>
<P>
The government wanted to privatize 12,225 small businesses in
1996 through auctions, buy-outs and leasing, but the State
Property Fund (SPF) which is in charge of privatizations sold
nearly 15,000 enterprises by November 1.
</P>
<P>
That means that the government's privatization plan for small
enterprises has now been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
"Small businesses and the service sector are completely out of
government hands," SPF advisor Miron Vasilik said.
</P>
<P>
But privatization of large state-owned enterprises is still
continuing. The SPF had only sold 2,650 large businesses, against
a target of 3,505 for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Vasilik said that 80 percent of the goal for large-scale
privatization will have been met when the annual statistics are
calculated.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 small, medium-sized and large enterprises have
been sold off since Ukraine embarked on its privatization program
in the early 1990s as part of a plan to move to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Vasilik said he was optimistic that that Ukraine would be able
to attract more foreign investment now that the government no
longer controlled these enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Drunken Hijacker Arrested by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A drunken passenger who briefly
hijacked an All Nippon Airways (ANA) Boeing 777 was arrested
shortly after the plane landed at Fukuoka airport in southern
Japan, Japanese authorities said.
</P>
<P>
A Transport Ministry spokesman said no one was hurt in the
brief hijack drama, which ended when the knife-wielding hijacker
was overpowered by an ANA employee and arrested by police.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker was identified as Yuichi Yano, 31, of Osaka, the
National Police Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with 182 passengers and 10 crew on board, was
completing a one-hour scheduled domestic flight from Itami
airport, on the border of Osaka and Hyogo prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the ANA flight radioed to the Fukuoka airport
tower shortly before landing at 18:40 that his plane had been
hijacked.
</P>
<P>
Yano, who sat in the front row of the plane, entered the
cockpit with a 15-cm fruit knife and demanded that when the plane
landed at Fukuoka it should be refueled and take off again for an
unnamed international airport,
</P>
<P>
After the plane landed he then told the pilot he wanted to get
off the plane with the stewardess, and walked out of the cockpit
by himself toward the exit, Japanese media reported.
</P>
<P>
The passengers, who were unaware a hijacking was in progress,
filed off the plane as normal after about a 15-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
Yano is currently being questioned by the Fukuoka Airport
Police, but police officials said they still do not know why he
attempted the hijack or how he was able to carry the fruit knife
onto the plane.
</P>
<P>
After the hijacking, Fukuoka airport was closed until 19:55.

TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government said
today it would do its utmost to prevent the oil spill off the
coast of western Japan from spreading further along the coast,
Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The government will study the damage caused by the incident,
the handling of the incident, compensation, and measures to
prevent a recurrence, Kyodo quoted Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroky
Kajiyama as saying.
</P>

The 13,157-ton Russian tanker Nakhodka, carrying some 19,000
tonnes of oil, broke into two during a storm and sank in
the Sea of Japan some 130 kilometers northeast of Shimane
prefecture on January 2.
</P>
<P>
The bow, estimated to contain about 3,000 tonnes of oil, broke
off from the main part of the vessel and drifted aground some 200
meters off the coast of the town Mikuni in Fukui Prefecture, on
January 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Oil from a wrecked Russian tanker
in the Sea of Japan was found today to have penetrated oil fences
established around two Japanese nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
At the Mihama power plant in Fukui Prefecture of Kansai
Electric Power Co., security personnel found small patches of oil
floating inside the 630-meter outer layer of a three-layer oil
fence, according to Kyodo News.
</P>
<P>
Larger patches, including one measuring about one meter in
diameter, were found outside the oil fence.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 meters of the fence, which is patrolled every 30
minutes, was opened in the early hours of this morning to allow
the coming and going of fishing boats. The oil was believed to
have drifted through at that time.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo reported that small patches of oil were also found to
have got through an oil fence around the Shiga nuclear power plant
of Hokuriku Electric Power Co., which is located further north on
the Noto Peninsula of Ishikawa Perfecture.
</P>
<P>
The penetrated oil was collected and no damage was caused to
the power plants, Kyodo said, quoting official sources.
</P>
<P>
The 13,157-ton Russian tanker Nakhodka, carrying some 19,000
tons of fuel oil, broke into two during a storm and sank in the
sea on January 2, roughly 110 kilometers northeast of Shiman
Prefecture's Oki Islands.
</P>
<P>
The bow, estimated to contain about 2,800 tons of oil, broke
off from the main part of the vessel and drifted aground some 200
meters off the coast of the town of Mikuni, Fikui Prefecture, on
January 7.
</P>

Unfavorable weather conditions off the coastal town of Mikuni
have prevented a salvaging company from pumping oil from the
tanker's bow since Friday afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian authorities are to
take actions against an international network that smuggles
Nigerian girls to overseas to engage in illicit sex trade, "The
Punch" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the authorities are now on the trail of five
Benin-City based persons operating in the trade, including a
local chief and prince. It added that the barons have been under
the surveillance of the security agents in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The trade of smuggling Nigerians girls to overseas for
prostitution has existed for years, but it reached an alarming
proportion in 1994 when the country's economy worsened, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the trade is operated by a cartel of
Nigerians who lured the girls with fake jobs to countries such as
Italy, Belgium, Holland, Burkina Faso, Mali and Benin, among
others.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out Edo State in southern Nigeria is
particularly notorious for the trade. Many shcoll-age girls are
forced to withdraw from schools by their parents and handed over
to the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said when the security agents raided their
bases in the state, the smugglers have all fled, perhaps because
they have been tipped off about their arrest.
They are still hunted by the authorities, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Change Policy on Holding Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan plans to lift its ban on
financial institutions owning more than 5 percent of a company's
outstanding shares, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The amount of shares that a financial firm can hold in a
certain company is currently limited to 5 percent under Japan's
Antitrust Law, but the government sees the restriction as a
hindrance to financial deregulation.
</P>
<P>
Although the new policy will abandon strict application of the
"5 percent rule," it will still regulate the amount of shares a
group of financial companies can hold in order to prevent
unlimited share holdings, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The government is now working on lifting the ban on holding
companies to promote Japan's so-called "Big Bang" financial reform
package.
</P>
<P>
Allowing holding companies for financial institutions will help
to establish a group of financial institutions able to compete in
international markets.
</P>
<P>
They will also help the reconstruction of financial
institutions burdened with bad loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC), the British police force in Northern Ireland, is
investigating two suspected terrorist bomb attacks Monday on a
Belfast police station and a car, according to a BBC television
report today.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland police said that a blast earlier today outside
an RUC station in east Belfast may have been a bomb attempt on
security forces.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the blast, near Mount Pottinger police
station in the nationalist Short Strand area, may have been caused
by a coffee jar bomb.
</P>
<P>
Although a woman was taken to hospital after the explosion with
a suspected heart attack, no other injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
A couple and their five-month-old baby escaped injury when a
device exploded under their car today in Larne, County Antrim, a
seaside town north of the Northern Ireland capital.
</P>
<P>
Although no one has so far claimed responsibility for the two
incidents, they were thought to be the third attack by the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) in three days in what police said was a
deliberate strategy to kill a member of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Flanagan, chief constable of Northern Ireland, said
Sunday that the IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland, was deliberately targeting the police forces in
the area.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a series of attacks that are very real attempts to
kill. If these attacks continue, my fear is that killing will be
the inevitable result," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Chinese Warship's Salvage Operation Well underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINKOU TOWN, WUHAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Salvage operations
to retrieve a warship from Yangtze River waters near Wuhan in
central China's Hubei Province, are about to be finished by the
end of this month, a salvage company supervisor announced today.
</P>
<P>
The 62-m cruiser, the "Chunshan", named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
the forerunner of the Chinese democratic revolution, was involved
in many important events in the first half of the century, and was
sunk on October 24, 1938 by Japanese, after shooting down three
Japanese warplanes in the War of Resistance against Japanese
Aggression.
</P>
<P>
Part of the cruiser almost rose to the water surface at the
salvage site at Jianshan town, 26 km from downtown Wuhan city,
according to Li Guanghui, manager of the Chongqing Yangtze River
Rescue and Salvage Company, which is in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of the cruiser will emerge on January 28, half
of month earlier than was scheduled," he said.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser has been moved some 200 meters from where it went
down 59 years ago. The salvage team placed 20 steel cables under
the hulk, one every three meters, to form a steel net to lift the
ship out of the water as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The salvage work was first vertical, then horizontal, done in
steps, Li explained.
</P>
<P>
His company won the bid for the salvage operation a year ago
because of its engineering skills and the workability of its plan.
</P>
<P>
The project began on November 12, and since then large amounts
of sand and mud have been moved.
</P>
<P>
The ship will be sent to a shipyard for a year of restoration
work, after which it will be on display at Jinkou Town, according
to local officials.

HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's trade promotion body,
Zimtrade, said today it will launch a major marketing drive to promote
the country's products in neighboring Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
It was proposed a Zimbabwe delegation first visit the

It said the Beira Corridor development conference, held in Harare
last month, had highlighted the potential for doing business in
Mozambique, whose sea ports were heavily used by Zimbabwean
companies.
</P>
<P>
Latest trade statistics show that Zimbabwean exports to
Mozambique increased from 35 million US Dollars in 1993 to just
over 44 million in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Foreign Minister on New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister
Venancio De Moura said here today he is hopeful a new Angolan
government of national unity will inaugurated on Saturday despite
difficulties in forming an integrated army.
</P>
<P>
The minister said after UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi rejected
the post of vice-president, a place has still to be found for him
in the new government.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Harare, he
said peace and stability are the two critical elements to
Angola's future.
</P>
<P>
"Without the two elements of peace and stability, we cannot
freely dedicate and devote our efforts to the development of the
country," said De Moura.
</P>
<P>
De Moura said 70 UNITA deputies, who were elected in the 1992
general elections but never took up their seats after the civil
war resumed, are expected to return to Luanda this month.
</P>
<P>
He said they are now waiting for other members of UNITA to
go to Luanda and join the government.
</P>
<P>
All soldiers, he said, should by the end of this month be
selected and integrated into a new national army.
</P>
<P>
"We have received some UNITA generals and we hope those still
outstanding will join their colleagues," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the new army now stands at 18,000 as they are still
waiting for some UNITA men selected for integration to
complete the 23,300-strong force.
</P>
<P>
De Moura, who is on a tour of southern African countries to
invite regional leaders to the inauguration of the government of
national unity of Angola, has already been to South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Lebanon Reiterate Unity in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- As the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on Hebron yielded fruit, Syria and Lebanon today
reiterated their unity in dealing with Israelis in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Lebanese coordination committee, co-chaired by
Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Zuebi and visiting Lebanese
counterpart Rafik Hariri, today agreed that partial and separate
solutions to issues with Israel will never help the peace process
on firm, just and comprehensive grounds.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting affirmed Syrian and Lebanese adherence to
the concept of just and comprehensive peace, and to the
fundamental principles of the Madrid conference, on the basis of
international legitimacy as well as Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolutions stipulate complete Israeli withdrawal from
the Syrian Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967 border lines, and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon and the West
Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying the Golan Heights since the 1967
Middle East war and Syria demands its unconditional return. Israel
also established a 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in 1985
in south Lebanon in a bid "to protect northern Israel from
cross-border attacks."
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended peace talks with Syria early last year and
proposed a "Lebanon first" plan trying to handle the Syria and
Lebanon issues separately.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu made no change in his government's policy towards the
Syria and Lebanon issues.
</P>
<P>
"Israel views the Golan Heights as a region of strategic
military importance for the defense of Israel against current
threats," he said.
</P>
<P>
In any future negotiations between Israel and Syria, he said,
"either party should be free to raise its claims at the
negotiating table. This includes territorial claims."
</P>
<P>
Zuebi and Hariri signed the minutes of the joint meeting here,
ensuring bilateral cooperation in conformity with the treaty of
cooperation and coordination between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Zuebi stressed the importance of solidarity
between Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that whatever harms Lebanon will harm Syria, and vice
versa, and that the security of Syria is that of Lebanon and the
other way round.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said meetings between officials of the two countries
would continue with the object of achieving Syrian-Lebanese
integration.

<HEADLINE> ANC Supports S. African Government's Policy of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The ruling African
National Congress (ANC) of South Africa is fully supportive of
the government's arms sales policy, and is confident the cabinet
will decide rightly the proposed sale of tank firing control
systems to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made at a press conference here today by
ANC's Deputy Secretary General Cheryl Carolus following the
party's three-day closed-door meeting which ended on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Carolus said the ANC-led government will not be "frog-marched"
into making one or the other decision "purely on the basis of a
hypocritical stance by another country whose arms are also being
sold in the region".
</P>
<P>
She was apparently referring to the criticism of the arms deal
by the United States, which threatened last week to cut aid to
South Africa if the controversial arms deal goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
Carolus said the ANC reiterated the fact that
South Africa is a sovereign country quite capable of making
decisions by itself on the basis of a policy "we are very happy
with".
</P>
<P>
If the United States wanted clarification on the deal, it
could have used the ordinary channels rather than have "some
petty government officials standing up and attacking the
sovereignty of another country", added Carolus.

<HEADLINE> UN Report Warns of Problems over Freshwater Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Water shortages in the
next century are likely to restrain economic and social
development, according to a new report by United Nations agencies.
</P>
<P>
The new report, "Comprehensive Assessment of the Freshwater
Resources of the World," finds that 1.2 billion poor people, more
than one-fifth of the world's population, live in countries facing
"medium-high to high water stress."
</P>
<P>
Medium-high stress means that countries are consuming from 20
percent to 40 percent of their available fresh water for
agricultural, industrial or household use each year; a 20 percent
utilization rate is considered safe. High stress countries consume
more than 40 percent of their fresh water supplies a year.
</P>
<P>
But the study forecast that by 2025, when the world's
population is expected to reach 8.3 billion, with most of the
increase coming in the rapidly growing urban areas of the third
world, as much as two-thirds of the population will be affected by
moderate-to-severe water shortages unless supplies are used more
efficiently, the pollution of rivers and lakes is curbed and more
waste water is purified for reuse.
</P>
<P>
The assessment said that water use has been increasing more
than twice as fast as population during this century and that the
resulting shortages have been worsened by pollution.
</P>
<P>
As a result, at least one-fifth of the worl'd people lack
access to safe drinking water and more than half lack adequate
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
With agricultural irrigation accounting for 70 percent of all
water use and the world's population growing, the report forecasts
increasing pressure to devote more water to food production.
</P>
<P>
But it suggests that countries short of water resist doing
that and consider devoting their limited water resources to the
needs of export industries that could earn money to import more food.
</P>
<P>
The study calls for a more market-oriented approach to
managing supplies, saying water must be perceived as a
marketable commodity with a price set by the balance of supply
and demand.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Promises to Facilitate Climate for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
reassured that it will take measures to help create a right
climate for a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the daily press briefing, Government Spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said "when the American initiative begins,
we will take our own decisions that would facilitate the climate
in which efforts for a solution to the Cyprus problem will be
made."
</P>
<P>
The United States is expected to launch a peace initiative on
Cyprus in April and the Cypriot government believes it could
continue until August, when the pre-election campaign for the
1998 presidential elections begins on the island.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said this period should be long enough to bring
about results, if there is political will from both Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides for a political solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that enough preparation has been made since 1996 as each
side's initial positions have been clarified.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides expressed the hope that concrete efforts to solve
the Cyprus problem will begin during the visit here by United
Nations Secretary General's special representative for Cyprus, Han
Sung Joo, at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Han's upcoming visit comes following a tension on the island
after Cyprus' acquisition of Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air
missiles.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. official here has announced that Han will arrive in
Cyprus in a bid to start direct negotiations between the two
communities on the island, trying to move the peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have been held on
and off for the past 22 years, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
and seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.

HARARE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chiredzi authorities in south
Zimbabwe are appealing to the government to declare some parts of
the drought-prone district disaster areas and order an immediate
distribution of relief food.
</P>
<P>
District Administrator Michael Tavaruva said today 120,000
people in Sengwe, Save and Matibi are facing imminent starvation
because very little or no rains have fallen.
</P>
<P>
"As we speak now these people have not planted anything
because there simply is no rain in the area. So we anticipate
that they will soon be requiring food aid," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he dismissed reports that people have started dying
of hunger in Sengwe Ward.
</P>
<P>
"This is not true. Most people still have food to carry them
several weeks," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Warns Cyprus on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Rauf
Denktas warned today that the Cypriot government's going-ahead
with the purchase of Russian missiles would lead to Turkey's
strong reaction.
</P>
<P>
Denktas made this remark upon his arrival here for his
three-day visit to Turkey at the invitation of Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel for exchanging views on Cyprus' purchase of
Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
He said the missile program would change the balance of power
on the eastern Mediterranean island and pull Cyprus into danger,
adding Turkey would possibly deal "a powerful counterblow."
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that Turkey and northern Cyprus would
issue a joint declaration and Turkey was expected to reiterate its
determination to protect Turkish Cypriots' security and rights.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Denktas is expected to meet Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller as well as the Chief of General Staff of the Turkish
Armed Forces Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Cyprus has remained tense since the Cypriot
government contracted to buy the 150-kilometer-range missiles
early this month.
</P>
<P>
On January 10, Ciller warned that Turkey would not hesitate
to hit these offensive missiles if the Cyprus government
continued the arms program.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi paid a two-day visit to northern Cyprus between
January 13 and 14 to show Turkey's determination to block the
deployment of the missiles on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides has promised not to deploy
the missiles in the next 16 months, but the Turkish government
said that this made no difference if Cyprus refused to give up the
program.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split into two parts since the Turkish armed
forces landed on it in 1974 and seized the northern third of the
strategic island.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 35,000-strong Turkish troops are stationed on
the island to protect Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Solana Leaves Moscow after Talks with Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 20(Xinhua) -- Javier Solana, Secretary-General
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), left here this
evening for Brussels after his talks with Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov over the NATO's expansion dispute.
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in Moscow on Sunday evening for a one-day visit
described here as "the first probe into potentialities." He was
expected to discuss with Primakov NATO's eastward expansion plans
and Moscow's sharply negative attitude to them.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a brief statement after the
talks between Solana and Primakov, describing the talks as
difficult but beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Their talks lasted for over five hours, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported, without giving further details. It is obvious that
the two men failed to reach any agreement, diplomats here believe.
</P>
<P>
While Solana and Primakov were discussing behind the closed
doors, Russian presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a
news briefing in the Kremlin that one should not have "too high
expectations" for the Russia-NATO dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He described the talks between Solana and Primakov as "the
first meeting" or "part of this dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"Russia's position is well known and remains unchanged," the
spokesman said, adding that "Moscow does not believe sweet
promises" which are not backed up by specific obligations.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhebmsky also said that although Primakov and Solana have
held only their first meeting, its results may influence Russia's
further steps in relations with the West military alliance.

<HEADLINE> Reproductive Health Services Urged for African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- African countries were today
urged to provide reproductive health services for women and
youth.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Dr. Kebede Tadesse, the Minister in charge of
social and administrative affairs at the Ethiopian Prime Minister's
Office, when he made a speech at the "African forum on adolescent
reproductive health'', which opened today at the Conference Centre
of the UN Eonomic Commission for Africa (ECA) here.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kebede said the provision of reproductive health services
needs greater concern so as to address issues related to unwanted
pregnancy, unsafe abortion, reproductive tract infection, sexually
transimitted diseases, aids, and gender based violence.
</P>
<P>
He said appropriate reproductive health services should
include information, education, counselling, prevention,
detection and management of health problems as well as care and
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Health Adem Ibrahim also said with the
critical lack of reproductive health services and counselling in
African countries, adolescents have inadequate understanding of
their own health needs and of how to protect themselves against the
consequences of risky sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
More than 350 policymakers, health care providers, researchers,
young people from across Africa are attending the five-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued by the forum, more than 50 percent
of young women in Africa give birth before the age of 20, and in
some countries as much as 40 percent have their first child by
age 18. Young women ageed 15-19 are twice as likely to die during
pregnancy and childbirth as older women. Their infants also are
more likely to die than children born to women in their twenties or
thirties. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities today
accused the United States of being behind an attack on Iran's
cultural center in the Pakistani city of Lahore Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific affairs Alaeddin
Boroujerdi said "what happened in Pakistan in recent days was
the result of the U.S. and Israeli moves."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that the reason for the charges was
"the two countries intend to overshadow the international Qods
day (the last Friday of the fasting Month of Ramadan) by fanning
the flames of sectarianism."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Pakistani government to adopt more serious
and more practical measures to protect all centers affiliated to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, a group of
people believed to be Sunni Muslims Sunday set fire on the
library of the Iranian Cultural Center in Lahore, burning 12,000
books, including exquisite copies of the holy Koran, Islam's holy
book, and other religious books.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi noted that "burning thousands of copies of the holy
Koran is a profane insult to the Islamic sanctities, which has
hurt the feelings of Iranian Muslims and other Muslims of the
world."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that "we strongly condemn this crime and urge the
Islamabad government to encounter those perpetrating such an
un-Islamic move."
</P>
<P>
Muslims can stand against the United States only when they
preserve their unity and this is why the enemies of Islam have
been doing all within their power to disunite Muslims, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has always favored and supported
preservation of unity among Shiite and Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on whether the incident would
adversely affect Tehran-Islamabad relations, he replied, "burning
the copies of the holy Koran was the work of a terrorist
group backed by the U.S. and has nothing to do with the
people and government of Pakistan."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Aid for Refugee-Affected Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
today appealed to the United Nations and donor community to
assist in the rehabilitation and development program of Kagera
region heavily affected by refugees from Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Principle Secretary in the Prime
Minister's Office Ben Moses when launching the project on
"rehabilitation of refugees affected areas in Kagera region" in
northwestern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Moses led a high level delegation of 12 ambassadors to
Tanzania, including the resident representative of UNDP, on a
one-day post-assesment mission to the camps which were occupied
by Rwandan refugees in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the Tanzanian government, UN agencies,
donors and NGOs will be expected together to assess on-going
rehabilitation and development task and identify areas of
priority.
</P>
<P>
They will analyze over-all micro-economic and development
issues facing the region and recommend sustainable development
infrastructure and income generating projects.
</P>
<P>
According to Moses, more than 540,000 Rwandan refugees have
been repatriated to Rwanda while there are still about 16,000
refugees and arrangements are being made to send them back home.
</P>
<P>
There are also 80,000 refugees from Burundi at Lukole and
Kitale camps who will continue to remain in the region for the

MOSCOW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
tonight left Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital and moved to his
Gorki-9 residence outside Moscow, his press office reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had been hospitalized with pneumonia since January 8.
He underwent a heart bypass surgery on November 5 and returned to
the Kremlin on December 23.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing in the
Kremlin that he completed his course of treatment for pneumonia in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Yeltsin will continue to recuperate
in the out-of-town residence for a few days to come and "it would
be wrong to expect a forced return of the president to full-sale
work" and "expect him to have a crowded schedule of working
meetings this coming week.
</P>
<P>
However, Yastrzhembsky went on to say, "one or two meetings"
will probably take place. Meanwhile, the president will continue
to "actively work with documents."

ADDIS ABABA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada said today the Ethiopian people should condemn
elements bent on using religion as a cover to promote their
hidden political agenda and trying to impose by force their faith

</P>

In his address to the 15th main conference of the Ethiopian

freedom of religion.
</P>

He said fundamentalism from whichever direction it comes is
barbaric, inhuman and undemocratic and employs terrorism, war and
murder as its instruments.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Small Companies Run to Managed Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Small businesses across the
United States are joining the rush to managed health care, two
studies being released this week show.
</P>
<P>
One of the studies, of 2,037 firms nationwide, found that in
1995, 69 percent of insured workers in firms employing fewer than
50 people are now in managed care plans. That's a big increase
from 22 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Researchers say the proportion now is likely on a par with the
73 percent of large company workers now in managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies are enrolling workers in health
maintenance organizations (HMOs) and looser managed-care plans
such as preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and point of
service (POS) plans. Under such systems, patients should go
through regular medical examination and treatment at designated
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
They can see special doctors outside the HMO's network only
with the approval of the hospital and health insurance companies.
Enrollees of POS can also do so if they make an additional premium
payment.
</P>
<P>
To save costs, a growing number of companies are taking up the
HMO plan. About 20 percent of the insured population is now
enrolled in such plans, up from 9 percent in 1993, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
As a result, health insurance costs for companies of all sizes
rose an average 2 to 3 percent a year between 1994 and 1996, the
lowest rate of rise in decades.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Takeovers Target UK Firms, Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Worries over Britain's attitude
towards monetary union have not deterred foreign firms from
rushing to snap up UK firms, making them Europe's number one
takeover targets, according to a survey revealed today.
</P>
<P>
The study, for the corporate finance arm of accountants KPMG,
found that sales of UK businesses to overseas buyers reached a new
high of 23 billion pounds (39.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, up
8 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign takeovers of UK firms exceeded the total for all the
other European Union countries combined, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The head of mergers and acquisitions at KPMG corporate finance,
Stephen Barrett, said: "International companies evidently believe
that the UK is the best base for expansion in Europe."
</P>
<P>
"They are not being put off by the prospect of Britain missing
the first stage of European monetary union," Barrett added.
</P>
<P>
American firms headed the spending rush, splashing out more
than 11 billion pounds (18.7 billion U.S. dollars) on UK
takeovers, particularly in the rush to buy regional electricity
companies (RECs).
</P>
<P>
But while the world investment scene may continue to
accelerate, Britain may see a slowdown in 1997, Barrett said, as a
hiatus inevitably comes with an election, regardless of the
political outcome.
</P>
<P>
The value of UK firms sold topped the level of foreign firms
bought by British companies for the second year running.
</P>
<P>
In the buying stakes, Britain regained its appetite for
overseas deals, spending more than 20 billion pounds (34 billion
U.S. dollars), up almost a quarter on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The US proved to be the top target for UK firms as acquisitions
rose 25 percent to 9.3 billion pounds (15.8 billion U.S. dollars),
followed by France, Germany and Australia.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A week-long seminar on
vocational training in east and southern Africa under Japan
International Cooperation Agency's (JICA) assistance opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the seminar, Ugandan Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Labor and Social Services Paul Etiang urged African
countries to cooperate, pay special attention and lay strategies
for the development of planned human resource that will lead to
the emergence of modernized Africa.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, whose theme is developing a national policy on
vocational training, is organized by the JICA.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Etiang commended JICA's operatives in

He called upon African policy makers to formulate national
human skills development policies that link basic education
systems with the labor market and accord vocational training the
prestigious status it deserves.
</P>

He disclosed that Uganda has identified vocational training as
the essential, effective, quickest and most flexible way of human
skills development in transforming the country into a modern

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: British Weapons Likely in Northern Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government will
investigate whether British weapons, admittedly sold to Turkey,
have actually ended up in Turkish Cypriots-controlled northern
areas on the island.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement at a daily briefing today, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said the allegations appeared in
Sunday's edition of the British newspaper "The Observer".
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman admitted today that Britain
does not sell arms to either side of the divided Cyprus, but sells
weapons to Turkey as a NATO ally.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said there are U.S. and German arms in the
Turkish-occupied northern part of the island, an act in violation
of the U.S. law and NATO regulations.
</P>
<P>
But a presence of British arms, if proven to be true, poses an
additional complication because of Britain's role as a guarantor
power, the spokesman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, I am not claiming this is the case," he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain together with Turkey and Greece were guarantors of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of
the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the former colonial power, has retained two sovereign
military bases on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split into two parts since the Turkish armed
forced laned on it in 1974 and seized the northern third of the
island. At present, some 35,000-strong Turkish troops are
stationed on the island to protect Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Promises Not to Torpedo Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Islamic
Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Hebron have promised that they
would not torpedo the Hebron accord between Israel and Palestine,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hamas leaders made the promise at a meeting with Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat during his
Sunday's visit to the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
They were quoted as telling Arafat that they would "express
their disappointment in a democratic manner."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Border Police and the Palestinian Security
Forces today began two additional joint patrols in Hebron,
bringing the number of joint patrols to four after the Israeli
army's redeployment in the city last week.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron agreement was reached by Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu last Wednesday, and the Israeli Army
completed the redeployment in the West Bank town early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The patrols are apparently operating on the Salaam Road, the
Abu Sneinah Hills and in the Khalid Asheh neighborhood, which
locate in between the two parts of Hebron respectively controlled
by the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli army's head of civilian
affairs in the West Bank David Shahal held a meeting today with
his Palestinian counterpart Zuheil Halaf, in an effort to work out
the final details regarding the transfer of civilian power to the
PNA in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians reportedly refused to assume control of 12
civilian affairs, claiming that Israel is holding up files and
sensitive materials of those items.
</P>
<P>
However, Israelis said that the transfer of the requested
items, including tax and other records, is in contravention of
the Hebron accord between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> UK Opposition Rules Out Increases in Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Brown, the Shadow
Chancellor, ruled out any changes to the current tax levels if his
party were to win the next election.
</P>
<P>
The Shadow Chancellor said: "What I want is for the tax rates
to be fair and I will leave the tax rates in the basic and top
rate unchanged."
</P>
<P>
He also said there would be no new spending commitments beyond
those covered by its planned windfall tax on the privatized
utilities.
</P>
<P>
Under the Conservative Government, the current top rate of
income tax is 40 percent, and the basic rate is 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
If Labor won the election, the priority was to ensure stable,
non-inflationary growth, the Shadow Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
Under a future Labor government, it would introduce a l0
percent initial income tax rate when resources were available,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
"The principals that should govern a tax system are that it
should encourage employment, it should encourage savings and
investment, and of course it should be fair," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Brown also said he would be tight on public spending. "I
can't allow public spending to get out of control and I will not
do so," the Shadow Chancellor stressed.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Pledge to Push Forward EU Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
European Union(EU) concluded today their first meeting of 1997,
with France and Germany pledging to remain the driving force
behind EU integration.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference, German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel and his French counterpart, Herve de Charette, said the two
countries were committed to being Europe's engine and stressed
their support to the Dutch EU presidency that began on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel repeated that the aim was to have the negotiations on
reviewing the Maastricht Treaty, the so-called Inter-Governmental
Conference(IGC), completed in June.
</P>
<P>
He also said that negotiations on EU's taking in a number of
new members from central and eastern Europe should start six months
thereafter as planned.
</P>
<P>
The French and German foreign ministers said the key element of
Franco-German cooperation would be to push for a flexibility
clause to be introduced into the EU Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to create a system to enable some countries to
extend their cooperation without being prevented form doing so by
the veto exercised by other member states. It is in part a
response to reluctant integrationists such as Britain.
</P>
<P>
While most EU members favor some form of flexibility, they are
divided over how to interpret it and no specific list of sectors,
where the flexibility clause should be applied, has been drawn up
yet at this stage of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the IGC topics, the ministers also addressed routine
issues ranging from establishing a common position for talks with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) and the
Europe-Asia(ASEAN) ministerial meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed United States' decision to further
suspend for six months the application of Title III of the
Helms-Burton Act, whilest repeating its firm opposition to any
extra-territorial legislation of the kind.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also discussed the situation in former
Yugoslavia, the Middle East, the Great Lakes region of Africa, and
Belarus.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sworn In for Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Bill Clinton claimed his
second term today, calling on the Americans to face the third
choice in the U.S history to shape the forces of the information
age and the global society.
</P>
<P>
Before his address to the massive throng in front of the
Capitol, the 50-year-old president raised his right hand and swore
the same 35-word oath taken by every president since George
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, Al Gore took the vice presidential oath. He
hopes to succeed Clinton, who became the first democrat in 60
years to celebrate two inaugurals.
</P>
<P>
In the wintry sun, Clinton said, "Now, for the third time a new
century is up on us, and another time to choose." He said the
American people "must choose to shape the forces of the
information age and the global society, to unleash the limitless
potential of all our people, and form a more perfect union" at the
dawn of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the tasks for the 21st century require the
American people to face the challenge of the past as "the
challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future."
</P>
<P>
He admitted one of the challenges of the past is racism, which
Clinton called "America's constant curse" and "the awful bloodshed
that stained its legacy."
</P>
<P>
He also addressed the issue of the divided government the
president will lead in the coming years, since Republican
majorities ruled there in 1994. The Capitol where he was standing
to deliver the inaugural speech in fact symbolizes the division.
</P>
<P>
Reconciliation thus became another theme in Clinton's speech.
And he called for an end of "the politics of petty bickering and
extreme partisanship" between the two parties by repairing
breaches.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to reform politics against the din of narrow
interests, which have been characteristic of two-party politics in
the United States and never been resolved.
</P>
<P>
As the new era approaches, Clinton said his administration will
pay great attention to education with American people accessible
to "knowledge and power of the information age," to a society
safer than the one which is constantly harassed with crimes.
</P>
<P>
He promised to balance the budget in a new fiscal year so as to
"fortify the world's most productive economy," the details of
which will be left later to address. Reports said Clinton will use
a Democratic national committee meeting Tuesday to issue a call
for tougher campaign finance rules. He also plans to ask
Republicans to work with him to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's speech mentioned almost nothing about his foreign
policies expect that his administration will "maintain a strong
defense against terror and destruction," and reduce "the threat of
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons."
</P>
<P>
The 42rd American president closed his speech by repeating his
campaign theme of a bridge to the 21th century: "Let us build our
bridge... to a blessed land of New Promise."

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Saudi Arabia Airlines (SAA) said at the weekend that
it would resume flights next month to Beirut with two flights a
week from Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, and two from its Red
Sea port city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
A group of pilots and security officials of the SAA arrived in
Beirut today for talks with Lebanon's Transportation Ministry
and officials of the Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national
carrier, on resumption of SAA's flights to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The SAA flights were halted 15 years ago because of the civil
war in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran is to award foreign companies two
multi-million-dollar oil field contracts that could provoke
U.S. sanctions, state-owned English daily Tehran Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) will
award contracts to develop its Soroush and Balal offshore oil
fields by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a NIOC official as saying "final proposals
of the interested companies have been received by the NIOC and
the winners will be announced by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Seyed Jalilian, NIOC's director of offshore division, said
that European, Asian and Iranian companies are being considered
for the work at the two fields.
</P>
<P>
However, the official did not specify how many foreign
companies are taking part in the bidding to carry out the
development work at the offshore fields.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that contracts to develop Soroush and Balal
could total some 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies would get a return for their investment
under the NIOC's so-called buy-back formula which gives payment in
the form of oil and gas produced at the field.
</P>
<P>
Soroush, which was heavily damaged during the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran
war, and the untapped Balal fields are set to produce some 130,000
barrels of oil a day at the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
To thwart U.S. sanctions, the Iranian oil industry has
announced a total of 11 oil and gas projects worth at least 7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that more than 120 foreign oil and gas companies
offered their bids for the Iranian oil and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Iraq have agreed on an across-the-board
price of 19.10 U.S. dollars per barrel for Iraqi oil to be
supplied to the kingdom in 1997, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed Saturday night by the two countries
in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, Iraq will meet Jordan's request
to raise its oil supplies in 1997 by 7 percent to reach 4.5
million tonnes of crude oil and oil derivatives (25 million
barrels of crude and 7 million barrels of derivatives).
</P>
<P>
During the Baghdad talks, Jordan and Iraq also signed a trade
protocol, under which Jordan will supply to Iraq goods and
services worth 255 million dollars in 1997 compared with 200
million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The agreement means that Jordan will receive Iraqi oil worth
625 million dollars in 1997. The free-of-charge supply will
account for 300 million dollars, leaving 325 million dollars to
be paid. This will be settled by the 255 million dollars trade
protocol and the rest 70 million dollars will be adjusted as
partial payment of Iraq's debts to Jordan, which is estimated by
officials here at 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jordan paid 15.25 dollars per barrel of Iraqi oil and
received 250 million dollars worth of free Iraqi oil supply in
1996.
</P>
<P>
In return, Jordan exported food and medicine to Iraq, but not
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Jordan reduced its trade volume with Iraq to 200 million
dollars in 1996 from 400 million dollars in 1995, saying that the
cutback was prompted when Iraq could no longer afford to pay the
foreign exchange needed for the Jordanian goods.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's oil imports from Iraq are carried out under a special
exemption to the United Nations economic sanctions imposed on
Baghdad after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The volume of Egypt's trade with African countries
accounts for only one percent of Egypt's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
An economic report, released by the Egyptian Trade
Representation Board today, said Egypt's trade with Africa
accounts for 300 million to 400 million Egyptian pounds (88
million to 118 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the lack of navigational lines with African
countries along with insufficient campaigns to promote Egyptian
products are behind the weak trade exchange between Egypt and
other African countries.

<HEADLINE> Mediators Await Bahrain Response to GCC's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Gulf mediators are waiting
for Bahrain's reply on a new suggestion by a four-way mediation
committee of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), according to
reports from reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
A deal on the improvement of relations between Bahrain and
Qatar was expected to be signed if Bahrain agrees to the
committee's recommendations, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was composed of foreign ministers from
Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, made the
new suggestion after it failed to persuade Bahrain and Qatar to
end a row on their border dispute earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Details of the suggestion, which calls for both sides to end
their war of words as a first step toward resolving their
dispute, was not yet available.
</P>
<P>
"The committee is waiting for Bahrain's answer to the
suggestion and if Bahrain agrees, we will advance to sign an
agreement between Bahrain and Qatar", said Saudi Arabian Minister
of Foreign Affairs Prince Saud al-Faisal Al-Saud, who heads the
committee, in a statement released in Manama, the capital of
Bahrain today.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi foreign minister and his three counterparts of the
committee respectively held talks with Qatar and Bahrain in a bid
to help the two countries end their dispute over the sovereignty
of the Hawar islands located in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Qatar told the committee that it was prepared to normalize its
ties with Bahrain provided Manama agreed to abide by a 1990 pact
committing the two sides to settling the dispute at the
international court.
</P>
<P>
However, Bahrain gave no promise of signing a Bahraini-Qatari
deal on the improvement of relations after it discussed the issue
with the committee.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain will completely support the committee's efforts to
help improve the Bahraini-Qatari relations, Bahrain's Foreign
Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Mubarak al-Khalifa said in a
statement released after his talks with the committee in Manama
today.
</P>
<P>
But the foreign minister said that Bahrain agreed with the
committee that more consultation and exchange of viewpoints
should be carried out by Bahrain and Qatar until the two sides
could sign an agreement.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee today voted unanimously to confirm Madeleine Albright to
be the first woman secretary of state in the U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The committee met briefly in the Capitol for the approval.
Twelve committee members cast their " yes" votes, and the other
six members are expected to add their approval later in the day.
This was the first vote on new members of Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Senator Jesse Helms, the panel's chairman who referred to her
as "secretary-to-be," said he intended to send the nomination to
the Senate floor Tuesday for a confirmation vote.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed as expected, Albright would be the highest ranking
woman ever in any U.S. government.

<TEXT>
<P>
The two men met at Ramadan Hotel which situated right at the
green line dividing Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint press conference held after the short
meeting, the two faction leaders agreed to implement the
Nairobi Peace Accord, signed by both sides in October last year
and sponsored by Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to wash away the green
line and appointed a six-member committee to further continue the
reached agreements over the pacification of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Even though Mogadishu people are optimistic about the outcome
of the meeting, there are still pessimistic figures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the faction leaders will not honor their
words. They believe that Hussein Aidid will not renounce from his
claim of being the "president of Somalia", while Ali Mahdi
Mohamed himself is not likely to join Hussein Aidid's "government".
</P>
<P>
This is the first meeting between the leaders of the two
factions in Mogadishu since early 1993, when then US Ambassador
Robert B. Oakley made the late General Aidid and Ali Mahdi to
meet in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Italy Signs Major Gas Supply Deal With Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy today signed a major
long-term gas deal worth some 22.5 trillion lire (14.3 billion
U.S. dollars) with Norway, making it Italy's fourth largest gas
supplier.
</P>
<P>
Norway is to supply some 6 billion cubic meters of methane a
year to Italy over a 25-year period from the year 2000, under a
contract signed by Snam, a subsidiary of the state fuel agency
ENI, and Norway's GFU Committee, made up of five oil and power
companies.
</P>
<P>
ENI, which supplies a quarter of the country's total demand for
gas and has a monopoly over domestic natural gas production, said
the deal would make Norway Italy's fourth largest gas supplier,
after the Netherlands, Russia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
New pipelines will have to be built to bring the gas from
Norway to the French and Dutch coasts and across the French-Swiss
border to link up with existing pipelines over the Alps.
</P>
<P>
Demand for natural gas is growing in Italy and the fuel is
expected to supply 33-34 percent of the country's total energy
needs by 2010, well above the European Union average of 24-25
percent, according to ENI.
</P>
<P>
Italy's total demand is forecast to be around 90 billion cubic
meters, of which Snam is expected to supply 80 billion, mainly
through imports.

<TEXT>
<P>
TBONG KHMUM, Cambodia, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen today urged officers and soldiers from the
rebel Khmer Rouge to join the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is worthless for you to go on fighting," Hun Sen said at a
ceremony to welcome 275 "underground" Khmer Rouge agents onto the
government side.
</P>
<P>
Even Ieng Sary, one of the main Khmer Rouge agents who defected
from the movement last August had joined the government, Hun Sen
said at the ceremony in Tbong Khmum District in Kompong Cham.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth ceremony in 40 days to welcome hundreds of
alleged underground Khmer Rouge agents who have defected to the
government side over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, a native of Kompong Cham province, appealed to all
levels of authorities, the Royal Armed Forces and the people to
work together to encourage the Khmer Rouge to "appear," change to
the government side and hand in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no winners or losers, no surrender. "It is
the obligation we all Khmers must follow for the benefit of peace,
security, stability and development of our entire nation."
</P>
<P>
The 275 "underground" Khmer Rouge at the ceremony were from the
three provinces of Kompong Cham, Kraitie and Prey Veng. They
handed in some 280 weapons.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for the whole country to go into
action to make society enjoy the real light of peace and
democracy," Hun Sen said in his hour-long speech.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by the U.N. representative to
Cambodia and a number of foreign diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Doctors Urged to Serve Village People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba today called on doctors in the country to suggest
effective ways to provide health services to all the villages.
</P>
<P>
Opening a national doctors' conference at Nepalgunj, about 300
kilometers west of here, Deuba said health is crucial to the
country's development and doctors should try to make their
profession more dignified, the official news agency RSS reported.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's target of providing health
services to every village of the country, Deuba said a larger
portion of the budgetary outlay has been earmarked for the health
and education sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the 18th All Nepal Doctors'
Conference, which was being attended by about 500 domestic
representatives and foreign observers, would come up with
suggestions helpful to the government.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Arjun Narsingh K. C. said on the occasion that
the recently enacted Health Service Act will benefit some 90
percent of the rural people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite problems like poverty, malnutrition, environmental
pollution and lack of adequate physical infrastructure, Nepal is
trying its best to meet the basic requirements in the health
sector, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He urged doctors and health workers to become village-oriented
to help implement the government's policy of providing health
services to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Nepal are generally reluctant to practice in
villages mainly due to rural poverty, shortage of medical
facilities and lack of incentive measures from the government.

<HEADLINE> Nestle 1996 Sales Reach Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Swiss food and confectionery
giant Nestle notched up record sales of 60.5 billion Swiss francs
(43.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, up 7.1 percent on 1995, the
company announced today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Nestle's history that the group's
sales in value terms have topped the 60 billion francs mark,
helped by exchange rates which gave a moderate boost of 1.4
percent to the sales figures, the company said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Net profit figures and the dividend proposal for 1996 will be
announced after the Nestle board meeting on March 26. The group,
which produces brands such as Nescafe coffee, made profits of 3.09
billion francs (2.5 billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sales volume, excluding acquisitions and divestments, grew 2.7
percent, with the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and Middle East all
registering strong volume growth.
</P>
<P>
Volume growth was also above average in Europe, thanks in
particular to rapid expansion in Central and Eastern Europe. In
the Americas, Latin America achieved above average growth, but
sales growth in the U.S. market were disappointing, partly due to
"transitional problems" in the beverage division.
</P>
<P>
Nestle expects sales volume to show continued growth in
1997. If the exchange rate of the Swiss franc against other
currencies continues to fall, the group says it should register
another increase in sales and profit this year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton takes the oath of office, asking for
racial unity and an end to partisanship as he and Congressional
leaders "move on with America's mission." As if fearful of
offending in a time of uncertain mandates, the President offered
few specifics in a careful, centrist address.
</P>
<P>
-- The Croatian Government has not shown intentions of honoring
the Dayton agreement by guaranteeing Serbs the right to remain in
Eastern Slavonia, a Serb-held enclave that is to be returned to
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- William Jefferson Clinton took the oath of office Monday in
the last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, urging
Americans to bury old racial and political divisions and declaring
that the nation stands "on the edge of a bright new prospect in
human affairs."
</P>
<P>
-- NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov met behind closed doors for five hours
today at the opening of a new, intensive round of negotiations
over NATO's plans for eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian leader Boris Yeltsin left the Kremlin hospital after
12 days of treatment for pneumonia and will recuperate at his
dacha for an indefinite period. An aide said the president intends
a gradual return to work. Yeltsin has been sidelined since a heart
attack during the last week of his re-election campaign in June.

<HEADLINE> China And Israel Cooperate on Cable Telephone Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Telecoms authorities in Tianjin
Municipality in north China are working together with an Israeli
enterprise, Elbit Ltd., on a cable-telephone system, which is
designed for telephone services using the existing cable
television network.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Israeli joint venture, the Tianjin and Haifa
Video-Telecom Company Ltd, has been set up in Tianjin for the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Elbit's Executive Vice-President Shlomo Haruvi told Xinhua in a
recent interview that if the experiment is successful the
technology can be used in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Elbit is a large private enterprise group in Israel, mainly
involved in developing electronics and telecommunications products
and technology, Haruvi explained, expressing the hope that his
company will cooperate further with China and bring more advanced
technology here.
</P>
<P>
According to Lorence Kole, the general manager of the joint
venture, the project is going well, although there are some
problems.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the cable-telephony system can save a huge
investment for China and it will also open up a new service and
income source for the television broadcasting sector," Mr. Kole
explained.
</P>
<P>
The system can provide the basic services of a telephone system
and link up with public telephone networks, but the service
charges are much lower than for the ordinary system, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, China has over 50 million
cable-tv subscribers nationwide, meaning a promising market for
this system.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Acquaint Mubarak With Hebron and Beyond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat will acquaint Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak with details
of the just-concluded Hebron agreement and other issues when he
arrives here Wednesday, a Palestinian envoy said.
</P>
<P>
This will be Arafat's first trip to Egypt since the Palestinian
Authority (PA) took control of most of the West Bank city of
Hebron last week in a landmark deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Mubarak, Arafat will also raise other
issues in the transitional phase and about the final status in the
upcoming negotiations with Israel, Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt
Zuhdi al-Qodra was quoted today by the Egyptian MENA news agency
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will extend his thanks to Mubarak and the Egyptian people
for their perennial and continuous support and advocacy for the
Palestinian's right.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause and the first
Arab country to make peace with Israel, has played a pivotal role
in the Palestinian-Israel negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement, the Israelis and Palestinians will
resume talks on a number of other issues immediately after the
Israeli redeployment in Hebron and start talks on a final peace
agreement within two months.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader's meeting with Mubarak comes within the
framework of the frequent coordination between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made a ten-minute stop here this morning enroute from
Gaza to Rome, where he would address a meeting of the Socialist
International and would later hold talks with Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

<HEADLINE> Workers Strike Worries Employers, Govt in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- An employers' federation
in Swaziland has warned that companies currently operating in the
kingdom may move to South Africa if the planned mass strike
goes ahead on February 3.
</P>
<P>
Musa Hlophe, director of the Federation of Swaziland
Employers, said in the Swazi capital Mbabane that he viewed
seriously the threat by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Union
(SFTU) to launch a nationwide strike early next month, said a
report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Hlophe said he believed the scheduled strike will go ahead
despite strong opposition from two large unions, the
Manufacturing and Allied Workers' Union and the Agricultural and
Plantations Workers' Union.
</P>
<P>
He also believed that only meaningful negotiations between the
government and the SFTU can avert the forthcoming strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an urgent meeting was planned later today between
the employers' federation and the SFTU to try to conduct talks
between the two and the government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier talks came to a standstill when SFTU leaders added
political demands to a list of labor demands, including lifting
a 23-year-old ban on political activities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the SFTU launched a series of strikes to press for
the government to speed up the democratic reform in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties have been banned by a royal decree in 1973.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Software Industry
Association (CSIA) and China World Trade Center will jointly stage
an International Software Fair and Symposium '97 from November 18
to 21 this year in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The fair's purpose is to provide a forum for the software
industry in China and other countries to discuss software
technology and to provide opportunities for domestic and overseas
software enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The CSIA has over 2,000 members and 21 branches and assists the
government in managing the software industry. It has relations
with counterparts in the United States, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Europe, and the countries of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
CSIA's president, Yang Tianxing, who is also with the Computer
Department of the Ministry of Electronics Industry, said today
that China's software technology market has become a part of the
international market. And it has already taken shape boosted by
the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The development of an information infrastructure has provided a
vast market for the country's software industry, he noted,
pointing out that it has gradually matured as large software
enterprises are built and policies and laws on intellectual
property rights take effect.
</P>
<P>
Ministry statistics show that total sales in China's software
market hit eight billion yuan in 1996, compared with 6.4 billion
in 1995.

years in the future.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Audience First to See Play on Yangtze River Boatmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- An acting troupe from southwest
China's Sichuan Province will bring the interior of a ship's cabin
to the Beijing stage as they dramatize the lives of the staff
onboard passenger boats shuttling across the Three Gorges of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"The Passing of the Three Gorges," presented by the Sichuan
People's Art Theater, has been billed as a special contribution to
the damming of the country's longest river this year. The play has
been well received by audiences -- especially boat workers -- in
Sichuan's capital city of Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges area tops the list of 40 favorite Chinese
scenic spots, and received additional promotion when China decided
to build the world's largest river dam for generating electric
power.
</P>
<P>
The troupe performed the one-act play for boat workers on 27
passenger boats, beginning in September 1996. It was the first
time the troupe has performed on boats.
</P>
<P>
The play's director, 30-year-old Lu Ang, described the drama as
an accurate portrayal of real life.
</P>
<P>
He said the dramatic conflicts lie in the beautiful dramatic
scenes contrasted with the dangerous water route, and also the
feelings experienced by boat workers' sending passengers back to
their families versus their long-time separations from their own
families.
</P>
<P>
Actress Xi Dan, director of the theater, said that 80 percent
of her staff suffered from influenza and diarrhea during their
27-day boat tour, but decided the shows had to go on.
</P>
<P>
Their devotion to their art has been applauded in many
ways: the crew of the Oriental Palace showed their gratitude by
offering their own cabin to the performers during the peak summer
season.

<HEADLINE> Official on Three Principles Guiding Sino-Portuguese Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official based here
said that the friendly cooperation between China and Portugal on
the question of Macao should be based on three principles.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said on Monday that such cooperation should be based on the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, conducted in accordance with
the Basic Law of Macao and be conducive to Macao's economic
growth, social stability and a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with representatives of two local grassroots
organizations, Wang said it is the aspiration of the Chinese side
to resolve the transitional issues of Macao on the basis of good
cooperation between the two sides, which is both in the interest
of long-term friendly relations between China and Portugal and in
the overall interest of Macao residents.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side attaches great importance to the friendship
between China and Portugal," he said. "The friendly cooperation
should be based on the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao and,
be in accordance with the principles of the Basic Law of Macao and
helpful to the economic growth and social stability of Macao as
well as the smooth transition of Macao."
</P>
<P>
Wang pledged support for the Macao Government in boosting the
local economy in 1997, adding that it is the duty of the Macao
Government to take concrete and effective measures to help pull
the economy out of the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
"For the general interest of Macao residents, Macao should be
more open, have a better investment environment and a more
efficient economic operation," he said.

In east China's Zhenjiang City, where medical reforms were

Hospitals in the city have reduced the use of imported

dollars, or 27.2 percent of total sales in the domestic medicine
market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are now about 800 different imported
medicines. National medicine expositions, held in the cities of
Hangzhou and Shenyang last June and August, showed that supplies
of imported medicine surpass demand, and that some of them can not
be sold and the price of almost all imported medicines has
dropped, Lin said.

<HEADLINE> China's Medicine Imports To Go Down This Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Imported medicines will see
slow growth this year in China in spite of big increases over the
past few years, according to Lin Jianning of the State
Pharmaceutical Administration's South Pharmaceutical Economy
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The sector will also see structural adjustment and a drop in
prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, increased sales of imported and
joint-funded medicines accounted for two-thirds of the increase in
the medicine market.
</P>
<P>
Imported medicines have a large share of the market in big
cities, and according to a survey of 180 hospitals in Beijing,
Tianjin, Guangzhou, and six other major cities, imported medicines
account for half of the 50 most popular medicines.
</P>
<P>
The need for imported medicines is declining, because of
medical reforms in urban areas and the rapid growth of the
domestic pharmaceutical industry, he explained. With new medical
insurance for urban workers, which began in some cities in 1994,
requiring people to cover part of their medical expenses, people
began to turn their backs on imported medicines, which are much
more expensive than domestic products.

<HEADLINE> China Funds See Outstanding Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China equity funds ranked
second on the top performance table of 1996 with an annual return
of 50.55 percent, according to a survey released today by the Hong
 Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for China funds to get into the top
three.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters, China funds had consistently
stayed outside the ranks of top fifteen. This had substantially
improved in the fourth quarter as it moved from the tenth place
in October to the fourth in November, and further to the second
in December.
</P>
<P>
Explaining reasons behind the strong performance, Chairman of
the HKIFA Andrew Lo said: "A reason would possibly be that in 1996
China had cut lending and savings rates twice, and the market
expects interest rates would be further reduced in the first
quarter of this year."
</P>
<P>
"This may have been made possible by China's success in
achieving economic soft-landing. In 1996, China's GDP registered a
steady growth of about 9.7 percent while retail price inflation
was at a four-year low of six percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong equity funds continued for the sixth consecutive
month to stay in the top three, posting an annual return of 41.92
percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lo attributed the strong performance of Hong Kong equity funds
to the surge in the local stock market and the strength of the
local property market.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG Discusses Transitional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Chinese official of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) today urged the
Portuguese side to step up efforts in handling the three leading
issues concerning the transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an, counselor of the Chinese side of the JLG, told
reporters after a four-hour closed-door meeting with his
Portuguese counterpart in the JLG that further efforts are needed
to resolve the issues of the localization of the civil service,
localization of law and the use of Chinese as an official language
for a smooth transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted that the Portuguese side has said that the
localization of the civil service would proceed to a new height in
1997" said Wang. "We hope that they would move their focus of the
localization to the middle and senior ranks of the civil service
in the new year."
</P>
<P>
Wang urged the Portuguese side to promote the use of Chinese to
a further degree, noting that some efforts have been made last
year.
</P>
<P>
Some departments of the government, on issues concerning the
everyday life of residents, still use forms that are printed only
in Portuguese, he said. "That should be changed as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
On the localization of law, he said that the two sides should
enhance legal consultations so that the current laws in Macao
would pass through 1999 in a smooth way.
</P>
<P>
The counselor said that the Portuguese side did a lot of work
both in the translation of law from Portuguese into Chinese, and
in law revising and compiling last year.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Mendes, Wang's counterpart, said that the Portuguese side
has made efforts in the localization of civil service and in the
translation of law.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our cooperation with the Chinese side and
make further efforts to promote the process (of the transitional
issues)," he said.

TOKYO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The liabilities of Japanese
corporate bankruptcies in 1996 amounted to 7.99 trillion yen
(72.64 billion U.S. dollars), the second highest in the postwar
period, a private research agency "Teikoku Databank" said today.

<P>
The figure is 11.5 percent lower than the record of 9.03
trillion yen (82.09 billion dollars) in 1995, the agency said.
</P>

URUMQI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The three prefectures of
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which suffered
from recent snowstorms, have been hit by new ones.
</P>
<P>
No new casualties have been reported, but the new snowfall has
halted rescue work, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow, accompanied by strong winds, started on Sunday and
is now from 60 to 70 centimeters deep in some places, temperatures
dropping to minus 30 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Traffic and telecommunications were disrupted for a second time
in Altay, Ili, and Bortala prefectures.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and local people have been busy removing snow from
roads and reconnecting telecommunications so that grain and forage
can be moved to the disaster areas as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The first snowstorms began on December 27 and resulted in 34
deaths, 18 serious injuries, and left four missing, according to
an earlier report. They also affected 320,000 local people, mostly
farmers and herdsmen in these prefectures.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here today
Sino-Japanese relations should be given greater care, and that the
responsibilities for difficulties in relations that occurred last
year did not rest with the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the overall interests of bilateral relations,
the Chinese government "has shown great restraint", even while
adhering to principles, Li said during his meeting with a Japanese
delegation in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining and developing friendly Sino-Japanese relations and
cooperation conform to the fundamental interests of the two
peoples, he noted, and that bilateral relations can follow a
"normal and healthy track" as long as the two sides abide by the
principles that govern such relations.
</P>
<P>
Yoshio Sakuauchi, president of the Japanese Association for the
Promotion of International Trade, and head of the delegation, said
that the meeting between President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto at the APEC summit last year resulted in
improved bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that members of his association will continue to make
an effort to help develop political and economic relations between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Population Ages Faster Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's society is aging faster
than projected five years ago and will reach a significant
"turning point" this year with people aged 65 and older
outnumbering those under 14, the Health and Welfare Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
The nation's population, partly due to a decline in births,
will start to shrink in 2007, four years earlier than forecast in
1992, after reaching a peak of 127.78 million, the Kyodo news
service quoted the ministry-affiliated National Institute of
Population and Social Security Research as saying in a latest
projection.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, Japan will have 25 million fewer people than in 1995
when the total stood at 125.57 million. By that time, one in
three, or 32.3 percent of the population, will be 65 and older,
making Japan a "super" aged society.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, life expectancy of the Japanese, already the highest
in the world, will increase by some three years to 79.43 for men
and 86.47 years for women by the year 2050, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Vanuatu Prime Minister Touring Beijing Market, Computer Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Vanuatu's Prime Minister
Rialuth Serge Vohor had a glimpse of daily life in Beijing when he
toured a market and got lessons on a computer.
</P>
<P>
Beitaipingzhuang Market was set up in 1979 as one of the first
markets to emerge with China's reform and opening up of the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
Vohor and his party visited the three-storey market, which
covers 5,000 sq.m., this morning to have a look at the more than
700 stalls and the customers going about their daily shopping.
</P>
<P>
Gu Guohua, director of the market, showed the Prime Minister
around the various agricultural and industrial products, ranging
from vegetables, aquatics, and cereal grains to general
merchandise, clothing, tools, and other items.
</P>
<P>
Vohor took a particularly interest in some small lanterns and
decorative items that Chinese traditionally use during Spring
Festival, which is only a fortnight away.
</P>
<P>
Gu noted that the market had a business volume of some 400
million yuan and a total of seven million customers last year.
</P>
<P>
"Many foreign leaders have visited the market because it is a
window on China's reform and opening up process," Gu told his
guest, "and your visit has given us more credit."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's second stop was the Legend Computer Group
in the Beijing Experimental Zone for the Development of New
Technology Industries. It was the first national high and new
technology industrial development zone approved by the State
Council in May, 1988.
</P>
<P>
While showing the Prime Minister a computer assembly line, Ying
Qi, manager of the assembly department, briefed Vohor on the
group's history and gave details of the assembly procedures.
</P>
<P>
Legend, which was founded in 1984 by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, is now the country's largest computer producer and
exporter. It it also one of the five largest computer accessory
suppliers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Vohor paused in front of some personal computers with an
animated cartoon, and Ying explained that Legend PCs are the most
popular in China. In 1996, the group produced a total of 206,000
PCs and had a 10-percent share of the domestic market, in spite
of sharp competition from foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister and his entourage are scheduled to leave for
Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu, this afternoon.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian government cars will
start using natural gas as fuel this year in a bid to promote the
"blue sky" program, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said here it is
an important move to make government officials set an example in
an effort to curb Jakarta's air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"It is useless to convince people to use natural gas for their
cars if government officials do not set an example. My official
car will certainly use gas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta already has 30 natural gas stations.
</P>
<P>
The provincial administrations of West and Central Java also
plan to build natural gas stations in a bid to encourage its use.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas, an alternative vehicle fuel to petrol, is
described by experts as a clean fuel.
</P>
<P>
The government has also called on car manufacturers to produce
natural gas-fueled vehicles in the future, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The number of motor vehicles in Indonesia is increasing by 12
percent per year. In 1995 the total number of registered motor
vehicles in the country stood at 12,833,536, of which 25 percent
were operating in Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Acts to Protect Sugar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government acted
today to protect the local sugar industry by proposing a
33-percent increase in tariff rates on imported sugar effective
January 1 to June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here tonight, the presidential palace
said that the Presidential Task Force on Sugar invoked the special
safeguard provision (SSP), or Article 5 of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) agreement, as a basis for the recommendation to
the Congressional Tariff Commission.
</P>
<P>
The presidential palace quoted Agriculture Secretary Salvador
Escudero as saying the move is aimed at ensuring the viability of
the local sugar industry, which has encountered financial woes due
to the flooding of cheap imported sugar in the local market.
</P>
<P>
The task force invoked the SSP in the WTO agreement as an
internal and temporary measure to save the local industry,
Escudero said.
</P>
<P>
Under the article, he said, a country can invoke the SSP if
there is an over-importation of any commodity.
</P>
<P>
According to Escudero, the government proposed that the tariff
rates on sugar be increased by 33 percent or from 100 percent to
133 percent during the six-month period.
</P>
<P>
"With the increase in tariff, we are expecting that sugar
importation will no longer be lucrative business, which will be
for the good of our local sugar industry," Escudero said.
</P>
<P>
At present, imported sugar in the Philippines is cheaper than
the locally-produced.
</P>
<P>
Once the task force recommendation is approved by the
congressional committee, the government will formally notify the
WTO, the presidential palace said.

Itar-Tass news agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tass said Kamsky, 22, wanted to pick up his education
interrupted by the training and maybe become a doctor.
</P>
<P>
"It has been clear for some time that Anatoly Karpov and Garry
Kasparov will do all they can not to allow any of the possible
pretenders to sit on the world chess throne," he told Tass in an
interview from New York.
</P>
<P>
Kamsky, now a United States citizen, lost to Karpov in last
July's challenge for the FIDE world championship in Elista, Russia.

He emigrated to the United States at the age of 15 and one
years later won the American national championship.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Japan To Treasure Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here today
Sino-Japanese relations should be given greater care, and that the
responsibilities for difficulties in relations that occurred last
year did not rest with the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from the overall interests of bilateral relations,
the Chinese government "has shown great restraint", even while
adhering to principles, Li said during his meeting with a Japanese
delegation in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining and developing friendly Sino-Japanese relations and
cooperation conform to the fundamental interests of the two
peoples, he noted, and that bilateral relations can follow a
"normal and healthy track" as long as the two sides abide by the
principles that govern such relations.
</P>
<P>
Yoshio Sakuauchi, president of the Japanese Association for the
Promotion of International Trade, and head of the delegation, said
that the meeting between President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto at the APEC summit last year resulted in
improved bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that members of his association will continue to make
an effort to help develop political and economic relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that the association can contribute more
to developing the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship and bilateral
economic and trade ties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Breaks Through 118 Yen Barrier in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar broke the 118 yen
level in Tokyo today for the first time since March 1993, yo-yoing
in response to comments by Japanese and U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended the day at 118.19-23 yen, after moving between
117.55 yen and 118.28 yen during the day.
</P>
<P>
In early morning trading, the dollar rallied to the intraday
high of 118.28 yen, the highest since March 1993, inheriting the
strong undertone seen in overnight trading in London and New York.
</P>
<P>
But the strength soon evaporated and the dollar slipped to the
intraday low of 117.55 yen, following a news report that Finance
Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka had issued a warning against what he
viewed as the yen's "excessive" fall against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The downswing was later reversed by a U.S. federal banking
official's comment in support of a strong dollar and Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's remarks indirectly expressing
tolerance for the current yen-dollar exchange level.
</P>
<P>
Economists said overseas investors are selling yen, which they
consider less attractive following the steep fall in stock prices
in Japan over the last few weeks. Japan's low interest rates are
also behind the currency selling, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks closed slightly lower today for the
third straight trading day as falling futures prices discouraged
investors and touched off heavy arbitrage-linked selling.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
17,358.16, down 122.18 points or 0.7 percent, from Monday's
close.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) --The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) expects members who also belong to
the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) to choose
between the two, South African Press Association (SAPA )reported
today.
</P>
<P>
SADC Information Officer Kgosinkwe Moesi was quoted as saying:
" There is no way both organizations can endeavour to establish
a common market in southern Africa. That is unworkable."
</P>
<P>
SADC members Mozambique and Lesotho have recently withdrawn from
COMESA.
</P>
<P>
COMESA was formed in 1993 in Uganda to promote trade and
economic integration in the sub-region. It groups 23 states.
</P>
<P>
SADC was established in 1992 with most of its member states also
belonging to COMESA. The two regional groupings have been at
loggerheads over alleged duplication of services.
</P>
<P>
Moesi said that SADC members were told to decide which group they
really belonged to. Of SADC's 12 members, only Botswana, South
Africa (and now Mozambique and Lesotho) are not members of
COMESA.
</P>
<P>
The other SADC members are Angola, Malawi, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Mauritius and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
" We are hopefully going to have a COMESA which comprises
non-SADC countries," sai Moesi.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economic Prospects Called Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic
prospect for 1997 remains more than encouraging with economic
growth expected to be sustained at around 8-8.3 percent, according
to an economic review released today.
</P>
<P>
However, issues related to competitiveness, structural
weaknesses and disequilibrium in the external sector must be
continuously addressed, the Public Bank Economic Review said.
</P>
<P>
The pace for such growth in 1997 was set by the improved
fundamentals last year when the economic growth rate was 8.2
percent and the present favorable external environment, the bank
said in the November-December issue of its Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing, services and construction sectors are
expected to remain strong while inflation is to be subdued and the
external sector to record further improvement in the year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
It said a key factor that would ensure sustainability of
Malaysia's high growth rate in the long term is the ability to
maintain its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"This issue is even more important at this stage with the
increased globalization and trade liberalization in the world
economy," it added in the article "Outlook for the Malaysian
Economy in 1997."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that two issues affecting competitiveness are
likely to remain important in the next few years -- wage increases
outpacing productivity and the ability to innovate.
</P>
<P>
On structural weaknesses, it said the economy is too dependent
on a few industries in the manufacturing sector, where electronics
and textile are predominant. Hence, Malaysia's export base is
narrow and subject to a cyclical pattern.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, industry is also still generally overdependent on
imported materials and technology, causing a substantial leakage
in the balance of payments, it added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Malaysia continues to rely heavily on foreign
investment that come with a high cost in terms of profit
repatriation and lack of domestic linkages.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the level of research and development activities
remains low in the country and, as a result, the manufacturing
sector continues to export low value-added products, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
On the external sector, it said that although the country's
current account deficit is under control, efforts to improve it
through increases in exports and sustained inflows of long-term
capital must be continued.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Set Up Command Centers Against Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The "alert command center" that
will be set up in each military district command of Indonesia is
to shoulder the task of preventing riots in the region, head of
the Supreme Advisory Council Soedomo said here today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with President Soeharto, he said the center shall
observe issues that easily incite social unrest and report them to
the authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The center, which will be the first of its kind, should be
ready to receive all kinds of reports from the people," Soedomo
said.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the center was first announced by President
Soeharto last Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said such a center is necessary to prevent further riots
which have been occurring in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
On the number of riots that occurred since 1995, Soedomo said,
"They were triggered by the widening social gap in the society."
</P>
<P>
The unrest, he added, was incited by some dissident and
subversive groups which want to discredit and undermine the
government and make people believe that the government can no
longer be trusted or relied upon.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, with a population of 195 million, has seen three
major outbursts of ethnic and religious conflict in the last three
months. The first occurred in Situbondo, East Java, last October,
claiming five lives. The second hit Tasikmalaya, West Java, on
December 26, leaving four dead and hardly a week later, riots
rocked Sanggau Ledo in West Kalimantan, killing five.
</P>
<P>
However, Soedomo said the riots have been "sporadic" and would
not affect the country's stability.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President On Relations with Vanuatu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China has always placed
importance on its relations with Vanuatu and wants to move the
"friendly, mutually-beneficial, and cooperative" relations to the
new height.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin made this remark during his meeting with
Vanuatu Prime Minister Rialuth Serge Vohor in the Great Hall of
the People here today after giving him a warm welcome on his first
visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang values Vohor's efforts in Vanuatu-Chinese
relations, adding that the prime minister has also made a positive
contribution to the friendship and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Vanuatu are in the Asia-Pacific region and have
much in common and have suffered similarly in the past, and are
now facing the same task of developing the economy and raising the
standard of living, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Vanuatu friendship is sincere," Jiang noted, and that
Vanuatu's attaching importance to bilateral relations has provided
good conditions for developing friendly and cooperative relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vohor said he was honored to visit China and to have a chance
to meet President Jiang. Vanuatu-Chinese relations have developed
well since the two countries forged diplomatic links 15 years ago,
the Prime Minister said, pointing to the increasing of the
mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese aid to Vanuatu and other developing
countries has been effective in helping Vanuatu's social progress,
particularly Vanuatu's public health and agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that a trade agreement signed during
this visit "is of great significance", to Vanuatu, where 80
percent of whose population live in rural areas, and that in
future Vanuatu will continue to cooperate with China in
international affairs, to offer mutual moral support, and uphold
the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government has always placed importance
on developing its relations with South Pacific nations, and on
supporting their efforts to safeguard state sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and to develop regional economy while
reinforcing regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China also supports the reasonable demands of the South Pacific
countries for establishing a South Pacific nuclear-free zone, he
noted, and for protecting the region's fishing resources and
maintaining an ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes that Sino-South Pacific relations will
enter a new phase of development on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence on the verge of the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> RUF Delays Peace Process of S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 21 (xinhua)-- The full implementation of the
Abidjan peace accord is being delayed in Sierra Leone because of
the failure of the Revolutionarg United Front (RUF) to appoint
representatives to the joint commission to oversee demobilization
of the combatants, diplomats said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
And in another hitch to the peace schedule, the United Nations
Security Council Monday postponed discussions of a neutral
monitoring force for the west African state because of the ''lack
of data '' with barely a month to go to the deadline for total
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord signed between S. leonean President
Tejan Kabbah and the RUF leader Foday Sankoh last November, the
seven member Demobilization and Resettlement Committee should
have been in place by December 29 last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the RUF has failed to nominate its representatives to
this body designed to encamp, disarm and resettle their fighters.
</P>
<P>
Government officials here confirmed that the four RUF delegates
to the peace commission ''meet regularly behind closed
doors'' with government representatives in an amicable
atmosphere, but the RUF has given ''various excuses for failing
to make the deadline. ''
</P>
<P>
One government official said, ''They either complain about
dificulty of contacting their commanders or give some other
excuses."
</P>
<P>
Observers here blamed the U.N.decision to postpone the
creation of a neutral monitoring group on the current delay.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the peace deal, foreign troops will only be
withdrawn three months after the neutral monitoring group's
deployment.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports have linked the RUF's delay to ''some
resistance from hardline RUF commanders over the peace deal.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 8,000 displaced persons in Kenema in
eastern Sierra Leone are stranded ''with virtually no food''
after a government ultimatum that they must return to their
respective areas before receiving food supplies.

PARIS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Colin McRae
of Scotland crashed out of the Monte Carlo rally in Monaco on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
McRae and co-driver Nicky Grist got their Subaru back onto the
road and finished an icy first special stage of Tuesday's third
leg but the car was too badly damaged to continue.
</P>
<P>
He had lost 24 minutes but tried vainly to drive the extra 25km
to the pits before abandoning after 4km.
</P>
<P>
First day leader Freddy Loix of Belgium lost 8 minutes when he
crashed his Toyota Celica but he was able to continue.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Piero Liatti was the fastest in the opening special,
timing 17 minutes 18 seconds for the 23km, 13 seconds ahead of
Finland's reigning world champion Finlandais Tommi Makinen in a
Mitsubishi Lancer.
</P>
<P>
Makinen's 18-second advantage over Spain's Carlos Sainz allowed

<HEADLINE> Customs Department Shakes up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Revenue Authority
(KRA) has made a major shake-up affecting 78 middle and senior
level management staff in the Customs and Excise Department
(CED), the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted KRA Chief Human Resources Manager D.O. Otondo
as saying that most of the involved staff have either been
transferred or promoted while others have been asked to retire.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up which will take effect from February 1 will
affect officers in the KRA headquarters, customs and excise
departments in Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Eldoret and some border
areas.
</P>
<P>
The changes came in the wake of allegations of massive
corruption in some government departments, especially in the CED,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is said to be losing billions of
Shillings because importers evaded taxes in league with customs
officials.
</P>
<P>
However, KRA Secretary General Yusuf Nzibo said the changes
are normal transfers and promotions geared towards improving KRA
operations.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Given High Credit Rating by International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's high marks given by
international credit agencies would elevate its economic status
and boost foreign investment, the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
International rating agency Standard Poor's announced last week
it has given Egypt BBB minus long-term and A3 short-term foreign
currency credit ratings, both at the minimum regarded as
investment grades.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are optimistic that the rating will help raise Egypt's
economic indicators, such as employment and investment.
</P>
<P>
It is good news for the economy, said Mohammed al-Ahmadi of
Cairo-based fund managers' Concord International Investments.
</P>
<P>
Following the rating, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
that Egypt should prepare itself for a 1.5 billion to 2 billion
U.S. dollars rise in annual inflows in the coming period.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the rating would also reinforce the benefits of
Egypt's imminent listing on the International Financial
Corporation composite investable index (IFCINDEX). It would also
ease import and borrowing costs, they added.
</P>
<P>
Stung by a speculative grade rating assigned by Moody's
Investors Service last October, the Egyptian government had worked
hard at invigorating its privatization reform program.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's reforms drew 2 billion dollars in direct foreign
investment last year as well as portfolio investment of about 600 to
700 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Hutchison Telecom Jumps Into Local Telephone Market in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hutchison Telecom announced
today that it would launch local fixed network services as an
important move to sharpen its competitive edges on the cut-throat
telecommunications market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The network, the first in the world to adopt the use of 2.5
Gbit/s Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) transmission network,
is able to provide two ways of access at the same time -- one of
American standard and the other of European Standard, according to
Dennis Lui, Managing Director of Hutchison Telecom.
</P>
<P>
With two systems combined, the network is claimed to be cost
saving and flexible to meet the demand of customers. As the third
local fixed telecommunications network in Hong Kong, Hutchison's
network has started to provide services for some 300 commercial
customers in highly dense areas. Lui expected the total number of
subscribers to reach 20,000 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The managing director said the launch of the local fixed
network marks a significant development for Hutchison Telecom,
which has already secured a strong foothold on paging, IDD and
mobile phone market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Currently, one out of every six Hong Kong people enjoys the
services offered by Hutchison Telecom, said Alex Ko, director of
Customer Services, who predicted that ratio will be one out of
five by the end of this year. Hutchison Telecom now has 300,000
subscribers to its international telephone services and some
400,000 pager users.
</P>
<P>
In the competition of local fixed network, Hutchison Telecom is
still in a weak position since the giant Hong Kong Telecom boasts
some three million subscribers to residential or commercial
telephone services.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- President Humphrey Mulenba of
Zambia's opposition National Party (NKP) has stepped down amid
serious in-fighting, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
This has brought to an end one of Zambia's most illustrious
and influential political careers and may make or break a
promising opposition party trammeled by incessant internal feuds
since its formation in 1993, the local newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Mulenma confirmed in Lusaka that he wanted to go into private
life and concentrate on personal affairs.
</P>
<P>
''I have offered to leave immediately but some members
convinced me that i should stay on until the convention when i
should hand over to a new leadership,'' he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was one of five presidential candidates in the elections
held last November and his party holds five parliament seats in
158 ones.
</P>
<P>
Mulumba had served in various portfolios both in the
government of former president Kenneth Kaunda and current
president Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Recently there have been numerous calls from some party
members for Mulenba to step down for alleged failure to run the
party well. His opponents also called for the convention to be
held in March instead of planned June.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Firm on Inflation: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
keep the lid firmly on inflation this year with a proposed
further reduction of inflationary rate to no more than 15
percent, said Finance Minister Anthony Ani.
</P>
<P>
Giving an account of details of the 1997 budget on Monday, Ani
said the macro-economic policies introduced in 1996 had positive
impact in curbing inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said the 4.5 percent decline in inflation rate was recorded
in 1996 which was down to 28 percent from 72.8 percent in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Despite this performance, the government will continue to
strive to bring down the level of prices in the country," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that producers and sellers of goods and
services in the country review their pricing policies as part of
our effort to fight inflation," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Ani assured that the proper implementation of the policies and
programs of this year's budget will go a long way in
strengthening the structure of the economy and raising the level
of production.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) went
up 3.25 percent in 1996 with improved production in vital
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and agricultural sectors grew by 0.7 and
3.79 percent respectively, compared with 5.5 and 3.4 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The mining sub-sector scored an increase of 3.4 percent from
1995's 2.6 percent, while capacity utilization rose almost 11
percent to 32.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said that despite some of the job creation
measures, unemployment still remained a problem. But he did not give
figure to illustrate the issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that the policies and projects that will be
introduced this year will generate new jobs," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's aerospace
industry, which is still in its infancy, is expected to become a
significant sector of the country's economy in terms of generating
income and foreign exchange by the year 2000, according to a
Public Bank Corporation publication today.
</P>
<P>
It would also be a significant sector in terms of producing
advanced technologies to enhance industrial capabilities in the
country, the corporation said in the November-December 1996 issue
of its Economic Review released here today.
</P>
<P>
The publication cited the government's support and Malaysia's
good location in the Asia-Pacific region as the catalyst for the
industry's prospects, saying Malaysia is well positioned to
provide overhaul and maintenance to the fast expanding aerospace
industries in major countries such as China, India and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also has the capability to supply light aircraft and
parts to the regional and world markets through collaborative
efforts with established international suppliers, it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the emphasis on further development of human
resources to meet the requirement of the industry as outlined in
the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) and the Second Industrial
Master Plan (1996-2005) augurs well for the long-term prospects of
the industry.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Police seized
about 400 kilograms of various narcotic drugs in swoops on
processing laboratories and storage places in and around Kuala
Lumpur in the past two weeks, the Department of Narcotics
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, with a street value of nearly 31 million ringgit
(about 12.4 million U.S. dollars), comprised heroin, caffeine and
hemp, department director Salleh Mat Som said at a news conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were smuggled in from Thailand through Kelantan, a
northern state bordering Thailand, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse has become a serious problem in the city with more
people involved and more drugs trafficked.
</P>
<P>
A total of 305 drug pedlars were detained in the capital city
in 1996 as against 184 people in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Police busted 28 drug syndicates in the city and prosecuted

<P>
PARIS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac announced Monday the

the country's judicial institution more efficient, more
transparent and closer to the need of the people.
</P>

-- Franklin D. Roosevelt promised the Americans the New Deal,
John F. Kennedy promised the New Frontier, and Bill Clinton

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Fashion Week Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The rapid development of Hong
Kong Fashion Week, branded as the largest of its kind in Asia,
echoes the emergence of Hong Kong's garment industry into the
mainstream of international fashion, the chairman of the Hong Kong
 Trade Development Council (TDC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the fair, Dr. Victor Fung
said that this is evident by the fact that the size and scope of
Hong Kong Fashion Week -- Fall/Winter Collections '97 have been
increased further from previous years, with 840 exhibitors coming
from at least 26 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The TDC-organized event, which runs until Friday at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, is also expected to attract
30,000 buyers from around the world to source the latest in
fashion.
</P>
<P>
"Since its origins in the 1960's, this event has undergone
tremendous development -- like Hong Kong itself. It has graduated
from a straightforward shop window of local manufacturing skills
into a fully-fledged fashion event of international standing,"
Fung said.
</P>
<P>
The growing international status of Hong Kong Fashion Week is
this year evident by the introduction of ExpoFil Yarn Forum, a
show on the latest in yarns and fabrics organized by the
Paris-based French Association for the Promotion of Textile Yarns.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Asia-Pacific Young Designers' Show features
innovative collections from 15 aspiring young designers from 13 of
the Asia-Pacific region's fastest growing economies.
</P>
<P>
The Europe Selection Pavilion, which comes back for the third
time with a much bigger presence, is another show of support by
the international fashion industry to the Week.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Fashion Week is today Asia's leading fashion
occasion, which reinforces the territory's role as the region's
foremost trading center for apparel. No event in this part of the
world offers a comparably efficient and effective platform for
buying or selling fashion and fashion accessories," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
For buyers in the region it is established as a date that
cannot be missed, he added.
</P>
<P>
On top of Hong Kong's role as the region's foremost trading
center for apparel, Hong Kong Fashion Week is as well as a
significant showcase for local and world renowned designers.
</P>
<P>
This year, 11 catwalk fashion shows, including seven
TDC-organized ones, will be on parade, while three fashion
industry seminars will be staged.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Fashion Week is now held twice a year for
Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter collections.
</P>
<P>
The clothing industry prevails to be one of the major export
earners of Hong Kong. In 1995, Hong Kong exported 164.7 billion
HK dollars (some 21 billion US dollars) worth of clothing and
accessories to worldwide markets, and in the first 10 months of
1996, the total was 141.6 billion HK dollars (18 billion US
dollars), up 3 percent over the same period of 1995.

<P>

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Continue Strengthening of Sino-Guatemalan Cooperation at UN: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang stated that China hopes to see the
continued strengthening of the cooperation at the United Nations
between China and Guatemala, here this afternoon at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that China always supports the peace process in
Guatemala and welcomes the peace accord signed between the two
parties in that country.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that on January 10 when the UN Security
Council was holding a deliberation on the question of Guatemala,
due to reasons known to all, the Chinese side had no alternative
but cast a vote against the draft resolution on sending military
observers to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
However, Shen noted, "we have always stood for a proper
settlement of this question through consultations and supported
the peace process in Guatemala carried forward under the UN
supervision and auspices, in the sincere hope that peace and
stability will be achieved in Guatemala from now on".
</P>
<P>
In the past nearly 10 days, the Chinese and Guatemalan sides
held many rounds of earnest and fruitful consultations and the
Guatemalan government indicated their realization of the gravity
and sensibility of the issue of Taiwan and its willingness to take
a positive approach, the Spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that it has therefore pledged to respect the provisions
of Resolution 2758 of the General Assembly and to use it as a
guidance for its relevant activities at the United Nations, adding
that thanks to their joint efforts, the Chinese and Guatemalan
sides finally arrived at a solution acceptable to both.
</P>
<P>
In view of the foregoing, Shen continued, on January 20, the
Chinese side voted in favor of the draft resolution on the
Security Council's authorizing the dispatch of military observers
to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to see the success of the peace process in Guatemala
and the continued strengthening of the cooperation at the United
Nations between China and Guatemala", Shen pointed out.

<HEADLINE> FM Spkesman on HK Judicial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- It is groundless to question
the independent nature of the judicial system of the future Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang stated at a regular press
conference in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Some correspondents asked: recently, when a US district court
was trying a case involving the extradition to Hong Kong of a Hong
Kong resident named Jerry Lui Hin-kong, the independent nature of
the judicial system of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region was called in question by some people, How would you
comment on this?
</P>
<P>
Shen ansered: The Chinese government will resume the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and establish the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region on July 1, 1997. The Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law of the HKSAR stipulate that the laws
currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged;
the laws previously enforced in Hong Kong, that is, the common
law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and
customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene
the Basic Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of
the HKSAR. The HKSAR shall be vested with independent judicial
power, including that of final adjudication, and the courts of the
HKSAR shall independently adjudicate cases in accordance with the
laws applicable in the region, free from any interference.
</P>
<P>
He continued: the agreement between Hong Kong and the United
States on the surrender of fugitive offenders which had been
approved through discussions by the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group and was recently signed shall remain valid after July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said: in view of the foregoing, it is groundless to question
the independent nature of the judicial system of the future Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Pushes for Larger Quota for Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAMGKOK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is requesting the
European Union to grant larger, low-tariff quotas to Thai farm
products as compensation for the EU's cut in tariff benefits under
the Generalized System of Preference (GSP).
</P>
<P>
Thailand is also lobbying the EU to put it back on the list of
countries eligible for GSP benefits in reward for its cooperation
with the EU in fighting drug production and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The EU has cut the GSP benefit rates for Thailand by about 50
percent since the beginning of this year on the belief that the
Thai economy has grown strong enough and is no longer eligible for
the low-tariff GSP benefits.
</P>
<P>
The cut means a doubling of the tariffs on Thai shrimps to 9.7
percent this year and to 13.8 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will suffer a huge loss as a result of higher tariffs
and a smaller export volume. Some of Thailand's competitors in the
shrimp sector will face maximum tariffs of just five percent.
</P>
<P>
Before the GSP benefits could be restored, Thailand hopes for
low-tariff quotas for Thai farm products, in particular frozen
shrimps, canned seafood, canned vegetables and canned fruits.
</P>
<P>
The EU has replied that it is willing to consider increasing
low-tariff quotas for only a few Thai farm products.
</P>
<P>
A negotiating team, to be led by Commerce Minister Narongchai
Akraseni, is planning a trip to France and Belgium to solicit
support for Thailand's requests and to negotiate with EU
officials.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is especially insistent that frozen shrimps be granted
a large low-tariff quota because Thailand's competitors in the
shrimp sector have not had their GSP privileges cut.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Thailand would like its frozen shrimp
exports subject to the same tariff rates as last year, with the
amount to be based on the volume of exports to the EU over the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Thailand wants the EU to at least treat its
frozen shrimp exports as a priority in its requests if the EU
would not yield on all of the above mentioned items.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Thailand would lose 50 percent of its EU
market or 3.5 million baht (140,000 U.S. dollars) this year and
would completely lose its market next year if the EU did not
soften its stance.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Backs Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
pledged its continued support to the operation of the Export
Board of Zambia (EBZ) to enhance the improved performance and
development of industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was made by Minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry Alfeyo Hambayi during his recent familiarization tour of
the EBZ, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi said that the role of the EBZ playing is paramount to
the development of industry in Zambia and needs the support of
the government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government gives priority to the promotional
activities being undertaken by the EBZ since they contribute
significantly to the growth of the export sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the development of industry in the
country hinges on the effective performance of the EBZ as it
opens more opportunities for the private sector to penetrate the
world market and earn foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
EBZ executive director Mwansa Musonda told the minister that
his organization has been working hard within its limited
financial resources to promote non-traditional products in
regional and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Zambian products are on high demand and needed to be promoted
vigorously on the international market. The European Union and
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are
the major target markets for Zambian products. Zambia's most
popular products needed in foreign markets include engineering
products, sugar, coffee, tobacco, soya beens and textiles,
according to the EBZ boss.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Reports lowest Rate of Aids Cases in GCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has the lowest rate
of AIDS cases comparing with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states and Middle East countries, Kuwait Times today quoted an
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily, Kuwaiti Blood Bank Director
Abdul Aziz Bashir attributed the achievement to various measures
taken to guard against this fatal disease in the country,
including highlighting the issue through the media and holding
seminars and international conferences on AIDS in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to Bashir, Kuwait is one of the first countries
which started AIDS detection tests in 1985 in the GCC, which also
groups Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, blood donors have to go through all mandatory
tests such as HIV, hepatitis, malaria and venereal disease,
Bashir said, adding that no transmission of the disease occurred
from within the country because expatriates in Kuwait are
subjected to AIDS detection tests upon their arrival.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Kuwait also made efforts to make people
aware of the dangers and contamination channels of the disease.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is a fatal disease which causes collapse of the human
body immune system and is spread mainly by blood transfusion and
homosexual activities.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 721,000 people in Kuwait donated blood and about 50
percent of the donors are Kuwaitis, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
However, Bashir neither gave details on the AIDS situation in
Kuwait, nor elaborated on the situation of other GCC countries.
</P>
<P>
About 40 HIV positive cases were reported in Kuwait last
year. But Bashir did not provide vital statistics on the
AIDS cases in the country.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of
Ethiopia said the country earned 184 million U.S. Dollars
from exports in the first half of this fiscal year starting on

</P>
<P>
The figure is up 11.4 million Dollars over the same period
of the last fiscal year, said the bank on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The boom is due to the increase of coffee exports and of the
varieties of exporting items, including hides and skins, oil
seeds, cereals, and chat.
</P>
<P>
Meat and Meat products in the country, previously only
exported to Saudi Arabia, this year entered the markets in the

<HEADLINE> Lebanon frees Iraqi Diplomats Held on Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi diplomats held on
charges of assassination of an Iraqi opposition leader in 1994 in
Beirut have been released, the Daily Star reported Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
An investigating judge Monday ordered the release of the
suspects, Consul Ali Sultan Darwish, Cultural Attache Mohammed
Fares Kamel Kazem and Hadi Hassoun Najim, a lower-ranking
diplomat, on a bail of 50,000 Lebanese pounds (32 dollars) for
each after the Lebanese Foreign Ministery reaffirmed their
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested following the assassination on April
12, 1994 of Taleb Souheil Al-Tamimi, a 70-year-old Iraqi Shiite
opposition leader, at his residence in West Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Souheil held Jordanian and Saudi passports and was a member
of the Free Iraq Council, a London-based oppopsition group which
staged an abortive putsch against Sassam Husseim's regime in
1993.
</P>
<P>
A forth Iraqi diplomat, Commercial Attache Khaled Alwan
khalaf was also arrested in connection with the murder and died
of a brain haemorrhage while in custody.
</P>
<P>
One week after the killing, Beirut severed diplomaic ties
with Baghdad, which had been tense since 1988 when Iraq backed
the anti-government revolt by General Michel Aoun, the former
Lebanese army commander.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese authorities said in 1995 they were waiting for a
reply by Lebanon's Foreign Ministry to whether the suspects were
listed as diplomats or non-diplomatic staff.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources said the ministry confirmed the suspects'
diplomatic immunity only last week, and they gave no explanation
for the prolonged delay in the response.

CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Moya of Spain fought
into the semi finals of the Australian Open tennis tournament
Tuesday after beating compatriot Felix Mantilla in a heated match
in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Moya outplayed Mantilla 7-5, 6-2, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 in the quarter
finals but the loser immediately questioned the decision by
tournament referee Peter Bellenger to close the retractable roof
for the first time to enclose center court from the sun.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Monday's high of 41 Celsius
prompted leading men's stars Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic to
describe playing conditions as the toughest they have known.
</P>
<P>
It was the first ever semifinals appearance in five grand slams
for Moya, who ranked 25th in the world. He will play against
either second seed Michael Chang or Chilean ninth seed Marcelo
Rios Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moya has beaten defending champion Boris Becker, Patrick

<P>
HANGZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has launched a historic hi-tech project for its economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
Under the "New Century Project," the chief goal will be to
establish an industrial structure with high technology at the core.
</P>
<P>
Eight hi-tech industries, including those involved in
telecommunications equipment, micro-electronics, new materials and
pharmaceuticals, will be established in the province; high
technology will be applied to the renovation of traditional
industries and agriculture by the end of the century; and the
contribution rate of science and technology to the growth of
traditional industries will reach or exceed 50 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, high technology is being called
the driving power of the economy in the province.
</P>
<P>
The "New Century Project" is based on the expansion of the
hi-tech industrial development areas and other hi-tech plans. At
present, three such areas have taken shape in Hangzhou, Ningbo and
Wenzhou, and two hi-tech industrial belts have formed along the
highways and the coastal areas. The output of the hi-tech industry
in the province has been on rise at an annual rate of 36 percent.
</P>

</P>
<P>
President William M. Crozier, Jr. disclosed during his tour in
China that the bank is also planning to start up a branch in south
China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth, the opening-up of its financial circle

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Urged to Reset Job Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has
come under a renewed pressure to restate its job target as
opposition claims there is no real prospect of employment growth
on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
The call followed the release of figures by the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showing the country's unemployment rate
up by 8.6 percent on a seasonally adjusted base last December from
8.5 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The number of people unemployed for two years or more rose to
229,500 from 220,700 in the previous month, the ABS said in its
release today.
</P>
<P>
As part of the last budget forecasts, the government predicted
that the jobless rate would drop to 8.25 percent by June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesman for employment and training Martin
Ferguson today called on the government to introduce real job
training schemes targeted at the needs of the long-term
unemployed, as there was little hope for an improvement in their
job prospects over 1997.
</P>
<P>
An economic analyst was quoted by newspapers as saying that
labor market conditions remained subdued at the end of 1996, with
the annual employment growth stuck around one percent, and the
full-time job growth even slower at 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
With employment growth unable to keep in pace with the growth
in the workforce, Australia's unemployment rate would continue to
climb, the analyst warned.

<HEADLINE> Agro-Science Plays Big Role in China's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Agro-science played a decisive
role in achieving comprehensive economic development in rural
China last year.
</P>
<P>
North China's Shanxi Province set historic records last year in
the production of grain, fruit, vegetable and animal
by-products. Its per capita share of meat, eggs and milk has
exceeded the national average.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of agro-science's contribution to the success of the
grain harvest rose to 70 percent last year, said a local
agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
Popularization of 50 new and high-tech items in agriculture
brought an additional profit of 30 million yuan to the province
last year.
</P>
<P>
The technique of growing crops under plastic film covers has
spread in the province at an annual growth rate of 20 percent. The
amount of land plowed with machinery and dry-farming techniques
has tripled in three years. And over 60 percent of the six million
farm households in the province have learned two or three
agro-techniques at short-term training courses.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, a pastoral area in north China, has succeeded
in turning 28,660 ha of farmland into fields that produce 15 tons
of grain per ha by introducing improved strains and new techniques.
</P>
<P>
The region vowed to raise its grain output of high-yielding
land to one billion kg by the year 2000, accounting for half of
the total.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hunan Province, 380,000 farm households have
begun to experiment with up-to-date farming methods. A farmer
named Li Aisheng introduced fine fruit tree saplings from abroad
and sold them to 200 townships, yielding an annual net income of
100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, Sichuan Province, one of China's leading
grain producers, plans to increase the amount of funds used in
improving crop strains from two million yuan to 5.5 million yuan a
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will set up research centers to study development
of maize, wheat, sweet potato, cotton and rapeseed in a move to
raise its output of grain to 50 billion kg and that of rapeseed to
two billion kg by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Dam Yangtze River Again (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China said it will be able to
dam the mighty Yangtze River for a second time, in order to build
the Three Gorgest Project, the world's largest hydro-electrical
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
"China has conquered all major technological problems for the
damming of the river, which has been scheduled for November this
year," said a senior official with the China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corporation, overseer of the project.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China has studied the damming of the
Yangtze at the Three Gorges for more than four decades. Since the
early 1980s, scientific research institutions have built a number
of models to simulate the damming.
</P>
<P>
"The design plan for this year's damming has passed
technological appraisal by experts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The damming of the river will be one of the three major events
in China this year, together with the resumption of exercising
sovereignty over Hong Kong and the 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
In order to build the project, scheduled for completion in
2009, the country plans to dam the Yangtze to achieve the
first-stage goal of the 17-year effort.
</P>
<P>
To build the 175-meter-high dam, located on the scenic Xiling
Gorge in central China, the country plans to build cofferdams in
both the upstream and downstream areas, then create a water-free
void so that work can begin on the dam and turbine generating
units.
</P>
<P>
A water diversion channel, known as the "artificial Yangtze," as
well as temporary locks, will be used for navigation. The channel
is 1,975 meters long and 300 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
Work on the cofferdams has started. The main riverbed of the
Yangtze is narrowing as workers are gradually building up
cofferdams from the north and south sides toward the middle of the
river.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to plans, a 460-meter-wide river mouth will be left
in the middle of the river by June. After the high-water season
this summer, the gap will be further narrowed to 130 meters
wide. Engineering teams will choose an appropriate day to close
the gap completely.
</P>
<P>
When this is done, the designed water flow volume will reach a
record of 14,000 to 19,000 cubic meters every second.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil's Itaipu, which is presently the world's largest
hydro-electrical station, the water flow volume during the course
of damming was 14,000 to 19,000 cubic meters per second. When
China first dammed the Yangtze River in early 1981 at Gezhouba,
water flow volume was 7,300 cubic meters a second.
</P>
<P>
To dam the river for the Three Gorges Project, China will sink
rocks into the water at depths ranging from 26 to 40 meters. The
deepest water area will be 60 meters, 20 meters deeper than the
lowest depth of water near the Gezhouba Barrage located 38 km
downstream from the Three Gorges Dam site.
</P>
<P>
This year's damming job will be mainly done by the Gezhouba
Group, which has undertaken 70 percent of the construction
workload of the Three Gorges Project since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Gezhouba Group, which has extensive experience as a result
of the first damming of the Yangtze, will dam the mightiest river
in China for a second time in November. However, the exact date
will be decided according to the progress of the project and the
hydraulic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Gezhouba Group signed a contract worth 470
million yuan (about 56.6 million US dollars) with the China
Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure engineering safety during the damming
process, the group has organized a number of leading
hydroelectric experts to solve major technological problems.
</P>
<P>
A series of plans have been worked out to lower rocks into deep
and turbulent water and at the same time to prevent the jutting
edges of the rock cofferdams from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
The group has already prepared 10 million cubic meters of rocks
and is stocking more.

<HEADLINE> Community Enterprise Thrives in Reform Trend (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Considering China's booming
economy, a business group with an annual turnover of 1.1 billion
yuan and an export volume of 38 million US dollars is
praiseworthy, but not remarkable.
</P>
<P>
What distinguishes Nanhuaxijie Enterprise Group (NEG) is that
for several years it has ranked first in the country among
businesses launched and operated by neighborhoods -- the lowest
unit in the government hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
And last year's indexes have helped the group, based in this
capital city of south China's Guangdong Province, strengthen its
hold on the No. 1 spot.
</P>
<P>
The business giant, comprised of nearly 70 companies with total
assets of 1.7 billion yuan, has evolved from what was little more
than a small processing operation founded by a group of housewives
from the neighborhood, according to Xiao Jianhua, chief of the
Nanhuaxi Neighborhood Office.
</P>
<P>
According to the administrative head of the community, the
business barely made ends meet during the first 20 years, but
began to balloon after China adopted the reform and opening in
1978, with annual profits leaping 20-fold from two million yuan in
1979 to 41.4 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since the group's official establishment in 1988, he added, its
business turnover, industrial output value, profit, and export
volume have been growing by about 30 percent each year.

"NEG has been designated as one of the 70 key enterprise groups
in Guangdong Province, which is quite rare for neighborhood
enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
Different from other local big businesses, Xiao noted, the
group has an independent streak, and has operated without any
state financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates the success of the reform policy, with focus on
diversification of economic structure, which has been pursued by
the Chinese government over the past 18 years," he commented.
</P>
<P>
The group created another precedent for neighborhood
enterprises in China when part of its operations were listed on
the stock market last month.
</P>
<P>
The listing of a shareholding body combining three major
companies in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on December 9 is expected
to bring in a total of 100 million yuan for the group, which will
be used to expand production, its real estate projects and
operations in the tertiary industry, and also as a liquid fund,
explained Liang Zhongwen, Managing Vice-Chairman of the Board.
</P>
<P>
He revealed NEG also has plans to raise funds in the
international capital market, including securities.
</P>
<P>
With five industrial parks under its operation across
Guangzhou, NEG focuses on manufacturing of transformers, central
air conditioning systems, high-quality clothing, rubber and light
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The group is also engaged in trade, real estate development,
and dealings in securities. A development plan for the group
indicated its sales will reach three million yuan in 2000.

BEIRUT, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beirut International
Airport has been closed since the midnight after negotiations
between the state-run airlines company and unions representing
pilots and ground staff Monday night failed to prevent a 24-hour
strike.
</P>
<P>
A Swissair flight from Zurich became the first victim of the
stoppage when the airport notified the plane that it would not
be allowed to land as scheduled at 2:00 a.m. (0000 GMT).
</P>
<P>
An hour before the strike started, Khaled Salam, chairman of
the Middle East Airlines(MEA), said he had given up hope of
brokering a deal to ensure industrial peace.
</P>
<P>
MEA and the unions held talks throughout Monday in a
zero-hour attempt to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The strike, involving the 145 pilots and some 4,500 other
staff, was called for in demand of a five percent annual
increase in salaries and in protest against changes in
employees' medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
MEA recently transferred medical insurance to a private
company but employees are demanding the continuation of the
current policy of immediate medical expense coverage by the
company.
</P>
<P>
MEA's Eight outgoing flights and five incoming flights have
been canciled due to the strike, and airlines serviced by MEA at
the airport, namely Swisair, Royal Jordanian, Alitalia, Kuwait
Airways and Emirates, are also affected.

HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior football club
official has offered to help solve the much-criticized refereeing
in Hong Kong's football matches.
</P>
<P>
Ken Ng Kin, an official of last season's first-division
champions and senior club Instant-Dict, said on Monday that a
softer approach through the Hong Kong Football Association
(HKFA)'s referee committee would help solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried by today's English-language daily
Hong Kong Standard, Instant-Dict and another senior club Golden
have been the vocal critics of Hong Kong's football referees.
</P>
<P>
Golden has even threatened to boycott a coming match unless the
HKFA cleaned up the standard refereeing.
</P>
<P>
"I view myself as part of the solution," said Ng, who himself
is a FIFA recognized referee.
</P>
<P>
Ng said there are no debriefing sessions between the referee'
technical committee and the referees themselves.
</P>
<P>
But Golden agreed to play Tuesday's match against Sing Tao as
scheduled after former FA councilor and Vice-President Veronica
Chan Yiu-kum talked out of staging the boycott.
</P>
<P>
Chan advised the club to go through proper FA channels to voice
their criticisms, the newspaper said.

WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- American balloonist Steve
Fossett landed in India Monday, failing to become the first person
to balloon non-stop around the world, but setting two world
records along the way.
</P>
<P>
Fossett landed early Monday at Prithiganj, north of the city of
Allahabad in northeastern India, his Chicago ground base said.
</P>
<P>
Fossett broke his own world distance record (9,594 miles or
15,350 km) and set the balloon duration record (6 days, 2 hours
and 54 minutes).
</P>
<P>
The adventurer took off January 13 from St. Louis of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
He could have continued on to southeast Asia had he not run
into thunderstorms near the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
Because of the delay of permission to pass Libyan airspace,
Fossett's balloon did not have enough fuel to cross the Pacific
and reach North America.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- As the matches are turning
white-hot in the Australian Open tennis championships, the weather
in Melbourne is getting higher as well.
</P>
<P>
According to forecast, a top of 40 degrees celsius has been
predicted today, while it has reached its maximum temperatures of
41.2 degrees yesterday.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Grand Slam tennis, the roof over the
central stadium at Melbourne Park is to stay closed throughout
today.
</P>
<P>
Australian Open tournament referee Peter Bellenger said he had
the option of closing the roof from the quarter-final stage since
all matches would be played on the center court.
</P>
<P>
Bellenger refused to close the roof yesterday as it would have
disadvanted players who had battled outdoors in temperatures of 60
celsius courtside.
</P>
<P>
He said the Grand Slam committee would review the regulations
at the end of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
In 1988 the temperature at the Open reached 45 degrees, and the
following year there were five days of 42, but concerns about the
heat had been expressed time and again since Melbourne has
experienced a succession of hot summers.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Developing Bonded Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Eight large foreign-funded
companies in Tianjin Municipality in North China were recently
approved by Tianjin Customs to become bonded factories, according
to a customs official.
</P>
<P>
To date, the customs office has approved the establishment of
80 bonded factories in the Tianjin Economic and Technological
Development Area in China's third largest city.
</P>
<P>
The combined production of these factories makes up 90 percent
of the total of the processing firms in the area, and the
factories receive tax exemptions for raw materials imported for
manufacturing export goods.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the economic development of the area,
Tianjin Customs has taken measures to introduce a more efficient,
flexible and fair administrative system, said the official.
</P>
<P>
And the factories have simplified the customs procedures, which
in turn has reduced the cost and boosted capital circulation of
firms, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Three bonded factories which violated the customs rules were
deprived of their rights to enjoy the preferential policies, the
official said. They recently regained the rights after they had
corrected their mistakes and passed mandatory reviews by the
customs office.

projects were built by following the practice of BOT (build,
operate and transfer).
</P>
<P>
Minbei water conservancy and hydropower resources exploitation
company in Nanping has signed 35 contracts on hydropower stations

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Military Bank is
introducing a new category of deposit account to allow its clients
to enjoy a rate higher than that paid to the fixed deposits
through depositing equivalent amounts each month.
</P>
<P>
According to a report available here today, the interest rate
generated on the new deposit category is 0.75 percentage points
above the bank's 12-month fixed deposits.
</P>
<P>
The tax on the interest generated on the new deposit category
will also be exempt, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, to enjoy the benefits, clients must put in equivalent
amounts of money ranging from 1,000 to 25,000 baht (40 to 1,000
U.S. dollars) every month for 24 consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
The bank initiated the new move in response to the Thai
government's policy to encourage savings this year. The government
has announced the year 1997 as "the year of savings," calling on
people to put more money in banks to help the country bring down
its current account deficit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urges ASEAN States to Ratify Nuclear Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas made a fresh call Monday for fellow ASEAN countries to
display their commitment to the elimination of nuclear weapons by
ratifying the treaty on a southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone.
</P>
<P>
He said all members of the Association of South-East Asian
Nations should have ratified the treaty by July 30 when the
association was due to meet in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The minister was addressing the plenary session of the House of
Representatives held to discuss ratification of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The government submitted the bill to the House on January 4.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing ASEAN as a nuclear weapon-free zone is of
fundamental national interest," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"Southeast Asia is a strategic area, lined not only by
communication channels which are the economic veins of many
countries, but is also a vital channel for the global strategies
of many major companies,' he added.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was originally signed at the ASEAN summit in
Bangkok, capital of Thailand, in December 1995 by all 10 Southeast
Asian nations. So far, however, only Cambodia has ratified the
treaty into its legal system.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the House's Foreign Affairs Commission Mrs. Aisyah
Amini said last night that it would not take more than a month for
Indonesia to ratify the treaty, as the nation wanted Southeast
Asia to be a nuclear weapon free zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Changle International Airport in
Fuzhou conducted successful test flights over the weekend,
bringing east China's Fujian Province into a new stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
The Changle Airport, the second in the capital city of Fuzhou,
is expected to greatly expand Fujian's capacity for air transport
upon its scheduled completion in April, according to the
provincial civil aviation authorities.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the rapidly-developing local economy, provincial
authorities have invested heavily in expansion and innovation of
airports in cities such as Xiamen, Fuzhou, Wuyishan, and Jinjiang.
</P>
<P>
So far, the four airports operating in Fujian have opened a
total of 106 air routes, including ten for overseas, and handle
nearly 700 flights each week.
</P>
<P>
Gaoqi International Airport in the port city of Xiamen is
operating 49 domestic routes and seven regional and international
routes, and ranks fourth in China in terms of passenger
flow. While the Yixu Airport in Fuzhou has opened chartered
flights to cities such as Singapore and Hiroshima, Japan, and has
offered a regular flight service to Hong Kong since 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the two air ports of entry in Xiamen and Fuzhou
combinedly handled 810,000 entries and departures, accounting for
98.6 percent of Fujian's total.
</P>
<P>
Along with the improvement of infrastructure, the only airlines
based in Fujian also has a flourishing business.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1984, Xiamen Airlines now operates 13 Boeing
passenger jets and one cargo plane. Providing regular flights on
more than 70 routes, the carrier reported an overall transport
volume totaling more than 200 million tons per kilometer last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has taken a number of
measures to create a liberal economic and business environment for
foreign investment, said Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has adopted an open and liberal economic policy since the
early 1990s with a view to encouraging the full involvement of the
private sector in economic activities, Lohani told a business
seminar here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has recently introduced many reform
measures including administrative decentralization, liberalization
in trade and industrial investment, tax reform and tariff
rationalization.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nepal, sandwiched between China and India, the
world's two most populous countries, provides it with vast markets
on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The abundance of a labor force available at a very competitive
wage level is another factor conducive to profitable business
activities in Nepal, said Lohani.
</P>
<P>
He added that Nepal welcomes foreign investment in almost all
the sectors of the national economy, especially manufacturing,
energy, tourism, mineral resources and agro-based industries.

<HEADLINE> India's New Guidelines to Attract Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Industry Ministry
on Monday issued some new guidelines designed to attract
badly-needed foreign direct investment, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the new guidelines, foreign companies will be
allowed to set up wholly-owned subsidiaries provided they are
bringing in propriety technology, the products will be exported or
if the investment is in the field of consultancy, power, road,
ports and industrial estates.
</P>
<P>
These should be done keeping in view the special requirements
and merit of each case, the guidelines said.
</P>
<P>
If a foreign company is unable to identify an Indian joint
venture partner, the guidelines said, India's Foreign Investment
Promotion Board (FIPB) may allow 100 percent equity on the
condition that 26 percent is sold to a partner or to the public
within a period of three to five years.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also pointed out that if an Indian partner of a
joint venture is unable to raise the resources for expansion, FIPB
may recommend an increase in the foreign partner equity to 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the non-banking financial services category, foreign equity
of up to 51 percent has been allowed, and no special conditions
are attached except those requiring approval of the Securities and
Exchange Board of India, the guidelines said.

LISBON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio met with visiting Chinese Vice-premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen in the presidential residence this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio, who is scheduled to visit China next month, said he
was looking forward to his coming visit to China and pledged to
further promote the cooperation between the two countries. The
visit will be Sampaio's second one since he was elected president.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said that a number of businessmen would join his
entourage to boost cooperation with China in the economic and
trade fields.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here last Saturday after his five-nation tour
of Africa, said China has made a realistic and sober approach in
dealing with the Hong Kong and Macao issues, thus working out two
successful joint declarations with Britain and Portugal
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the settlement of the Macao issue will benefit
both countries in developing bilateral relations and enhancing
cooperation in international affairs. He agreed that both sides
should speed up the work of the liaison group.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio thanked China for backing Portugal in running for the
non-permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council. He hoped
that Portugal and China will have more consultations, which would
help resolve some international problems. And he voiced Portugal's
support for China to resume its membership of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio maintained that Portugal, longing to build up a lasting
friendly and cooperative relationship with China, should promote
such a relationship with initiativeness, strategic views and
patience.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the two countries have shared a stable and friendly
relationship since they established diplomatic relations 18 years

<HEADLINE> Thai Currency Hits 66-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has urged
finance institutions, exporters and other foreign loan borrowers
to hedge currency risks as the Thai currency baht has depreciated
to a record 66-month low against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The mid-rate on Monday was pegged at 25.71 baht, or 1.54
percent higher than the rate of 25.32 baht per dollar on January
22 last year.
</P>
<P>
On Monday 50-dollar and 100-dollar denominations were sold at
26.01 baht and bought at 25.42 baht.
</P>
<P>
The steep baht depreciation followed a surge in the U.S. dollar
against the Japanese yen. The dollar rose to a 46-month high of
117.90 yen in Tokyo on Monday, surpassing the 118 yen mark for the
first time since March 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat Vibulsawasdi, deputy governor of the Bank of
Thailand, said that weakening against the dollar, the baht will be
stronger against the German mark and Japanese yen, putting
Thailand's exports to Japan and Europe at a disadvantage. But,
Thailand will gain from the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand's economic fundamentals are still strong and
that will prevent some adverse impact from the Thai currency's
fall.
</P>
<P>
However, Chaiyawat suggested that commercial banks and those
involved in currency transactions hedge against their positions to
prevent undue risk from the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar, which
has been appreciating steadily on the back of a strong U.S.
economy.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, Spain to Strengthen Educational Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and Spain today inaugurated
a postgraduate center in Havana designed to foster relations
between universities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The institution will benefit both countries by promoting
postgraduate research and academic projects, Carle Sola, chairman
of the conference of Spanish university presidents said.
</P>
<P>
He said a platform of work priorities will be reviewed and a
meeting of Cuban-Spanish university presidents to be held in
Havana will be held in Havana in July.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Cruz, Cuba's deputy minister of higher education,
underlined that the center, the only one of its kind in the
country, is an important step in bilateral collaborations.
</P>
<P>
The idea to establish such an institution first came up in 1995
at the first meeting of Cuban and Spanish university presidents in
Santiago de Compostela. The meeting was hailed as historical
since it intensified professor exchanges and joint research and
master and Ph.D. programs.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Electronic Exports Expected to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's exports of consumer
electronics and home appliances are set to increase by 79 percent
as a result of increased investment in the sector, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's consumer electronic products are competitive,
"even stronger than Malaysian or Thai products," Mulya Hadi
Suwarso, secretary general of the Electronic Industry and Home
Appliances Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's consumer electronics exports, which reached 1.95
billion U.S. dollars in 1996, are expected to hit 3.5 billion
dollars this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Suwarso, Indonesia offers cheaper workers and
cheaper space than that available in other countries, providing an
impetus for rapid development in the consumer electronics
industry.
</P>
<P>
"It will also be more beneficial if we can avoid investments
and loans involving high interest rates," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Of the 400 electronics companies in the country, 20 percent are
based on foreign investment and the remaining 80 percent are local
companies.
</P>
<P>
The sector is expected to yield 6 billion dollars in foreign
exchange by the end of 1998, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Residents Trace Shanghai's History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Shanghai
residents are flocking to the Shanghai Museum to rediscover the
culture and history of their hometown through a newly-opened
exhibition called "Six Thousand Years of Shanghai."
</P>
<P>
On display are a number of cultural relics from the area,
dating from different historical periods.
</P>
<P>
The relics include tripods and pottery ovens which were
unearthed from a tomb of the Chu Kingdom of the Warring States
Period (475BC-221BC), sculptures of fetishes of Taoism in the Song
Dynasty (960-1279), and lacquerwares from the Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
The items were made locally and some can be traced back 6,000
years, when the city was in its beginning stages of growth.
</P>
<P>
Visitors whose knowledge about Shanghai's history is limited to
the tale of the city that sprang up from a tiny fishing village
150 years ago, are now proud of their rich heritage.
</P>
<P>
It is the duty of local residents to find and help preserve the
cultural relics of Shanghai, one museum visitor said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Tianzuo, a deputy general engineer from the Municipal
Administration on Urban Planning, said that some of Shanghai's
unique characteristics are gradually vanishing as a result of the
city's development and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Local people's enthusiasm for the history and culture of
Shanghai is "highly commendable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, dubbed the "Pearl of the Orient," is the largest city
in China, located on the east coast and facing the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
A recent TV program asked the audience to find the oldest iron
manhole cover in Shanghai. Local residents discovered three covers
cast in 1921, which are now exhibited in the Shanghai Museum.
</P>
<P>
Xue Daming, who plans to open a museum for firefighting
equipment, has collected a number of these items, such as
fire-engines, fire hydrants, ladders, uniforms and a fire ship,
which was used in the early years of Shanghai and later replaced
by modern versions.
</P>
<P>
Xue said the pieces in his collection symbolize the history of
the city's fire control sector, and perhaps that of the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is among a group of cities throughout the world that
took the lead in introducing modern necessities such as electric
power, gas and the telephone, said a local resident, "but few
people know about it."
</P>
<P>
Now, imitations of cultural relics such as antique fire
hydrants, gas lamps, hand-crank telephones and calendars are used
as fashionable decorations in local bars and restaurants.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Likely to Tighten Rules on Transit Visas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is likely to tighten
its transit visa rules, especially for Bangladeshis, Indians and
Pakistanis, in a bid to stem illegal immigrants from using
Thailand as a gateway to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently allows a one-month period for transit visas
as a measure to promote tourism and the period is too long,
according to Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Surapong Jayanama.
</P>
<P>
Thai nationals were being granted only a two-day transit visa
in some countries, Surapong was quoted as saying by local
newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Ministry is considering changes in its
regulations for granting transit visas, he said.
</P>
<P>
In future, the spokesman said, visitors from Bangladesh, India,
and Pakistan would have to apply for visas from the Thai consular
offices in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
The Thai immigration authorities earlier this month rounded up
over 300 illegal immigrants in southern Thailand's Songkhla
province. Most of them, who were waiting for chances to enter
Malaysia for jobs, were from the three south Asian countries.

YANGON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities have

<HEADLINE> Botanical Garden to Be Established in Three Gorges Dam Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China is constructing a
botanical garden to protect and save rare wild plants which will
be submerged when the renowned Three Gorges Dam is finished and
begins operating.
</P>
<P>
The Haiyun Botanic Garden is located at Yichang, Hubei
Province, where the dam project is underway, reported the
Beijing-based "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Botanical Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences
has worked out an overall plan for the garden, probably costing
several billion yuan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A major task should include transplanting rare wild varieties
of plants which may be submerged by the dam, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Precious and rare botanical species in the surrounding areas
can also be planted in this garden, which is expected to be
completed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
As early as the 1960s, scientists suggested establishing a
national botanical garden in this area, and making this garden
into a gene base for precious and rare varieties of plants, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Three-Gorges Dam is situated in the confluence of plateau,
hill land and mountains. The climate in this area shifts from
subtropical to temperate zones.
</P>
<P>
Since there are hills and mountains to the north, Siberian cold
current can be stopped from entering the area. And therefore, due
to favourable natural conditions there, the variety of plants is
very rich.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Threaten to Pull out of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) has threatened to pull out of the peace
talks if the government does not withdraw its troops surrounding
the MILF's main camp, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Haj Murad, military chief of the 12,000-member rebel group
in the southern Philippines, was quoted as saying that he was
planning to hand in a protest to the government peace panel
against the continued military deployment in several villages of
Buldon, Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, there are occasional but minor firefights between
our forces (and government troops), but the MILF is trying to
prevent the situation from getting out of hand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers and one rebel were killed last Thursday in an
encounter which the military said was provoked by an ambush
against the escort of the Buldon Mayor.
</P>
<P>
Government chief negotiator Fortunato Abat said he would reject
any demand to withdraw the troops and stressed the importance of
the military's presence in the area to ensure the security of
residents.
</P>
<P>
The peace panels of the government and the MILF discussed
guidelines and the framework for their future formal peace
negotiations at the first round of talks on January 7-8. They are
scheduled to come back to the negotiation table on February 25.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Countries Beat Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) countries achieved the most successful fight against
inflation in South America in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay. Argentina's inflation dropped from 1.6 percent in 1995 to
0.1 percent in 1996; Brazil from 22.4 to 9.6 percent; Paraguay
from 10.5 to 8.2 percent and Uruguay from 35.4 to 24.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy expressed his wish to
intensify his country's links in the Mercosur and for new partners
to join the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Wasmosy asserted his country's need to find solutions for its
financial sector based on foreign experiences.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur and the European Union (EU) are sponsoring a
program to promote quality which is aimed at the business sectors
of the countries of that South American bloc.
</P>
<P>
The coordinators of the third working sub-group of the
Mercosur, and a delegation of the EU, agreed to distribute 45
slots among businessmen, 12 of which will correspond to Uruguay,
the same number to Argentina and Paraguay and 9 to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The positions will be given to small- and mid-sized companies
that want to implement a system of quality and are willing to
collaborate for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The government of Paraguay, which this year will exercise the
pro tempore presidency of the Mercosur, will give priority to
social matters during its mandate.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is of great concern for the four members of the
Mercosur and we want to develop a series of joint projects in that
area," said Dido Bogado, Paraguay's ambassador to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur had achieved an important trade and economic
development. Paraguay would focus its attention on social matters,
especially in the generation of jobs, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, at the same time, will try to negotiate an agreement
with Chile to liberalize foreign investments in border areas, in
order to stimulate mining projects in the Cordillera de Los Andes.
</P>
<P>
Through that agreement, both countries will grant investors
from the other side the same treatment granted to nationals.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will allow mines close to the border to take
advantage of the infrastructure existing on the other side and to
exploit deposits that cross the borders in the area.
</P>
<P>
The technical committees that are working in the Uruguayan
Institute of Technical Standards -- with the participation of all
the sectors involved -- have approved 79 standards presented by
the Mercosur Standardization Committee (CNM, its acronym in
Spanish) as national specifications.
</P>
<P>
The norms referring to cement, concrete and its components are
part of the nearly 700 that are undergoing different stages of
study or approval by the CNM, whose objectives are to draw up the
regional specifications and promote cooperation for unifying
specifications.

<HEADLINE> Former Bulgarian Leader Freed From House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Bulgarian leader Todor
Zhivkov was freed from six-year house arrest today after Bulgarian
Chief Prosecutor Ivan Tatarchev signed an order.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that the chief prosecutor did not explain the
reasons of the release in his order.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov, 85, was compelled to resign the secretary-general of
the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee on November 10,
1989. In February 1992, he was convicted of illegally distributing
money, apartments and cars to people's deputies.
</P>
<P>
In September 1992, Zhivkov was sentenced to seven years in
prison and would repay 21 million levs (24 million U.S. dollars)
to Bulgaria. He lodged an appeal, but the Supreme Court maintained
the original verdict in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, the Bulgarian Supreme Court Criminal Committee
acquitted Zhivkov of the crimes. But he remained under house
arrest because he was indicted on other charges by the Bulgarian
Office of the Chief Procurator, including allegedly channeling
millions of dollars to developing countries.

The government of Paraguay approved a loan contract with the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for 22 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to strengthen the judicial power and for
the Civil Registry Office.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the modernization program for Paraguay will
amount to 33 million dollars, and the extra funds required for its
execution will be covered by a loan from the Spanish government.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's central bank, which devalued its currency against the
U.S. dollar by nearly seven percent in 1996 insinuated that it
will follow a similar strategy this year.
</P>
<P>
Critics maintain that if the currency does not depreciate more
quickly, Brazil's trade deficit could increase by more than the
eight billion U.S dollars for this year.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's automobile sales to Brazil reached 103,000 units in
1996, an increase of 145 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Argentine automobiles enjoy a comfortable lead in the Brazilian
market taking a 46 percent share of the total of 224,000 units
imported by Brazil in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Argentina imported 368,000 automobiles from Brazil and
exported only 42,000 units to that country in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government said that it was viewing with caution
the United States' proposal to speed up the creation of a Free
Trade Zone of the Americas (ALCA, its acronym in Spanish).
</P>
<P>
"Brazil cannot accept that tariffs be lowered ahead of time,"
said Jose Botafogo Gonzalves, the Foreign Ministry's
undersecretary for economic affairs, and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Brazil could not afford a tariff reduction because it would
aggravate its trade deficit which reached 5.2 billion dollars last
year, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The government of Bolivia decided to continue its preferential
tariffs for products originating from Mercosur countries until
February 28, thus eliminating recent custom tieups.
</P>
<P>
The preferential treatment included in the agreements of
economic complementarity signed by Bolivia and Mercosur countries
in 1995 expired on December 31, 1996. But this decree extends them
for two months until Bolivia's associate status in the Mercosur
Free Trade zone becomes effective.
</P>
<P>
Former United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
asked that the Andean group integration process with the Mercosur
be speeded up so that progress could be made towards the creation
of a continental trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Group's integration with the Mercosur would create
a South American economic bloc of 307 million consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Later on it could join the so-called Free Trade Zone (FRZ) to
form a single hemispherical trade bloc," said de Cuellar.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- With the Beijing-Kowloon Railway
line now in operation, poor mountain areas in central China's
Hubei Province have new opportunities for fast-moving economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The area, a part of the Dabieshan Mountain, the largest
poverty-stricken area in central China, was formerly closed-off
and had poor transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
To boost its opening drive, Hubei has worked out a series of
measures, including an ambitious plan to build bases of grain,
high-quality cotton and fine oil-bearing crops in the area,
according to Li Daqiang, vice-governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, abundant local resources will be used to their
fullest to develop light industries, such as silk, traditional
Chinese medicine and foodstuffs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 180 projects with total
investment of 600 million yuan have been launched in regions along
the railway line, of which 28 each reported an investment
exceeding 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, foreign funds are being introduced to the area. In
the first half of 1996, 15 new overseas-funded companies were set
up there.

<HEADLINE> Marked Rise in Colombia's Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct
investment in Colombia grew by 15 percent, to 1.27 billion
U.S. dollars, during the first 10 months of 1996 compared with the
same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The amount represented an increase of 86 percent over the same
period in 1995 when foreign capital amounted to 272 million
dollars, not counting that received by the petroleum sector,
according to a governmental report published today by the press.
</P>
<P>
Experts are forecasting a considerable increase in foreign
investments in face of the expected arrival of large multinational
companies such as Cemex, the Bilbao Vizcaya Bank, Chilgener,
Endesa, Saint Gobain, Vitro, Friedlands, Daewoo and Sumitomo.
</P>
<P>
Colombian law requires foreign investors to report these
investments within months to the country's central bank.
Therefore several months may elapse between the entry of the funds
and report to the institution.
</P>
<P>
The largest flows of foreign capital went to manufacturing
industries, 528 million dollars (42 percent), and to financial
establishments which got 288 million dollars (23 percent).
</P>
<P>
The Cayman Islands was the main source of foreign investments
in October. It provided 114 million dollars, 42 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Panama and the Virgin Islands were the second most important
sources, contributing more than 50 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a considerable increase in capital
from Central America and the Antilles, especially from Panama, had
been expected in the country last October.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Baoshan Iron and
Steel Corporation will export 39,300 tons of high-grade,
high-intensity petroleum pipeline steel (X65) to India.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the corporation, it won a public
bidding for an oil pipeline project of the National Petroleum
Corporation of India by cooperating with the petroleum steel
pipeline factory of China National Oil and Gas Corporation and
defeated eleven competing enterprises from eight countries,
including Japan, the Republic of Korea and Germany.
</P>
<P>
This puts an end to China's long-time need to rely on imports
for high-grade, high-intensity pipeline steel.
</P>
<P>
The steel will be purchased with World Bank loans, and will be
used to build a 500-km-long oil pipeline in India.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel Corporation started research on
the steel in the early 1990s and has made remarkable progress in
this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the corporation has supplied 120,000 tons of
different types of pipeline steel for oil prospecting in the Tarim
Basin and the Korla petroleum pipeline project in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and also the oil
pipeline project from Shaanxi to Beijing.

MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has hinted a massive revamp of the Philippine National Police
(PNP) as he admitted displeasure over the agency's failure to
capture a lawmaker who was filed against rape charges, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We are evaluating the performance of all officials every day
and that goes for everybody," the president said, hinting the
Presidential Security Group (PSG) was more professional than the
PNP, which still failed to arrest the rape suspect 23 days after
the arrest warrant was issued.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Hector Villanueva said that Ramos has sent out
a signal that PNP Director General Recaredo Sarmiento should
resign so that the PNP can have an effective revamp.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said as of Monday Ramos had neither asked nor
received a courtesy resignation from Sarmiento, but he added that
"Sarmiento is an honorable man so he probably will submit his
courtesy resignation."
</P>
<P>
However, the PNP chief refused to do so. "Why would I do that?
Why I should think about that?" he said on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Romeo Jalosjos, a Representative from Zamboanga Del Notre
province in the southern Philippine, was arrested by PSG members
on January 17 after 23 days in hiding. He was charged with raping
an 11-year-old girl last year and will be tried on January 29.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Quarantine Bureau
of Animals and Plants has found a potentially dangerous bacteria
on a parcel of soybean seeds from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The bureau confiscated the parcel at the city's international
post exchange center, earlier this month, which was mailed from
Japan to a unit in Beijing, an official with the State Quarantine
Bureau of Animals and Plants said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bacteria cannot only harm soybeans but other
plants, such as kidney beans and peas, as well, and can cut output
of those plants in half, or as much as 75 percent in some extreme
cases.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for China to find this type of bacteria
on imported soybeans, the official noted, and urged all quarantine
offices at ports of entry around China to improve their work to
protect the country's agricultural development.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Taking Steps to Bring Unemployment Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest city wants to
keep its unemployment rate at around 3 percent in 1997, Zhu Junyi,
director of the Municipal Bureau of Labor, said at a recent
conference.
</P>
<P>
The city will provide vocational trainings for redundant
workers to bring the number of jobless down to around 150,000 this
year, he explained, and will set up a computer network to collect
and provide employment information to job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to control the employment of the people coming in
from outside.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has seen the GDP average around 12 percent growth in
the past few years, according to statistics, and according to Zhu,
"If it keeps up at this rate, at least an additional 200,000 to
300,000 people will be needed for the labor market before the year
2000."
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the city will have some 240,000
job-seekers from 1996 to 2000. "The bulk of them are well-educated
and can meet the market demand," Zhu said, adding that supply and
demand on the labor market will be in balance.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the city's traditional industries are
rapidly being replaced by new ones that are hi-tech and
information-oriented, resulting in redundancy among older and
poorly-educated workers, with women accounting for the bulk of
that.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Speaks on Guatemala Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun made a speech today before the Security Council voted to
send 150 military observers to Guatemala, explaining why China
voted for the dispatch after it vetoed a similar resolution 10
days ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government," said Ambassador Qin, the permanent
representative to the United Nations, "has all along supported the
peace process in Guatemala and the relevant resolutions adopted by
the General Assembly."
</P>
<P>
He said China is also in favor of the peace process in
Guatemala monitored under the auspices of the U.N. and therefore
China has kept the door wide open to a proper solution of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is with such sincerity," he said, "that we have had many
rounds of fruitful consultations with Guatemala over the past 10
days."
</P>
<P>
"The two sides, guided by the Purposes and Principles of the
U.N. Charter and in a forward-looking pragmatic approach, have
finally found a solution acceptable to both sides, thereby
removing the obstacles to China's support for the relevant draft
resolution. We positively appraise the constructive move taken by
Guatemala," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the basis for cooperation between China and
Guatemala in the U.N. will thus further strengthened, thereby
creating favorable conditions for the future development of
relations between the countries.

<HEADLINE> UK Opposition Rules Out Increases in Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, today ruled out any changes to the current tax levels
if his party were to win the next election.
</P>
<P>
The shadow chancellor told BBC radio today, "What I want is
for the tax rates to be fair and I will leave the tax rates in the
basic and top rate unchanged."
</P>
<P>
He also said there would be no new spending commitments beyond
those covered by its planned windfall tax on the privatized
utilities.
</P>
<P>
Under the Conservative government, the current top rate of
income tax is 40 percent, and the basic rate is 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
If Labor won the election, the priority was to ensure stable,
non-inflationary growth, the shadow chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
Under a future Labor government, it would introduce a 10
percent initial income tax rate when resources were available,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
"The principals that should govern a tax system are that it
should encourage employment, it should encourage savings and
investment, and of course it should be fair," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Brown also said he would be tight on public spending. "I
can't allow public spending to get out of control and I will not
do so," the shadow chancellor stressed.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Approves Military Observers to Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council approved unanimously today a plan to send 150 military
observers to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The 150 military observers were given a three-month mandate to
monitor the implementation of a peace agreement between the
government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional
Guatemalteca (URNG).
</P>
<P>
The approval came after an agreement between China and
Guatemala, which China said removed the obstacle for its support
for the relevant resolution.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to announce," said Ambassador Qin Huasun, the
Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations, "that the
agreement between China and Guatemala has reached."
</P>
<P>
"And the obstacle is removed," he told reporters outside the
Security Council before a formal meeting adopting the draft
resolution. "Now we have a chance to send military observers to
Guatemala."
</P>
<P>
China vetoed a similar resolution on January 10, charging that
Guatemala undermined the basis of cooperation between the two
countries in the United Nations by inviting Taiwan's so-called
foreign minister to attend the signing of the peace agreement and
by speaking for Taiwan's bid to the world body.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Frankfurt Hits New Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with London and Paris retreating from last
Friday's record close and ending lower, and Frankfurt finishing
at a new record high.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in London failed to build on Friday's record
breaking gains as profit-taking tightened their grip, with the
FTSE 100 index finishing the session 13.7 points lower at 4,194.0,
dropping back below the 4,200 level.
</P>
<P>
A downturn on Wall Street also pulled London lower in its wake.
The market was said to be nervous ahead of Tuesday's Congressional
testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, and
trading volume was relatively thin.
</P>
<P>
However, German shares in Frankfurt closed at record levels in
moderate trading, supported by the strength of the bond market and
a strong dollar, with the DAX-30 index 29.31 points higher at a
record 3,030.68 after trading in a range of 3,016.41 to 3,031.56
throughout the session.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse had hit an all-time intraday high of 2,438.50
before giving up the early gains and closing down 19 points at
2,406.10.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the early decline on Wall Street and a

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Urges Germany to Spell Out Objectives on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind today called on German leaders to spell out their
long-term objectives on the future of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC Radio interview today, Rifkind challenged
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German leaders to make clear the
limits he would place on moves towards future European
integration.
</P>
<P>
"I think the time has come to ask them to indicate what are the
limits of the integration that they seek and what would be the
European Union that they would like to see in 10 or 20 years,"
Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France, the so-called engine of the European
integration, are reportedly drawing up plans to introduce a
"flexibility chapter" into the EU treaty in a bid to restrict the
single country veto rights.
</P>
<P>
The British government admitted that there was still a
"significant difference" between EU member states over the
definition of flexibility. It stressed that such a flexibility
recommendation would have to be agreed by all the 15 members of
the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind noted that the issue of flexibility is "probably the
most important issue that's being discussed at the
Inter-Governmental Conference and what we are trying to do is to
achieve a European Union that actually is sensitive to the
extraordinary diversity that exits in Europe."

<HEADLINE> (Updated) China, Guatemala Reach Agreement on Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- China and Guatemala have
finally found a solution on sending United Nations military
observers to Guatemala, Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Qin Huasun announced here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to announce that an agreement between China
and Guatemala is reached and the obstacle is removed," Ambassador
Qin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that later today the U.N. Security Council will
have a formal meeting on the question of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have the chance to agree to sending military observers
to monitor the implementation of the peace agreement in
Guatemala," Qin added.
</P>
<P>
China vetoed the draft resolution on sending military observers
to Guatemala when it was considered at the Security Council on
January 10.
</P>
<P>
China charged that Guatemala undermined the basis of
cooperation between the two countries in the United Nations by
inviting Taiwan's so-called "foreign minister" to attend the
signing ceremony of the country's peace agreement last December.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Guatemala has been supporting Taiwan's
bid for the world body.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Fixes Calendar for Justice Reform in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today fixed the calendar for the reform of France's justice
system, which will add to the list of his reform plans covering
the military, social protection, the state system and education.
</P>
<P>
In a radio-television speech this evening, Chirac said that the
French people are experiencing their dissatisfaction over the
country's justice system every day.
</P>
<P>
The doubt remains over the independence of the country's body
of justice from the government, and "some fundmental rights of
human person are sometimes ignored," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the number of trials in France has increased
so much that its justice system is threatened with "being
asphyxiated," while the justice is found to be too tedious in its
procedures, too expensive to resort to, and difficult to
understand.
</P>
<P>
He asked the commission to be in charge of making the layouts
of the reform to study how to create a totally independent justice
system in France, and to better protect the right of presumption
of innocence for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The commission, called Commission of Reflexion on Justice, will
be headed by the first president (judge) of the Cour de Cassation
(supreme court), Pierre Truche, and is expected to present its
conclusion by July 15 to the government.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also asked the government to work out a five-year plan
to improve the daily function of the country's justice machinery.

<HEADLINE> UK to Table New Proposals on BSE in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government is to
present new plans next month on exempting herds free of BSE or mad
cow disease from a global ban on British beef exports in a bid to
lift the total trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said today that the
British parliament was due to debate the government plans Thursday
and that it would be the first step in easing the protracted ban
if the new proposals were accepted.
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't want to put forward a working document until the
House of Commons has approved the Orders. We'll be putting forward
the working document I anticipate in early February," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hogg denied that the new certified herd scheme, in which each
cow is to get a passport or ear-tag, would allow Northern Ireland
exporters to grab Scottish markets.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's the proper way to look at it as we are
putting forward new proposals, which are UK-wide," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "Northern Ireland is well placed to take advantage of
the certified herds scheme" as Northern Irish herds are mainly
grass-fed and their details and movements are recorded on a
computerized system, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef products
exports last March as the British government admitted that there
were possible links between mad cow disease and its human
equivalent Creutzfelft Jacob Disease (CJD).

<HEADLINE> UK Labor MP Dies After Long Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A member of parliament (MP) for
Britain's opposition Labor Party died today at the age of 59 after
a long illness, putting the Conservative Party back on level terms
in the House of Commons, according to a BBC television report
today.
</P>
<P>
Martin Redmond, Labor MP for Don Valley, in South Yorkshire,
had suffered from cancer, and his death today followed that last
week of Conservative MP Iain Mills, which put the Tory into a
minority of one in the lower House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Redmond's death put the ruling Conservative Party and all the
opposition parties once again back on level terms with 322 on each
side of the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Britain's general election must be held by May 22 at the latest
and Mills' death last week had heightened speculation that Prime
Minister John Major might be forced to hold an early election.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Court Suspends Belgrade Election Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A Serbian court suspended
today a Belgrade electoral commission ruling which admitted the
municipal election victory to the opposition coalition Zajedno.
</P>
<P>
Municipal court president Dragoljub Jankovic told a press
conference that the Supreme Court has decided to put the electoral
panel's ruling on ice pending.
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the electoral commission is suspended until
the Supreme Court decides (which court should rule on the
matter)," Jankovic said, adding that the Supreme Court had no
deadline for a ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade electoral commission recognized Zajedno's triumph
in Belgrade last week, conceding over half of the city assembly's
seats to Zajedno, but it said its judgment was preliminary and
open to appeals.
</P>
<P>
Jankovic said both the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)
and the rightist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which is not in the
government but opposes the opposition coalition, have submitted
appeals to the Supreme Court over the commission's ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Zajedno coalition has staged nine weeks of street
demonstrations to protest over the annulment of its victories in
the municipal elections in Serbia. It has claimed victories in 14
major cities in the country and demanded that the election results
be fully reinstated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of opposition demonstrators, organized by
the Zajedno, rallied in central Belgrade again today, the 63rd day
of protests across Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Northern Cyprus Vow to Strengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel and visiting Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas signed a
joint declaration here today to show their unity in confronting
alleged military threat from the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Denktas arrived today for a three-day visit to Turkey to
discuss with Turkish leaders the Cypriot government's purchase of
Russian anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
The five-page strongly-worded statement lashed out at the
"continued intensive military build-up" by the Greek Cypriot side,
saying it threatens peace and stability for the whole island.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused the Cypriot and Greek governments of
establishing military cooperation to threaten northern
Cyprus and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey...will not let the security of the Turkish Cypriots
come under threat," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that any attack against northern
Cyprus would be considered as an attack against Turkey itself,
warning that any Greek-Greek Cypriot political and military joint
action would lead to reciprocal measures from Turkey and
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that unless the rights and equality of
the Turkish Cypriots were commonly recognized, a just and
lasting peace on the island would not be available.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and northern Cyprus also accused the European Union
(EU) of conducting talks with the Cypriot government on its
membership issue, warning that this kind of contact would only
drive Turkey and northern Cyprus into deep integration.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Denktas was expected to meet
Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, Deputy Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller as well as Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki
Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Cyprus has remained tense since Turkey
vowed to hit Cyprus' missiles if the Cyprus government continued
the arms program.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish forces
occupied and seized northern one-third of the island after a coup
by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Turkish Cypriots declared the northern island as
an independent "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is
only reconized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Government Gives War Order to Fight Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Zairean Prime Minister Kengo Wa
Dondo announced solemnly this evening on the Zairean National
Television that he has ordered the government forces to "conduct
war" against Tutsi rebels in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
"I gave today, in coordination with the chief of state
(President Mobutu Sese Seko), the order to our armed forces to
conduct war and to restore authority of the state (in the occupied
provinces," the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Dondo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this month, the Zairean government has
been preparing for what it calls "a thorough and devastating"
counter-offensive against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, AFP quoted Western sources in the Kivu region of eastern
Zaire as saying that no military operation has been launched so far.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that intensive military movements of the Zairean
government troops, led by General Mahele Lyoko, are going on in the
Kisangani, 500 kilometers west of Goma, where the headquarters of
the rebels are located.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Concede Differences Exist After Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The meeting between NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov today in Moscow "proceeded successfully," but
"different approaches exist on a range of issues," a joint
NATO-Russia statement received here said.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, Solana had five hours of talks with
Primakov at a secret venue in a bid to reassure Moscow about the
alliance's plans to admit new members from central and eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions will continue in order to reach a common
position... and a schedule for further work has been set up," the
agreed statement by Solana and Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
However, they conceded in the statement that "this will not be
an easy process but both sides will strive to make it a success."
</P>
<P>
Solana is believed to have offered Moscow some form of
permanent consultative forum between the former Cold War foes,
greater flexibility on arms control issues and more economic
assistance.
</P>
<P>
But experts say that this will not be enough for Russia since
it is demanding a structure giving it a say in all issues covering
its "vital interests."
</P>
<P>
Russia launched recently a new diplomatic offensive against the
alliance's enlargement plan, and President Boris Yeltsin has
ordered its Foreign Ministry to start drawing up a set of possible
responses to an enlarged NATO.
