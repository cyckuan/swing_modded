<HEADLINE> Japanese Bank Cautious on Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A week after the government reported an unexpected  
spurt in economic growth, Japan's central bank remained dour about 
the state of the economy, saying the recession had hit bottom but 
recovery was still uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's June assessment of the economy in a monthly  
report released Wednesday was largely unchanged from its last 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan's economy, at present, has stopped deteriorating, but  
clear signs of recovery have not been observed yet,'' the central 
bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the government announced that Japan's gross domestic  
product grew a robust 1.9 percent in the first quarter of the 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bank of Japan report highlighted persistent weak spots  
in economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	It said business fixed investment has ``basically been on a  
downtrend,'' although it added that ``there was a slight 
improvement in early 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Housing investment has been recovering, public works seem to be  
increasing, but the recovery in public consumption remains weak on 
the whole, the bank report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank repeated that ``it is still difficult to expect  
an immediate self-sustained recovery in private demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Full-scale restructuring by Japanese companies is expected to  
push down corporate investment and weigh on household spending by 
hurting employment and income conditions, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the bank said economic stimulus steps by the government  
and the central bank's monetary easing will continue to underpin 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the recovery of Asian economies ``is likely to have  
a positive effect on domestic production,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> Senator Offers Acreage in Land Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch is selling 118 acres in  
Ogden Canyon that became controversial when he helped win 
congressional approval for a federal land swap to benefit nearby 
Snowbasin Ski Area. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch listed the Lewis Grove tract as an asset on his latest  
financial disclosure released last week, but his partner says the 
land is under contract to sell for about $200,000 to another local 
landowner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Republican owns a 70 percent interest, meaning he  
should get $140,000 on the sale -- substantially higher than the 
$15,000 Hatch listed as the maximum value of his interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch bought the land with Walter Plumb III, a former law  
partner, as part of a larger tract in 1976. Plumb insisted there 
was never a connection between the property and expansion a dozen 
miles away at the ski resort, which is owned by wealthy campaign 
contributor Earl Holding. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 10 of the 118 acres can be developed and much of the rest  
is steep canyon slope, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't resort-oriented,'' Plumb said. ``For want of  
something to do with the land, we just kept it all these years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported on Hatch's land interest a year  
ago. Utah Democratic Party Chairwoman Meghan Holbrook suggested the 
senator had a conflict of interest because he had helped win 
congressional approval in 1996 for a land swap that will bring 
development to the base of Snowbasin. 
</P>
<P>
	The resort will be the site of the downhill and Super-G ski  
races during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. That became a basis for 
an order by Congress for a National Forest Service land swap. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Congress authorized the sale of 1,320 acres to  
Holding, the Forest Service says the 4,171 acres Holding offered in 
return -- land scattered throughout northern Utah -- are worth less 
in value. Holding has been asked to supplement his package. 
</P>
<P>
	Plumb said the 118-acre tract he and Hatch are selling is the  
``remnant'' of a parcel they sold a decade or more ago for 
condominium development near the mouth of the Ogden Canyon.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Faces Olympic Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) -- Already a longshot against renowned  
competition, Slovakia also is facing obstacles at home in its bid 
for the 2006 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	It's only the second bid for the country, which split peacefully  
from Czechoslovakia. The first bid, for the 2002 Olympics, was won 
by Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers are pushing the short distance between sporting  
events and the Olympic village at Poprad-Tatry -- the would-be venue 
for most of the events -- as well as the location of Slovakia in the 
heart of Europe and its rich history of winter sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, officials know that they face strong competition.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is expected that Sion (Switzerland) and Turin (Italy) will  
make it to the finals,'' Peter Chudy, general director of the 
Committee for the Candidacy of Olympic Winter Games Poprad-Tatry 
2006, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal that developed from Salt Lake's victory brought a  
change in the process, with the six bidders this time narrowed to 
two finalists before the International Olympic Committee votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the resistance among local environmentalists.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is great stupidity to put more money into an event that we  
have no chance of getting,'' Greenpeace director Lubica Trubiniova 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such criticism extends all the way to the government of Premier  
Mikulas Dzurinda, which decided to support the bid after it took 
power last October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are convinced, that the political support for the candidacy  
for the 2006 Winter Olympics is not the best way to make the 
country a legal state and improving Slovakia's image abroad,'' the 
protest sent to Dzurinda by the environmental organizations read. 
</P>
<P>
	Such protest was expected, considering the venue.  
</P>
<P>
	The High Tatras mountain range, topped by the 8,761-foot-high  
Gerlachovsky Stit, is a national park, an area of pristine beauty 
that has escaped the industrial blight scarring much of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the environmentalists, Slovak legislation does not  
allow for building new sports facilities in the national park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, the employees of the national park, have to defend the  
law,'' Tomas Vancura, director of the Tatras National Park 
Management, said. ``We have suggested that some of the sports 
should take place outside the national park, but the Olympic 
Committee said this would be against their main idea of having all 
sports at short distances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bid also has to fight a group of opinion makers in the IOC  
that say Slovakia should wait with grandiose plans such as staging 
an Olympics until after it gets itself out of the post-communist 
era and completes the move to a modern, free-market society . 
</P>
<P>
	Chudy said that the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and the  
resulting ban on travel by IOC members to bidding countries did not 
help Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only few members of the IOC know Slovakia,'' Chudy said. ``We  
think it is a handicap they cannot come here. It is hard to present 
something to them that they have never seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slovak organizers have projected that about $1.5 billion would  
be needed for the project. Few of the sports venues, hotels, 
infrastructure and other facilities are built, and even fewer of 
them meet international standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the problem would definitely come after the  
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will happen to the hotels, roads and other facilities?  
Who will take care of them?'' said Vancura, noting that the Tatras 
are nearly deserted for seven months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they built all of these modern-looking buildings, the  
Tatras will lose their beauty,'' Vancura said. ``If the Tatras will 
be so commercialized, we might lose a number of visitors. This 
could be fatal to the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Chudy and Poprad mayor Stefan Kubik believe the Olympics  
project would help the underdeveloped region, struggling with an 
unemployment rate of more than 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main goals are not the Olympics by themselves, but ... the  
attempt to make the Tatras a very attractive place for the 
tourists,'' Chudy said. 
</P>
<P>

Winter Olympics: 
</P>
<P>
	POPRAD-TATRY (Slovakia)  
</P>
<P>
	Population: 55,483.

at one venue (Jasna). 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Marlins Trade Craig Counsell to L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Infielder Craig Counsell, a World Series hero  
with the Florida Marlins in 1997, was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers on Tuesday for a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell, one of the last four Marlins who remained for their  
1997 World Series roster, lost his second-base job to Luis Castillo 
this year while batting just .152 with two RBIs in 37 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Counsell, 28, was designated for assignment last Friday, which  
meant he would have been placed on waivers if not traded within 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	He complained last week during a meeting with manager John Boles  
about his shrinking role with the Marlins, saying: ``I need a new 
start ... I need to go somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Counsell lacks power, with just one extra-base hit this  
year and four homers in 1998, he bats left-handed -- an area where 
the Dodgers have been shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles said Counsell had not been a problem even though he's made  
it clear since spring training that he wanted to play more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy everything's worked out for him,'' Boles said in  
Phoenix before the Marlins played the Arizona Diamondbacks Tuesday 
night. ``It seems like the Dodgers are going to be a good fit. 
We're just hoping he goes there and gets all the playing time he 
wants and deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins currently have just three holdovers from the 1997  
World Series roster -- Livan Hernandez, Cliff Floyd and Antonio 
Alfonseca. Alex Fernandez, who missed the series because of an 
injury, also remains with Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles designated outfielder Brent Cookson for assignment.  
Playing in three weekend games at Oakland, Cookson had one hit in 
five at bats after his contract was purchased from Albuquerque of 
the Pacific Coast League. At Triple-A Albuquerque, Cookson hit .335 
with a league-leading 18 homers and 48 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Broadcaster Sues Wrestling Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Kuwaiti broadcaster has sued the World  
Wrestling Federation over a promotional video that shows him being 
roughed up by a wrestler on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassam Al Othman, the host of ``Good Morning Kuwait,'' filed the  
suit Monday in federal court, accusing the federation of slurring 
all Arabic people by repeatedly showing the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The video is a promotion for the wrestler ``Vader,'' who grabbed  
Othman's tie and threatened him during a 1997 interview after 
Othman asked another wrestler whether the sport was faked, 
according to Othman's lawyer, Douglas Clark Hollmann of Annapolis, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Othman ``managed to pry Vader's hands off him and walked off the  
set,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation has used the clip to promote its shows ``with the  
apparent belief that a video of a large white American wrestler 
shaking an Arab person by his tie had commercial value in the 
market their product is sold,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Byrne, a spokesman for the wrestling organization, would not  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said use of the video is ``clearly outrageous and  
insulting'' to Othman and to Arabic people everywhere and in 
violation of the civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	The clip has been seen in Kuwait, causing Othman embarrassment,  
the lawsuit said. It said the video clip constitutes defamation.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Ownership of Waste Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what could be a break in the five-year  
stalemate over what to do with commercial nuclear waste, a leading 
Republican senator is offering a proposal that would keep the waste 
at reactor sites, but shift ownership to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, reflected a  
departure from the argument he and many other Republican senators 
have long made that the government should move the waste to a 
yet-to-be-built temporary storage facility in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was expected to be voted on Wednesday by the Senate  
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which Murkowski chairs. 
Murkowski said he believes he has enough support to get it 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
	But Murkowski also has conditions on the proposal, including  
that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, instead of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, set radiation exposure standards 
at a future permanent waste burial facility. The EPA has 
traditionally pushed for more stringent standards, including a 
requirement to protect groundwater that the nuclear industry claims 
is impossible to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over exposure standards was likely to pose a  
significant problem and could determine whether the Clinton 
administration will go along with the compromise, some 
congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the committee's ranking  
Democrat, will vote against Murkowski's proposal unless the EPA has 
jurisdiction over the exposure standards, an aide said yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson first proposed in February that  
the government accept title to the waste kept at nuclear plants 
around the country, but that the waste remain at the reactor sites 
until a permanent burial facility on Yucca Mountain in Nevada is 
approved and completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, which argues the government promised to assume  
responsibility for the waste, rejected the idea. A number of suits 
are being litigated over the government's failure to dispose of the 
more than 40,000 tons of highly radioactive used reactor fuel now 
kept at plants in 34 states. The waste is growing at the rate of 
2,000 tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has stymied Congress for more than five years.  
Repeated attempts to pass legislation requiring a temporary storage 
facility in Nevada have failed, largely because the White House has 
threatened to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has maintained that no temporary storage  
facility should be built because it would ease pressure to develop 
a permanent burial ground at Yucca Mountain, in the Nevada desert 
about 90 miles from Las Vegas. The Yucca site is being evaluated, 
but even if approved, it will not be ready to accept shipments 
until 2010, and possibly later. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski and Richardson discussed the waste issue at length  
during a recent trip to Alaska. Murkowski said he would prefer the 
waste be taken off utilities' hands as the government promised, but 
that there's no chance such legislation could pass and survive a 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been there and done that,'' said Murkowski in an  
interview, referring to repeated efforts to pass legislation to 
build a temporary storage facility in Nevada that fell short 
because of the veto threat.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Bill To Limit Y2K Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved legislation Tuesday that  
supporters said could save the economy from being crushed by 
lawsuits against companies in connection with Year 2000 computer 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House has threatened a veto, saying the bill gives  
too little protection to consumers, and the 62-37 vote was five 
short of the two-thirds that would be needed to override such a 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, authored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with input  
from several Democrats, attempts to head off what some estimate 
could be billions of dollars in lawsuits by encouraging mediation 
and giving companies 90 days to fix year 2000 computer problems 
before they can be taken to court. 
</P>
<P>
	It puts limits on class action lawsuits and tries to stifle the  
practice of targeting big rich companies for lawsuits by saying 
that in most cases defendants are responsible only for the share of 
the damage they cause. Punitive damage caps are set for small 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the Y2K act, we run the risk of starting a gold rush  
for prospecting lawyers in search of Y2K gold,'' said Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who worked with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., 
to make the legislation more consumer-friendly and acceptable to 
the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration says the bill is still unacceptable  
because it weakens the rights of consumers to recover losses and 
would discourage companies from fixing computers that misread the 
2000 date for the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Mulhern of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said  
she hoped the White House would stick to that position because the 
bill would not protect consumers and ``is clearly just a special 
interest giveaway to the high-tech and business lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the most vocal opponent of the  
legislation, said Congress was moving to ``do away with 200 years 
of liability law at the state level'' in the chase for political 
donations from the business and high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high-tech industry has also provided strong financial  
backing to President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, and the 
industry was expected to be heard from again as the bill goes to a 
House-Senate conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, said Harris Miller, president of the  
Information Technology Association of America, ``has been trying to 
take two girls to the same prom'' by trying to please both 
supporters and opponents of the bill. He said there was ``no doubt 
that President Clinton and Vice President Gore will be hearing a 
lot from the high-tech community and the small business 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republican leaders made a point of the importance of the  
legislation to high-tech companies by putting off the final vote 
from last Thursday to Tuesday, when Microsoft head Bill Gates and 
other high-tech executives would be on Capitol Hill for hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	A House Y2K litigation bill that passed last month is even more  
problematic to the White House, but Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., one of 
the authors of that bill, said a strong Senate vote could be a 
factor in the House accepting a final version closer to that 
written in the Senate. ``We have to be realistic about that,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill provides punitive damage caps to all defendants  
that make a good faith effort to fix computers, not just small 
companies. It makes it easier for a defendant to be eligible to pay 
only a proportional share of damages and has a loser-pays 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., issued a report finding  
that out of 43 federal programs identified by the administration as 
having ``high impact'' on citizens, only two -- Social Security and 
the National Weather Service -- have finished preparations for Jan. 
1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn, who for three years has been issuing report cards on  
federal agency response to the Y2K problem, said the government has 
done well in fixing systems, but individual programs, including 
food safety inspection, Medicare, child nutrition programs and air 
traffic control, have yet to fully coordinate with state and 
private partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn said he thought most of these programs would be  
Y2K-compliant by this fall. ``I am not a scaremonger.'' But he said 
that with less than 200 days to go before the millennium, ``the 
heat is on.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Britain's Inflation at 5-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A drop in the prices of seasonal and nonseasonal  
foods helped reduce Britain's inflation rate to 2.1 percent in May, 
its lowest level in almost five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate was last lower in October 1994, the Office of National  
Statistics said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation rate stood at 2.4 percent in April.  
</P>
<P>
	May's rate is well below the government's inflation target of  
2.5 percent, and is likely to raise hopes of a further cut in 
interest rates, already at a 22-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	After its monthly rate-setting meeting last week, the Bank of  
England's Monetary Policy Committee warned that inflation was 
falling below target rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower inflation rate was attributed to a drop in the prices  
of domestically produced fruit and vegetables, unaffected by 
shortages due to bad weather compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The prices of soft drinks, sweets, and chocolates also were  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England has predicted that inflation will be  
slightly below the government's targeted limit for much of the next 
two years.

<HEADLINE>  Coke Soft Drinks Banned in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Just as they're starting to recover  
from a food contamination scare over meat, butter and eggs, 
Europeans are being buffeted by fears of another product they 
thought they could trust -- Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the hospitalization of dozens of Belgians, Coke  
admitted Tuesday that it had problems at two of its plants -- one 
involving pesticide on the outside of cans, the other substandard 
carbonation gas. 
</P>
<P>
	While the world's largest soft drink maker contended that the  
products are still safe, the scare which prompted Belgium to ban 
all Coke soft drinks Monday spread to its neighbors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg said it was withdrawing all Coca-Cola drinks from its  
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's Dutch arm recalled all its products originating from  
Belgium and ordered its distributors in the Netherlands to stop any 
imports of Coca-Cola products from Belgian suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	France banned the sale of cans Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite and  
Fanta brands, saying the company's explanations of the 
contamination haven't been sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's admission follows a dioxin scare that spread across  
Europe in recent weeks. Most nations including the United States 
banned sales of chicken, pork, beef, eggs and meat products from 
Belgium after revelations the cancer-causing chemical had entered 
the food chain through animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	While Belgium began restocking shelves Friday with foods from  
farms the government deemed safe, bans on Belgian foods remain in 
effect in a number of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes the Coke scare.  
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Lenfant, general manager of Coca-Cola Belgium, said  
separate errors occurred at two Coca-Cola plants, one in Dunkirk, 
France, just across the Belgian border and the other in the 
northern Belgian city of Antwerp. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Antwerp plant, Lenfant said gas used to carbonate drinks  
about two weeks ago was ``of bad quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coca Cola said that only the taste was affected and that all of  
the products involved have been recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dunkirk, a pesticide used to treat some wooden crates in  
which the cans are placed leaked onto the underside of the cans. 
People who drank from these cans probably fell ill after inhaling 
the substance, Lenfant said. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted the pesticide had not leaked into drinks, but had  
been absorbed by an anticorrosive lacquer painted on the bottom of 
the cans. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola said ``independent analysis'' had determined the  
pesticide was safe, but said it was taking steps to eliminate the 
odor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta, Ga.-based company said both problems were confined  
products sold in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenfant refused to say how many cans and bottles were affected.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the publicity nightmare, corporate crisis consultant  
Alfred Geduldig said it was unlikely Coke will experience any 
long-lasting effects from the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to show themselves to be very consumer  
oriented,'' he predicted. ``No one manages their global image more 
than Coke,'' said Geduldig, of the New York-based firm Geduldig and 
Ferguson Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola's name recognition in this case worked against them,  
Geduldig added. If a similar incident happened to a small company 
that was selling a soft drink, it probably would not get into the 
papers and the bureaucracy probably wouldn't ban the product. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the Coca-Cola brand is so famous makes it a news  
story,'' he said. ``On the other hand, that's balanced out by the 
fact that Coca-Cola implies purity and quality and customer 
satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Belgium Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche banned  
all sales of Coke and other Coca-Cola brands such as Fanta, Sprite, 
Aquarius, Bonaqua or Minute Maid fruit juices. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came after a total of almost 50 people were  
hospitalized suffering from nausea after drinking Coke products. 
Eight remained in the hospital Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 10, 31 school children fell ill after drinking Coke,  
forcing the company to recall 2.5 million bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person hospitalized showed symptoms of hemolysis,  
an excessive destruction of red blood cells that causes anemia and 
vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the minister's decision,'' Lenfant said. But he  
stressed the company had withdrawn the contaminated products and 
was confident sales could soon return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenfant met with Van den Bossche Tuesday and said he felt he had  
convinced the minister the damage was contained. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am more optimistic tonight than I was this morning,''  
Lenfant told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Basketball, Hockey Dominate Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox learned the hard way that professional  
hockey -- even the game's championship series -- is a hard sell in 
prime-time. 
</P>
<P>
	The network had its lowest weekly rating last week since the  
summer of 1996, and could partly blame its two nights covering the 
National Hockey League's Stanley Cup finals series between Buffalo 
and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, NBC's prime-time schedule benefited from three games  
of the gripping National Basketball Association conference 
championship series between the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	The hockey series' opening game drew just over 5 million  
viewers, and the audience dipped to 4.6 million for Game 2. By 
contrast, the top-rated NBA game last week -- the Knicks' 
series-clinching win last Friday -- had 14.2 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox also suffers because its two most popular series, ``Ally  
McBeal'' and ``The X-Files,'' lose more viewers in repeats than 
typical prime-time shows. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS topped the broadcast networks last week with a 7.3 rating  
and 13 share. Two of its newsmagazines were the week's two 
most-watched shows: ``60 Minutes'' and the new Monday night edition 
of ``48 Hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had a 6.8 rating and 13 share, ABC was at 5.9 and 11, and  
Fox slumped to a 3.9 rating and 7 share. The WB had a 2.4 rating 
and 4 share, UPN had a 1.7 and 3 and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
	In cable, MTV was beaming over its telecast of the ``MTV Movie  
Awards,'' which saw a 64 percent increase over last year's show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition with a  
6.9 rating and 16 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 6.6 
rating and 16 share, and the ``CBS Evening News was at 5.5 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of June 7-13, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 10.7; ``48 Hours-Monday,'' CBS, 
10.3; ``NBA Playoff: Indiana at New York, Game 6,'' NBC, 10.2; 
``NBA Playoff: New York at Indiana, Game 5,'' NBC, 9.6; ``Touched 
By an Angel,'' CBS, 9.6; ``20/20-Wednesday,'' ABC, 9.4; ``CBS 
Tuesday Movie: Everything to Gain,'' CBS, 9.1; ``Everybody Loves 
Raymond,'' CBS, 9.1; ``NBA Playoffs: Indiana at New York, Game 4,'' 
NBC, 9.1; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 8.8.

<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Comedian Billy Crystal, former host of the  
Academy Awards, has turned his skills to a different audience: the 
Special Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be an honor to pay tribute and help celebrate the  
achievements of some very gifted athletes from around the world,'' 
Crystal said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is thrilling to take part in an event that plays such an  
important role in promoting pride and self-worth in some truly 
remarkable people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Olympics World Summer Games open June 26 at  
Carter-Finley Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Others expected to perform at the opening ceremonies are rock  
act Sugar Ray and gospel singer Kirk Franklin. Detroit Pistons 
basketball star Grant Hill also was expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The weeklong Special Olympics will feature 7,000 athletes from  
150 countries. The opening ceremony airs July 1 on ABC.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Air Difference With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said today that  
``everything changes'' after he officially kicks off his 
presidential campaign, even if that means publicly disagreeing with 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``If differences come up between the agenda I propose and that  
which the president is pursuing, that's different after tomorrow,'' 
he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore returned to his hometown of Carthage to formally kick off  
his campaign Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said his speech would be a heavily thematic address that  
provides some biographical material about the candidate and lays 
out broad outlines of his plans once in the White House. He will 
unveil a series of specific proposals later in the campaign trip, 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president holds a solid lead in polls and money raising  
over his only Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New 
Jersey. However, there is concern among Democrats about his ability 
to win in the general election. Polls show him trailing the top two 
Republican candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former 
American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference with Tennessee reporters, Gore said for the  
first time he would not hesitate to distinguish himself from 
Clinton if they disagree. The vice president said he has had many 
differences with Clinton since they were elected in 1992, but 
refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've kept it to myself because I took an oath under the  
Constitution to serve my country as vice president, which means to 
me helping him be the best president he can be, not arguing with 
the policies of the administration, but rather winning the 
arguments I can in the private debates,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, everything changes Wednesday morning when I become a  
candidate because I'll be describing my own vision for the future, 
and if that happens to be different from what the administration 
wants, I think that's understandable to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Gore's challenges is to run on the successful policies of  
the Clinton administration without being tarred by its scandals, 
including Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky that led to the 
president's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore indicated he would try to separate himself from Clinton the  
man while embracing Clinton the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I condemned the president for his behavior and I do so  
again,'' he said in response to a question about the Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remained steadfast for two reasons,'' he said. ``No. 1, he's  
my friend and my co-worker and I keep my commitments -- to my wife 
and to my family and to my job. That's a code of honor with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, he said he felt it was important ``for me to provide  
some stability and continuity and show up for work every day to 
keep things moving in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore flew to Tennessee, his aides tried to draw for reporters  
a contrast between the vice president and Bush, the Republican 
front-runner who has been criticized for failing to take specific 
stands on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not mention Bush, but said, ``I'm not going to just  
deal in platitudes. I'm going to deal with policies and specific 
choices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I'm simply trying to describe the choices I believe  
we should make to become a better country as we enter the 21st 
century. I'm going to tell people what's in my heart and what I 
believe our country needs to do,'' he said. 

</P>
<P>
	Gore looked trim and relaxed, wearing a polo shirt as he  
wandered to the back of his new Air Force plane. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as the understudy for six and a half years, Gore  
said he feels liberated by the idea of campaigning for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been eager to begin formulating the campaign and get out  
on the road and talk to people and listen to them,'' Gore said. 
``I've waited for this to begin for quite a while and I'm happy 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 50, joked that he hopes this campaign goes better than his  
disastrous 1988 effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment when I got out of the race in '88 that if  
I ran for president again, I'd run as an older candidate,'' Gore 
said with a chuckle. ``The record will reflect that I made that 
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Gore's biggest advantages is the power of incumbency. He  
will benefit from Clinton's political machine and has the White 
House political apparatus at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	One example of the power of incumbency: The White House Travel  
Office, staffed with employees paid by taxpayers, helps with many 
of the logistical aspects of this campaign trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he will be surrounded on stage Wednesday by his entire  
family, including his mother Pauline, 86, and his daughter Karenna 
Gore Schiff, 25, who is due to have the Gores' first grandchild in 
less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his father, the late Sen. Al Gore Sr., who died in December,  
he said, ``I wish that he could be there. He'll be there in 
spirit.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Mulled Dumping Microsoft Browser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly disclosed e-mail shows that top  
executives at America Online Inc. debated whether to stop 
distributing Microsoft's Internet software during their secret $10 
billion negotiations last fall to buy Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Chairman Steve Case wondered whether Microsoft might not  
retaliate ``given current antitrust attention'' if AOL switched its 
nearly 17 million subscribers to Netscape's browser, suggesting 
that the software giant might be intimidated into inaction by the 
government's legal case. 
</P>
<P>
	But AOL's president and chief operating officer, Robert Pittman,  
argued to Case that Microsoft was ``too strong to throw them out of 
the tent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days later in another e-mail, Case asked for an analysis of the  
deal's implications, ``including an analysis of what would happen 
if we got really aggressive and swapped out'' Microsoft's browser 
for Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Other documents, also disclosed Monday at Microsoft's antitrust  
trial, confirmed that Netscape currently is working to create for 
AOL subscribers a version of its browser software under the project 
name ``Raptor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL ultimately decided to continue distributing Microsoft's Web  
browser under a contract that runs until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden disclosed the e-mails and other  
documents while questioning David Colburn, senior vice president of 
business affairs for AOL. He was called by Microsoft as a hostile 
witness during this final phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unclear whether Warden persuaded U.S. District Judge  
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will issue the verdict in the case 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In private meetings with lawyers, Jackson said many of the  
e-mails and documents Colburn ``has never seen before and he 
doesn't know anything about,'' and called Colburn's testimony ``not 
very illuminating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rather surprised at the lack of personal knowledge he has  
about the things you're asking him, but he's demonstrated it,'' 
Jackson told Warden. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also asked Microsoft whether it wanted to call Case  
himself as one of its final witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may be the point man insofar as explicating what the  
transaction is all about,'' Jackson said, according to transcripts 
of the meeting made available today. ``I would be willing to let 
you substitute, if you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, the judge again mentioned Case.  
</P>
<P>
	``The best person to call, you don't want to call,'' the judge  
told Warden. ``And I don't blame you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The government can call him,'' Warden offered.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want him, either,'' the judge said.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Mike Murray said today the company has no  
plans to call Case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to resume Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Colburn maintained Monday that AOL never seriously considered  
dropping Microsoft's browser. He said Microsoft's offer in exchange 
-- to distribute AOL's software within Windows -- was too important 
to risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Case's job is to make sure the operations people are  
thinking of all the issues,'' said Colburn, who added that AOL 
``never really did an analysis of swapping out one browser for 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants to convince Jackson that AOL's purchase of  
Netscape, finalized earlier this year, illustrates there is 
sufficiently robust competition in the high-tech industry such that 
federal intervention isn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally wielded its  
influence as the maker of the dominant Windows operating system to 
try to crush Netscape, one of its top software rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft believes AOL could resuscitate Netscape's flagging  
popularity by distributing its software to millions. Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates wrote in a December e-mail to his employees 
that AOL will switch browsers ``sooner or later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warden called Gates' message ``a very interesting document'' and  
tried to introduce it as evidence, but the judge blocked him. The 
Justice Department's lead lawyer, David Boies, complained that the 
message was sent ``by Gates during the litigation, a self-serving 
statement.'' The Associated Press had obtained a copy of the 
message the day it was sent. 
</P>
<P>
	In his own e-mail last September, Case called AOL's choice of  
browsers a ``big, big issue to figure out'' but noted that if AOL 
distributed Netscape's browser, its share of the software market 
would climb to ``more than two-thirds share again!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My main point is, we shouldn't assume we need or want to  
maintain (Microsoft's) as primary browser,'' Case wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pittman warned Case not to underestimate the company that  
Gates built. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can hurt us if they think they have no other option,''  
said Pittman. ``I think we need to stay in business with them, 
create a need for them to need us.''

<HEADLINE> Student Dies 'a Hero' in Rockslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A Colorado college student  
refused to let go of the climbing rope that secured his friend 
despite a massive rockslide that crashed down over him. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Peter J. Terbush, 22, of Gunnison, Colo., was  
recovered Monday. Yosemite National Park officials said the student 
from Western State College died of head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Terbush was at the base the granite face of Glacier Point on  
Sunday, holding a rope that 20-year-old Kerry Pyle was using to 
ascend. Fellow climber Joe Kerwin, 21, stood beside Terbush. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the rocks began tumbling off the mountain. ``I saw enormous  
Volkswagen-sized boulders coming down and I just prayed we wouldn't 
be hit,'' Pyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerwin jumped out of the way, but Terbush held tight to the rope  
connecting his friend. He was still grasping it when the dust 
cleared and his body was found, Pyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had run, he probably would have ripped me off the rock  
and killed me,'' Pyle said. ``He's definitely a hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terbush's friends say he was an experienced third-generation  
climber who began rock climbing at age 11 with his father. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending several weeks with his friends at Yosemite,  
Terbush planned to visit his parents in South Africa. The group was 
on its final climb of the trip when the slide occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a huge rumbling sound, like a jet coming close,''  
said Abbie Kealey, 43, who was atop Glacier Point when the mountain 
face collapsed. ``We looked over and we saw a tiny plume of impact 
that rose up like a nuclear blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,300 guests and employees in 300 cabins were evacuated  
from Curry Village, then allowed to return several hours after the 
slide. Pyle, Kerwin and a third person who tried to help suffered 
only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Geological Survey geologist was expected to examine the  
area today.

<HEADLINE> Study: Patch Could Restore Sex Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Middle-aged women who said their sex drives  
were stuck in park after they underwent hysterectomies found that a 
testosterone-laced skin patch increased their libidos, according to 
a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Women naturally produce the male sex hormone, which controls  
sexual desire, but that stops when the ovaries are removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 43 percent of the 14 million women who have had  
hysterectomies reported sexual dysfunction after their surgeries -- 
a decrease in sex drive, a decrease in sexual pleasure, an 
inability to have an orgasm and sometimes depression,'' said the 
study's primary author, Dr. Glenn Braunstein of Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He presented the data Tuesday at The Endocrine Society's annual  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., which makes a testosterone patch for men  
experiencing sexual dysfunction, funded Braunstein's study to see 
whether similar patches would help women. 
</P>
<P>
	He studied 57 women for nine months. All had been on hormone  
replacement therapy for at least a year. The average age was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were given either two placebos; a placebo and a patch  
containing a normal level of testosterone usually found in a 
woman's body; or two patches containing high levels of 
testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	They changed the patches every three to four days.  
</P>
<P>
	More than half reported an increase in sexual desire with  
patches that contained normal (150 micrograms) and high levels (300 
micrograms) of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	Braunstein found that estrogen levels in the women remained the  
same, hot flashes did not increase and there was no acne or 
increased hair growth in unwanted areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is a broader study involving more women over a  
longer period of time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing really out there for women to treat this type  
of problem,'' Braunstein said, noting there are oral medications, 
creams and injections to deliver testosterone to the body, but they 
can cause side-effects like acne, liver abnormalities or moodiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Margaret Wierman, chairwoman of the meeting, warned that  
older women shouldn't interpret the findings as a way to increase 
their libido and cure depression through male hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely do not think we should think of this as a Viagra  
for women,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty in Severed-Hand Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- A man has been found guilty of beating to  
death his girlfriend, whose severed hand was found in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinicio Valverde, 32, was convicted yesterday of second-degree  
murder in the death of 20-year-old Beatriz Alvarez. Ms. Alvarez's 
body was found in June 1998 in a drainage ditch in Monsey. Both 
hands were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Valverde kept the severed hand ``to assist him in the practice  
of the occult,'' according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Police solved the crime after learning that Ms. Alvarez had  
lived with Valverde and that Valverde had wanted to break up with 
her. Blood was found on the floor and walls of his apartment, and a 
police dog helped authorities find the victim's right hand, which 
had been concealed in the ceiling of Valverde's closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alvarez's skull had been bashed in with a hammer, her hands  
were cut off with a hatchet and a knife, and her body was placed in 
a plastic bag and then burned in an attempt to conceal her 
identity.

<HEADLINE> IOC Accepts Less Lavish Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Royal treatment is out. So are lavish  
parties, receptions and ceremonies. Even the flowers and the food 
will be more modest. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the IOC will have to give up some of their accustomed  
luxuries at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and 2002 Winter 
Games in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee executive board on Tuesday  
agreed to cutbacks in the hospitality provided to IOC members 
during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts are a direct result of the Olympic corruption scandal  
which has tarnished the IOC and hampered the fund-raising efforts 
of Sydney and Salt Lake organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	While providing savings of millions of dollars, the reductions  
also are intended to help dispel the image of IOC members as 
pampered and privileged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important in terms of budget, but also important in terms  
of symbolism, for Sydney and the IOC,'' Sydney organizing committee 
president Michael Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC board agreed to several concessions at Sydney's request:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The opening ceremony of the IOC's general assembly will be  
scrapped. This is traditionally a formal affair attended by 
hundreds of guests and VIPs, with speeches and musical 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There will not be any social program for spouses and other  
guests of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	-- IOC members no longer will get free tickets to Olympic  
cultural events; they'll have to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sixty to 70 cars will be cut from the fleet provided for IOC  
members and other Olympic officials. While each IOC member will 
still get a designated car, those who hold other Olympic positions 
no longer will get a second one. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Food in VIP lounges will consist of ``more modest snacks --  
certainly not lobster,'' Australian Olympic Committee president 
John Coates said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Flowers in hotels and VIP lounges will be scaled back or  
eliminated, Coates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney chief executive Sandy Hollway said the cuts would save  
``several million dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight congratulated the IOC on accepting more frugal  
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been very sensitive both to our budgetary position and  
the general public mood about officials generally,'' he said. ``It 
was done in a very constructive way. There was no acrimony about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollway added: ``It would be wrong to have a picture of them as  
somehow adamant about maintaining privileges or high level of 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,  
also got commitments from the IOC for fewer perks. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch told him: ``We  
will be happy to remove any luxuries, any receptions, any dinners. 
Any way we can be helpful to you, we will take that action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake is looking to reduce costs as it struggles to meet its  
$1.4 billion budget in the wake of the vote-buying scandal stemming 
from the Utah capital's winning 2002 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	While the cost of putting up IOC members represents only a small  
fraction of the budget, Romney said the cuts must be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said $1 million already has been slashed from the $3.5  
million originally budgeted for IOC services. He said there is room 
for another $1 million in cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at plans we have for receptions and ceremonies  
that we can eliminate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Limousines and five-star hotels already have been ruled out. IOC  
members will travel in Chevy Blazers, driven by volunteers, and 
stay at a business-style hotel rather than a new luxury hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said talks were continuing  
on further cost-saving measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has never asked for any luxury,'' he said. ``The IOC  
is prepared to consider everything that is reasonable and doesn't 
affect the success of the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to reduce. We don't need parties, we don't  
need cocktails, we don't need dinners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another issue, the IOC deferred a final decision on Salt  
Lake's request to add seven new sports events, including skeleton 
(a head-first version of luge) and women's bobsled. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board expressed approval in principle, but said  
more time was needed to study whether all the events met the 
criteria for being on the Olympic program. A final decision now is 
expected at the IOC executive board meeting in Athens, Greece, in 
October.

<HEADLINE> Societe Generale Hikes Paribas Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The French bank Societe Generale, moving to thwart  
a hostile takeover bid, has sweetened its offer for investment bank 
Paribas in a move aimed at thwarting a hostile takeover bid from a 
third bank that wants them both. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris stock exchange regulator on Tuesday suspended for a  
day the shares of Societe Generale and Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe General said late Monday that it has offered Paribas  
shareholders 75 euros ($78.96) in cash for every eight Paribas 
shares held. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer is in addition to Societe Generale's share offer of  
five Societe Generale shares for every eight Paribas shares, worth 
more than $19 billion. The new offer is worth $1.58 billion if all 
shareholders accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale is also offering a second option to Paribas  
shareholders -- a revised all-stock offer of two Societe Generale 
shares for every three Paribas shares held. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale spokesman Michel Thibout said there is a  
ceiling for the second ``subsidiary'' offer of 30 percent of 
Paribas shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Societe Generale and Paribas are seeking to fight off  
hostile takeover bids from rival Banque Nationale de Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP's unsolicited $37 billion bid for both Societe Generale and  
Paribas were made March 10, a month after the two target banks had 
themselves announced a friendly merger to create SG Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	Were BNP to succeed, it would create the world's first $1  
trillion bank in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas have appealed the stock market  
regulator's decision to allow the BNP bid to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	A court decision is scheduled for June 17. If the appeal fails,  
it will be up to shareholders to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	Thibout said Monday that the third prong of the banks' attempt  
to fight off BNP will be an SG Paribas share buyback program worth 
$2.6 billion over 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The share buyback program will boost the return on equity for  
the new group's shareholders, Thibout said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thibout said the new offers, share-and-cash and all-share,  
represent a 12 percent and 10 percent improvement, respectively, 
over the initial offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to sweeten the offer followed overwhelming support  
for the SG Paribas project -- and demands for a cash offer as well 
as a share offer -- at shareholder meetings held a week ago by both 
Societe Generale and Paribas, according to Thibout. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that BNP may make a counter bid, but said BNP  
will have to make two new bids if it is win control of Societe 
Generale and Paribas. That, he added, would be ``very expensive.''

<HEADLINE> CMP Group Being Sold to N.Y. Utility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Hoping to create a leading player in the  
Northeast's energy-distribution industry, parent companies of New 
York and Maine-based electric companies announced their intentions 
Tuesday to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	CMP Group Inc. of Maine will be acquired by the Energy East  
Corp., parent company of New York State Electric &AMP; Gas Corp., if 
four state and federal regulatory agencies approve the transaction. 
The cash deal is valued at $957 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta-based CMP is the parent company of Central Maine Power  
Co., which serves more than 530,000 electric customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the merger would leave both utilities better  
positioned to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms call for Energy East to acquire all 32.4 million shares of  
CMP common stock for $29.50 cash. That is a hefty 43 percent higher 
than CMP's closing price of $20.62 1/2 on Monday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of CMP rose more than 28 percent in trading Tuesday,  
moving up $5.68 3/4 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
Energy East nudged up 6 1/4 cents to $26.31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will seek to minimize impact on workers through  
reduced hiring and attrition, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Flanagan will be chairman, president and  
chief executive of CMP Group and will become president of Energy 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is contingent upon approval of CMP Group shareholders  
and regulatory agencies including the Maine Public Utilities 
Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies anticipate that regulatory approvals can be  
obtained within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy East does business in New York, Massachusetts, Maine and  
New Hampshire. Its subsidiary, New York State Electric &AMP; Gas Corp., 
supplies and delivers electricity and natural gas to more than 1 
million customers across much of upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	CMP recently completed the sale of its electric generation  
plants to Florida-based FPL Energy for $846 million, ending nearly 
100 years of power production for the utility. 
</P>
<P>
	Wes von Schack, chairman, president and chief executive of  
Energy East, said the two companies will be better positioned to 
compete in a new era of deregulation and competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This combination is about growth and competition,'' said von  
Schack. ``CMP Group employees will benefit from being part of a 
company with the size and capabilities necessary to compete in the 
increasingly competitive energy industry.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Seeks Tougher Brady Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring gun regulation is ``too important to  
be decided by strong-arm lobbying tactics,'' President Clinton 
today renewed his call to the Republican Congress to toughen the 
Brady gun law, which he said has proved itself one of the nation's 
must effective anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the law with its system of background checks has  
blocked more than 400,000 illegal gun sales, two-thirds of which 
involved either convicted felons or people with a current felony 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heart and soul of America is on the line,'' Clinton said  
as he urged ordinary Americans to tell House members to follow the 
lead of the Senate and pass strengthened gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a White House Rose Garden ceremony with congressional  
supporters and the families of many victims of gun violence, 
Clinton said the National Rifle Association was ``wrong, wrong, 
wrong'' in arguing against the Brady bill six years ago and is 
equally wrong now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now in the aftermath of the terrible shootings at Littleton  
our nation is even more galvanized to act against violent crime,'' 
and to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles and criminals, 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again the gun lobby is resisting with all its might; once  
again we are battling not only for the safety of our families but 
the soundness of our democracy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Congress to resist ``procedural and tactical  
smokescreens to confuse everyone and confuse the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want us to honor the sacrifices of the people in Littleton,  
Colo., and not to turn our backs on them,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called on Congress to strengthen the Brady law by  
requiring background checks of people seeking to buy guns at gun 
shows and flea markets, by raising the national age of handgun 
ownership from 18 to 21 and by passing other measures he said would 
help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. 
</P>
<P>
	The president made public a new Justice Department report  
showing that in the first five years of the application of the law, 
a period in which a five-day waiting period was required, some 
312,000 handgun purchase applications were rejected under state or 
federal law, 66.3 percent of them for felony convictions or 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first five years, state and local authorities were  
allowed up to five days to check backgrounds of handgun buyers 
before the guns were sold, unless a state already had its own 
instant-check system. If a check took less than five days, no 
additional waiting was required. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department report said that in the first six months  
under a new instant-check background search system, an additional 
90,000 illegal gun sales were blocked. The new system gives law 
enforcement officials access to a more extensive set of records and 
applies to all firearms, not just handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4.1 million background checks have been conducted by  
the FBI and the states under the new instant-check system, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appeal to House Republicans followed by a day a  
similar call from Vice President Al Gore. Gore told the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors in New Orleans that new government studies 
show that one in four gun murders are committed by people 18, 19 or 
20.

	The president made public a new Justice Department report  
showing that in the first five years of the application of the law, 
a period in which a five-day waiting period was required, some 
312,000 handgun purchase applications were rejected under state or 
federal law, 66.3 percent of them for felony convictions or 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first five years, state and local authorities were  
allowed up to five days to check backgrounds of handgun buyers 
before the guns were sold, unless a state already had its own 
instant-check system. If a check took less than five days, no 
additional waiting was required. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department report said that in the first six months  
under a new instant-check background search system, an additional 
90,000 illegal gun sales were blocked. The new system gives law 
enforcement officials access to a more extensive set of records and 
applies to all firearms, not just handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4.1 million background checks have been conducted by  
the FBI and the states under the new instant-check system, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appeal to House Republicans followed by a day a  
similar call from Vice President Al Gore. Gore told the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors in New Orleans that new government studies 
show that one in four gun murders are committed by people 18, 19 or 
20.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Fall on Crop News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures tumbled Tuesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade after the government reported crops appear 
to have been unscathed by recent poor weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell on the U.S. Agriculture Department's report that  
winter wheat growing conditions improved last week, confounding 
expectations of a decline in crop ratings because of heavy rains 
that could foster disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also were pressured by excellent crop ratings.  
Some 70 percent of the nation's soybean crop -- which many expect to 
set another production record this year -- was in good to excellent 
condition, the USDA reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices for the nation's spring-planted crops also were  
affected by forecasts for milder temperatures and beneficial 
Midwest rains through this week, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.59 a bushel; July  
corn fell 4 cents to $2.14 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 2 3/4 cents to 
$1.20 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 8 1/4 cents to $4.63 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures fell sharply on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .55 cent to 64.67 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .55 cent to 77.87 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
fell 1.88 cents to 51.27 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 1.87 
cents to 42.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> NY's Lazio Likely To Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio said he expects to announce  
this summer that he will seek the Republican nomination for the 
Senate seat that Hillary Rodham Clinton is also eyeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio will probably face New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the  
GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you beat Rudy Giuliani is you run as the Republican,''  
the Long Island congressman said Tuesday, noting the mayor's 
crossing of party lines in 1994 to endorse Democratic Gov. Mario 
Cuomo over Republican George Pataki in a race won by Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani political adviser Bruce Teitelbaum declined to comment  
on Lazio's plans. The mayor formed a Senate exploratory committee 
in April but has yet to announce his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate race is for the seat being vacated next year by  
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mrs. Clinton plans to form an 
exploratory committee in early July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go into it as the underdog and I have a keen understanding  
of what that means,'' Lazio, 41, said. ``It's a David-and-Goliath 
race against two titans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio said he will campaign on the theme that both the first  
lady and the mayor want to use the Senate seat as a stepping stone 
to higher office and that the blunt Giuliani has the wrong 
temperament for the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Version of Nasdaq Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a new sign of the globalization of financial  
markets, the operator of the Nasdaq Stock Market and a Tokyo-based 
investment firm plan to launch a computerized stock market in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. and the  
high-tech investor Softbank Corp. said Tuesday they would spend a 
total of $5 million on the venture, which is to begin trading by 
the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers and sellers will initially be able to trade shares in  
Japanese startup companies and eventually the top 100 Nasdaq 
stocks, which include such technology bellwethers as Intel Corp. 
and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Japanese market will operate round-the-clock as ``a  
formula and a model for stock markets around the world,'' John 
Wall, president of Nasdaq-Amex International Ltd., said in a press 
conference in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments like that, however, prompt fears among small,  
independent brokers in the United States, who are already worried 
about how to cope with plans to extend trading hours at all the 
major U.S. stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the backdoor for extended trading hours, to which  
there will be tremendous opposition,'' said Alan Davidson, 
president of Zeus Securities Inc. in Jericho, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The overlap of trading hours between the Nasdaq and Japanese  
Nasdaq markets will mean many stocks can be traded for 21 hours a 
day, he said. To compete, Davidson said his firm will have to add 
personnel, support staff and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trend appears unstoppable.  
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq executives are still in talks with exchanges in London  
and Frankfurt, hoping to cut deals for similar stock trading 
initiatives in Europe's two biggest financial centers, according to 
Wall. He declined to elaborate, but acknowledged, ``Europe is 
moving at a fairly slow pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq officials also said Tuesday that existing plans with the  
Hong Kong Stock Exchange are on schedule, and they hope by year's 
end to have dual listings in Hong Kong for about a dozen companies 
now traded in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the new stock market will similar to Nasdaq in the  
United States. Unlike traditional exchanges which have a trading 
floor where brokers representing buyers and sellers haggle in 
person, Nasdaq traders place orders at computer screens which 
display buy and sell offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese Nasdaq market will focus on helping young  
technology-oriented firms raise capital by selling shares to 
investors, with less stringent listing requirements than more 
established companies must meet to be sold on the huge Tokyo Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The market is also intended to let Japanese investors put money  
into U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese cautiously keep just 4.8 percent of their wealth in  
stocks, but Wall predicted they will invest more if the market 
becomes an easier and cheaper place to put money. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Tokyo Stock Exchange said Tuesday he wasn't  
worried about competition from Nasdaq-Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe we will be up at bat against each other,''  
said Mitsuhida Yamaguchi, the Tokyo exchange's president, at a 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been struggling through its most serious recession  
since World War II, with analysts uncertain when things might 
bounce back in Asia's largest economy.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid CFO To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.'s chief financial officer  
intends to retire later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-largest drugstore chain said yesterday that  
Frank Bergonzi, 53, will step down as senior vice president and CFO 
in the fall after 29 years with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the company restated earnings for the fiscal  
year ended Feb. 27, decreasing net income to $143.7 million, or 54 
cents a share, from $158 million, or 60 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The revisions reflected how the company accounted for expenses  
related to recent acquisitions, store openings and the closing of 
smaller stores and distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Rite Aid spokeswoman, asked if Bergonzi had been asked to  
resign or if there was a connection between his departure and the 
company's recent earnings restatement, said the announcement 
``stands on its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bergonzi ``told us today he wants to retire,'' she said. ``The  
company will begin a search for a new CFO tomorrow, and more than 
likely, the new CFO will come from outside the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of Bergonzi's retirement was included in Rite  
Aid's release of its most recent quarterly earnings statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, citing a payoff from its program to expand and  
renovate its drug stores, reported Monday that earnings increased 
3.5 percent to $81 million, or 31 cents per share, for the quarter 
ended May 29 compared with $78.3 million, or 30 cents per share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid had revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter; an  
increase from $3 billion during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid has more than 4,000 store locations in 30 states.

<HEADLINE> Boy's School Suspension Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUDSON, Ohio (AP) -- School officials reversed the suspension of  
a 9-year-old boy for writing a fortune-cookie message considered 
threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	During a class assignment to write a fortune-cookie message that  
was positive and fun, Karl Bauman wrote: ``You will die with 
honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension was overturned Monday because Karl didn't receive  
written notification of the punishment, as required by state law, 
officials said. Karl served the two-day punishment last month, but 
now it will be removed from his record. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl's parents and the American Civil Liberties Union, had  
planned to appeal the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Bauman said her son thought his message was positive. She  
said he picked the phrase up from a computer game he plays that 
says: ``Congratulations. You have died an honorable death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Joseph Siegferth said Tuesday that the reversal  
was granted on a technicality and ``does not change or alter in any 
way the reason for suspension.''

<HEADLINE> Holy Land Evidence at Israel Shroud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Plant imprints and pollen found on the Shroud  
of Turin, revered by many as Jesus' burial shroud, support the 
premise that it originated in the Holy Land, two Israeli scientists 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the light of our findings, it is highly probable that the  
shroud did in fact come from this part of the world,'' said Avinoam 
Danin, a botany professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	The botanists did not address the issue of the age of the linen  
cloth, which was brought to France by a 14th-century crusader and 
has been enshrined since 1578 in a cathedral in Turin, Italy. About 
13 feet long and 3 feet wide, it bears the image of a man with 
wounds similar to those suffered by Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, scientists tested scraps of the shroud with Vatican  
approval and concluded it dated back to between 1260 and 1390. They 
can't explain how the image was made, and some experts have said 
contamination might have affected the carbon-14 dating tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The shroud also includes the images of some plants, and Danin  
identified one as the bean caper (Zygophyllum dumosum), which he 
said grows only in Israel, Jordan and Egypt's Sinai desert. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other plants whose images were found on the shroud were the  
Rock Rose (Cistus creticus) which grows throughout the Middle East; 
and the Goundelia tournefortii tumbleweed, believed by some 
Christians to be the material of the crown of thorns. 
</P>
<P>
	Traces of pollen taken from the shroud are from plants found in  
Israel and neighboring countries, including the bean caper and the 
tumbleweed appearing on the shroud, according to Uri Baruch, an 
expert on pollen at the Israel Antiquities Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Danin and Baruch both refused to discuss the authenticity of the  
shroud, but said their findings show that it was very probably from 
the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
	The flowers ``could have been picked up fresh in the fields. A  
few of the species could be found in the markets of Jerusalem in 
the spring,'' Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic Church has never claimed the cloth as a holy  
relic, but it has attracted pilgrims to Turin since the Middle 
Ages. 
</P>
<P>
	The shroud went on display in a bulletproof case for several  
weeks last year and will next go on view in 2000, for Holy Year 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II, who knelt in silent prayer before the cloth  
last year, urged scientists to do more testing of the linen.

<HEADLINE> Spurs, Knicks Set for NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs are impressed with the  
way the New York Knicks reached the NBA Finals despite a 
psychological face lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been incredible,'' Tim Duncan said Monday. ``They're a  
very resilient team. They just find ways to get it done. Everybody 
counts them out. They just prove everybody wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs and Knicks begin their best-of-7 championship series  
Wednesday night at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the top-seeded Spurs are 11-1 in the playoffs and swept  
the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers to reach the 
finals, San Antonio's players say they aren't overlooking the 
capabilities of the Knicks, the eighth-seeded team in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to respect them because they've come through the  
East and they've beaten all the teams in the East they needed to 
beat,'' Spurs center David Robinson said. ``Man, they are playing 
great basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York defeated the Indiana Pacers 4-2 to win the Eastern  
Conference finals, even after losing power forward Larry Johnson to 
a knee injury. The Knicks advanced to the NBA Finals for the first 
time since 1994, when New York lost to Houston in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who last won a title in 1973, are the first  
eighth-seeded team to make it to the finals. No other eighth-seeded 
team won more than one playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never played in the Eastern Conference finals, never done  
any of these things,'' the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell said. 
``Obviously I know what I'm playing for and what's at stake, but I 
just focus on this being the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have never been to the NBA Finals since joining the  
league in the late 1970s from the American Basketball Association. 
The Spurs are the first of the old ABA teams to make it this far. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs have been relatively injury-free this season,  
the Knicks have been anything but. Johnson suffered a sprained 
ligament in his right knee Friday. It will be a game-time decision 
as to whether he'll play Wednesday, the Knicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's there, obviously he's going to play a huge role. If  
not, we'll depend on other people,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson predicted he will play at some point in the series.  
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing will be missing from the Knicks lineup after  
suffering a torn Achilles' tendon in the Indiana series. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Johnson, containing Duncan and Robinson would be even  
more difficult for New York than it already is likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing Duncan and Robinson can do is cause so much foul  
trouble. The depth factor inside is critical for us,'' Van Gundy 
said Monday in New York before the team flew to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy and the Knicks players refuse to say if they'll depart  
from common strategy and use single-coverage rather than 
double-teams against Duncan and Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs and Knicks don't really know how they'll stack up  
against each other with their current lineups because they never 
faced each other this lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing with New York is they just formed their team  
in the playoffs,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``They are who 
they are now. The way they played against Indiana is who this team 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last meeting between San Antonio and New York was March 31,  
1998, at Madison Square Garden. The Spurs won that game by 17 
points largely because of injuries to Ewing and Chris Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio has been watching the Knicks' every move on  
television the past two weeks after defeating Portland in four 
games and getting a nearly 10-day layoff until the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the players. We've played against them,'' Robinson  
said. ``Just this combination we don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few days ago, the Spurs acted thrilled to have made it to  
the finals. On Monday, they were concentrating on the job at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks arrived in San Antonio on Monday to find a town  
virtually plastered with ``Go Spurs Go'' signs and cars tooling 
around with Spurs flags flapping from their antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks may be trying to ignore the distractions, but so are  
the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hear it,'' San Antonio guard Mario Elie said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I live by myself, so I've got to go out and get me some  
groceries now and then, and people ask me, `Are you going to win?' 
I'm rude. I don't answer them. I just get my food and leave,'' Elie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand these people around here are excited, but there's  
a lot of work to be done.''

<HEADLINE> HealthSouth Splits Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- HealthSouth Corp.'s directors have  
approved a plan to split the corporation's inpatient and outpatient 
operations into separate companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The move announced late Monday could enable the companies to  
expand faster by giving them a chance to raise their own capital 
and pursue their own acquisition opportunities, said HealthSouth 
founder Richard Scrushy. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the spin-off have not been settled, but Scrushy  
believes it will happen within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have two $2 billion-plus companies in Birmingham,'' he  
told The Birmingham News. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies would be HealthSouth Corp. for outpatient  
services and HealthSouth Hospital Corp. for inpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
	HealthSouth Corp. would operate more than 1,400 outpatient  
rehabilitation locations, surgery clinics and diagnostic centers in 
all 50 states and the United Kingdom. The other company would own 
inpatient rehab centers and a few acute-care hospitals. It would 
operate in 33 states, Puerto Rico and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The inpatient operation have taken in about $2.3 billion in  
revenue a year, just slightly ahead of the outpatient division. 
Profits are about equal. 
</P>
<P>
	HealthSouth's market value is $5.8 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Details about the plan were released after the market closed  
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrushy is likely to be chairman of both companies, but his role  
has not yet been decided. Both stocks will be listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange when the spin-off is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The change comes after a tough 1998 for HealthSouth, which saw  
stock fall sharply as analysts expressed fears that its growth was 
slowing. The company sold its home health care division and laid 
off workers.

<HEADLINE> Father Guilty of Killing Own Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELBYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A man was convicted today of lining up  
his three sons and the boys' half-sister and shooting them after he 
had told them they were going Christmas shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury deliberated one hour in finding Daryl Keith Holton guilty  
of four counts of first-degree murder. The trial immediately went 
into the sentencing phase. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is seeking the death penalty for the 36-year-old  
Holton. 
</P>
<P>
	The children thought they were going Christmas shopping when  
Holton picked them up on Nov. 30, 1997. Instead, they stopped by 
the auto body repair shop where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
	At the shop, 4-year-old Kayla, Crystle Holton's daughter by  
another man, wrote a letter asking Santa Claus to bring her a 
``Tickle Me Elmo'' doll for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, police said, Holton shot each child from the back with a  
Russian-made, semiautomatic assault weapon. The bodies of Kayla, 
Steven, 12; Eric, 6, and Brent, 10, were found stacked on top of 
one another, underneath a tarp. 
</P>
<P>
	Holton went looking for his former wife and her boyfriend but  
could not find them, police said, then turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, his lawyer argued that Holton was a caring  
father but severely depressed at the time of the slayings. Officers 
said he told them he was afraid he would never gain custody of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystle Holton said at the time of the shootings that she had  
kept the children away from him after filing a protective order 
because he was abusive.

<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Dolores Jimenez Alcantara, one of  
flamenco's leading singers, better known as ``La Nina de la 
Puebla'' (The Girl from Puebla), died Monday. She was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	She suffered a brain hemorrhage during a performance last  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer was given her stage name in recognition of her  
birthplace, Puebla de Cazalla, just outside Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Blind from childhood, Jimenez dedicated herself to music from  
her early years and in the 1960s and 1970s captured the hearts of 
flamenco artists and fans. Admired for her ability to sing in a 
wide range of flamenco styles, she was probably best known for 
popularizing the Spanish traditional song ``Los campanilleros'' 
(The Bell Ringers). 
</P>
<P>
	She was to have received Spain's Gold Medal for Fine Arts from  
King Juan Carlos next week.

Thursday. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, Grunfeld teamed with fellow German Jew and Nazi refugee

</P>
<P>
	The two men formed the New Trading Co., which changed its name

<P>
	Grunfeld became chairman of the firm when Warburg retired in

<HEADLINE> Heinz Profit Up Before Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H. J. Heinz Co.'s profit before a  
restructuring charge rose nearly 12 percent for its fourth quarter 
based on strong growth in its core products, including the 
company's signature ketchup brand. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported a profit before the charge of $219.4  
million or 60 cents a share, for the three months ended April 28 
compared to $196.2 million or 53 cents a share in the same quarter 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reported Tuesday exceeded the expectations of  
analysts surveyed by First Call, who predicted operating earnings 
of 59 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	But its stock price fell 68 3/4 cents a share to $48.87 1/2 in  
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Including $411.1 million in pre-tax restructuring charges, Heinz  
reported a $191.7 million loss, or 25 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales declined slightly to $2.47 billion from $2.48 billion a  
year ago due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and 
divestitures. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz said it sold 11 percent more ketchup in the fourth  
quarter, 6 percent more seafood and had higher sales at its weight 
loss clinics. Pet food sales fell 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Heinz reported income of $1.65 billion or $2.40 a  
share before charges compared to $1.52 billion or $2.15 a share a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	With charges, Heinz earned $474.3 million, or $1.29 a share in  
the latest year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year grew just under 1 percent to $9.29 billion  
compared to $9.21 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Four Dead in Ky. Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Ky. (AP) -- A University of Kentucky medical helicopter  
crashed on a rugged mountainside in eastern Kentucky shortly after 
taking off in thick fog, killing all four people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims in Monday night's crash were two pilots, a flight  
nurse and a paramedic, said Mary Margaret Colliver, a spokeswoman 
for the UK Hospital in Lexington. Their names were not immediately 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	No patients were aboard, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sikorsky S-76 helicopter had lifted off from the Jackson  
airport shortly after 10 p.m. on its way to Lexington, Colliver 
said. Airport officials later lost contact with the aircraft, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Breathitt County Constable J.C. Montgomery said there was thick  
fog in the area at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter was found on a rugged mountainside a few miles  
from Jackson, so badly wrecked that authorities had a difficult 
time identifying it, State Police Trooper Tim Mullins said. Thick 
smoke was still rising from the wreckage this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Coroner Gene Watts said two bodies were removed from the crash  
site overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have some bodies to get out,'' Watts said this  
morning. ``It was so dark up there last night it was hard to see 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jackson-based helicopter, leased from Petroleum Helicopters  
Inc., was one of two used by the hospital to transport patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators were expected to arrive at the crash site  
today, Mulling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is about 70 miles southeast of Lexington.

	Calling all Elvis fans and aficionados of roots rock 'n' roll:  
``Sunrise,'' an archival two-disc collection, features the King's 
recordings for Sam Philips' Sun Records from 1953 to 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	While the first disc reprises vintage Elvis singles (``Blue Moon  
of Kentucky,'' ``Milkcow Blues Boogie,'' ``Mystery Train,'' ``I'm 
Left, You're Right, She's Gone''), the second disc delivers rare 
alternate takes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most notably, ``Sunrise'' showcases eight previously unreleased  
Elvis recordings salvaged from well-worn acetate recordings, making 
this set an illuminating spin.

	``Through the Darkness'' (C2 / Columbia) -- D Generation  

</P>
<P>
	``Through the Darkness'' contains D Generation's best songs  
since they formed in 1991. D Gen's 1970s hard rock and punk shines 
with veteran producer Tony Visconti (Thin Lizzy, T-Rex) in 
contagious sing-alongs such as ``Helpless,'' ``Every Mother's 
Son,'' ``Hatred'' and the mini-classic ``Sick on the Radio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other cuts -- ``Rise &AMP; Fall,'' ``Good Ship Down,'' ``Only a  
Ghost,'' ``Sunday Secret Saints,'' ``Cornered'' -- recall musical 
forebears like Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, The Damned, The Dead 
Boys, Deep Purple, The Dictators, Social Distortion, and, of 
course, Iggy &AMP; the Stooges and The Ramones. D Generation, which has 
opened in concert for Kiss, reveals more inspirations in their 
tender cover of Neil Young's ``Don't Be Denied'' and on the hidden 
bonus track, ``Violent Love,'' a touching Rolling Stones-like 
ballad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the Darkness'' could very well be D Generation's  
``Appetite for Destruction'' because it's such a breakthrough hit 
monster. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	``Gedida'' (Beggars Banquet / Mantra) -- Natacha Atlas  

</P>
<P>
	Branching out from her work with trip-hop group Trans Global  
Underground, Natacha Atlas blends traditional Arabian music with 
contemporary dance beats on ``Gedida.'' Standout tracks, including 
``Agaba,'' ``Ezzay,'' ``Bastet'' and ``Mahlabeya,'' highlight 
Atlas' mystifying vocal range in multiple international tongues. 
The album's swirling sounds bring to mind a psychedelic belly 
dance, which could describe Altas' concert performances as well. 
``Gedida'' is spellbinding with its mix of old world backbone and 
new school rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``1965'' (Columbia) -- Afghan Whigs  

</P>
<P>
	Deep down, the Afghan Whigs are a soul band wrapped in  
alternative rock. The heart of their songs beat with the heat that 
Marvin Gaye stoked in ``Sexual Healing,'' and the connection is 
evident in the Whigs' concert performances where the band segues 
from rhythm and blues jams to their original songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``1965'' is all cream, from the strutting seduction of  
``Somethin' Hot'' to the flowing ballad ``Crazy.'' ``The Slide 
Song'' and ``66'' surrender sweetly, while ``Citi Soleil'' and 
``Neglekted'' burn slowly until they explode. 
</P>
<P>
	The Afghan Whigs have come a long way from 1990's scratchy ``Up  
in It'' LP through 1996's smooth ``Black Love'' album, which built 
the bridge to their arrival at ``1965.'' There's not a stray dog on 
this album, and even if there were, frontman Greg Dulli would pick 
it up and bring it on home.

<HEADLINE> Internet CEO Bares Chest on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Losing your shirt is usually the last thing  
you'd want to do in business, but that's exactly what the president 
of an Internet company did in an interview on CNBC Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a naked attempt to stir up publicity for his company, the  
head of online software vendor Beyond.com appeared stripped to the 
waist on CNBC's morning talk show ``Squawk Box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Breier, the chief executive of the company, said he was  
just trying to shake up the often staid world of financial news 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``CNBC is famous for framed talking heads bobbing on the  
screen,'' Breier said in an interview following his appearance. 
``We thought it was a neat twist to throw a little surprise on the 
CNBC viewers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hosts of the show certainly seemed surprised, even though  
the company had warned CNBC officials that Breier planned to appear 
wearing only boxer shorts during the satellite interview from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the hosts hadn't been fully briefed.  
</P>
<P>
	The bare-all appearance was in keeping with the company's ad  
campaign, which shows a guy so comfortable working from home that 
he walks around the house naked, to the chagrin of the neighbors 
and the package delivery man. 
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, CNBC host Joe Kernen covered his face and  
looked down at his desk to avoid looking at Breier, who grinned 
boyishly into the camera and held up the tiny microphone since he 
had no clothes on which to pin it. 
</P>
<P>
	By way of explanation, the clearly nonplussed Kernen borrowed a  
line from a Seinfeld episode, saying that ``my quota for naked men 
today is zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show's other hosts took Breier's buff appearance in stride.  
Anchor Mark Haines, peppered Breier with several questions and 
thanked him for the ``revealing'' interview. 
</P>
<P>
	While CNBC doesn't plan to make a habit of interviewing scantily  
clad CEOs, they didn't get too bent out of shape by Breier's stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't really control what CEOs wear or don't wear to  
interviews,'' network spokeswoman Martine Charles said. ``We 
concentrate on getting the best information for the investing 
audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breier may have caught a little wave of publicity with his  
appearance, but early indications are that other Internet 
executives will not be following suit with au naturel interviews 
any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Amazon.com chief Jeff Bezos would consider a similar  
tactic, company spokesman Bill Curry quipped: ``Barring 
developments, I am sure we will remain dot-clothed.''

<HEADLINE> Corpse Rides Subway For Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A passenger seemingly asleep aboard a packed  
rush-hour subway train was actually dead, possibly for as long as 
five hours, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the unidentified man, in his 40s, was on the uptown  
No. 1 train at least 20 stops Monday before passengers noticed he 
was unresponsive and alerted authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was removed at the 96th Street station in Manhattan's  
upper west side. 
</P>
<P>
	Subway regulars expressed little surprise at unwittingly sharing  
a busy train with a corpse. The man had been sitting upright, 
silent, with his eyes closed and head bowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know how many people sleep on the train during morning  
rush?'' rider Mario Licari said. ``Unless the guy slumps into me, I 
just leave him alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man carried no identification -- only 20 cents, a watch and a  
comb, police said. It was unknown where he boarded or how long the 
subway, which runs from Manhattan's southern tip to the Bronx, had 
been in service Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on a preliminary examination of the body, the man may have  
been dead up to five hours before being noticed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he appeared to have died of natural causes. An  
autopsy was pending.

<HEADLINE> Chicken Nuggets Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 480,000 pounds of chicken nuggets are  
being recalled by an Indiana company because they may contain an 
unlisted dairy product, the Agriculture Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Serenade Foods Inc. of Milford, Ind., recalled its Maple Leaf  
Farms brand of ``Crunchy Chicken Nuggets'' because they may contain 
whey, a dairy product and allergen that could trigger 
life-threatening reactions in people allergic to milk or milk 
proteins. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall applies to 10-ounce packages that bear ``Est.  
P-2375'' in the USDA mark of inspection. An identifying code 
number, ranging from 9001 to 9124, is embossed on the end panel 
above the opening strip of the product. All ``Crunchy Chicken 
Nuggets'' produced between Jan. 1 and May 4 were recalled. The 
products were distributed nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall was prompted by a consumer who complained to USDA  
officials after having an allergic reaction to the chicken nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about the recall should be directed to Serenade Foods  
at (219) 658-4121.

<HEADLINE> FCC Won't Seek Broadband Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As cable companies stand on the threshold of  
offering new communications services to consumers, the government 
should remain vigilant but avoid regulation, a top regulator says. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard in an  
eagerly anticipated pronouncement said Tuesday that competition 
alone should be enough to bring Americans cheap and lightning-quick 
Internet access, as well as new phone and cable television service. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard's comments before a cable industry meeting here came in  
the wake of a federal court ruling earlier this month in which a 
judge said municipalities in Oregon can demand that AT&AMP;T open its 
high-speed cable lines to rival Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do what you say you are going to do and embrace the  
openness of the Internet, this marketplace will explode and the 
entire country will benefit,'' Kennard said. ``We're going to be 
watching. We're not necessarily going to be regulating, but we will 
be watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon ruling could have precedent-setting ramifications on  
the way and speed in which Americans receive a new generation of 
digital and interactive communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies that have invested billions in laying  
``broadband'' lines capable of providing super-fast Internet 
service and handling phone calls have balked at the possibility of 
allowing slower-moving competitors such as MCIWorldCom and America 
Online to share the wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service providers say cable's refusal to let them share  
lines effectively stifles competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard suggested the judge in Oregon erred in allowing  
local governments to control the regulatory and technical standards 
that would determine rates for and access to broadband. He urged 
cable companies to come up with their own national standards -- 
while the FCC stands by as an interested party. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Information Superhighway will not work if there are 30,000  
different technical standards or 30,000 different regulatory 
structures for broadband,'' he said. ``The market would be rocked 
with uncertainty. Investment would be stymied. Consumers would be 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks echoed those a day earlier by AT&AMP;T chief executive  
C. Michael Armstrong, who said the free market would foster 
competition more effectively than regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard's remarks were welcomed by big cable companies at the  
National Cable Television Association convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like the idea of open and free,'' said Jerry Wolfer, senior  
vice president for engineering at MediaOne cable company. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you start controlling (the industry) right up front, it's  
going to take a hard road to hoe to convince anyone to make such 
deep-pocket investments when some other guy will benefit from them 
for practically free,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-based OpenNet Coalition -- a group of more than 70  
Internet providers -- predicted, however, that it would be just a 
matter of time before the FCC would be forced to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read this speech to say he's handing the cable industry a  
lot of rope and is expecting them to open up their wires on their 
own,'' said Greg Simon, co-director of the group. ``He doesn't 
support 30,000 local statutes, but I believe the federal government 
is eventually going to have to guarantee open access so local 
communities don't have to.''

<HEADLINE> Rosa Parks Honored by Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hailed by lawmakers as the mother of civil  
rights, Rosa Parks was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal 
today, the highest civilian award given by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks, 86, was lauded by the House and Senate leadership  
and President Clinton for an act of defiance more than four decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 1, 1955, the seamstress, tired after a day's work in  
Montgomery, Ala., refused to give up her seat to a white man on a 
segregated city bus and was arrested for her defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Her arrest set off a lengthy bus boycott by thousands of blacks  
-- led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., then a local minister. 
The boycott lasted about a year until the Supreme Court declared 
Montgomery's bus segregation law unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the mother of the civil rights movement,'' said Rep.  
Julia Carson, D-Ind., who pushed for the legislation granting the 
Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Parks, who now lives in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a celebration of the life of Rosa Parks, who is  
receiving the honor while she can still see it,'' Carson said of 
Mrs. Parks, who appeared frail and had to be helped to her feet 
from her wheelchair, sometimes steadying herself on the arm of 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God that when your time came, you were not afraid,''  
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said at the Capitol 
Rotunda ceremony. ``You had courage, and you sat down for all of 
America and all of America's freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional lawmakers gave Mrs. Parks an artist's drawing of  
the medal, which is not yet finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank you,'' she said in a low, halting voice, adding that  
she accepted the award for a ``free people'' and for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The gratitude went both ways.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thank you for what you have done,'' Clinton told Mrs. Parks.  
</P>
<P>
	``She sat, anchored to that seat, as Dr. King said, by the  
accumulated indignities of days gone by and the countless 
aspirations of generations yet unborn,'' the president said. ``Rosa 
Parks said, 'I didn't get on that bus to get arrested; I got on 
that bus to go home.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was only 9 when Mrs. Parks refused to  
stand up. He and his friends ``couldn't figure out anything we 
could do since we couldn't even vote. So we began to sit on the 
back of the bus when we got on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks action cost her the seamstress job and prompted  
harassment and threats to her family. So she moved to Detroit in 
1957. She joined the staff of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1965 
and worked there until retiring in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Mrs. Parks co-founded a nonprofit group, the Rosa and  
Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, to help young people 
in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	A guest at Clinton's State of the Union address in January, Mrs.  
Parks has received numerous awards, including the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation awarding her the Congressional Gold Medal was  
approved by the Senate without dissent April 19. The House voted 
424-1 for it the next day. The only ``no'' vote was cast by Rep. 
Ron Paul, R-Texas, who said he opposes spending government money on 
such awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers initially used the Congressional Gold Medal to honor  
military leaders but began using it during the 20th century to 
recognize excellence in a range of fields. More than 320 medals 
have been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was given to George Washington in 1776 for ``wise and  
spirited conduct'' during the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent honorees include Frank Sinatra, Mother Teresa and South  
African President Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> New Computer Virus Could Linger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The latest outbreak of a computer virus began  
easing today as infected companies carefully reconnected e-mail and 
file-sharing links the bug used to spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts warned, however, that due to its crafty design, the  
Worm.Explore.Zip virus could remain a serious risk for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after the epidemic took hold, anti-virus software  
companies reported that the torrent of calls to customer-help lines 
was starting to ebb. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Thursday to Monday, we had four times the normal rate of  
calls. Today it looks like about twice the normal rate,'' said 
Sandi Morgenthaler, a spokeswoman for Trend Micro. 
</P>
<P>
	A government-chartered anti-virus team at Carnegie Mellon  
University reported that firsthand accounts of outbreaks were 
leveling off. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the virus can lay dormant in an unused machine, the  
aftershocks could extend well beyond the days it took to contain 
the Melissa and Chernobyl viruses earlier this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have a week go by with only two reports and then we may  
get 20,'' said Mark Zajicek, a member of Carnegie Mellon's Computer 
Emergency Response Team, or CERT. ``We expect to continue to 
receive reports of this for days and weeks to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, CERT revealed that in addition to spreading under the  
guise of a friendly e-mail -- tricking the recipient into opening an 
attached file -- the new virus was taking advantage of the 
information-sharing pathways that co-workers set up to use files 
stored on each other's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a computer is infected, the virus hunts across network  
links that share files created by popular programs, including 
Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus struck tens of thousands of machines at major  
corporations during the first days of the outbreak.

<HEADLINE> Austin Powers Scores at Box Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Swinging '60s-era spy Austin Powers is  
proving to be just the man for the '90s -- and the box office, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' the James Bond spoof  
starring Mike Myers as the groovy man of mystery, knocked ``Star 
Wars: Episode One -- The Phantom Menace'' from the No. 1 spot over 
the weekend with an estimated opening of $54.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The comedy grossed more in its first three days than the first  
``Austin Powers'' film did in its entire run. 
</P>
<P>
	It also became the top-opening comedy (beating last year's ``The  
Waterboy,'' which debuted with $39.4 million); the top June opener 
(beating ``Batman Forever'' with $52.7 million in 1995) and the No. 
2 non-holiday weekend opener (behind only ``The Phantom Menace'' 
with $64.8 million last month). The figures are not adjusted for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In passing the ``Star Wars'' prequel, ``Austin Powers'' has  
become an unlikely blockbuster, going from an inside joke Myers 
thought few people would understand to a cultural phenomenon. 
Powers' favorite phrases -- ``Oh, behave!'' and ``Yeah, baby! 
Yeah!'' -- have exploded into America's cultural vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're stunned, it's almost surreal,'' said Mike Deluca,  
president of production at New Line Cinema, the film's distributor. 
``I think in a weird way, the culture caught up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first film, ``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,''  
opened to a tepid $9.5 million in May 1997. Audiences just didn't 
seem to understand the humor about a '60s spy with bad teeth, a 
bearskin rug of chest hair and an infatuation all things sexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin's character was inspired by Meyer's late father, a  
Liverpool-born salesman who loved British comedy. The comedian 
feared his creation ``was the consummate in-joke,'' Myers said 
before the film premiered. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, audiences warmed to Austin, and the $16  
million-budget film hung on through the summer to gross a 
profitable $53.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it went to video, where it was -- as Austin would say --  
smashing. The tape dominated the 1998 video charts, with $44 
million in sales. It spawned Austin theme parties in colleges and 
homes, and set the groundwork for the sequel, with double the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	New Line raised expectations with a movie trailer that poked fun  
at the hype around ``The Phantom Menace.'' The ads told moviegoers 
that if they see just one film this summer, go to ``Star Wars.'' If 
they see two films, the ads said, check out ``Austin Powers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the studio launched a huge promotional push using carefully  
selected partners that adopted Myers' brand of gentle, 
double-entendre-laced humor. 
</P>
<P>
	One Virgin Atlantic Airways billboard has Austin beaming, ``Five  
times a day? Yeah, baby!'' to promote the airline's frequent 
flights to London. And a Heineken commercial had a masseuse 
admiring Austin's ``Heiney'' -- his beer, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	The sequel, which sends Austin back to 1969 to reclaim his  
stolen mojo, was given an enviable release date. It followed 
``Phantom,'' but came before July's special effects-laden ``Wild 
Wild West,'' and with no other comedies in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's success is due to ``Mike's spirit of joy and his love  
of this music and this culture, this color and movement,'' said its 
director, Jay Roach. ``People young and old want to share it with 
him, and that's his genius.''

<HEADLINE> Education Dept. Oversight Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Education Department forgave nearly $4  
million in student loans over a 2 1/2-year period for borrowers who 
were supposed to be dead but turned out to be quite alive, 
according to an internal audit. 
</P>
<P>
	During the same span, the department also forgave more than $73  
million in loans for people who claimed permanent disability but 
continued to work, said the audit, which has just been given to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really a clear case of no oversight,'' said Sharon  
Pinkerton, spokeswoman for Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., who oversees 
domestic issues on the House Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mica has scheduled a hearing for Thursday, asking why the  
department hasn't required original or certified copies of death 
certificates for discharges of loans based on a borrower's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really does not pass the straight-face test,'' Pinkerton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Woods, who oversees the Education Department's loan  
division, ordered the audit. He said the department will use wage 
garnishment and other means to recover the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand this is real money,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods also said the department has also created new safeguards  
against ``a few dishonest individuals spoiling this program for the 
millions who depend on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law provides for loan discharges when the borrower  
either dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled. The 
Education Department defines a disability as a condition which 
prevents a person from working and earning money, or attending 
school, because of an injury or illness that is expected to 
continue indefinitely or result in death. 
</P>
<P>
	The process to claim such a disability is in the hands of the  
borrower. It requires the borrower to send a form completed and 
signed by a doctor to the lender or guaranty agency. The process 
did not require proof that a qualified doctor actually saw the 
patient or proof the borrower was not working. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Education Department's request, its auditing arm studied  
loan-discharge records from July 1, 1994, through December 31, 
1996. It matched all borrowers who received disability and death 
discharges with the Social Security Administration's master earning 
records for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 708 borrowers found to be drawing wages after  
receiving education loan death discharges. The audit found that 
lenders processing discharges relied on copies, not originals, of a 
death certificate or other proof of death such as a doctor's 
statement or an insurance bill, which might be acceptable proof 
under a given state's law. 
</P>
<P>
	One man apparently altered his twin brother's death certificate  
-- changing the name and Social Security number to match his own -- 
in an attempt to get his loans discharged. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit also found that 9,798 individual borrowers -- or 23  
percent of the borrowers claiming disability -- were earning wages 
after their loans were forgiven. Eighty-one of them earned more 
than $50,000 in 1997 after receiving a disability discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the auditors learned that more than 6,800 new loans  
totaling almost $20 million have been awarded to borrowers who 
returned to school after previously having loans totaling nearly 
$11.5 million discharged due to total and permanent disability. 
</P>
<P>
	One borrower who earned more than $57,000 in 1997 received a  
disability discharge of almost $11,000 in September 1994 for 
``chronic low back pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other borrowers earned wages in excess of $20,000 each after  
having loans discharged for total and permanent disabilities of 
memory loss, reconstruction of right ankle, carpal tunnel syndrome, 
depression, fractured elbow and severe headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department acknowleged that it hadn't given  
lenders enough guidance on how to process loan discharges. 
Effective immediately, it said it would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Reinstate all loans found to be improperly discharged.  
</P>
<P>
	--Revise the disability form to require the doctor's professional  
license number and office telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
	--Direct lenders to investigate loan forgiveness claims if  
there's suspicion that the borrower has given conflicting 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	--Use the Social Security Administration's nationwide system of  
tracking records of disabled individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The department administers two types of loans for student  
borrowers: direct loans and loans made by private lenders that are 
subsidized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The report analyzed records for the subsidized program but  
noted, ``Similar procedures are followed for determining borrower 
eligibility for (federal direct loans).''

<HEADLINE> Phil Jackson To Coach Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Zen is about to meet Showtime.  
</P>
<P>
	Phil Jackson, who guided Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to  
six titles with an enlightened, offbeat approach to basketball, 
agreed in principle Tuesday to coach the Los Angeles Lakers next 
season, team spokesman John Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reportedly offered Jackson a four-year, $24 million  
deal. Barring a last-minute snag in contract details, he is 
expected to be introduced at a press conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who returned from an Alaskan fishing trip Monday,  
already was scheduled to be in Los Angeles on Wednesday and 
Thursday to campaign for presidential candidate Bill Bradley, a 
former NBA star who played alongside Jackson with the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	A family member who answered the phone at Jackson's home in  
Montana said the coach wasn't available for comment. Neither Todd 
Musburger, Jackson's agent. nor Jerry West, the Lakers' vice 
president, returned calls from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who would replace interim coach Kurt Rambis, was also  
sought by the New Jersey Nets and, to a lesser degree, the Knicks 
before they made their improbable run to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers fired Del Harris 12 games into last season and  
promoted Rambis from his job as an assistant. They were swept in 
the playoffs for the second year in a row, losing in the second 
round to San Antonio. Utah swept the Lakers in the Western 
Conference finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers had indicated that Rambis might keep the job, but  
owner Jerry Buss instead decided to spend millions more to hire the 
high-profile Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to inheriting three of the NBA's marquee players,  
Shaquille O'Neal, Glen Rice and Kobe Bryant, Jackson also will be 
working in a sleek new building. The Lakers have left the aging 
Forum and will play in the new Staples Arena next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's former home, of course, was the United Center, where  
Jordan worked his magic alongside Scottie Pippen and the Bulls 
became one of the greatest teams in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Jackson, who took this season off, had a 545-193  
record in nine seasons at Chicago and was 111-41 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	An ex-hippie and Zen master, he was a motivator, mediator and  
basketball maestro all in one, able to blend the egos and diverse 
talents of players like Jordan, Pippen and Dennis Rodman. He was 
able to relate to his players with, as Jordan refers to it, ``that 
Zen Buddhism stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His style is unique. Not many NBA coaches go to bookstores and  
pick out books for each of their players. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NBA  
regular-season (.738) and playoff (.730) history. He was coach of 
the year in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson spent 11 of his 13 NBA seasons as a player with the  
Knicks, and was a member of their 1973 championship team. He worked 
his way up through the coaching ranks, leading the Albany Patroons 
of the CBA for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the Bulls' coach on July 10, 1989, replacing the fired  
Doug Collins for whom he had been an assistant the previous two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers began talking to Musburger, last week. Team  
executives West and Mitch Kupchak spoke by telephone to Jackson on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	West and Kupchak were favorably impressed after talking with  
Jackson about the Lakers players and the team's future, and left it 
up to him to decide whether he wanted the job. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's skills as a mediator will be put to the test in Los  
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Although O'Neal is the NBA's dominant center, he has yet to win  
a championship in his six years in the league. Bryant is a 
freelancer by nature, a flashy player who can do almost everything 
but create open shots for his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	There also has been friction between O'Neal, 26, and Bryant, 20.  
</P>
<P>
	After Harris was fired and the Lakers' experiment with Rodman  
ended, the Lakers provided O'Neal with the outside shooter he 
thought was the missing link for a title, Glenn Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles traded Eddie Jones, a former All-Star and an  
outstanding defender, and Elden Campbell to Charlotte to get Rice. 
But Rice, coming off elbow surgery, was mostly disappointing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Group Wins Brit Defense Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A consortium led by the U.S. defense contractor  
Raytheon has won a $1.3 billion contract for an airborne radar 
system for the British military, the Ministry of Defense said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Airborne Stand-Off Radar System -- or ASTOR -- will  
be developed, produced and serviced by the Raytheon consortium, all 
of the contract value will be with British firms and its project 
management team will be located here, Defense Secretary George 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will create or sustain 2,500 jobs in Britain, Robertson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team headed by Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., includes  
Short Brothers, Motorola U.K. Ltd., GEC Marconi Avionics and 
Marshall SV. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big deal for the armed forces, a big deal for the  
companies concerned and a big deal for the United Kingdom,'' 
Robertson said. ``And it is good for all three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new radar system, mounted on high-flying jets, will operate  
at long distance to give detailed information about forces' 
infrastructure and vehicle movements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accurate and timely information is crucial to the success of  
the armed forces in a wide range of operations, from humanitarian 
aid missions to major conflict,'' Robertson said. ``If I did not 
know that before the recent campaign in Kosovo, I certainly know 
that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The radar systems are expected to enter service in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Opening Business Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- After eight years as an engineer for a  
Swiss elevator maker, Jin Jin worried his career had stalled. Like 
many ambitious young Chinese, he decided to get an MBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese universities are opening business schools, but they seem  
to lack a global perspective. And Jin, 31, skipped the expensive 
option of school abroad. Instead, he signed up for an experiment 
aimed at creating a new kind of elite Chinese executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Jin enrolled at the China-Europe International Business School  
in Shanghai. The 5-year-old program founded by a European group of 
business schools teaches in English with faculty from top U.S. and 
European universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jin says that after graduation, his company -- Schindler  
Elevator Co. -- is thinking about putting him in charge of training 
for its 4,500 employees in East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without this MBA, I would have no chance to get a job like  
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CEIBS is leading a wave of Western business schools that are  
pouring into China. They are finding an eager audience of students 
who until recently had little chance to learn the elite skills 
demanded by international employers and top Chinese firms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and  
a U.S. consortium of 26 Jesuit colleges launched separate MBA 
programs with Chinese universities. The Arizona-based Thunderbird 
American Graduate School of International Management started 
courses on its own in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	Their arrival is a small revolution in Chinese education, an  
area largely untouched by modernizing reforms that have swept the 
rest of society. In a global economy that rewards creativity and 
hands-on skills, China's schools still stress old-fashioned 
memorization and theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're viewed as an experiment in trying to develop the kind of  
business education that China is going to need in the next 
century,'' said William A. Fischer, the American president of 
CEIBS, which graduated 221 MBA students this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Applications to both foreign programs and China's own 56  
business schools tripled this year to 30,000, according to the 
Ministry of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	Such booming demand highlights a shift in outlook for China's  
elite. Where students a decade ago in the Tiananmen Square 
pro-democracy era were in the streets protesting the communist 
system's failings, most today are out chasing opportunities in 
private business. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign programs say they get up to six applicants for every  
opening. Tuition is a fraction of Western levels but steep for 
China -- from $6,800 at CEIBS to $10,950 at Thunderbird. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, tuition is paid by their employers -- foreign ventures  
trying to reduce reliance on costly expatriate managers or Chinese 
state firms struggling to modernize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have probably better students here than any of our  
schools'' in the United States, said Ron Anton, dean of the Jesuit 
program in Beijing, which has 70 students. Its U.S. backers include 
Boston College and Loyola-Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
	The group behind CEIBS includes business schools INSEAD in  
France and Switzerland's IMD. Their Chinese partner is Shanghai's 
Jiaotong University, alma mater of President Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
	CEIBS is subsidized by the European Union as a way to compete  
with the United States for influence in China by nurturing ties to 
future Chinese business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, then-EU President Jacques Santer called it Europe's  
most successful program in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its joint-venture status, the school's foreign directors  
have retained autonomy in picking students, courses and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The faculty is a rotating group drawn from INSEAD, IMD and other  
European schools, as well as MIT, Dartmouth and Columbia in the 
United States. CEIBS plans to move this year from the red- brick 
Jiaotong campus into its own $18 million facility in Shanghai's 
Pudong financial district. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of lectures, CEIBS uses role-playing games and debates to  
instill independent thinking and assertiveness -- traits frowned on 
by traditional Chinese education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing we do is to change the way our  
students think,'' said Zhang Guohua, a vice president of CEIBS and 
a former Jiaotong professor. 
</P>
<P>
	CEIBS also offers Chinese students an unusual chance for  
internships abroad. This year, a handful went to London, Germany 
and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet nothing sets CEIBS and other foreign programs apart more  
than language, a deeply nationalistic issue in China. Teaching in 
English highlights their break with tradition and appeals to 
students with international goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have come here if it were taught in Mandarin,''  
said Yu Chenyue, a 25-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
	Students say their goal is more opportunity, not just bigger  
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hou Yunfu, 34, was sent to CEIBS by the Daqing Geophysics  
Institute, part of China's state oil industry. He plans to go back 
to his modestly paid job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to compete with BP Amoco and Exxon,'' Hou said.

<HEADLINE> Day-Trading Not As Easy As Imagined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tales of the swashbuckling world of Internet  
day-trading in stocks can be a real test of faith for any 
old-fashioned investor in mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	You're too conservative! You're missing out! When are you going  
to hook up to the future, where all the real money is? 
</P>
<P>
	Our purpose here today is to shore up your resolve a little, to  
provide the personal finance equivalent of a cold shower you can 
take whenever visions of instant wealth on the Web get your pulse 
beating too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what you read or hear, it is never easy to earn a  
sustained, worthwhile payoff as a short-term trader in any 
financial marketplace. You need skill, steady nerves and a big 
bankroll -- and even in a bull market, the house odds work against 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term rise of the stock market, supported by economic  
growth, is a powerful force benefiting people who keep their money 
invested over time in funds or individual stocks. Once you start 
buying in the morning and selling in the afternoon, you are no 
longer riding this current, but trying to catch individual waves 
one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading is also a much more expensive game than buy-and-hold  
investing. Yes, commissions on each transaction are much lower on 
most World Wide Web sites than they used to be in a conventional 
brokerage account. If you pay only $29 or $19 or even $9 to buy 
today, and the same amount to sell tomorrow, the stock may need to 
rise only slightly to get you your commission back. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the more you trade, the faster the fees add up. To  
compound the problem, commissions aren't the only cost of trading. 
Each time you buy or sell, you also are faced with the challenge of 
getting the best possible price. 
</P>
<P>
	So you have to worry about whether the firm or system through  
which you operate provides the best possible ``execution,'' in Wall 
Street parlance. Often, you also have to contend with the 
``spread'' imposed by the broker or dealer who acts as a so-called 
market-maker in a stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Suppose you pick a stock where the spread is normally a quarter  
of a point. You put in your buy order yesterday, when the last 
reported price was $20, and you hit the sell button today, when the 
last reported price was $20.50. 
</P>
<P>
	When the going price yesterday was $20, chances are the dealer  
was offering to buy at 19 7/8 and sell at 20 1/8. So you wound up paying 
$20.125. When the going price today was $20.50, chances are the 
dealer was offering to buy at 20 3/8 and sell at 20 5/8. So you wound up 
receiving $20.375. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouch! Your profit per share, before taking commissions into  
account, was 25 cents, not 50 cents -- half what a casual observer 
might have thought was there to be had. 
</P>
<P>
	When the market goes against you, and the stock falls to $19.50  
instead of climbing to $20.50, the spread expands your loss. So, on 
what looks like about the same-sized move in a stock's price, you 
can lose three times as much as you might have made. 
</P>
<P>
	We haven't even mentioned taxes. Tax rates on short-term trading  
profits, which are treated as ordinary income, are generally higher 
than those on long-term gains from investments held for more than a 
year, which have a maximum rate of 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps most troublesome of all, in short-term trading you may  
easily lose the protection of diversification. If your investments 
aren't diversified, one misstep in a stock that tanks can wipe out 
the gains from many winning moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Surely, you may say, some people are getting rich in this game!  
A few people are good enough, and a few others get lucky enough, at 
trading to make a big score -- nowhere near as many, though, as the 
popular myths about day-trading would have you believe. 
</P>
<P>
	In any risk-taking venture, never underestimate your fellow  
humans' ability to exaggerate their success, not just in what they 
tell others but in the pictures they paint for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund managers are criticized all the time for their inability as  
a group to beat the market averages. Before you set out to 
day-trade, ask yourself what qualifications you have to succeed 
where many professionals can't.

<HEADLINE> Beltran, Febles Top AL Rookies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- It was Carlos Beltran's reaction to a  
bad play that first caught Minnesota manager Tom Kelly's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Beltran had looked bad while making the last out of an inning.  
The 22-year-old rookie was completely fooled on a pitch. But 
instead of sulking or losing his focus, he made a marvelous play 
just a few minutes later, robbing Marty Cordova of a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really looks like he can play,'' Kelly said. ``He made a  
terrific catch on Cordova's ball. That was after he made an easy 
out, too, which makes it more special. When you see a player make 
the last out, sort of a broken-bat dribbler, then go out in the 
field and make a neat play, that's pretty impressive. He also looks 
like he has a nice left-handed swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little did Kelly know that two months later, Beltran would be  
running neck-and-neck with second baseman Carlos Febles, the other 
half of the Royals' ``Dos Carlos'' tandem, for the lead among AL 
rookies in almost every offensive category. 
</P>
<P>
	Week-to-week, game-to-game, first one and then the other Carlos  
looks like the one the Royals should push for rookie of the year 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Febles, a 23-year-old native of the Dominican Republic, has been  
spectacular defensively, flashing the range, quickness and ability 
fans remember from a young Frank White. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he stays around, I think he'll be better than I was,''  
White, a nine-time winner of the Gold Glove who now coaches first 
base for the Royals, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beltran, a 22-year-old switch-hitter, leads AL rookies in most  
offensive categories. Trailing him in second place is his buddy 
from their minor league days, Febles. Fans dubbed the pair ``Don 
Carlos'' about the time they vaulted to the big leagues last 
September from Double-A Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a doubt, they are the most exciting rookies the Royals  
have had since Bo Jackson in 1987. Many are comparing them with the 
Jim Rice-Fred Lynn duo that electrified the Boston Red Sox as 
rookie sensations more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scouts and the development people need to be given some  
credit,'' manager Tony Muser said. ``It was their tutoring and 
their teaching and disciplining that got them so far so fast. I'm 
just going to try to continue what they've done, to keep them 
getting better and better and not getting complacent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Tuesday night's game at Baltimore, Beltran led AL  
rookies in batting average (.294), home runs (10), RBIs (48), 
multihit games (20), runs scored (44), hits (79), total bases 
(125), doubles (14), stolen bases (12) and extra-base hits (25). 
</P>
<P>
	Febles was second in average (.286), RBIs (27), multihit games  
(15), runs (36), hits (60), total bases (98), doubles (13), stolen 
bases (10), and extra-base hits (23). Febles leads AL rookies in 
triples (five), slugging percentage (.467) and on-base percentage 
(.369). Beltran is third in on-base percentage (.330) and second in 
slugging percentage (.465.) 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of them, there's no question about it,'' Muser said.  
``I think this city has caught on. I think they appreciate what 
these kids have done. But we have a long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muser was worried last September that he might be promoting the  
two ahead of their time. So he sat down and had a talk with each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked both of them, `Do you think you're big league players?  
Do you think you can handle it on a big league level? Look me in 
the eye. Can you play in the big leagues?''' 
</P>
<P>
	They looked him in the eye and spoke with the naive confidence  
of the young and talented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him, `Yeah, I'm ready to play. I think I'm ready,'''  
Beltran said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Doc Goes From IVs to PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the new TNT film ``Pirates of Silicon  
Valley,'' Noah Wyle is ungroomed, arrogant and generally 
unappealing. 
</P>
<P>
	An irresistible opportunity, says the actor, whose portrayal of  
Apple Computer Inc. magnate Steve Jobs is a sharp departure from 
the idealistic, fresh-faced physician Wyle plays on ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he immediately jumped at the project, which chronicles  
the rise of Jobs and fellow computer empire builder Bill Gates of 
Microsoft Corp. Anthony Michael Hall plays Gates in the film 
debuting 8 p.m. EDT Sunday (June 20) on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyle initially ignored the script, citing his preoccupation with  
``ER.'' Then the ``Pirates'' producers tried a different tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sent over a documentary that aired on PBS a couple years  
ago, 'The Triumph of the Nerds.' I popped it in the VCR, really on 
a whim to see what the guy looked like, and I was bowled over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first clip of Jobs is in 1984, and he's standing on a  
stage at a stockholders' convention, introducing the Macintosh. He 
turns it on, and there's this gasp and thunderous applause ... and 
this smile just comes across his face. It was such a hodgepodge of 
everybody's technology, but one man was on that stage taking 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned to my fiancee (make-up artist Tracy Warbin) and said,  
'If I don't play this guy, I'm gonna kick myself for the rest of my 
life,' '' Wyle recounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Given his tender age -- 28 -- it could have been a long and  
bruising session. But Wyle's thoughtful approach to his career 
makes such a scenario unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	In his off-''ER'' hours, Wyle has avoided rushing into quickie  
TV movies or silly big-screen fare. Instead, he's leaned toward 
independent films like the family drama ``The Myth of 
Fingerprints.'' He's also been in local stage productions, 
including ``The 24th Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Myth of Fingerprints,'' part of the 1997 Sundance Film  
Festival, intrigued him because its script contained silences that 
seemed as eloquent as any dialogue, Wyle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming from a family dynamic where silence was almost a weapon  
if you used it properly, I got excited about trying to show a 
family that did that and have it be interesting,'' said Wyle, who 
grew up with six siblings in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' offered the vibrant part of Jobs,  
who is portrayed as a sometimes-heartless visionary working to 
create a brave new high-tech world. It also, Wyle said, was a smart 
exploration of a pivotal period. 
</P>
<P>
	``This story leapt off the page because I couldn't believe no  
one had done it before,'' Wyle said. ``On the surface, it's a great 
American fable about how the largest accumulation of wealth in the 
history of mankind was obtained, and who got stepped over, stepped 
on, stabbed in the back in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``But underneath, you see the origins of a revolution that we're  
still feeling reverberations from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, impeccably dressed in a blue blazer and slacks and  
unerringly polite during an interview to promote ``Pirates,'' 
actually has more to talk about than his latest project. 
</P>
<P>
	His summer vacation is devoted in part to a venture that's close  
to his heart: his Blank Theatre Co., which sponsors a young 
playwrights' festival. He helps fund it somewhat improbably, 
serving as spokesman for a Maalox campaign celebrating American 
heroes and donating his fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The theater, run by Wyle and Daniel Henning, culls 10 plays from  
nationwide submissions, brings the authors to Los Angeles and 
stages their works. Wyle usually joins the cast of one production. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the more rewarding things we do,'' Wyle said.  
</P>
<P>
	For fiscal rewards there's ``ER,'' which enters its sixth season  
on NBC this fall, has consistently ranked as TV's top-rated drama 
and has allowed its stars to reap multimillion-dollar salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	All that hasn't kept the cast intact. Sherry Stringfield checked  
out early, George Clooney hung up his stethoscope last season to 
intern as a movie star and Julianna Margulies leaves in 2000. Wyle, 
however, says he is staying put as Dr. John Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the show started, no one knew what to expect. Then, when  
it became immensely popular, the natural progression was to see it 
as a stepping stone to somewhere else,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just came around to the fact this isn't so much a  
springboard as it is a great experience; why not sit with it as 
long as it will run. It's never gonna happen to us again. None of 
us are going to do a television series with this kind of impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a young man, I've got plenty of time to explore other  
parts and roles. ... If the writing stays as consistently strong as 
it's been and the people on the set are as passionate as they are, 
I have no reason to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

	WHEN ROYALS WED: As we breathlessly await the June 19 wedding of

<HEADLINE> La. GOP Chairman Fires Top Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The chairman of Louisiana's Republican  
Party fired top staff and changed the locks on its headquarters, 
and other leaders will consider a no-confidence vote against him, 
the vice chairman says. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the chairman is intent on self-destruction, we don't want  
the party to go down with him,'' vice chairman Dianne Christopher 
said Monday. A meeting was set for this evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Becky Miller, executive director of the party, said state  
chairman Mike Francis did not give her or her chief assistant any 
reason for firing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disappointed but not surprised,'' she said. ``These are  
not honorable people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The party has been split for years between traditional GOP  
members and the more conservative Christian Coalition wing, which 
supports Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman already was on the hot seat after Saturday's State  
Central Committee meeting. Critics said he improperly engineered 
approval of a plan for first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	An overwhelming majority of the party's executive committee had  
recommended an Internet election plan, but it was rejected after 
Francis called a vote despite the fact that dozens of 
Internet-balloting proponents had walked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis ruled that enough people remained to vote, even though  
it was clear that wasn't so, said Christopher, who was among 
committee members considering a lawsuit over the vote. She said a 
special meeting was called to deal with Francis' ``irrational 
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had proposed allowing voters to cast their ballots from  
computers set up in the homes of volunteers throughout the state. A 
company called VoteHere.net had offered to pay for the cost of 
setting up the Internet ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis did not return repeated calls to his home and office  
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee still must approve any state  
plan to hold a caucus before Iowa, which traditionally votes first. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Louisiana held a caucus before Iowa, but most  
candidates shunned Louisiana because they worried about offending 
Iowa Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Wins World Handball Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Sweden won the World Handball Championship  
gold-medal game Tuesday, beating Russia 25-24 behind six-goal 
performances by Stefan Lovgren and Pierre Thorsson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good time, we have team spirit, we watch opera  
together and we work together,'' Swedish coach Bengt Joahnsson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have as many good scorers as Russia, but they (the  
Swedish players) have a good head. They are motivated and that is 
the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ljubomir Eranjes added five goals for the Swedes, who rallied  
from a 14-12 halftime deficit against the defending champion 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorsson gave Sweden, the European champion, a 17-16 lead with a  
powerful shot seven minutes into the second half. The Swedes opened 
a four-goal margin at 22-18 with four straight goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, which got six goals from Alexambre Toutchkine and five  
from Igor Lavrov, cut it to one goal a number of times, but was 
unable to pull even. Lavrov made a 27-foot shot in the last second 
as the whistle blew. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden also won titles in 1954, 1958 and 1990.  
</P>
<P>
	In the third-place game, Yugoslavia beat Spain 27-24.

<HEADLINE> Georgia To Honor Oliver Hardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARLEM, Ga. (AP) -- Oliver Hardy's hometown is planning a museum  
to pay tribute to its most famous native son. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Shirley Tankersley said the town 20 miles west of Augusta  
will use a $10,000 state grant to turn its post office into the 
Oliver Hardy Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The project will have to wait until the Postal Service's lease  
on the building expires in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need it to house all the memorabilia we have,'' Ms.  
Tankersley said. ``We have boxes of it. We have people come in here 
almost every day asking us what we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy was born in Harlem in 1892 and died in 1957. He starred  
with Stan Laurel in classic film comedies that include ``Flying 
Deuces'' and ``Sons of the Desert.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Defensive Lapses Key to Stars' Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- All it took was a couple of big mistakes  
for the previously shiny Dallas Stars to lose some luster in the 
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo Sabres took advantage of some suddenly inept Stars  
and evened the best-of-7 series at two games each with a 2-1 
victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	On the flip side of a sparkling performance by a Buffalo team  
that had looked ready for some golf after losing two games in a 
row, the second at home, the Stars coughed up the puck, took some 
bad penalties and failed to jump on opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres scored two unassisted goals against a Dallas defense  
that had smothered them in Game 3 so effectively that Buffalo 
managed only a dozen shots in that 2-1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time the Dallas `D' backfired, and normally reliable  
defenseman Craig Ludwig got burned -- twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig, on the ice with Shawn Chambers at the time, was nowhere  
to be found when Sabres speedy wing Geoff Sanderson broke away in 
the first period. Sanderson froze goaltender Ed Belfour with a fake 
slap shot and steered the puck around the prone goalie for a 1-0 
lead at 8:09. 
</P>
<P>
	Jere Lehtinen tied it two minutes later before another miscue,  
this one a glaring blooper by Ludwig, handed the Sabres the 
game-winner in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig flubbed a clearing attempt right in front of his own net,  
fell down in an attempt to stop the shot by Buffalo's Dixon Ward 
and wound up screening Belfour. Ward easily potted the goal for a 
2-1 lead at 7:37 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig was looking for Chambers when he found Ward.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to throw it over to Shawn, and it bounced  
right off the top of my stick, and he just shot it over me,'' 
Ludwig said. ``Eddie didn't have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour was the only bright Star. He made the save of the series  
with just over four minutes left in the second period. Miroslav 
Satan, who led the Sabres in the regular season and was looking for 
his first goal of the series, threaded the puck behind Belfour and 
went to the other side to try to tap it in. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour fell and shoved the stick in front of the shot. He also  
stopped Satan's low bid from the slot with two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nieuwendyk, the Stars' offensive leader, went into the  
penalty box to start the third period. The Sabres left it up to 
goalie Dominik Hasek (30 saves) in the third after its onslaught of 
the first 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got our energy going,'' Ward said.

	Strong Earthquake Rocks Mexico City  
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A large earthquake shook Mexico City and a  
swath of central Mexico today, damaging buildings and sending 
thousands fleeing into the streets as buildings swayed. The quake 
had a preliminary magnitude of 6.7, the National Seismological 
Service said. It occurred at 4:41 p.m. EDT and was centered near 
Huajuapan de Leon, about 125 miles southeast of Mexico City. 
Television stations reported that some buildings were damaged in 
Puebla, about 60 miles east of Mexico City, and there were 
unconfirmed reports of injuries there. There was no immediate 
report of major damage or of injuries in the capital.

	U.S. Sending Aircraft to Korea  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States dispatched additional  
aircraft today to patrol the Yellow Sea, where a confrontation 
between vessels from the Koreas led to the sinking of a North 
Korean warship. Additional U.S. ships or other resources may also 
be sent to the region. The incident culminated a week-long, high 
seas standoff but Clinton administration officials said the 
situation appeared to be easing, noting that North Korean vessels 
were heading north. An estimated 30 North Korean sailors are 
believed to have died in the sinking, and there were injuries on 
both sides. Five North Korean vessels were said to have been badly 
damaged.

	Church Calls for Milosevic To Quit

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Serbian Orthodox Church today  
called for President Slobodan Milosevic to resign. The emotional 
and religious significance of Kosovo, which has some of the 
church's holiest buildings, lends weight to its call for Milosevic 
to step down. Appealing to ``every sensible person,'' the church 
said: ``We demand that the current president of the country and his 
government resign in the interest of the people and their 
salvation.'' The church does not have the power to force his 
removal.

spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba demanded Kabila stop bombing rebel-held 
towns, free political prisoners, allow political parties to operate 
freely, disarm Rwandan, Ugandan and Burundian rebels allied with 
him and end attacks on ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Cease-fire talks are

Gold Medal today, the highest civilian award given by Congress. 
Mrs. Parks, 86, was lauded by the House and Senate leadership and 
President Clinton for an act of defiance in 1955. The seamstress, 
tired after a day's work in Montgomery, Ala., refused to give up 
her seat to a white man on a segregated city bus. Her arrest set 
off a bus boycott by thousands of blacks that lasted until about a 
year later when the Supreme Court declared Montgomery's bus 
segregation law unconstitutional.

cancer dramatically, a study found. The three-year study of 7,705 
women found a 76 percent lower risk of breast cancer among those 
taking raloxifene compared with those given a placebo. In the 
study, 5,129 post-menopausal women younger than 81 received 
raloxifene daily, while 2,576 got a dummy pill. Thirteen cases of 
breast cancer were diagnosed among the women on raloxifene; 27

	After nearly a year of deliberation, Lucasfilm Ltd. has been  
granted the right to develop 23 acres of coveted San Francisco land 
at the former Presidio Army base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presidio Trust, a congressionally appointed committee that  
oversees the land's transition from a former military base to a 
self-sufficient park and office site, made the announcement Monday.

<P>
	The site will be known as the Letterman Digital Arts Center and  
will house part of Lucas' film and technology empire, including 
Industrial Light &AMP; Magic, LucasArts Entertainment Company and the 
THX Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas and the trust next begin lease negotiations. If both sides  
broker a deal, Lucas could take over the lease in October, after a

<HEADLINE> US Open Course Offers Different Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Check out the fairways, so ample and  
inviting that they no longer look as narrow as a hiking trail. 
Check out the rough, only 3 inches high and so sparse in spots that 
a search party isn't required to find the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Check out the calendar.  
</P>
<P>
	Is this really the third week in June? Is this really the U.S.  
Open? 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course is playing a little more friendly than I  
thought it would,'' Tiger Woods said Tuesday. ``I thought the rough 
would be higher, the fairways narrower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who didn't?  
</P>
<P>
	After all, the U.S. Open has a reputation of being so difficult  
that it borders on unfair. The rough is supposed to be deep enough 
to cover shoe laces. The fairways should require players to walk 
single file. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember last year at The Olympic Club, where balls that landed  
in the middle of the fairway actually broke toward the rough and 
didn't stop until they got there? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the USGA recognized the fact that they made a mistake  
last year,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or perhaps the USGA figured it could leave Pinehurst No. 2 the  
way Donald Ross designed it 92 years ago and still get what it 
wants -- the toughest test in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinehurst might not look like Olympic or Congressional, Oakmont  
or Oakland Hills or Oak Hill. The 99th U.S. Open, which begins 
Thursday, instead offers a different test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rough is deep, but not as deep as past U.S. Opens off the  
edge of the fairway,'' Mark O'Meara said. ``There's going to be 
times you might be able to advance your ball, maybe get it on a 
green. In past U.S. Opens, it was usually a sand wedge out. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think the whole key is going to be, once again,  
management of your game, hanging in there, fighting and just 
staying patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are always words to live by at a U.S. Open.  
</P>
<P>
	Then again, so is the message that Colin Montgomerie's caddie  
offered during a practice round Tuesday in occasional rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The middle of the green is a good target.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said that 18 times today,'' Montgomerie said. ``You've got  
to be patient. If you start attacking these greens, you're in 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Pinehurst No. 2 lacks in ankle-deep rough and country-lane  
fairways, it makes up for with some of the most devilish greens the 
players will see all year. They not only have severe contours, 
similar to Augusta National, but the edges slope away to hollows 
that could open up all sorts of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal is one of the few players  
who feels comfortable with a sand wedge. Woods is relying a lot on 
his 3-wood, while Montgomerie prefers to use a putter off the 
tightly mowed grass around the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 3-wood or a 5-wood for a 10-yard shot doesn't make sense to  
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie isn't about to argue about the setup, not in the  
tournament he has nearly won three times since 1992 and has become 
his favorite major of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it wasn't what he was expecting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised to find the fairways a little more generous  
than normal,'' he said. ``But the reason we call them generous is 
because they're not 23 yards (wide). Just because they're 28 yards 
does not mean they're wide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And just because the rough isn't as clumpy will not necessarily  
make playing out of it any easier. The rough was trimmed by 1 inch 
last week when USGA officials tossed a couple of balls in the rough 
and found that 3 inches was ample. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief agronomist Tim Moraghan said the purpose was to give  
players a decent chance to go for the greens, ``and see what 
happens from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval was not deceived by the appearance of Pinehurst.  
Playing his first practice round with tape around his burned right 
thumb and forefinger, Duval found that he could still hit a 6-iron 
from the rough to the green. He's just not sure that's the smart 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the players a false sense of security that you can  
advance it onto the green,'' Duval said. ``And it looks to me the 
reasoning is to get players to try to hit some shots that will run 
into the greens, because that's when you can get in more trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hit the rough at previous Open venues, and the smart play was to  
hack out into the fairway and try to make par from 100 yards out or 
settle for bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pinehurst, going for the green from an uncertain lie could  
lead to heroics or disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll maybe see some great birdies,'' defending champion Lee  
Janzen said. ``And also maybe some doubles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was willing to predict a winning score. With rain in the  
forecast through Thursday, the USGA may have to use built-in 
vacuums under the greens to suck the air from them. Montgomerie was 
willing to take even-par, the score that has won two of the past 
four U.S. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was willing to stick to the same plan that usually wins a  
U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have yet to play in one that hitting it in the fairway and  
knocking it on the green doesn't work,'' Duval said. ``Whether 
there is rough or not.''

<HEADLINE> Boys Convicted in Death of Gay Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Steven Goedereis was walking home  
on an empty street after having some drinks with co-workers when he 
passed someone he found attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, beautiful,'' he said to the 16-year-old boy.  
</P>
<P>
	The object of his compliment teamed up with a friend to beat  
Goedereis into unconsciousness, one kicking him 20 times in the 
head. He died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Donahue, 17, and Billy Dodge, 18, both high school  
dropouts who'd been drinking beer and tequila that day, were 
convicted Monday by separate juries of murder motivated by hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue faces life in prison for second-degree murder and  
robbery as a hate crime. Dodge could face up to 30 years in prison 
for third-degree murder based upon prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no winners,'' Steven Goedereis, the victims' father,  
said at the end of the three-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the teens admitted they'd punched and kicked Goedereis.  
</P>
<P>
	Goedereis was walking home April 27, 1998, when he saw Donahue,  
who also was walking alone after a day of partying. Donahue became 
infuriated when Goedereis complimented him, Assistant State 
Attorney Renelda Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue began to walk away, but turned around and punched  
Goedereis, demanding money and taking his knapsack, Mack told 
jurors. Donahue then left, found his friends and returned with 
Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the defendant had to do was continue walking away,'' Mack  
said as the teen's mother sobbed silently in the courtroom. ``He 
wasn't in fear. He was in control. He was dominating the victim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue's lawyer, Joe Atterbury, argued his client was  
frightened when he went back to his friends and said, ``Someone 
just tried to rape me.'' Atterbury acknowledged Donahue gave 
conflicting statements to police. In his first statement, he did 
not say Goedereis grabbed or touched him. 
</P>
<P>
	After the beating, Donahue searched Goedereis' bag for money. He  
listened to Goedereis' portable radio and smoked his cigarettes, 
Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodge's lawyer took a different tact from that of Donahue,  
telling jurors that Dodge went with Donahue to find Goedereis 
because he thought Goedereis may have been the man who'd been 
bothering his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 3.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Cooler temperatures, humidity and calm  
winds provided a break Tuesday to firefighters battling two large 
blazes that have scorched thousands of acres. 
</P>
<P>
	One fire 250 miles northeast of Anchorage, in Donnelly Flats,  
tore across 13,800 acres of black spruce forest during the weekend 
and slowed enough for firefighters to build lines around 30 percent 
of the perimeter, said Cindi Lagoudakis, a firefighter spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze, which started Friday, destroyed a guard shack and a  
recreation building at Fort Greely, an Army post about 5 miles 
south of Delta Junction. The Army evacuated the base Sunday, but 
hundreds of soldiers and their families were allowed to return 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire's still going on,'' said Maj. Robert Marcinkowski,  
the Army post's deputy commander. ``There's a lot of hot spots. But 
we opened the post back up to civilian workers who are coming in 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters used an infrared device to spot hot spots and spent  
much of the day attacking them with helicopters and ground crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-eight other fires were burning around Alaska on Tuesday,  
four of which were being fought. 
</P>
<P>
	Burn permits have been suspended across the state indefinitely,  
and the National Weather Service says there is no rain in sight for 
the Anchorage area and the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Interior village of Minto, about 50 miles northwest of  
Fairbanks, 150 firefighters worked to keep a 2,100-acre fire from 
reaching homes. Heavy smoke forced about 20 residents to flee the 
blaze, but officials said the fire slowed significantly Tuesday and 
no longer posed much of a threat. That blaze began Sunday at the 
village dump.

<HEADLINE> Gates Describes High-Tech Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates urged Congress  
today to avoid burdensome regulations on the booming high-tech 
industry while encouraging investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incredible success of this industry in the United States  
owes a lot to the light hand of government in the technology area, 
the fact that people can take incredible risks and if they're 
successful they can have incredible rewards,'' said Gates, the 
world's wealthiest person. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I'd say the light hand is working very well,'' Gates  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates testified just a few blocks from the federal courthouse  
where his company is fighting government antitrust allegations. He 
has not testified in the trial, although the judge has watched 
hours of videotape showing Gates being questioned by government 
lawyers last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In testifying to a Joint Economic Committee hearing on  
technology, Gates generally steered clear of any discussion of his 
company's legal troubles, even when asked directly by Sen. Charles 
Robb, D-Va., about how he would reform the nation's antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many people who dive into that, but I think the laws  
as they are currently written are fine,'' Gates said, adding: 
``Certainly everything that's gone on in the technology industry 
has come about because of things like integrating new features in 
is one of the freedoms that all companies have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers allege in their antitrust lawsuit that  
Microsoft illegally included its Internet software into its 
dominant Windows computer operating system to undermine a rival 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates also answered questions from three groups of high school  
and college students from around the country via a videoconference 
link. 
</P>
<P>
	An industry group critical of Microsoft, the Project to Promote  
Competition in the Digital Age, accused Gates in a statement of 
choosing ``to appear in a friendly setting where the questions will 
come via the Internet from school children, rather than traveling 
the three blocks to the courthouse where he would be forced to 
testify under oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates spent much of his half-hour appearance describing future  
advances in technology, predicting that consumers will carry 
tablet-size computers connected to wireless networks holding their 
schedules, important telephone numbers and financial information. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day in the not-too-distant future, computers will be able  
to see, listen and speak,'' Gates said. ``At home or in the office, 
you'll be able to control your PC by talking to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' appearance wasn't totally without controversy. A group of  
young people lined one wall of the hearing room wearing white 
T-shirts with messages such as ``Bust the Trust'' and 
``Microsoft-Intel: Corporate predators versus Democracy.''

<HEADLINE> Feds: No Bug in 'Mobster's' Butt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Reputed mobster Vincent ``Gigi  
Portalla'' Marino for years claimed that surgery to remove a bullet 
from his buttocks also included an unwelcome addition: a federal 
tracking device. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing called to reveal the truth, the region's top  
federal law enforcement official said Tuesday that agents never 
went that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can confirm that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  
did not implant a tracking device in defendant Vincent M. `Gigi 
Portalla' Marino's buttocks,'' U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said in a 
statement. ``But we cannot speak, however, for any extraterrestrial 
beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino had claimed that he was once asked by a DEA agent to sign  
a form so the government could remove the device from his body. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton said the  
situation ``sounds like some DEA agent trying to be funny,'' but he 
granted Marino's request to force the government to tell him the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton's order came during a hearing in preparation for a  
racketeering trial scheduled to start in the fall. Marino and six 
other defendants are accused of waging a murderous battle to seize 
control of the New England Mafia. Marino is in prison awaiting 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Marino was caught in a hail of gunfire at a club in  
Revere. He was shot in the buttocks.

<HEADLINE> Senate Pushing Steel, Oil, Gas Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to create government-backed  
emergency loans for struggling steel, oil and natural gas companies 
cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 70-29 to limit debate on the bill -- 10 more  
votes than the 60 needed. Final passage could come as early as 
Wednesday. The strong support on the procedural matter was a good 
indication that the bill's supporters would prevail on final 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1 billion in loans to domestic steel  
producers injured by low-priced imports. The measure also would 
create a $500 million loan program for U.S. oil and natural gas 
industries hurt by sagging prices. The taxpayer cost for the new 
loan programs is put at $270 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate previously approved the steel-loan program as part of  
an emergency spending bill to fund Kosovo operations. But 
supporters backed down during negotiations with the House when the 
provision threatened to sink the Kosovo spending package. 
</P>
<P>
	During those negotiations, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., insisted  
that a similar program be set up for small oil and gas firms. As 
part of a compromise, the two programs were combined later into a 
separate bill. House action on the measure is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel companies that qualify would be able to borrow $25 million  
to $250 million at market interest rates. Independent producers and 
other companies in the U.S. oil and gas service industries could 
borrow up to $10 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say many companies now have problems borrowing money  
from banks because of uncertainties about future import trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel companies would be able to make use of the loans through  
the end of 2001 and would have six years to pay the money back. Oil 
and gas companies would have five years to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a pro-American business vote as well as a pro-American  
job vote,'' said sponsoring Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., whose state 
is home to Weirton Steel Corp., a company the Commerce Department 
says would qualify for such loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the government had no business meddling in the  
marketplace. Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said that 
when the Carter administration established a loan program for the 
steel industry in 1978, companies defaulted on 77 percent of the 
$290 million borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steel loans represent a very high level of risk,'' Nickles  
said. ``We tried it. It didn't work before. I'm afraid it won't 
work again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said federally guaranteed loans for steel, gas and oil  
companies were similar in principle to government lending programs 
for farmers and small businesses.

<HEADLINE> Vinnie Castilla's Streak Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The list of baseball's iron men is getting shorter  
every week. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Castilla had played in 307 consecutive games for the  
Colorado Rockies, but a sore lower back kept him out of the 
starting lineup for Tuesday night's game against the San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, who last missed a game June 25, 1997, briefly took the  
iron man title last Friday after Baltimore's Albert Belle was 
benched following a shouting match with Orioles manager Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle played in 392 straight games before sitting out  
Baltimore's victory over the Atlanta Braves. Belle teammate Cal 
Ripken holds the major league record with 2,632 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Surhoff, yet another Baltimore player, becomes the leader  
among active players at 225 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind too much about the streak. I think it's  
secondary,'' Castilla said. ``I just go out there every day because 
I love to play. I love to help my team win. Right now I'm hurting 
the team instead of helping it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla has struggled offensively and defensively in the  
season's first two months. He has 12 homers and 36 RBIs but is 
hitting .226 with runners in scoring position and has committed 
nine errors at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	He has hit at least 40 home runs and driven in more than 100  
runs in each of the past three seasons. His average has never 
finished below .300 in the past four year, but he is hitting .272 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a bad back, it's hard to perform,'' Rockies  
manager Jim Leyland said. ``It's hard to do anything if you have a 
bad back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Streak or no streak, Leyland said as early as spring training  
that Castilla would not play every game. The sore back makes the 
decision even easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to give everybody a rest,'' Leyland said Tuesday.  
``Everybody's going to play here, and everybody will get some time 
off. That's why they call it a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Shumpert started at third base for the Rockies on Tuesday  
night. Leyland said he will see how Castilla feels before making a 
decision on his status for Wednesday. The Rockies have an off day 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Church Reacts To Gay Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A United Methodist Church committee  
today began investigating whether to charge 68 ministers with 
violating church law for blessing a lesbian wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Donald Fado, who led the ceremony for two church  
leaders, said he hopes the case will lead to an end of the church's 
ban on homosexual weddings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can bless people's houses, dogs, tractors, anything,'' said  
Fado, minister at St. Mark's United Methodist Church. ``There's no 
restriction on blessing, except if two human beings of the same 
sex, who love each other, want to make a commitment to spend their 
lives together. 
</P>
<P>
	``To deny this blessing is to deny the Gospel as I understand  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. John Sheppard II of the First United Methodist Church  
of Yuba City is among the ministers who objected to the ceremony. 
He said he hopes to gather support for the ban at a regional church 
leaders' conference that starts Wednesday in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the church ruled that a minister could be removed for  
violating its ban on homosexual weddings. Fado told his 
congregation in October that he wanted to protest that ruling by 
publicly blessing a same-sex union. 
</P>
<P>
	Two volunteers responded to Fado: Jeanne Barnett, 69, a retired  
state unemployment administrator and lay leader of the Methodists' 
California-Nevada Conference; and Ellie Charlton, 64, a divorced 
great-grandmother and conference trustee. They have been together 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, more than 1,000 people attended their public wedding  
at the Sacramento Convention Center. Fado and 67 other ministers 
blessed the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this helps bring it out that there are a number of us  
who have been members of the church for a long time. We're not 
outsiders,'' Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Melvin Talbert said the investigating committee of the  
California-Nevada Conference, which includes 400 congregations, is 
expected to meet in private over weeks or even months to decide 
whether to charge the ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before have so many ministers faced the possibility of a  
formal charge of disobedience, Fado said. In the past, two 
Methodist ministers have been disciplined for officiating at 
same-sex weddings.

<HEADLINE> Internet CEO Bares Chest on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Losing your shirt is usually the last thing  
you'd want to do in business, but that's exactly what the president 
of an Internet company did in an interview on CNBC Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a naked attempt to stir up publicity for his company, the  
head of online software vendor Beyond.com appeared stripped to the 
waist on CNBC's morning talk show ``Squawk Box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Breier, the chief executive of the company, said he was  
just trying to shake up the often staid world of financial news 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``CNBC is famous for framed talking heads bobbing on the  
screen,'' Breier said in an interview following his appearance. 
``We thought it was a neat twist to throw a little surprise on the 
CNBC viewers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hosts of the show certainly seemed surprised, even though  
the company had warned CNBC officials that Breier planned to appear 
wearing only boxer shorts during the satellite interview from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the hosts hadn't been fully briefed.  
</P>
<P>
	The bare-all appearance was in keeping with the company's ad  
campaign, which shows a guy so comfortable working from home that 
he walks around the house naked, to the chagrin of the neighbors 
and the package delivery man. 
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, CNBC host Joe Kernen covered his face and  
looked down at his desk to avoid looking at Breier, who grinned 
boyishly into the camera and held up the tiny microphone since he 
had no clothes on which to pin it. 
</P>
<P>
	By way of explanation, the clearly nonplussed Kernen borrowed a  
line from a Seinfeld episode, saying that ``my quota for naked men 
today is zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show's other hosts took Breier's buff appearance in stride.  
Anchor Mark Haines, peppered Breier with several questions and 
thanked him for the ``revealing'' interview. 
</P>
<P>
	While CNBC doesn't plan to make a habit of interviewing scantily  
clad CEOs, they didn't get too bent out of shape by Breier's stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't really control what CEOs wear or don't wear to  
interviews,'' network spokeswoman Martine Charles said. ``We 
concentrate on getting the best information for the investing 
audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breier may have caught a little wave of publicity with his  
appearance, but early indications are that other Internet 
executives will not be following suit with au naturel interviews 
any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Amazon.com chief Jeff Bezos would consider a similar  
tactic, company spokesman Bill Curry quipped: ``Barring 
developments, I am sure we will remain dot-clothed.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Slip Ahead of Economy Reports / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slipped in cautious trading Monday,  
as traders refrained from buying bonds ahead of a string of closely 
watched economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/16  
point, or $1.86 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.11 percent from 6.09 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose in early trading, but drifted lower as a  
cautious atmosphere took over in advance of the government's 
releases on May consumer prices, housing construction and regional 
economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were expected to sift through the reports for  
indications of whether the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates 
to try to check nascent inflationary pressures. An increase in 
prevailing rates would hurt the value of already-sold Treasury 
securities, which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged and intermediate maturities were down 1/32 point to 
3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.72 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.60 percent from levels at 
Monday's auction. Six-month yields were 5.06 percent, as the 
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.86 percent from levels at 
auction. One-year yields were 5.07 percent as the discount fell by 
0.02 percentage point to 4.82 percent from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.75 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 3/32 point to 119 5/32 from late 
Monday. The average yield to maturity fell to 5.53 percent from 
5.54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Church Reacts To Gay Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A United Methodist Church committee  
has begun investigating whether to charge 68 ministers with 
violating church law for blessing a lesbian ``holy union'' in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Donald Fado, who took part in the ceremony for the two  
women and is among those facing possible removal from the clergy, 
hopes the case will lead to the end of the church's ban on 
conducting homosexual weddings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can bless people's houses, dogs, tractors, anything,'' Fado  
said. ``There's no restriction on blessing, except if two human 
beings of the same sex, who love each other, want to make a 
commitment to spend their lives together. 
</P>
<P>
	``To deny this blessing is to deny the Gospel as I understand  
it,'' added Fado, minister at St. Mark's United Methodist Church in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. John Sheppard II of the First United Methodist Church  
of Yuba City, 40 miles north of Sacramento, is among the ministers 
who objected to the ceremony. He hopes to shore up support for the 
ban at a regional church leaders' conference that starts here 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fado, who is married and has four children, told his  
congregation last October that he wanted to protest a ruling by the 
Methodist Judicial Council that a minister could be removed for 
violating the ban on homosexual weddings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two volunteers responded. Jeanne Barnett, 69, a retired state  
unemployment administrator and lay leader of the Methodists' 
California-Nevada Conference; and Ellie Charlton, 64, a divorced 
great-grandmother and conference trustee. They had been together 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 16, more than 1,000 people attended what was called a  
``holy union celebration'' at the Sacramento Convention Center. The 
event was much like a traditional wedding, with Barnett and 
Charlton promising to love each other and a group of ministers 
pronouncing them ``loving partners together for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Melvin Talbert said the investigating committee of the  
California-Nevada Conference, which includes 400 congregations, 
began meeting Tuesday and is expected to continue sessions in 
private over weeks or even months to decide whether to charge the 
68 ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before have so many ministers faced the possibility of a  
formal charge of disobedience, Fado said. In the past, two 
Methodist ministers have been disciplined for officiating at 
same-sex weddings. 
</P>
<P>
	If the conference's investigating panel, with members ranging  
from ministers to church members, decides to bring charges, the 
conference would conduct a trial somewhat like those in civil 
courts except that it would be overseen by a bishop.

<HEADLINE> Twins' McIlvaine OK After Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Doctors found no major problems with a  
Minnesota Twins official who was hospitalized after a seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe McIlvaine, 51, was expected to be released from a New  
Orleans hospital later Tuesday, Twins spokesman Sean Harlin said. 
McIlvaine was stricken Sunday, about the same time Houston manager 
Larry Dierker had a seizure in the eighth inning of the Astros' 
game with the San Diego Padres. Dierker had brain surgery Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine, a special assistant to Twins general manager Terry  
Ryan, was in New Orleans to scout the Triple-A Salt Lake Buzz when 
he had a seizure while walking in a mall with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors ran McIlvaine through several tests and found no major  
problems, Harlin said. He said the seizure might have been a result 
of a low potassium level. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same thing Dierker had, but I'm not sure how  
serious his was compared to Dierker's,'' Ryan said Monday. ``But 
they had to strap him down and take him away in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was with his wife, and he said he felt a little woozy and  
sat down. Next thing he knew, he woke up in the hospital,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine, the former general manager of the Padres and New York  
Mets, was hired as Ryan's special assistant in 1998 and has scouted 
Latin America, the major leagues and the minor leagues for the 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ryan, McIlvaine has no history of seizures.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana GOP Chairman Fires Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- State Republican Party executives have  
stripped their chairman of check-writing powers after he led an 
effort to give Louisiana the first presidential caucus in the 
nation and sacked two top party officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode was the latest example of a years-long split between  
traditional GOP members and the more conservative Christian 
Coalition wing, which supports chairman Mike Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, Diane Christopher, vice chairwoman of the party,  
led an executive committee vote to take check writing powers away 
from Francis, who also changed the locks at party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's acting irrational,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Since there is little money in the bank account, the action may  
not mean much and the committee cannot oust Francis. But Ms. 
Christopher said it is at least a no-confidence vote and if Francis 
can't write checks ``he can't do much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis was defiant: ``What they did was illegal. I'm the only  
one who can call a meeting of the committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis has irked party moderates by pushing for Louisiana's  
presidential caucus to be held even before Iowa's traditional 
first-in-the-nation caucus. His critics said that at a meeting 
Saturday, he improperly engineered approval of an early caucus 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Monday, he dismissed state GOP executive director Becky  
Miller and her deputy, Terry Benham. They had not taken public 
stands on the caucus issue, and the reason they were fired was 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walked in, sat down, told us that our job at the party was  
done. We needed to clear our desk and move out,'' Benham said. 
``He's totally out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend meeting of the central committee had been called to  
decide how to run Louisiana's 2000 Republican presidential caucus. 
Francis had said it would be the nation's first even if it had to 
be held on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The group voted to hold its caucus one week before Iowa's, even  
though national GOP rules say Iowa must be the first state to 
choose a nominee and delegates to the national convention. Francis 
also killed the traditionalists' idea for a primary that would 
allow voting via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Louisiana held a caucus before Iowa, but most  
candidates shunned Louisiana because they worried about offending 
Iowa Republicans. Only about 20,000 out of nearly 500,000 
registered Republicans voted. Conservative Pat Buchanan finished 
first.

<HEADLINE> Keith Jackson Returns to ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY JEFF GOODMAN   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Keith Jackson unexpectedly ended his six-month  
retirement Tuesday, deciding to return to ABC's college football 
telecasts this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who retired this past season after 32 years with the  
network, will no longer be the network's top play-by-play man. 
Instead, he will work West Coast Pac-10 games and the Rose Bowl in 
January in order to keep travel to a minimum from his Los Angeles 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a relatively easy decision, and I know it sounds  
self-serving to retire and resurface,'' Jackson said. ``I guarantee 
I wouldn't have done it if I couldn't stay in the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the 71-year-old Jackson said the Fiesta Bowl was his  
final game, but ABC Sports president Howard Katz persuaded him to 
return in a regional role. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson will remain with analyst Bob Griese, his broadcast  
partner of the past 12 years, for 12 or 13 games in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The man famous for his ``Whoa, Nellie!'' call isn't sure exactly  
how much longer he'll stick around, but he figures that with the 
reduced travel, it should be at least two or three more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz is leaving the decision up to Jackson.  
</P>
<P>
	``Keith's going to tell me each year whether he's going to work  
the following year,'' Katz said. ``And we'll do that however long 
he wants to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson will travel the farthest away from home for his first  
game -- California at Nebraska on Sept. 11. Some of his games could 
be nationally televised, if Pac-10 teams such as Arizona, Arizona 
State or USC get off to good starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I guess we're saying with this announcement is that I'm  
staying at home and now there will be others doing the big games,'' 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Katz would not bestow the title of No. 1 broadcast crew  
on the Brent Musburger-Dan Fouts team or the Brad Nessler-Gary 
Danielson pairing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brent and Brad will share the spotlight on the national  
games,'' Katz said. ``One of them will do the Sugar Bowl this year 
and the other will probably do the Orange Bowl next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sugar Bowl will likely determine this season's national  
champion, while the Orange Bowl will get the top picks in the Bowl 
Championship Series the following season. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz also said Terry Bowden will replace Todd Blackledge, who  
left for CBS, as the studio analyst.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Wins Pledge From IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- International Olympic Committee  
leaders told Salt Lake City organizers today they are happy to give 
up red carpet treatment during the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
(SLOC), asked the IOC for help in cutting costs of hosting IOC 
members during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch replied: ``We  
will be happy to remove any luxuries, any receptions, any dinners. 
Any way we can be helpful to you, we will take that action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City is looking to reduce costs as it struggles to  
meet its $1.4 billion budget in the wake of the vote-buying scandal 
stemming from the Utah capital's winning 2002 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	While the cost of putting up IOC members represents only a small  
fraction of the budget, Romney said the cuts must be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said $1 million has already been slashed from the $3.5  
million originally budgeted for IOC services. He said there is room 
for another $1 million in cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at plans we have for receptions and ceremonies  
that we can eliminate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Limousines and five-star hotels have been ruled out. IOC members  
will travel in Chevy Blazers, driven by volunteers, and stay at a 
business-style hotel rather than a new luxury hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said talks were continuing  
on eliminating other perks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has never asked for any luxury,'' he said. ``The IOC  
is prepared to consider everything that is reasonable and doesn't 
affect the success of the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to reduce,'' he added. ``We don't need  
parties, we don't need cocktails, we don't need dinners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts were raised during a 1 hour, 15-minute report to the  
IOC by Romney, SLOC chairman Robert Garff and sports director Cathy 
Priestner Allinger. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC deferred a final decision on Salt Lake City's request to  
add seven new sports events -- skeleton (a head-first version of 
luge), women's bobsled and cross-country ski sprints and 
1,500-meter short-track speed skating for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive board expressed approval in principle, but said  
more time is needed to study whether all the events meet the 
criteria for being on the Olympic program. A final decision is 
expected at the IOC executive board meeting in Athens, Greece, in 
early October. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City leaders hoped to win ratification of the  
additions in Seoul. But Romney said approval in Athens would still 
be acceptable because Salt Lake City's final schedule is not due to 
be completed until December. 
</P>
<P>
	Allinger said the events that needed the most study were women's  
bobsled and the cross-country sprints because of their limited 
international exposure so far. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Romney said more work was needed to finalize Salt Lake's  
technology consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has already appointed the European company Sema as the  
information technologies systems integrator and is in negotiations 
for a computer hardware sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the IOC has had sole control over the technology  
sponsors. But the Salt Lake City committee and OPUS, a joint 
marketing company with the U.S. Olympic Committee, are also 
involved this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney denied there was any tension among the groups.  
</P>
<P>
	``All three have been turned loose,'' he said. ``We are all  
going out knocking on doors seeing if we can put together final 
elements of the technology consortium. There's no territoriality 
being imposed. We are each looking to see which group can solve the 
current gaps. We're looking to sell first and ask questions 
later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Romney pressed his request for the IOC to allow Salt Lake City  
to defer payment of royalties on merchandise, sponsorships, tickets 
and cash contributions -- a move that could save $1.5 million to $2 
million.

<HEADLINE> Still No Decision on WTO Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization is still deadlocked  
in the search for a new director-general despite signs of growing 
support for former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore, trade diplomats 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the 134 member countries, WTO general council  
chairman Ali Mchumo said there was still no immediate likelihood of 
a decision, and advised them to ``draw the appropriate conclusions 
and act accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo said 80 delegations were prepared to accept Moore -- who  
is backed by the United States and many European nations. But, in 
reference to Japan and other Asian nations, he said several members 
continued to maintain a formal objection. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also no consensus around Moore's rival, Thai deputy  
prime minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, added Mchumo. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has been without a leader since the departure of Italian  
Renato Ruggiero at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, many delegations are suggesting that the only  
possible option now is to drop both candidates and start the 
leadership hunt again from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would leave a prolonged and damaging vacuum at the  
head of the world's main trade body just as it prepares to launch a 
new set of trade liberalizing negotiations this fall in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates have vowed to stay in the race.  
</P>
<P>
	In a previous poll at the end of April, Moore had support from  
62 countries, compared with 59 for Supachai -- the longtime 
frontrunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo had convened an informal meeting of the council for  
Tuesday, but it was postponed until Wednesday. It may be followed 
by a full formal session.

<HEADLINE> Gas Surge Causes Michigan Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- A gas surge caused fires to break out  
in 24 homes today, injuring two people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears like some small home fires, not small if it's your  
home, but it's not like a raging inferno,'' City Manager Merrill 
Stanley told Detroit radio station WWJ. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction work was going on in the neighborhood when the  
pressure surge happened, said Jeff Kruithoss, director of the 
city's police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge may have caused pilot lights to increase their flames,  
said Jane Breederland, a spokeswoman for the Semco Energy Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas was shutoff to about 1,500 homes. Crews are going  
house-to-house to make sure the lines are clean. It may be two to 
three days before the gas is turned back on. 
</P>
<P>
	It was left up to homeowners to spend the night. The Red Cross  
set up a shelter for those who wanted to leave.

<HEADLINE> Austin Powers Scores at Box Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Swinging '60s-era spy Austin Powers is  
proving to be just the man for the '90s -- and the box office, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' the James Bond spoof  
starring Mike Myers as the groovy man of mystery, knocked ``Star 
Wars: Episode One -- The Phantom Menace'' from the No. 1 spot over 
the weekend with an estimated opening of $54.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The comedy grossed more in its first three days than the first  
``Austin Powers'' film did in its entire run. 
</P>
<P>
	It also became the top-opening comedy (beating last year's ``The  
Waterboy,'' which debuted with $39.4 million); the top June opener 
(beating ``Batman Forever'' with $52.7 million in 1995) and the No. 
2 non-holiday weekend opener (behind only ``The Phantom Menace'' 
with $64.8 million last month). The figures are not adjusted for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In passing the ``Star Wars'' prequel, ``Austin Powers'' has  
become an unlikely blockbuster, going from an inside joke Myers 
thought few people would understand to a cultural phenomenon. 
Powers' favorite phrases -- ``Oh, behave!'' and ``Yeah, baby! 
Yeah!'' -- have exploded into America's cultural vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're stunned, it's almost surreal,'' said Mike Deluca,  
president of production at New Line Cinema, the film's distributor. 
``I think in a weird way, the culture caught up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first film, ``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,''  
opened to a tepid $9.5 million in May 1997. Audiences just didn't 
seem to understand the humor about a '60s spy with bad teeth, a 
bearskin rug of chest hair and an infatuation all things sexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin's character was inspired by Meyer's late father, a  
Liverpool-born salesman who loved British comedy. The comedian 
feared his creation ``was the consummate in-joke,'' Myers said 
before the film premiered. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, audiences warmed to Austin, and the $16  
million-budget film hung on through the summer to gross a 
profitable $53.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it went to video, where it was -- as Austin would say --  
smashing. The tape dominated the 1998 video charts, with $44 
million in sales. It spawned Austin theme parties in colleges and 
homes, and set the groundwork for the sequel, with double the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	New Line raised expectations with a movie trailer that poked fun  
at the hype around ``The Phantom Menace.'' The ads told moviegoers 
that if they see just one film this summer, go to ``Star Wars.'' If 
they see two films, the ads said, check out ``Austin Powers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the studio launched a huge promotional push using carefully  
selected partners that adopted Myers' brand of gentle, 
double-entendre-laced humor. 
</P>
<P>
	One Virgin Atlantic Airways billboard has Austin beaming, ``Five  
times a day? Yeah, baby!'' to promote the airline's frequent 
flights to London. And a Heineken commercial had a masseuse 
admiring Austin's ``Heiney'' -- his beer, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	The sequel, which sends Austin back to 1969 to reclaim his  
stolen mojo, was given an enviable release date. It followed 
``Phantom,'' but came before July's special effects-laden ``Wild 
Wild West,'' and with no other comedies in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's success is due to ``Mike's spirit of joy and his love  
of this music and this culture, this color and movement,'' said its 
director, Jay Roach. ``People young and old want to share it with 
him, and that's his genius.''

<P>
	Showers and thunderstorms darkened the Mid-Atlantic states and  
Southeast today. Much of the Midwest and West was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain fell in the Carolinas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama,  
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Parts of Texas saw 
heavy afternoon rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Fair and pleasant weather was seen from the northern Mississippi  
Valley east across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley into most of the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm system pushing out of the Rockies and into the High  
Plains brought showers and thunderstorms to areas of the Dakotas, 
Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the western United States remained under the influence  
of high pressure. Fair to partly cloudy skies were seen from 
Washington and Oregon southeast into Arizona and New Mexico. A few 
spotty showers were seen in Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the Lower 48 ranged from a low of 31 in  
Redwood Falls, Minn., to an early-afternoon high of 95 in Luke,

<HEADLINE> Bush Welcomed in Massachusetts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush  
sang ``You're a Grand Old Flag'' with schoolchildren today and 
promised to rally the ``armies of compassion'' to help children and 
make society more responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	On his inaugural campaign trip, Bush told the mostly Latino  
students at the Lawrence Community Day Charter School that the 
American dream should be available to legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you work hard, if you play by the rules, if you understand  
you're responsible for decisions you make, the American dream is 
for you,'' he said in both English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has a wide lead in the polls over a crowded  
field of Republican presidential candidates. He also leads in fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
	At a fund-raiser Tuesday, Bush promised to make boosting  
volunteerism a major theme of his campaign. ``I will rally the 
armies of compassion,'' he said. ``I will run a positive campaign, 
a campaign that unites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His noon appearance at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston set a  
record for GOP fund-raising in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500-a-plate fund-raiser netted $800,000 for his exploratory  
committee, which already has raised at least $14 million, said 
local Republicans. A reception beforehand brought in an additional 
$100,000 for the Republican State Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the first one who has struck my heartstrings in terms of  
having a stand I can be proud of,'' said Warren G. Appell, chief 
financial officer for Air General Inc. ``I'm tired of a president I 
have to make excuses for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many of them saw in Bush at least one quality he shares with  
President Clinton -- an ability to appeal to both the left and right 
wings of his party. 
</P>
<P>
	``He combines conservative values with inclusiveness and  
compassion,'' said former state Treasurer Joe Malone, the 
standard-bearer for the Massachusetts GOP's right wing during last 
year's gubernatorial primary. ``He's the real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Paul Cellucci, a moderate, could barely hide his glee as he  
campaigned with Bush, who he has known for 20 years. As a young 
state representative, Cellucci was the state's first elected 
official to endorse George Bush for president in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Bush served up coffee at a Derry, N.H.,  
restaurant and mingled with customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Customer Bill Otto said he supports Bush even though he didn't  
learn anything new about the Texas governor except that ``he pours 
a good cup of coffee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just like his father. The country needs another one like  
that,'' Otto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing critics who say he refuses to take a stand on a wide  
array of issues, Bush said, ``There's a lot of time for 10-point 
programs, but my first trip to New Hampshire is to try to answer 
that question -- why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why is he running for president?  
</P>
<P>
	``I want this country to be prosperous,'' Bush said.  
``Prosperity is not a given. Some in this administration think they 
invented prosperity, kind of like they think they invented the 
Internet.'' It was a reference to Vice President Al Gore, the 
Democratic presidential front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Hadco Corp. plant, computer technician Matt Devoe was not  
persuaded by Bush's declaration that he was ready to lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now he's got his name carrying him. As he begins to  
reveal where he stands, then we'll really see what he's all 
about,'' said Devoe, who supports Bush rival Elizabeth Dole.

<HEADLINE> Accounting Firm To Pay $1.1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An accounting firm will pay $1.1 million to  
settle a state investigation into its role in preparing financial 
documents that led to former Gov. Fife Symington's conviction on 
federal bank fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement announced Tuesday also concludes a 4-year-old  
probe of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's role in the alleged rigging of a bid 
to win a $1.5 million state contract in 1991, Attorney General 
Janet Napolitano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington, a two-term Republican, was convicted of seven counts  
of bank and wire fraud in 1997 stemming from his former career as a 
Phoenix developer. One count was later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington was forced to resign but remains free on appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged Symington gave false personal financial  
statements to lenders to get millions of dollars in loans to fund 
his failing projects in the 1980s and early '90s. Symington 
prepared some of the statements and others were prepared or 
reviewed by his accountants. 
</P>
<P>
	Coopers &AMP; Lybrand merged with Price Waterhouse in 1998 to form  
PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington contended that his inflated net worth and other  
mistakes in the documents were unintentional and should have been 
caught by Coopers accountants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy with the way the matter was concluded,'' said  
Lee Stein, an assistant attorney general who helped negotiate the 
settlement. ``It's a significant amount of money, and it resolves 
the allegations and brings a conclusion to a big case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PricewaterhouseCoopers said it was glad the matter was over  
with. 
</P>
<P>
	``This investigation was launched years ago. We're gratified  
that the settlement announced today finally enables state officials 
to put the matter to rest,'' the firm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington and his attorney did not immediately return phone  
calls Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> No Bug in Mobster's Buttocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- There's no bug in a reputed mobster's  
buttocks, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Vincent ``Gigi Portalla'' Marino claims, a federal  
drug agent had told him that a tracking device was inserted in 
Marino's rear end when he underwent surgery to remove a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, a federal judge ordered authorities to say whether  
they did, in fact, implant such a device. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can confirm that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  
did not implant a tracking device in defendant Vincent M. `Gigi 
Portalla' Marino's buttocks,'' U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern said 
in a statement. ``But we cannot speak, however, for any 
extraterrestrial beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino had claimed that he was once asked by a DEA agent to sign  
a form so the government could remove the device from his body. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton said the  
situation ``sounds like some DEA agent trying to be funny,'' but he 
granted Marino's request to force the government to tell him the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton's order came during a hearing in preparation for a  
racketeering trial scheduled to start in the fall. Marino and six 
other defendants are accused of waging a murderous battle to seize 
control of the New England Mafia. Marino is in prison awaiting 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Marino was caught in a hail of gunfire at a club in  
Revere. He was shot in the buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
	A legal expert said it is highly unlikely the government could  
legally implant a device in a person's body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theoretically, if you wanted to put a tracking device in  
someone's body you would have to have court authority to do that, 
and I imagine the courts would be reluctant to do that,'' said 
Randy Chapman, former head of the Massachusetts Bar Association's 
criminal justice division.

<HEADLINE> Gates to Senate: Don't Tread On Me </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates urged a  
receptive Senate panel on Tuesday to continue using a light touch 
while regulating the high-tech companies that are helping to drive 
the nation's booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates testified in a packed room on Capitol Hill, just blocks  
from the federal courthouse where Microsoft is fighting a landmark 
antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrity billionaire, who didn't testify in the courtroom  
in his company's defense, barely discussed his legal problems, 
except to say that antitrust laws ``are fine'' and don't need to be 
rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incredible success of this industry in the United States  
owes a lot to the light hand of government in the technology area, 
the fact that people can take incredible risks and if they're 
successful they can have incredible rewards,'' said Gates. Worth 
more than $60 billion, he is the world's wealthiest person. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of risk-taking attitude is fairly unique to the  
United States,'' Gates added. ``We really are the envy of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Gates praised the government's minimalist role  
regulating his industry, he asked the Joint Economic Committee for 
fewer restrictions on exporting the most powerful data-scrambling 
technology. He also asked for new tax breaks on research spending. 
Both are pet issues for high-tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry is losing a lot of sales because the encryption  
technology that is widely available outside the United States, we 
uniquely are not allowed to export,'' said Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added: ``Overall, I'd say the light hand is working very  
well. ... The basic philosophy of letting the marketplace work has 
been vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., told Gates that Congress generally  
supports that light-hand approach, but ``we're trying to figure out 
exactly where and when to intervene or regulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates offered his thoughts on federal antitrust law only after  
Robb pressed him whether those laws need to be reworked. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb twice reminded Gates awkwardly that he was ``not focusing  
on specific litigation,'' causing outbreaks of laughter in the room 
-- like asking somebody ticketed for driving too fast what they 
think about speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the laws as they are currently written are fine,''  
Gates answered. ``... Certainly everything that's gone on in the 
technology industry has come about because things like integrating 
new features is one of the freedoms that all companies have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers have spent months in federal court trying to  
show that Microsoft illegally adds new features into new versions 
of its Windows software -- which runs most of the world's personal 
computers -- to undermine competitors, such as Internet pioneer 
Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	High school and college students from four schools also used a  
videoconference link to briefly ask Gates questions Tuesday. One 
asked Gates to predict any future technology glitches, such as the 
Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said his biggest concern is the reliability of computer  
networks in the face of disasters or attacks from software viruses, 
such as the recent malicious ``Worm.Explore.Zip'' outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to design our systems to be far more resilient to  
these types of virus attacks,'' Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates was once a summer congressional page. His appearance  
Tuesday was markedly more friendly than his only previous testimony 
before Congress, when he appeared last spring before the Commerce 
Committee and debated Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a vocal critic. 
</P>
<P>
	But even this trip wasn't without controversy. A group of young  
people lined one wall of the hearing room Tuesday wearing white 
T-shirts with messages such as ``Bust the Trust'' and 
``Microsoft-Intel: Corporate predators versus Democracy.''

<HEADLINE> Estrogen Sub Lowers Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Medical researchers have found a dramatic drop in  
the risk of breast cancer for women who take an estrogen substitute 
prescribed to prevent brittle bones. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year study of 7,705 women found a 76 percent lower  
risk of breast cancer among post-menopausal women taking raloxifene 
compared with those given a placebo. The report was published in 
today's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very exciting beginning,'' said lead researcher Dr.  
Steven Cummings, a professor of medicine at the University of 
California at San Francisco. ``But we've only had 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 years of 
experience with this. I think women should be cautious about any 
medications used for prevention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Collyar -- a patient advocate from California and a  
breast cancer survivor who was not involved in the study -- agreed 
caution is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no magic bullets,'' said Collyar, president of  
Patient Advocates in Research. ``When you look at the risk 
reduction, 76 percent sounds like a tremendous amount, and it is. 
But you have to look at what the absolute risk of those women was 
in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene is part of a new generation of drugs scientists hope  
will mimic the good effects of estrogen -- stronger bones and a 
lower risk of heart disease -- while inhibiting the possible harmful 
effects, which may include promoting breast and uterine cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene, the first so-called ``designer estrogen,'' was  
approved in 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration for preventing 
osteoporosis. It has not been shown to affect heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It is marketed under the name Evista by Eli Lilly and Co., which  
paid for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Many women are afraid to use estrogen because of conflicting  
evidence on whether it promotes breast cancer. However, a study 
released last week on 37,000 women suggested that hormones do not 
increase the risk of breast cancer, except for some uncommon and 
highly curable forms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene isn't risk-free. It increases the chances of serious  
blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cummings' study, 5,129 post-menopausal women younger than 81  
received raloxifene daily, while 2,576 got a dummy pill. Thirteen 
cases of breast cancer were diagnosed among the women taking 
raloxifene; 27 cases were found among those taking the placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	Women taking raloxifene had a 90 percent lower risk of a type of  
cancer called estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, raloxifene had almost no effect on estrogen-receptor  
negative breast cancer, one of the hardest forms of the disease to 
treat. It is most commonly developed by younger women and those 
with a genetic predisposition to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Janet Wolter of Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center  
in Chicago said she is encouraged by the findings and hopes more 
research will determine whether the breast cancer drug tamoxifen or 
raloxifene is more effective and produces fewer side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	An accompanying editorial cautioned that raloxifene cannot yet  
be considered suitable for most women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its contributions to knowledge intensify the anticipation of  
finding something even better on this new frontier,'' wrote Drs. 
Adele Franks of the Prudential Center for Health Care Research in 
Atlanta and Karen Steinberg of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.

	TINGO MARIA, Peru (AP) -- Maoist Shining Path rebels raided a  
remote village in Peru's central jungle and executed eight peasants 
it suspected of being informers, villagers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A rebel column entered Azul de Magdalena, 250 miles northeast of  
Lima in the Upper Huallaga Valley, on Sunday and assembled 
residents in the town square, villagers told reporters from CNR 
radio. The rebels led the four men away and their bodies were later 
found abandoned, villagers said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman from the military base in Tingo Maria, the nearest  
city, denied that the attack took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels attacks have left 20 people dead in the past month in  
Peru's jungle-shrouded Huallaga Valley in an apparent surge of 
rebel activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru's war against leftist rebels has left 30,000 dead since

capture of top rebel leaders in 1992.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Construction work at Venezuela's  
largest oil refining complex was suspended indefinitely Tuesday 
because of labor unrest that has endangered employees' safety, 
industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The paralysis could have serious social and economic  
consequences for Venezuela since the complex directly and 
indirectly employs some 20,000 people. About 1,400 private and 
foreign companies depend on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision affects several joint ventures at the Jose  
petroleum complex in eastern Venezuela, involving Venezuela's 
state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, Conoco, 
Mobil, France's Total and Norway's Statoil. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hugo Chavez travelled to the region Tuesday to try to  
solve the impasse personally. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to stop construction was made in response to weeks  
of protests by unions and unemployed people demanding payment of 
suspended salaries and the re-hiring of laid off employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters have blocked the entrance to the complex, detained  
oil-company executives and seized trucks that transport liquid gas.

divorced Fujimori told host Laura Bozzo on her show ``Laura in

	When asked if he would run for a third consecutive term in  
office next year -- a subject of much speculation in Peru -- he said: 
``I haven't decided. I'm waiting for Cupid's arrow'' for both 
decisions. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	The breakout occurred late Monday night at the Bauru  
Penitentiary, 186 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Sao Paulo State Penitentiary Department said  
37 of the penitentiary's 700 inmates used pliers to cut through the 
26-foot wire fence surrounding the building.

turn over the administration of teacher's colleges to state-run and 
private universities.

	Hundreds of students burnt effigies of Education Minister Tito  
Hoz de Vila in front of his office and blocked the main

	The government is trying to improve the educational level of  
teachers who until now were able to teach in public schools after 
studying at a two-year teacher's college. Teachers were not 
required to have a university-leve degree.

<P>
	Students marched from the mining city of Oruro, located 230  
miles south of La Paz. They encountered freezing temperatures at 
night and intense Andean sun during the day.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Airport Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defying a veto threat and congressional budget  
writers, the House tonight passed legislation allowing a hefty 
boost in airport spending by guaranteeing that all airport user 
taxes go to airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration authorization bill, passed  
316-110, directs $56 billion over five years to operate the FAA and 
improve airport and air traffic control facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	It seeks to bolster competition to smaller market airports,  
eventually eliminates takeoff and landing restrictions at New York 
and Chicago airports and doubles to $6 per passenger what an 
airport can charge for local projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which has yet to be taken up by the Senate, is the  
handiwork of Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., 
a fierce advocate of infrastructure spending. 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case last year when he succeeded in walling off a  
highway trust fund from the general budget, Shuster came up with an 
extra $14 billion in the aviation bill with language stating that 
Congress can no longer use funds from the Aviation Trust Fund for 
non-aviation purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund, which takes in about $10 billion a year in  
airport user taxes, is now used for general budget programs and 
boosting the budget surplus, as well as airport projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster insisted that the $14 billion could come out of the  
Republican plan to cut taxes by $778 billion over 10 years, and 
would not decrease the budget surplus or require cuts in other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is morally wrong to take aviation ticket taxes and use  
those ticket taxes for a general tax cut,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House said taking the trust fund off-budget would  
result in a presidential veto, stressing that the unified budget 
approach ``permits more fully informed decisions'' on allocating 
the nation's resources. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget and Appropriations committee leaders also fought  
both the extra spending and the threat to their control over how 
money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to maintain fiscal discipline within this House,''  
said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee. ``Once this process begins to start, the members of this 
House lose control over the budget process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An amendment proposed by Young and a bipartisan group of budget  
leaders to keep the trust fund within the general budget was 
defeated, 248-179. 
</P>
<P>
	It was overwhelmed by strong sentiments from members that  
something must be done about deteriorating airport facilities and 
lack of competition at smaller airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lois Slaughter, D-N.Y., said businesses are moving out of  
her district in Rochester and ``consumers are getting crushed'' 
because of high ticket prices -- she said a roundtrip ticket to 
Chicago listed for more than $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``The debate today is not about arcane budget rules,'' said Rep.  
James Oberstar, D-Minn., ranking Democrat on the Transportation 
Committee. ``It is about the very future of America and our 
leadership in the world economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would eliminate takeoff and landing restrictions at  
Chicago's O'Hare in 2002 and at La Guardia and JFK in New York in 
2007. And it would allow additional flights out of Washington's 
Reagan National Airport to underserved markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would require the hiring of more air traffic  
controllers and establish procedures to quiet air tours over 
national parks. It would increase from $1.9 billion this year to 
$4.3 billion in 2004 spending under the Airport Improvement 
Program, which funds new runways and deals with noise pollution.

<HEADLINE> Delays, Problems Plague Conrail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Delivery delays and other rail-service  
problems continued to plague the new owners of Conrail Inc. as they 
began their third week of operations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rail customers of CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp., which  
carved up Conrail on June 1, reported late shipments of raw 
materials and difficulties getting the rail cars needed to pick up 
finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Those problems, primarily along former Conrail territory in  
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Indiana, interfere 
with production schedules nationwide and threaten to shut down some 
manufacturing plants. Shippers say Norfolk Southern appeared to 
have more problems than CSX. 
</P>
<P>
	United Parcel Service, one of the nation's largest rail  
customers, began moving some packages by truck on Monday, a more 
expensive option for longer-distance shipments. The company also 
had to pay its employees overtime to process delayed shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still going downhill,'' said UPS spokesman Norman Black.  
``We're seeing delays of three to 12 hours still on virtually every 
train on both lines, and we're not seeing any indication that 
things are getting better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The split of Conrail was the most complex transaction in modern  
railroading and followed a problematic merger of Union Pacific with 
Southern Pacific in 1996, a merger that led to severe congestion 
and delays in the West and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The $10.3 billion transaction breaks up a 23-year-old Conrail  
monopoly created by Congress in 1976 out of six bankrupt carriers. 
CSX and Norfolk Southern, now the nation's third- and 
fourth-largest railroads respectively, control virtually all rail 
traffic east of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Shippers say problems began to arise after the first few days,  
when traffic was light, but none has risen to the level that Union 
Pacific faced several months into its merger three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Rastatter, director of policy with the National Industrial  
Transportation League, said it was too early to declare an 
emergency, but several shippers believe ``it's getting as bad as UP 
was at the same stage of the merger, and that worries them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By some estimates, the Union Pacific gridlock cost the U.S.  
economy at least $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite two years of transition planning, CSX and Norfolk  
Southern have both faced problems with computers -- compatibility 
and coding -- among other troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're looking at is a reduced number of delayed  
shipments,'' said an apologetic Donald O'Brien, assistant Norfolk 
Southern vice president for implementation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Haulter, assistant CSX vice president for integration  
planning, said, ``Even though it's not working as smoothly as we 
would like, it's not jammed.''

<HEADLINE> Family of Dead Wrestler Sues WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The family of a wrestler killed doing a  
stunt last month filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the World 
Wrestling Federation and the city on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in Jackson County Circuit Court on behalf  
of Owen Hart's widow, Martha, their two children and his parents, 
Helen and Stu Hart, a pioneer of professional wrestling in Western 
Canada. The amount of money sought was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart -- also known as The Blue Blazer -- was killed May 23 when he  
fell from a cable as he was being lowered into the ring at a WWF 
spectacle at Kemper Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart fell more than 70 feet when the quick release on his  
harness opened early. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit lists 46 separate counts against 13 defendants. Among  
the defendants are the companies that manufactured the harness and 
cable system used in the stunt as well as the individuals who set 
up the rigging. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the WWF and its parent company, Titan Sports, the  
lawsuit named WWF chairman Vincent McMahon and the city of Kansas 
City, the owner and operator of Kemper Arena where Hart died. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hart said she was suing because those responsible for her  
husband's death should be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Professional wrestling has become a showy display of graphic  
violence, sexual themes and dangerous stunts,'' Mrs. Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the WWF is promoting profit at the expense of  
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hart said she was ``repulsed'' when she learned that the  
show continued after her husband's fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Schmelzle, general manager of Kemper Arena, said the  
decision to continue was not out of disrespect for Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we had a meeting about it. The next show just  
went on,'' he said. ``Honestly, we didn't know at that point if he 
was dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His family has said Hart was leery about the flashy stunt he was  
supposed to perform to land inside the ring, but was persuaded to 
do it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	He had done the stunt before and had practiced at the arena  
hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF officials declined to comment Tuesday until they see the  
lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Refutes IOC Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
moved Wednesday to dispel rumors of an internal plot against him 
and reiterated that he intends to complete the final two years of 
his term. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the International Olympic Committee executive board,  
meanwhile, expressed their unanimous support for Samaranch and 
urged him to stay on until the end of his mandate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not leaving,'' he said. ``I will stay until 2001 if I am  
healthy enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a breakfast meeting with six news agency reporters, Samaranch  
dismissed recent published reports that senior members of the IOC 
administration have been trying to oust him in a palace coup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always we have rumors,'' he said. ``I am not worried. Nothing  
has happened. We are used to rumors. We are hearing rumors every 
day. In an organization like ours, we have to be used to rumors. 
But rumors are rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch denied there was a split in the administration at IOC  
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, or that director general 
Francois Carrard was leading a faction against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you we are very pleased with the administration  
of the IOC,'' he said. ``They are working very well. I fully 
support all the members -- from the director general on down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also refuted suggestions of a rift with IOC vice  
president Dick Pound, who has publicly speculated that Samaranch 
might retire after the organization ushers in reforms at the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch confirmed that he had written Pound expressing dismay  
at the remarks and that Pound had sent a reply. But he denied a 
French newspaper report that Pound, a leading contender to succeed 
him as president, had told him it was time to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a minor incident,'' Samaranch said. ``He has my full  
confidence. I respect him very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been frequent speculation about Samaranch's future in  
the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal which plunged the 
IOC into the worst crisis of its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch, who won a massive vote of confidence from IOC  
members in March, repeated that he will complete the remainder of 
his term. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I said is very clear: I have decided to go until the end  
of my mandate,'' he said. ``The only thing that can stop me is if I 
have don't have the confidence of IOC members or if I am ill. If 
one day I have the feeling that my physical condition is not the 
same as today, I will leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980 and turns 79 next  
month, released a letter signed by the 10 members of the executive 
board endorsing his continued leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these difficult times of crisis wrought with danger, a  
strong, wise, trusted leadership is essential,'' the letter said. 
``We unanimously support you ... and ask you to continue to devote 
your time to the Olympic movement as president of the IOC, until 
the end of your present mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has faced numerous calls for his resignation from  
newspapers and critics outside the IOC, said he had survived the 
worst of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you compare these days to the last weeks, this is a  
vacation for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, Samaranch:  
</P>
<P>
	-- defended the decision to allow Australia's Phil Coles to  
retain his seat on the IOC while forcing him to resign as a board 
member of the Sydney 2000 organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who had been censured in March for his role in the Salt  
Lake scandal, was reprimanded again Monday for ``serious 
negligence'' in compiling sensitive notes on his IOC colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we solved this problem in the best way,'' Samaranch  
said. ``The problem is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- welcomed the opportunity to cut back on perks for IOC members  
as requested by Sydney and Salt Lake organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not looking for luxury,'' Samaranch said. ``We are not  
looking for parties and dinners and so on. I hate dinners. I was 
very happy. I said, `No dinners, no dinners.''' 
</P>
<P>
	-- hinted that FIFA president Sepp Blatter may be appointed as an  
ex officio member of the IOC later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	-- said the IOC executive board will consider holding meetings  
every two months, half of them by video conference linkup. The 
board, which normally meets four times a year, has already held 
five meetings this year since the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Cold War Tensions Resurfacing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imagine Russian soldiers in a military  
standoff with NATO troops on a European airfield. Consider the 
United States hitting a Chinese diplomatic mission with a missile. 
Add in the naval gunfire between North and South Korea, and 
sometimes it's hard to remember the Cold War is over. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. policy-makers are suddenly confronted with far larger  
security issues than those initially at stake in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we need to exaggerate this problem,'' Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright said of the standoff between NATO and 
200 Russian troops at the airport in Pristina, Kosovo's provincial 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	But as she and Defense Secretary William Cohen prepared to go to  
Helsinki, Finland, to meet with their Russian counterparts to try 
and sort out Moscow's peacekeeping role, analysts and military 
experts suggested the airport situation was fraught with the danger 
of escalation. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, meanwhile, Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering  
was trying to explain NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Yugoslavia. Chinese officials continue to depict the May 7 bombing, 
which killed three Chinese journalists, as deliberate and 
provocative. 
</P>
<P>
	While NATO's air campaign achieved the stated goal of forcing a  
Serb withdrawal from Kosovo, it also rekindled Cold War tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, we still live in a divided world. And China and  
Russia often have different interests from those of the West,'' 
said Tony Cordesman, a foreign policy expert at the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordesman sees a fundamental difference between today and the  
years of nuclear confrontation between a massive Soviet military 
and the West. Still, he said, it's ``very dangerous for Americans 
to believe the diplomatic rhetoric'' that minimizes present 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials reiterated on today that they expected the  
stalemate with Russia to be eased. Moscow has given ``assurances at 
a variety of levels'' that it won't add to the 200 soldiers at the 
airport in Pristina, said State Department spokesman James Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	As he spoke, an 11-vehicle Russian convoy rolled through Kosovo  
on its way to Pristina to resupply the Russian troops. And concerns 
were raised that Russia might try to send in reinforcements by air. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have learned repeatedly over the last three months, few  
things seem to go as planned in the Balkans,'' said Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz., a senior member of the Armed Services Committee 
and a 2000 GOP presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Western observers still weren't sure whether the refusal of the  
troops to leave the airport was orchestrated by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin -- or was the act of independent-minded generals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure Yeltsin is in total control of the military,''  
said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., chairman of a congressional group 
that meets with members of the Russian Duma. 
</P>
<P>
	But Weldon sees the airport stand as a frustrated gesture,  
reflecting a desire by Russians to play a wider role in the 
peacekeeping -- a role he suggests the Clinton administration has 
trivialized. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is extremely serious. All it takes is for one Russian or  
one American to misfire,'' Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation may top the agenda at this weekend's annual  
meeting of the world's industrial democracies and Russia in 
Cologne, Germany -- and comes at a bad time for Russia's bid for 
more Western financial support. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Russia and China are torn by difficult internal problems.  
Russia is attempting to overcome severe economic woes while China 
is trying to emerge as an economic world power. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickering's mission to Beijing should help mend fences with  
China, even if it produces no grand pronouncements, said Sen. Max 
Baucus, D-Mont., a leading advocate of wider trade with China. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dust has begun to settle. The Balkans military action has  
ended, which makes it easier for China to move forward,'' Baucus 
said. He said the Chinese realize that resuming stalled trade talks 
is in their best interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders put on hold military contacts, talks on human  
rights and arms control and negotiations on joining the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-seas confrontation between North and South Korea  
reinforced how quickly things can begin to escalate -- adding to 
more potential tensions between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the U.S. position is that the North Koreans should  
refrain from provocative acts and that both sides should be as 
restrained as possible in not allowing disputes that occur from 
time to time to spin out of control,'' said Pentagon spokesman 
Kenneth Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the United States dispatched additional  
aircraft to patrol the area, and there was talk of sending 
additional U.S. ships or other resources.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,  
dragged down by news of a Korean naval battle as well as worries 
over a possible increase in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the  
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 93.18 points, or 
0.54 percent, to finish at 17,282.00. On Monday, the index lost 
9.73 points, or 0.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks were boosted by buying from foreign investors, said  
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that domestic institutional investors remained  
cautious about the direction of the economy and the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also jittery on news that South Korea had sunk  
one, and possibly two, North Korean boats in disputed waters in the 
Yellow Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors were also refraining from big deals ahead of the  
release Wednesday of the May U.S. consumer price index, which may 
provide an indication about U.S. interest rate policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.34 yen in afternoon  
trading, down 0.32 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its 
late New York level of 120.62 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares closed sharply lower on the news that North  
and South Korean warships had exchanged gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 18.19 points, or 2.2  
percent, to 803.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed generally lower in reaction to news of  
the sea battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 72.16 points, or 0.6 percent,  
closing at 12,935.41. On Monday, the index gained 14.81 points, or 
0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong traders also were concerned about a possible interest  
rate hike in the United States, which would probably be matched by 
Hong Kong banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on concern over the standoff  
between North and South Korea, with analysts saying trade in the 
region could be hurt if the Korean hostilities grow. The market's 
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 13.58 points, or 0.1 percent, 
to 7,960.00. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 8.77 points, or 0.4 percent, 
to 2,107.09. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower on persistent concerns  
that U.S. interest rates may rise later this month. The 30-company 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSE Index) fell 5.75 points, or 
0.2 percent, to 2,385.45. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower. The benchmark All  
Ordinaries Index closed at 2,940.9, down 9.3 points, or 0.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed lower on profit-taking.  
The Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, closed at 
779.93 points, down 3.05 points, or 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed mixed in active trading, with  
the key index falling on profit-taking following recent gains. The 
Composite Index fell 9.289 points, or 1.4 percent, to 670.160. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly lower as the possibility of a  
U.S. interest rate hike kept institutional investors on the 
sidelines. The Straits Times Index fell 11.55 points, or 0.5 
percent, to close at 2,046.83. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares closed lower. The Thailand SET Index fell  
6.05 points, or 1.2 percent, to 508.62.

<HEADLINE> NHL GMs Mull Rules Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- One of the biggest controversies in the NHL  
during this season has been the man-in-the crease rule and the 
video replay that usually accompanies an infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment among general managers is to change it.  
</P>
<P>
	That was one of the topics discussed Tuesday by GMs attending  
the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a feeling we have to make adjustments,'' Florida  
Panthers GM Bryan Murray said. ``This time, more so than in the 
past, there's a feeling we have to change it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players have expressed unhappiness with the rule that disallows  
a goal if any one from the offensive team has a part of his body in 
the goalie's crease, even if it doesn't have an impact on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is unhappy with the time spent reviewing goals on  
video, which it feels takes away the spontaneity for fans. A recent 
league survey showed that it took an average 93 seconds to make 
video review. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Campbell, vice president in charge of hockey operations  
for the NHL, said the league was interested in shortening games. 
During the five-hour session prior to Tuesday night's Game 4, the 
GMs also talked about using a ``hurry-up'' faceoff and ``hurry-up'' 
line changes to speed the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Other topics included the schedule for 1999-2000, which is in  
the air right now because of the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins' 
situation. The league has said it would make up three schedules 
depending on whether the Penguins stay in town, move or fold. 
</P>
<P>
	The GMs also looked at the recent experiment by the American  
Hockey League of using four players instead of five in overtime in 
an attempt to open the game and cut down on ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the AHL games were brought to a conclusion ``65  
percent of the time'' and at least a couple of GMs seem to favor 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The GMs made no recommendations, but said they would continue  
the discussion next week when the board of governors meets.

<HEADLINE> Joe McIlvaine OK After Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Tests today showed Minnesota Twins executive  
Joe McIlvaine has no major health problems following his collapse 
from a seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine had the seizure in New Orleans about the same time  
that Houston manager Larry Dierker was stricken during a game in 
the Astrodome on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine was expected to be released from the hospital today,  
said Twins spokesman Sean Harlin. Dierker had brain surgery in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine, a special assistant to Twins general manager Terry  
Ryan, was in New Orleans to scout the Class Triple-A Salt Lake Buzz 
when he collapsed while walking in a mall with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors ran McIlvaine through a battery of tests and found no  
major problems, Harlin said. He said the seizure might have been a 
result of a low potassium level. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was with his wife, and he said he felt a little woozy and  
sat down,'' Ryan said Monday. ``Next thing he knew, he woke up in 
the hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine, the former general manager of the San Diego Padres  
and New York Mets, was hired as Ryan's special assistant in 1998 
and has scouted Latin America, the major leagues and the minor 
leagues for the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine has no history of seizures, Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were lower early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorable crop reports weighed on corn and soybean prices, but  
forecasts of above-average temperatures and below-average rains in 
Midwest growing areas next week were supportive, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's report from the Agriculture Department showed 70  
percent of the soybean crop was rated good to excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were depressed by an improvement in winter crop  
conditions, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery was $2.60 a bushel, down 2 3/4 cents; July  
corn was down 3 cents to $2.15 a bushel; July oats fell 2 1/2 cents to 
$1.20 1/2 a bushel; and July soybeans were 3 1/4 cents lower to $4.68 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock futures prices sank on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle for August delivery were .50 cent lower at 66.70  
cents a pound; August feeder cattle fell .67 cent to 77.75 cents a 
pound; July lean hogs were off 1.90 cents to 51.25 cents a pound; 
and July pork bellies were down 1.87 to 42.55 cents a pound.

<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The bodies of a man, woman and two young  
children were discovered in a house today in what appeared to be a 
murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A relative found the bodies after the 27-year-old father did not  
show up for work, police said. The cause of death was under 
investigation, but it appeared to be a murder-suicide, Capt. Bruce 
Tilkens said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was found in a vehicle in the garage, where a strong  
smell of exhaust lingered. The woman was found in the living room, 
while the two children were in an upstairs bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the victims was shot or stabbed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is blood and cuts, but we don't know the cause of  
death,'' Tilkens said.

<HEADLINE> Two Sentenced for Stolen Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two men have been sentenced for conspiring to  
resell almost $20 million worth of computer software that had been 
stolen from a manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Monday sentenced Robert S. Simons, 62, of  
Peabody, to five years and 10 months in prison. He was also ordered 
to pay $908,000 in restitution to the Microsoft Corp. and to 
forfeit $440,000 to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Simons pleaded guilty to interstate transportation  
of stolen property and conspiring to launder the proceeds of the 
sale of stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
	Simons' son, William Simons, 35, of Salem, was sentenced to one  
year and 10 months in prison for his role in the stolen property 
conspiracy and the interstate sale of stolen computer software 
disks. William Simons, who had also pleaded guilty, was ordered to 
pay $100,000 in restitution to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Simons both worked at Crazy Bob's, a discount computer  
outlet in Wakefield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1994 and 1997, Crazy Bob's purchased computer products  
that had been stolen from KAO Infosystems in Plymouth, Mass., 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest shipment of the stolen property consisted of 32,000  
Microsoft Office '97 Professional Edition CD-ROMs, each valued at 
$599. The store sold the disks to various outlets located in 
California and Great Britain, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other people charged in the case await sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Trains Return to Oklahoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Amtrak passenger trains have returned to  
the rails in Oklahoma, ending a 20-year absence caused by federal 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``All aboard the Heartland Flyer!'' 11-year-old Katie Moore  
announced on Monday as the train made its first stops throughout 
the state. She earned a place on the inaugural trip from Fort 
Worth, Texas, to Oklahoma City by winning a contest to name the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
	Service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth will allow  
travelers to connect with trains serving Chicago, San Antonio, Los 
Angeles, New Orleans and Florida. Some hope the train service will 
eventually expand north to Tulsa and link to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily service between Oklahoma City and Tulsa was to begin  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	A long lobbying effort by the state led to a deal in which  
Oklahoma leases the track from Burlington Northern Santa Fe while 
Amtrak operates the trains. Eleven other states have similar 
ventures, and only five states remain with no Amtrak service -- 
Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Wyoming and South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	For several hours Monday, Oklahoma looked transformed to the  
glory days of train travel as thousands gathered at old depots to 
celebrate Amtrak's return. 
</P>
<P>
	In the south-central Oklahoma town of Ardmore, more than 600  
flag-waving residents cheered Monday's arrival of the Flyer. A high 
school band played ``Oklahoma!'' as the train came to a stop 
outside the old Frisco depot. 
</P>
<P>
	Pauline Anderson Foster, 90, said she plans to be among those  
who will use the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see it come back,'' she said. ``We've missed it.''

<HEADLINE> Kennard Promotes Internet Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Communications  
Commission predicts chaos if local governments are allowed to 
determine the technical standards for high-speed Internet access 
and cable television systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine if we had a highway system where every town could set  
the parameters for the size of cars and the size of lanes. We 
wouldn't be able to drive to the store, much less to another 
state,'' William E. Kennard said in remarks prepared for delivery 
today to the National Cable Television Association convention in 
Chicago. The text was released in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies are upgrading their lines so they may offer a  
range of ``broadband'' services that could include high-speed 
Internet access 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said, ``The Information Superhighway will not work if  
there are 30,000 different technical standards or 30,000 different 
regulatory structures for broadband. The market would be rocked 
with uncertainty. Investment would be stymied. Consumers would be 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard urged support for setting up a national policy on these  
broadband pipelines to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball is in your court, and if you act responsibly,  
consumers will get broadband and that broadband pipe will follow 
the open tradition of the Internet,'' he said. ``If this 
marketplace is allowed to develop, the entire country will benefit 
from an Internet -- the engine driving our economy -- that goes 
faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was surprised that there had been no appeal to the  
FCC of a Portland, Ore., federal district court ruling earlier this 
month that said the city could force its cable TV franchisee to 
open its lines to all Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said he met last week with Senate Democratic leader Tom  
Daschle of South Dakota and his colleagues from rural states to 
assure them that the Internet would be accessible to people who 
live in small towns and farms.

<HEADLINE> McKeon Doesn't Regret Shirt Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The only thing Cincinnati Reds manager Jack  
McKeon regrets about enforcing a uniform rule is the way his move 
was interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon said Tuesday that New York manager Bobby Valentine  
shouldn't take it personally that he forced a Mets reliever to 
change T-shirts before pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel badly that he feels like I'm picking on him,''  
McKeon said. ``I'd do the same thing to anybody. I've got to look 
out for the welfare of my players and team. I like the guy. I've 
always liked him. I've always gotten along with him. I've got 
nothing against Bobby Valentine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine obviously has something against the way McKeon insists  
on following the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	It goes back to June 3 at Shea Stadium, where the batter's box  
was soaked before their game. The umpires made the grounds crew 
pour a drying material on it before the first pitch after the Reds 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked after that game whether the Mets deliberately soaked the  
field, Valentine shrugged his shoulders and didn't answer. The Reds 
called it gamesmanship to try to blunt their speed. 
</P>
<P>
	During that June game, the Reds also complained about the glove  
of pitcher Jason Isringhausen, saying there was white on it -- a 
violation of the rules. Valentine took a marker and blacked out the 
white on the glove. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't end in New York. During Monday's series opener, McKeon  
pointed out to umpires that reliever Pat Mahomes was wearing a 
bright orange T-shirt with sleeves that protruded from his jersey. 
That's a violation of rule 1.11 (a), which requires all players to 
wear ``uniforms identical in color, trim and style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires agreed with McKeon and ordered Mahomes to go to the  
dugout and change to a black T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I abide by the rules,'' McKeon said. ``But we're not out there  
looking for stuff. It's ironic that it's happened against those 
guys on different occasions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's game, Valentine called McKeon's insistence on the  
shirt change ``ridiculous, a waste of time.'' He also said of 
McKeon: ``He likes to do that. It's his style. Whatever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Tuesday if he expected McKeon to challenge something else  
during the series, Valentine said, ``If he can, I guess. That's the 
way ... I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't looking to get into a rule-enforcement spat  
with the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have at any time gone out and had their white  
wristbands removed, but I've never done that,'' Valentine said.

<HEADLINE> Astros Relieved After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros' mood lightened noticeably  
Tuesday after players learned manager Larry Dierker was expected to 
make a full recovery from brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we can worry about baseball, not life and death,'' closer  
Billy Wagner said. ``There's always going to be something in 
baseball, but I'm glad this part is over. We don't need this any 
more. We're just glad our prayers have been answered. Now we can 
worry about baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker collapsed in the dugout Sunday during a game in the  
Astrodome. A 5 1/2-hour operation Tuesday removed a life-threatening 
tangle of malformed blood vessels from his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Recovery is expected to take at least four weeks, meaning he  
will not rejoin the Astros until after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the operation, Dierker told Jeff Bagwell and Craig  
Biggio he'd like to get back in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to get back quicker than they are supposed  
to,'' Bagwell said. ``We just want him to get back and get back to 
his old self.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Gerry Hunsicker informed interim manager Matt  
Galante of Dierker's prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Sunday, all we've had the last few days was good news,''  
Galante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galante said he will wait until Dierker leaves intensive care  
before visiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to bring up business,'' Galante said. ``When he  
wants to, we'll talk. I'll let him lead the way on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros didn't miss a beat in their first game without  
Dierker on Monday night, beating the Braves 10-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you get on the field, it's all the same,'' catcher Paul  
Bako said. ``He and Mattie are on the same page as far as managing. 
That doesn't change. But before and after the game, yeah, he's in 
our thoughts and prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biggio looked forward to a return to normalcy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a two-day whirlwind with what happened, the waiting  
and then the surgery,'' he said. ``Then we got the best possible 
scenario.''

<HEADLINE> Lott: Gore's Gun Vote May Boomerang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Majority Leader Trent Lott said today the  
tie-breaking gun control vote that Vice President Al Gore cast in 
the Senate last month may turn out to be a political detriment 
rather than a benefit in a run for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news media in its lather to distort this whole issue may  
be wrong in their estimation that this will help Al Gore,'' Lott 
said in an interview. ``As a matter of fact, it may already have 
hurt him and it may hurt him a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senate deadlocked at 50-50 on May 20, Gore employed the  
vice president's prerogative to break ties and voted in favor of 
gun control proposals that included mandatory background checks for 
sales at gun shows. Gore seemed eager to play such a role and 
expressed pleasure at a news conference held moments later. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans have grumbled privately that Lott committed a  
major political blunder by allowing Gore, whose presidential 
campaign was stumbling, the opportunity to vote on behalf of 
legislation that is popular in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mississippi Republican said the gun issue varies from  
state to state. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a lot of places people don't agree with what he did and how  
he voted. I don't think it helped him,'' Lott said. ``Certainly his 
poll numbers haven't gone up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said: ``Once again, the  
Republican leadership is showing just how out of touch they are 
with the American people. Bottom line is the American people want 
real meaningful reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott made his comments as a gun control showdown loomed across  
the Capitol in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	There, Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt charged that Speaker  
Dennis Hastert had abdicated his leadership in the House to ``the 
forces that prefer that we do nothing of significance'' on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not a legislative process,'' Gephardt said of a  
GOP-crafted schedule that has changed repeatedly in recent days. 
``It is a deliberative effort to give gun control opponents every 
advantage while depriving gun control advocates of vital 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Hastert's spokesman, John Feehery, said, ``We will  
have a fair and open debate regarding youth and violence despite 
Mr. Gephardt's best efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview in his Capitol office, with its grand view down  
the Washington Mall, Lott said he has a favorite in the race for 
the White House next year, but declined to identify him. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether it was anyone other than Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush, Lott noted that two fellow senators -- Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire and John McCain of Arizona -- are in the race, and that 
contenders Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander are close friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think as majority leader it really would be timely or  
appropriate for me to endorse a specific candidate,'' he said. ``I 
do have a favorite. I'm trying to be helpful to him in an 
appropriate way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, in comments to a group of reporters during the  
day, Lott said he thought Bush had done a good job in his initial 
campaign foray outside Texas, and he likes what the governor has 
had to say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also said he had spoken with President Clinton and written  
him a letter in hopes of defusing a controversy that has led a 
fellow Republican to block confirmation of all pending presidential 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton's decision to use his Constitutional authority  
to appoint James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg without 
confirmation during a congressional recess ``broke the process'' 
that had been in effect for the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some conservative senators opposed the appointment of Hormel, a  
homosexual, but recess appointments are not subject to Senate 
confirmation. When Clinton employed the tactic, Sen. James Inhofe, 
R-Okla., retaliated by saying he would block all pending 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott indicated that his letter asked Clinton to commit to revert  
to an earlier procedure. He said that until the Hormel nomination, 
the administration had notified the Senate before a recess 
appointment was made to see whether it was possible to approve it 
through the regular process. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's comments on gun control were his first explanation of his  
handling of an issue which frequently seemed to put Republicans in 
disarray on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it may not have been pretty, it was focused, we dealt  
with it and the Senate moved on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Lott said he knew the night before the gun  
control vote that there might be a tie and he considered asking for 
someone to switch their vote. That would have allowed the measure 
to pass, but deny Gore a chance for the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, you always consider that,'' he said. But Lott quickly  
added, ``It's one thing to try to get somebody to switch a vote on 
something that maybe is not as consequential as this was. ... I 
thought it would have been inappropriate to get somebody who had 
already voted on an issue maybe once or twice to switch their vote 
just to avoid Al Gore casting this vote.''

<HEADLINE> Tom Hanks Tops Star Power Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No one in Hollywood can guarantee a box  
office bonanza like Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson or Tom Cruise, according 
to a Tinseltown trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the top 10 of The Hollywood Reporter's fifth annual Star  
Power '99 survey of bankable stars were, in order, Hanks, Gibson, 
Cruise, Harrison Ford, Jim Carrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, John 
Travolta, Julia Roberts, Robin Williams and Brad Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood Reporter surveyed 135 entertainment industry  
executives, bankers, buyers and sales agents. The top 10 list was 
``a subjective look at the bankability of 525 actors and actresses 
worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You obviously need a good script and a good director, but the  
casting of the right actor and right actress in the right park is 
essential to the success of any movie,'' said Sherry Lansing, 
chairwoman of Paramount Motion Picture Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters were asked about an individual's ability to attract  
financing, ensure global distribution and open a film on the 
strength of their name, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	The list was to be published in today's edition.

<HEADLINE> Renovation Underway at Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two months after two teen-age gunmen  
opened fire at Columbine High School, the bullet holes have been 
plastered, the broken glass repaired, and the bloodstained carpet 
stripped from the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	The repairs, shown to reporters Tuesday, are the first in a  
massive renovation project aimed at erasing memories of the deadly 
rampage before classes for the 1999-2000 school year resume Aug. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent of the school district is to put this back as a  
high school,'' said Jack Swanzy, the lead architect in the project. 
``We don't want to make it a shrine to the tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine seniors Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris walked into the  
school on April 20, planted bombs, fired off weapons and killed 12 
students and a teacher before committing suicide. Twenty-three 
others were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who visited the site shortly after the massacre said it  
looked like a war zone: The library was littered with slain 
students, tables were overturned, backpacks were scattered 
throughout the building, hallways were flooded and windows shot 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want the building to reflect changes and a new vitality,''  
Swanzy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main hallways will be repainted, he said. Carpeting in  
hallways will be replaced by tiles. The cafeteria will be 
completely remodeled with new furniture floor tiles, ceiling and 
different wall colors. And bullet-riddled doors and windows will be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be changes in the tone of the fire alarm that  
blared for seven hours straight during after the rampage. Strobe 
lights that went on in the library gave it an eerie disco 
appearance, and smoke wafted in from the hall, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who were in trapped in there for three or four hours  
said that sound would stay with them for the rest of their life,'' 
said Swanzy. ``We want to make sure people don't jump out of their 
skin every time there's a fire drill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts will also be made to enhance security at the school, he  
said. While there are no immediate plans to install metal 
detectors, up to 20 video cameras will placed throughout the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Those involved in the project said they think the changes  
proposed so far are good ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the school's going to look really nice,'' said Meghan  
McKee, 15, who was in the science room during the shooting. ``There 
will be enough changes that it will have a different kind of feel 
to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everything has been cleaned up except the library, where many  
students died. The room remains a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Swanzy said the initial plan called for renovating the library  
extensively. But parents protested, saying students would be too 
traumatized to study at the site. Other options are now being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents didn't want cosmetic changes,'' said Linda Mauser,  
whose son Daniel died in the shooting. ``They wanted it moved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are still signs of the investigation throughout the  
building: holes in some of the walls where drywall has been removed 
for ballistic analysis and the words ``cleared crime scene'' 
showing where SWAT team members moved through the building in the 
hours that followed the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	An arrow was drawn by investigators over locker 837, which had  
belonged to Klebold, with the words ``empty.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Court Rules on Police Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- People in Massachusetts can't be ordered out of  
their cars during a traffic stop unless police believe they pose a 
threat, the state's highest court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-2 decision Monday, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that  
a police officer ``must have a reasonable belief that his safety, 
or the safety of others, is in danger,'' before ordering people out 
of a car. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that it is allowable under the  
U.S. Constitution for police to order anyone out of a car that has 
been stopped for a traffic violation. But the Massachusetts 
justices said the state constitution grants its citizens more 
protection against such orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority opinion also said allowing police to order people  
out of their cars was a ``clear invitation'' to discrimination by 
police against minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Roderick Ireland pointed to the controversy over whether  
police stop blacks disproportionately on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prohibiting the police from ordering people out of automobiles  
without any justification is a much needed step in the right 
direction to cure such abuses,'' he wrote in a concurring opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in a Plymouth Superior Court case in which a  
state trooper ordered a passenger out of the back seat of a taxi 
and later found a bag of cocaine in the seat. The man, John D. 
Gonsalves, argued the cocaine and his comments were inadmissible as 
evidence because the search was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissenting Justices Charles Fried and Neil Lynch cited the  
``mortal danger'' posed to police during routine traffic stops and 
argued that police could better protect themselves if they had the 
power to order people out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately the court chooses to bolster its policy judgment  
by invoking the inflammatory issue of race,'' the dissent added.

<HEADLINE> Medical Privacy Bill Moving Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. James Jeffords, trying to avoid the  
partisan fighting that surrounded debate over HMOs and patient 
rights, again postponed committee action today on another 
troublesome issue: the privacy of medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is a broad agreement on the overall privacy issue,  
major disagreements remain over the details, despite months of 
searching for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Action had been scheduled today in the Senate Health, Education,  
Labor and Pensions Committee, but Jeffords, the panel's chairman, 
announced postponement for a third time, trying to find compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be much more fruitful if we wait and come back  
tomorrow morning,'' said Jeffords, R-Vt. ``We're very, very close'' 
to consensus, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the HMO debate, the right of patients to sue is at the  
center of the issue. In the privacy case, the question is how easy 
it will be for patients to sue those who improperly disclose 
personal health information. Also, Democrats and Republicans were 
divided over the rights of children to keep their medical records 
secret -- even from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation written by Jeffords sets out to establish the first  
federal right to privacy regarding medical records. While many 
states have privacy laws, no federal law prohibits the free 
distribution of someone's medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords has been trying to walk a thin line between the views  
of Democrats, who generally want to make privacy rights as broad as 
possible, and Republicans, who fear hampering business by expanding 
such privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy debate is being driven by an August deadline. If  
Congress does not act by then, a 1996 law requires the Clinton 
administration to write its own regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates on both sides of the issue dislike different aspects  
of the administration's approach, and both prefer that Congress 
resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats will not support the bill as written, said Jim  
Manley, spokesman for Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the 
committee's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	On the right to sue over unauthorized release of patient  
information, Jeffords originally included language more acceptable 
to Democrats. But then conservative Republicans balked, led by Sen. 
Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. So Jeffords tightened the provision to cap 
damages for pain and suffering at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But negotiators, trying to win Democratic support, changed a  
provision that required plaintiffs to prove in court that their 
records were released ``willingfully and intentionally.'' The bill 
now sets the standard at ``knowingly or intentionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are also angry at a provision that would essentially  
give parents the right to see their children's medical records, 
even if the child sought medical attention independently. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states require doctors to give these records to parents.  
Democrats want to let doctors in other states withhold them if they 
see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	There are differences on other issues, but those were not  
serious enough for either side to oppose the bill, Senate aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues of contention, Jeffords' legislation would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow existing, tougher state privacy laws to stand, but  
prohibit most future action. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enable law enforcement officers to seize medical records  
without the patient's permission if they have a warrant or other 
court action ordering it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Give medical researchers access to records without getting  
permission first.

<HEADLINE> Crocodile Numbers Up in S. Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The endangered American crocodile  
appears to have made a strong comeback in the past two decades, 
nesting in parts of Florida's Biscayne Bay for the first time this 
century, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The crocodile was declared an endangered species in 1975 when  
its population dwindled to 20 nesting females, all of them in a 
20-square-mile area in Miami-Dade County and the Keys. 
</P>
<P>
	But University of Florida biologists announced Monday that they  
have seen more than 100 crocodiles and two nests over the past 
three years. They estimate there are about 500 crocodiles in south 
Florida today, including as many as 50 nesting females. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more crocodiles, in more places, doing more things  
than we have had for a long time,'' said Frank Mazzotti, a 
university biologist. ``The animals are looking for other areas to 
inhabit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young crocodiles -- rarely seen in other parts of the giant bay  
south of metropolitan Miami -- have appeared at parks and golf 
courses, Mazzotti said. He called the reproduction a sign of a 
healthy population. 
</P>
<P>
	Crocodiles, characterized by a fourth tooth that juts from their  
lower jaw when their mouth is closed, are closely related to the 
alligator, classified as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
	By the 1960s, most of the crocodiles' natural habitat was wiped  
out by development. As their plight became known, agencies began 
buying preserves to provide a home. The animals also adopted the 
miles of cooling canals at the Turkey Point Power Plant in Florida 
City, southwest of Miami and just outside Everglades National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The ditches had all the comforts of home for the crocodiles, and  
they began reproducing at a rate three to four times higher than 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists are reluctant to declare a successful comeback.  
</P>
<P>
	``As the numbers of crocodiles increase, they necessarily start  
to spread out and start to run into developed areas,'' said Paul 
Moler, a Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission crocodile 
researcher. ``The crocodile, and many other species, are still on a 
collision course with the development of south Florida.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Hit 3 HRs in First Against Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The New York Mets hit three homers in the  
first inning of their game Tuesday night, something they hadn't 
done in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's Brett Tomko gave up a leadoff homer to Rickey  
Henderson, walked Edgardo Alfonzo, then gave up homers to John 
Olerud and Mike Piazza as the Mets went ahead 4-0 only nine minutes 
into the game. The homers were estimated at 397, 411 and 448 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets hadn't hit three homers in an inning since April 25,  
1996, when Brent Mayne, Lance Johnson and Butch Huskey homered in 
the seventh inning at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time this season Tomko gave up three homers in  
an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 28 at Philadelphia, Tomko gave up consecutive homers to  
Scott Rolen, Rico Brogna and Ron Gant in the first inning. That 
marked the first time that the Phillies hit three consecutive 
homers since 1987.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Seeks Tougher Brady Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring gun regulation is ``too important to  
be decided by strong-arm lobbying tactics,'' President Clinton 
today renewed his call to the Republican Congress to toughen the 
Brady gun law, which he said has proved itself one of the nation's 
must effective anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the law with its system of background checks has  
blocked more than 400,000 illegal gun sales, two-thirds of which 
involved either convicted felons or people with a current felony 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heart and soul of America is on the line,'' Clinton said  
as he urged ordinary Americans to tell House members to follow the 
lead of the Senate and pass strengthened gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a White House Rose Garden ceremony with congressional  
supporters and the families of many victims of gun violence, 
Clinton said the National Rifle Association was ``wrong, wrong, 
wrong'' in arguing against the Brady bill six years ago and is 
equally wrong now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now in the aftermath of the terrible shootings at Littleton  
our nation is even more galvanized to act against violent crime,'' 
and to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles and criminals, 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again the gun lobby is resisting with all its might; once  
again we are battling not only for the safety of our families but 
the soundness of our democracy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Congress to resist ``procedural and tactical  
smokescreens to confuse everyone and confuse the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want us to honor the sacrifices of the people in Littleton,  
Colo., and not to turn our backs on them,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called on Congress to strengthen the Brady law by  
requiring background checks of people seeking to buy guns at gun 
shows and flea markets, by raising the national age of handgun 
ownership from 18 to 21 and by passing other measures he said would 
help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. 
</P>
<P>
	The president made public a new Justice Department report  
showing that in the first five years of the application of the law, 
a period in which a five-day waiting period was required, some 
312,000 handgun purchase applications were rejected under state or 
federal law, 66.3 percent of them for felony convictions or 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first five years, state and local authorities were  
allowed up to five days to check backgrounds of handgun buyers 
before the guns were sold, unless a state already had its own 
instant-check system. If a check took less than five days, no 
additional waiting was required. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department report said that in the first six months  
under a new instant-check background search system, an additional 
90,000 illegal gun sales were blocked. The new system gives law 
enforcement officials access to a more extensive set of records and 
applies to all firearms, not just handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4.1 million background checks have been conducted by  
the FBI and the states under the new instant-check system, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appeal to House Republicans followed by a day a  
similar call from Vice President Al Gore. Gore told the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors in New Orleans that new government studies 
show that one in four gun murders are committed by people 18, 19 or 
20.

<HEADLINE> Study: Patch Could Restore Sex Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A testosterone-laced skin patch helped increase  
the sex drive of women who lost their libido after hysterectomies, 
according to a study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Women naturally produce the male sex hormone, which controls  
sexual desire, but that stops when the ovaries are removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 43 percent of the 14 million women who have had  
hysterectomies reported sexual dysfunction after their surgeries -- 
a decrease in sex drive, a decrease in sexual pleasure, an 
inability to have an orgasm and sometimes depression,'' said the 
study's primary author, Dr. Glenn Braunstein of Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble, which makes a testosterone patch for men with  
sexual dysfunction, funded Braunstein's study to see whether 
similar patches would help women. Other medications to deliver 
testosterone to women can cause side effects like acne, liver 
abnormalities or moodiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was released Tuesday at The Endocrine Society's annual  
meeting, which drew more than 6,100 researchers, doctors and 
pharmaceutical company representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Braunstein studied 57 women for nine months. They wore the  
patches on their abdomens, changing them every three to four days. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were given either two placebos; a placebo and a patch  
containing a normal level of testosterone usually found in a 
woman's body; or two patches containing high levels of 
testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the women who didn't have two placebos  
reported an increase in sexual desire. Braunstein found that their 
estrogen levels remained the same; hot flashes did not increase; 
there was no increased hair growth in unwanted areas or acne. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is a broader study involving more women over a  
longer period of time, Braunstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Margaret Wierman, chairwoman of The Endocrine Society  
meeting, warned that older women shouldn't interpret the findings 
to mean they should use male hormones to increase their libido and 
cure their depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely do not think we should think of this as a Viagra  
for women,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bogart, Hepburn Top Stars List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Humphrey Bogart and his ``African Queen''  
co-star Katharine Hepburn led the American Film Institute's list 
today of the 50 greatest screen legends, a lineup missing many of 
the biggest stars of silent films and musicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The roster was unveiled during a three-hour special on CBS.  
</P>
<P>
	Cary Grant was No. 2 on the list of greatest male actors,  
followed by James Stewart, Marlon Brando, Fred Astaire, Henry 
Fonda, Clark Gable, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy and Charlie 
Chaplin. Only four on the men's list -- Brando, Gregory Peck, Kirk 
Douglas and Sidney Poitier -- are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Miss Hepburn among female legends were, in order:  
Bette Davis, Audrey Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo, Marilyn 
Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich and Joan 
Crawford. There are five living female legends -- Miss Taylor, 
Katharine Hepburn, Lauren Bacall, Shirley Temple and Sophia Loren. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a guy who didn't think of acting as a competitive sport,  
he would have been honored and awestruck by this,'' Bogart's son 
Stephen said. ``You look at the 75 films he's done, from `The 
African Queen' to `Casablanca,' `Treasure of the Sierra Madre' and 
`The Maltese Falcon.' These were all such disparate roles, yet he 
carried them all off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Bogart's mother is Miss Bacall, who was No. 20 among the  
actresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked and I'm flattered beyond words,'' she said by  
telephone from Italy. ``My God! I would never have expected it. But 
I'm not surprised that Bogie's No. 1.'' She added: ``Gee, this 
makes me feel a hell of a lot more important than I am. I'm going 
to call my agent right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday night show was patterned after last summer's AFI  
special that named the 100 best American movies. ``Citizen Kane'' 
was No. 1, followed by ``Casablanca,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``Gone 
With the Wind,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``The Wizard of Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics and movie buffs jumped on the AFI for overlooking so  
many silent movies. Only four were chosen, and way down in 44th 
place was D.W. Griffith's ``The Birth of a Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that sort of thing again. Someone will find fault,''  
AFI chairman Tom Pollock said. ``Lists by their nature create 
controversy because of who is on them and who is left off them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who didn't make the top 50 greatest stars included Douglas  
Fairbanks, Ronald Colman, Rudolph Valentino, Stan Laurel and Oliver 
Hardy, Harold Lloyd, Alec Guinness, Mickey Rooney, Fredric March, 
Doris Day, Loretta Young, Olivia de Havilland, Bob Hope, Will 
Rogers, Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Clara Bow, Gloria 
Swanson and Tom Mix. 
</P>
<P>
	``The silent film people always get the shaft. This is more a  
comment on a lack of cinema literacy,'' film critic and historian 
Leonard Maltin said. ``But who on this list isn't deserving? I'd 
find it hard to argue against anyone who's on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFI compilation also paid little regard to musicals.  
Astaire, Miss Rogers and Miss Garland appeared from that film 
genre, but Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	By design, current box office stars like Tom Hanks, Meryl  
Streep, John Travolta, Harrison Ford and Susan Sarandon weren't 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	AFI defined ``American screen legend'' as an actor with a  
significant presence in movies whose debut occurred before 1951 or 
whose debut occurred after 1950 but produced a significant body of 
work before the performer's death. 
</P>
<P>
	That allowed the inclusion of James Dean (No. 18) and Grace  
Kelly (No. 13). 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were asked to consider five criteria: star quality  
(charisma and presence), craft (ability to embody different 
characters), legacy (body of work), popularity and historical 
context. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballots were sent to more than 1,800 people in the film industry  
-- both behind and in front of the camera -- critics, writers, 
cultural leaders, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. It 
wasn't known whether Clinton and Gore voted. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment writers and editors of The Associated Press, in a  
recently compiled list of the 25 most significant stars of the 
century, also selected Bogart, Miss Bacall and Miss Hepburn, but 
included Fairbanks, Valentino and Laurel and Hardy. Not limited by 
the AFI's rules, the AP also singled out Jack Nicholson, Meryl 
Streep, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mickey Mouse.

	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- Bruno Balke, a man considered to be a  
founding father in sports medicine, died on June 7. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, Balke was recruited by the Air Force to teach at the  
School of Aviation Medicine in Texas. He spent a decade at the 
school, investigating human adaptation to high altitude, deep space 
simulation and in-flight stress. 
</P>
<P>
	He later taught at the University of Oklahoma before he accepted  
a position at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1964. While 
teaching there, he wrote several papers linking oxygen consumption, 
exercise and health. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, he helped create the American College of Sports  
Medicine.

academic whose work shed light on the lives of ordinary people in 
classical times, died May 31 of a brain tumor. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd was just 24 when he was appointed field director at the  
site of the ancient Greek and Roman city of Berenice, now part of 
the Libyan port of Benghazi. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next three years, his team completed a major excavation  
and compiled a large amount of data about life in Berenice in the 
three centuries before Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, he joined a group of archaeologists studying the  
history of the Biferno valley east of Rome, home to Samnite 
warriors who resisted Rome's expansion in the Italian peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1977 to 1988, Lloyd taught at Sheffield University, then  
moved to Oxford, where he taught until 1989. He became a fellow of

<HEADLINE> Orange Co. Bankruptcy Case Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Standard &AMP; Poor's has agreed to pay  
$140,000 to settle a lawsuit in which Orange County accused the 
rating agency of failing to warn against issuing bonds just before 
the county declared bankruptcy in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, announced Tuesday, must be approved by a judge.  
The county's $2 billion suit against S&AMP;P was the last one pending 
among the county's more than two dozen lawsuits against finance and 
securities firms, and former financial advisers and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, the $140,000 would mean that the county has  
recovered $860.7 million, or more than half of the $1.64 billion it 
lost in the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The settlement with Standard &AMP; Poor's represents the final  
step necessary to put the litigation surrounding Orange County's 
bankruptcy to a conclusion,'' Thomas Hayes, the federal bankruptcy 
court-appointed overseer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Final court approval was anticipated in about four months.  
</P>
<P>
	The county had argued that S&AMP;P gave its highest ratings to  
one-year notes and multiyear bonds that the county issued in 1994, 
just before it declared bankruptcy and that S&AMP;P should have warned 
county officials against issuing the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard &AMP; Poor's countered that its liability should be  
determined under federal rather than state law. Federal law limits 
a defendant's damages to its fair share of the blame, while state 
law allows individual lawsuits for such claims. The company also 
said its ratings were protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the county  
would have to show S&AMP;P acted with ``actual malice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the county's other suits related to its bankruptcy have  
been settled out-of-court including in December 1998 when U.S. 
District Judge Gary Taylor approved a total of $703 million in 
settlements, the largest being $447.7 million from Merrill Lynch &AMP; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The county filed for bankruptcy protection in December 1994  
after it was revealed that risky investments by Treasurer Robert L. 
Citron on behalf of cities, schools and special districts had lost 
$1.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The county emerged from bankruptcy in 1996, but still has $1.3  
million in debt stemming from the investment losses, Orange County 
Chief Financial Officer Gary Burton said earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Internet CEO Bares Chest on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Call it a naked publicity stunt.  
</P>
<P>
	Eager to create some buzz for his online software retailer,  
Beyond.com president Mark Breier appeared on an interview with 
CNBC's ``Squawk Box'' show Tuesday morning wearing only boxer 
shorts, his glasses and a mischievous grin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bare-all appearance was in keeping with the company's ad  
campaign, which shows a guy so comfortable working from home that 
he walks around the house naked, to the chagrin of the neighbors 
and the package delivery man. 
</P>
<P>
	Breier said he was just trying to shake up the often staid world  
of financial news commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``CNBC is famous for framed talking heads bobbing on the  
screen,'' Breier said in an interview following his appearance. 
``We thought it was a neat twist to throw a little surprise on the 
CNBC viewers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hosts of the show certainly seemed surprised, even though  
the company had warned CNBC officials that Breier planned to appear 
wearing only boxer shorts during the satellite interview from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the hosts hadn't been fully briefed.  
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, CNBC host Joe Kernen covered his face and  
looked down at his desk to avoid looking at Breier, who grinned 
boyishly into the camera and held up the tiny microphone since he 
had no clothes on which to pin it. 
</P>
<P>
	By way of explanation, the clearly nonplussed Kernen borrowed a  
line from a Seinfeld episode, saying that ``my quota for naked men 
today is zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show's other hosts took Breier's buff appearance in stride.  
Anchor Mark Haines, peppered Breier with several questions and 
thanked him for the ``revealing'' interview. 
</P>
<P>
	While CNBC doesn't plan to make a habit of interviewing scantily  
clad CEOs, they didn't get too bent out of shape by Breier's stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't really control what CEOs wear or don't wear to  
interviews,'' network spokeswoman Martine Charles said. ``We 
concentrate on getting the best information for the investing 
audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breier may have caught a little wave of publicity with his  
appearance, but early indications are that other Internet 
executives will not be following suit with au naturel interviews 
any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Amazon.com chief Jeff Bezos would consider a similar  
tactic, company spokesman Bill Curry quipped: ``Barring 
developments, I am sure we will remain dot-clothed.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 31.66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved moderately higher Tuesday as  
investors scooped up Internet, pharmaceutical and oil company 
shares at bargain prices, but the mood on Wall Street remained 
tense ahead of Wednesday's report on consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 31.66 to 10,594.99.  
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose slightly. The  
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 16.36 to 2,414.67 and 
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 gained 7.16 to 1,301.16. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the calm before the storm,'' said David Orr, chief  
economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were hoping Wednesday's consumer price report for May  
would provide clues about inflation and whether the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates to slow the economy's growth when its 
Open Market Committee meets June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also looking forward to Fed Chairman Alan  
Greenspan's testimony before Congress on Thursday for hints about 
what action the Fed might take. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market, worried that higher rates will hurt corporate  
profits, has been nervous ever since the April Consumer Price 
Index, released May 14, showed the highest increase in consumer 
prices in nine years. Days later the Fed announced it was leaning 
toward increasing interest rates if necessary to stifle inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	A 309-point drop in the Dow last week reflected the market's  
expectation that rates will indeed rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A strengthening bond market prodded stocks higher for much of  
Tuesday's session, until Treasury prices fell late in the day. The 
benchmark 30-year bond yielded 6.10 percent, up from 6.09 percent 
on Monday, but still lower than the 19-month high of 6.16 percent 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet stocks, some of which have seen their prices  
fall by nearly half since April, recouped some of their losses. 
Those gaining ground included America Online, up 4 1/4 at 94 3/4, 
Amazon.com, up 4 1/2 at 96 1/2 and Yahoo!, up 6 at 125 1/4. Still, analysts 
said they expect the correction in Internet issues to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks are no longer riding high because there are so  
many more of them, Orr said. ``Supply is now equal to demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several big pharmaceutical stocks, which also have been battered  
since April, were picked up by bargain hunters. Pfizer was up 2 
7/16 at 97 9/16, Merck rose 1 3/8 at 67 5/8 and American Home Products 
rose 1 3/16 at 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were led by Dow components Exxon , up 1 at 82 1/8 , and  
Chevron, up 1 1/4 at 96. 
</P>
<P>
	But Coca-Cola, another Dow stock, fell 1 1/16 to 63 3/4 after  
Belgian officials banned sales of the company's soft drinks amid 
reports of people becoming ill after drinking them. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the market kept its focus on the economy.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are getting more optimistic about a benign CPI report  
and the possibility that the Fed is going to make its notion 
clear,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston. 
</P>
<P>
	If the CPI numbers are worse than expected, Riley warned the  
market might suffer a severe drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 6-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Composite volume totaled 842.40 million shares, up from 813.16  
million in Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 2.68 to 622.28, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.23 to 763.92 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.48 to 434.01  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.54 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 1.34 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
1.26 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.64 percent.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds Spinoff Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the nation's  
second-biggest cigarette company, began operating on its own 
Tuesday after being spun off from the conglomerate at the center of 
the most famous takeover battle of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. distributed shares in the maker of  
Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes to RJR shareholders after the 
stock market closed on Monday, creating a separate $5.7 billion 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to be operating once again as a  
freestanding, publicly traded company,'' said Andrew Schindler, 
president and chief executive of R.R. Reynolds Tobacco. The tobacco 
company had been the foundation for RJR Nabisco and now trades on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff left RJR Nabisco with an 80 percent stake in Nabisco  
Holdings Corp., which makes Oreo cookies and Planters nuts. So it 
renamed itself Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. and will also trade on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	In NYSE trading, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco closed at $32.43 3/4 a  
share, up 18 3/4 cents from where it had been trading in expectation 
of the spinoff, and Nabisco Group Holdings closed at $21.56 1/4, up 25 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Financier Carl Icahn, who had been pushing RJR Nabisco leaders  
for a breakup for several years, didn't wait around for the 
spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	He disclosed in a government filing that he had sold his entire  
8 percent stake of RJR Nabisco shares late in Monday's session for 
about $813 million. That was about $130 million more than he paid 
for the stock accumulated over the past eight months, said people 
close to Icahn who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco won wide attention as the target of a 1980s takeover  
battle chronicled in the book ``Barbarians at the Gate.'' It was 
taken private in a $25 billion deal that long ranked as the biggest 
corporate buyout on record. But the heavy debt hobbled its growth 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn and other backers of a breakup long argued that Wall  
Street failed to appreciate the value in the company's food 
interests because of concerns about potential legal liability for 
its sibling tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	They say separating the two businesses will eventually mean a  
higher combined stock price for investors than they would have seen 
with food and tobacco under the same parent. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR chairman and chief executive Steven Goldstone had supported  
the concept of a breakup but had resisted moving ahead in part 
because of concerns about the legal environment for tobacco 
companies and the possibility that a breakup would face lengthy 
challenges in court. 
</P>
<P>
	But the major tobacco companies agreed late last year to pay  
$206 billion over 25 years to settle claims by 46 states for the 
health costs they were paying for treating sick smokers. That 
resolved one huge perceived legal threat. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Goldstone announced RJR had reached an agreement to  
sell its international tobacco business for $7.8 billion to Japan 
Tobacco Co. and that the board had decided to split up its 
remaining tobacco and food businesses. The board eventually 
proposed spinning off the tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn had favored a different method for breaking up the  
company, saying it should spin off its food interests and keep its 
U.S. tobacco operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that spinning off the food business would more clearly  
shield it from those who may win liability awards against the 
tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goldstone said the tobacco spinoff could probably be  
accomplished more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn assembled a slate of candidate for the board to push his  
plan, but gave up the fight before the May shareholders meeting 
when it appeared he would not get the support of other large 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The financier sold the more than 25.7 million shares of RJR  
Nabisco stock for $31.62 1/2 a share to undisclosed buyers, the filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission said. RJR closed at $32 
a share on Monday. In the spinoff, shareholders received one share 
of the new tobacco company for every three shares of the old RJR. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco company will continue to be based in Winston-Salem,  
N.C., and employs about 8,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Schindler was the only company insider among directors named to  
the tobacco company's board on Tuesday. Others include Joseph 
Viviano, vice chairman of Hershey Foods Corp.; Nana Mensah, 
president and chief operating officer of Long John Silver's 
Restaurants Inc., and Denise Ilitch, vice chairwoman of Little 
Caesar Enterprises Inc.

	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Players shouldn't expect a reprieve from  
nasty rough conditions in future U.S. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	The rough at Pinehurst No. 2 has been trimmed from 4 inches to 3  
for the 99th Open, and it will stay that length throughout the 
tournament, according to U.S. Golf Association officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Jett, golf course superintendent for No. 2, on Tuesday said  
he has been instructed by the USGA to mow the rough each night 
through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Originally we requested 4 inches last fall,'' Tim Moraghan of  
the USGA said. ``Paul went above and beyond that and gave us 4 of 
the best inches I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bermuda rough, unusual for an Open, was lowered because the  
USGA didn't want players just hacking the ball out toward the 
fairway, Moraghan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to give them a little bit of an opportunity to go  
for the pin,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Moraghan insisted the lowering of the rough isn't a  
change in Open philosophy -- and won't be the case next year at 
Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say it will only be for this week,'' Moraghan  
said. ``Here, we are dealing with a warm season grass and it has 
the tendency to grab the club a little more. It's harder to play 
out of. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had the cut of rough at 5 or 6 inches we could have a  
lost ball 5 or 6 feet off the edge of the fairway, and I don't 
think we want to do that. We've not out here to embarrass 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WOODS WORDS:* Apparently the father of Tiger Woods isn't too  
fond of golf's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published in the May-June issue of Icon, a  
bimonthly men's magazine, Earl Woods was quoted making ethnic and 
racial slurs at Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's for white people,'' the elder Woods said of Scotland.  
``It has the sorriest weather. People had better be happy that the 
Scots lived there instead of the soul brothers -- the game of golf 
would have never been invented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine goes on to quote Earl Woods saying: ``We wouldn't  
have been stupid enough to go out in that weather and play a 
silly-... game and freeze to death. We would have been inside 
listening to jazz, laughing and joking, and drinking rum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Woods, 67, said the quotes were fabricated.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the author of the interview, Susan Zakin, said she  
taped the conversation and that it took place over the telephone 
Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, 23, refused to comment on the article when asked  
about it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUVAL PREDICTS:* David Duval was asked to name some of the  
favorites for this week's Open. He paused for a long time, then 
rattled off a long list of players that included Tiger Woods, 
Justin Leonard, Davis Love III and Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the setup is it brings a lot more people into the  
mix,'' Duval, the world's No. 1 player, said. ``When you play a 
typical Open, the fairway is going to be narrow and the rough is 
going to be high. But here, you have the options of advancing the 
ball -- that brings more people into play. I think it's a lot more 
wide open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval wouldn't predict what the winning score would be.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PAYING THE RENT:* Tiger Woods was invited to stay at a house  
with good friend Mark O'Meara this week in Pinehurst. The golfers 
are also neighbors in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two still haven't settled on Woods' rent.  
</P>
<P>
	``He mentioned something, but I said that's OK,'' O'Meara said.  
``If he wins, I'll definitely give him the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MICKELSON MAKES IT:* Phil Mickelson was a late arrival at  
Pinehurst on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson flew into town after going to a doctor's appointment  
with his wife, Amy, who is expecting the couple's first child at 
the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NORMAN ARRIVES:* Greg Norman, who is having trouble with his  
putting, arrived at No. 2 Tuesday and played a late practice round 
by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman withdrew from Monday's final round at Memphis after  
rounds of 66, 72 and 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman, who had shoulder surgery in April 1998, said he didn't  
withdraw for health reasons. Instead, he said once he fell back in 
the pack he wanted an extra day to prepare for the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my reasons, but I basically saw what the weather  
forecast was going to be and one of the tour officials told me what 
was going to happen Sunday (if it rained), so I decided to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a genius,'' Norman added. ``I came home and I practiced  
my short game all day Sunday, bump-and-run stuff that we knew we 
needed up here. We did the same thing Monday. Now, let's hope it 
pays off. I thought it was more beneficial to my game to go home 
than to stay there and finish 58th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman was buzzing around the course and was waved through a  
threesome that included Tiger Woods on the second hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to tee off before 3 o'clock and spent six hours  
out there,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GRAND SLAM:* Jose Maria Olazabal laughed Tuesday when asked  
about the possibility of winning golf's Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	The talented golfer from Spain won the Masters in April, but  
said it's inconceivable that he could follow that with victories in 
the three other majors -- the U.S. Open, British Open and PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe nowadays that the closest thing to impossible  
is winning the Grand Slam in a single year,'' Olazabal said. ``I 
might be wrong, but the level of the game nowadays is so high, and 
there are so many players that can really win all the events, it 
makes it really tough for just one player to win all four.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COLTART WITHDRAWS:* Andrew Coltart of England has withdrawn  
from the Open because of a torn muscle between his ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Coltart, 29, will be replaced by alternate Edward Pfister of La  
Quinta, Calif. Pfister shot rounds of 69 and 72 in sectional 
qualifying June 7 at Tarzana, Calif.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds Spinoff Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the nation's  
second-biggest cigarette company, began operating on its own 
Tuesday after being spun off from the conglomerate at the center of 
the most famous takeover battle of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. distributed shares in the maker of  
Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes to RJR shareholders after the 
stock market closed on Monday, creating a separate $5.7 billion 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to be operating once again as a  
freestanding, publicly traded company,'' said Andrew Schindler, 
president and chief executive of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. The tobacco 
company had been the foundation for RJR Nabisco and now trades on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff left RJR Nabisco with an 80 percent stake in Nabisco  
Holdings Corp., which makes Oreo cookies and Planters nuts. So it 
renamed itself Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. and will also trade on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	In NYSE trading, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco closed at $32.43 3/4 a  
share, up 18 3/4 cents from where it had been trading in expectation 
of the spinoff, and Nabisco Group Holdings closed at $21.56 1/4, up 25 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Financier Carl Icahn, who had been pushing RJR Nabisco leaders  
for a breakup for several years, didn't wait around for the 
spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	He disclosed in a government filing that he had sold his entire  
8 percent stake of RJR Nabisco shares late in Monday's session for 
about $813 million. That was about $130 million more than he paid 
for the stock accumulated over the past eight months, said people 
close to Icahn who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco won wide attention as the target of a 1980s takeover  
battle chronicled in the book ``Barbarians at the Gate.'' It was 
taken private in a $25 billion deal that long ranked as the biggest 
corporate buyout on record. But the heavy debt hobbled its growth 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn and other backers of a breakup long argued that Wall  
Street failed to appreciate the value in the company's food 
interests because of concerns about potential legal liability for 
its sibling tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	They say separating the two businesses will eventually mean a  
higher combined stock price for investors than they would have seen 
with food and tobacco under the same parent. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR chairman and chief executive Steven Goldstone had supported  
the concept of a breakup but had resisted moving ahead in part 
because of concerns about the legal environment for tobacco 
companies and the possibility that a breakup would face lengthy 
challenges in court. 
</P>
<P>
	But the major tobacco companies agreed late last year to pay  
$206 billion over 25 years to settle claims by 46 states for the 
health costs they were paying for treating sick smokers. That 
resolved one huge perceived legal threat. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Goldstone announced RJR had reached an agreement to  
sell its international tobacco business for $7.8 billion to Japan 
Tobacco Co. and that the board had decided to split up its 
remaining tobacco and food businesses. The board eventually 
proposed spinning off the tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn had favored a different method for breaking up the  
company, saying it should spin off its food interests and keep its 
U.S. tobacco operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that spinning off the food business would more clearly  
shield it from those who may win liability awards against the 
tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goldstone said the tobacco spinoff could probably be  
accomplished more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn assembled a slate of candidate for the board to push his  
plan, but gave up the fight before the May shareholders meeting 
when it appeared he would not get the support of other large 
shareholders.

a share on Monday. In the spinoff, shareholders received one share 
of the new tobacco company for every three shares of the old RJR.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Player Adjusts to New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Danielle Fotopoulos' eyes grow wide  
whenever she spots an opening. More often than not, she has surged 
through those holes and scored goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Fotopoulos' eyes also grow wide when she talks about joining the  
U.S. women's national team. She chuckles a bit, too, as she looks 
around the media tent and sees eight players with more than 100 
international appearances for the American squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm learning from the best in the world every day,''  
Fotopoulos said. ``It makes the transition from college to being a 
professional much easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fotopoulos always has made soccer look easy. At the University  
of Florida, she scored 118 goals, breaking a record shared by 
current teammates Tiffeny Milbrett and U.S. soccer icon Mia Hamm, 
and led the Gators to the national title. Fotopoulos scored the 
only goal when Florida edged North Carolina for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she is on the same side as Hamm, the sport's career goals  
leader, Milbrett and such other stars as Michelle Akers, Julie 
Foudy and Kristine Lilly. Fotopoulos is part of a squad favored to 
win its second World Cup -- the Americans took the initial 
tournament in 1991, then finished third in '95 before winning the 
1996 Olympic title. 
</P>
<P>
	But she is not a major contributor quite yet. In Hamm, Milbrett,  
Lilly, Cindy Parlow and Shannon MacMillan, the Americans have 
plenty of veteran firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do what I can when I get into the game,'' she said.  
``If we need to score a goal, I want to be the one who scored. I'm 
going to work hard each day to become a starter. But that's why we 
are great. We all want that, to start and contribute, so you'd 
better adapt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fotopoulos has four goals and three assists in 13 games this  
year, eight goals in 22 internationals. She's confident bigger 
numbers will come with more playing time, but understands her time 
might not quite be here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard coming in to the team and accepting my role of a  
person who might come in later in a game, rather than playing the 
whole game,'' she said. ``But to win, you must accept a role the 
best you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And accept the attention and pressure placed on a team whose  
success could be the catalyst for a boom in women's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mentality of the team is it took 12 years to get where  
they are, not only on the field, but off it,'' she said. ``They 
want to maintain that, and they want to do something for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all know what can come of the sport and how it is  
building and that we are role models for youngsters and for our 
sport. We have to be role models for each other, too, and the 
players on this team carry that weight so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They carried that weight pretty well at the Atlanta Olympics,  
where 76, 481 fans came to watch the gold medal game against China. 
Fotopoulos was in Athens, Ga., for the game, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just get chills thinking of that game,'' she said. ``It is  
definitely a great memory of my life. I really felt a part of it, 
because I was in the residency program and worked out with them. So 
in my own way, I helped the team, helped the girls to win the 
Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next, she'd like to help the United States win the World Cup,  
which begins with the Americans playing Denmark on Saturday at 
Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting time,'' Fotopoulos said, ``and I'm thankful  
to be a part of it.''

<HEADLINE> S. Baptists To Recruit in Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The president of the Southern Baptists called on  
members of the nation's largest Protestant denomination today to 
recruit in inner cities and shun ``touchy-touchy feely-feely'' 
worship and creative Biblical interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech opening the denomination's annual meeting, the Rev.  
Paige Patterson urged Southern Baptists to pool their resources to 
reach out to urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Southern Baptists,'' he said, ``will you weep before God until  
God gives us the souls of the cities?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Phil Roberts of the convention's North American Mission  
Board said the plan is to start one to four ``flagship churches'' 
in 17 cities over a 10-year period, and start neighborhood churches 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mark a dramatic shift for a denomination whose 16  
million members live mostly in the suburbs, small towns and rural 
areas. The denomination was formed in 1845 by rural whites who 
insisted on their right to own slaves. During the civil rights era, 
blacks were not welcome in most Southern Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, though, the denomination has tried to reach out to  
blacks and has apologized for tolerating racism. It now has an 
estimated 2,800 churches with mostly black members -- a small 
fraction of the thousands of black Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. David K. Campbell of New Orleans appreciated  
Patterson's emphasis on evangelizing in urban areas but thought the 
minister might not have gone far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a heart for the cities,'' Campbell said. ``But I was  
hoping that he would talk about reaching out along racial lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his call for more diversity in the church membership,  
Patterson made clear that he does not believe it should be 
accomplished with modern methods of preaching. He railed against 
pastors who replace the Bible with banter in their services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twelve minute sermonettes generated by the `felt needs' of an  
assembled cast of postmodern listeners augmented by drama and 
multiple repetitions of touchy-touchy, feely-feely music is the 
call of the hour,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Southern Baptists should be moved only by the Bible.  
</P>
<P>
	``For most Baptists it is settled forever -- we believe every  
syllable of the word of God to be absolutely true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson's speech received a generally warm response, though  
many moderate Baptists are not at this convention and attendance is 
around 11,000, short of expectations. Previous meetings have been 
filled with fighting between moderates and conservatives and marked 
by grand pronouncements, such as the 1997 Disney boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was on the money,'' said Douglas Clark, a seminary student  
from Germantown, Tenn., who showed his approval with applause and 
cries of ``Amen!'' ``We're here to preach the word of God, not 
entertain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. David Key, director of Baptist Studies at Emory  
University's Candler School of Theology, said Patterson is ignoring 
growing movements away from fundamentalism in the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went after charismatic, community churches and Generation X  
churches,'' Key said. ``Most moderates have not the left the 
denomination and they don't believe in the straight fundamentalist 
interpretation of the Scripture. The freedom to interpret is the 
issue, and he doesn't want to give any freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Patterson, 56, was re-elected to a second one-year  
term as president of the convention. He ran unopposed.

<HEADLINE> Gas Station Owners Sue Oil Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Independent gasoline station owners on  
Tuesday filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Texaco Inc., Shell Oil 
Co. and a Saudi oil company of conspiring to fix gasoline prices 
and force them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent owners contend Shell, Texaco and Saudi Refining  
Inc. have tried to use joint marketing agreements to fix prices 
while raising rents and the wholesale price dealers must pay for 
gasoline. The goal, the owners contend, is to replace small 
independents with bigger company-owned operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Company representatives said the allegations were false.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court lawsuit claims prices have been fixed  
since 1996 through joint refining and marketing ventures 
established by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past 18 months, the prices dealers have paid for gas  
have risen between 25 cents and 55 cents per gallon, said Tom 
Bleau, co-counsel for the 39 dealers named as plaintiffs in the 
suit. Over the same period, the price in the gasoline futures 
market has declined by more than 4 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rent increases have ranged from 30 percent to 100 percent, Bleau  
said. An independent dealer rents a gas station location from an 
oil company, but owns the business itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a straight, old-fashioned price-fixing agreement,'' said  
Joseph Alioto, another attorney for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks unspecified damages and to have the joint  
ventures dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies refine and market gasoline in the eastern  
United States through Houston-based Motiva Enterprises LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco and Shell refine and market in the West and Midwest  
through a separate firm, Equilon Enterprises LLC, also based in 
Houston. Saudi Refining is not part of Equilon. 
</P>
<P>
	A third company, Equiva Services, provides various services to  
Motiva and Equilon. The three ventures also were named in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of Equilon, Motiva and Equiva was done for  
legitimate business reasons,'' said Andy Norman, a spokesman for 
Texaco. ``It was totally proper and the formation of those 
companies has led to a number of efficiencies in our ... 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of the ventures was the subject of an investigation by  
the Federal Trade Commission and attorney generals in several 
states where the companies operate. No wrongdoing was found, Norman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Equilon issued a statement calling the allegations preposterous.  
Calls to the other defendants were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, dealers contend their rents and prices were raised  
soon after the joint ventures began. As a result, they have had to 
sell gasoline at uncompetitive prices, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Small stations, whether independent or company owned, have  
struggled to sell enough gasoline to stay open, but ``these are 
market forces. They're not collusion,'' said Bill Berman, publisher 
of The Pump Price Report, a weekly survey of gasoline prices and 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not intentional efforts by the refiners or  
wholesalers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several independents spoke in support of the suit at a news  
conference Tuesday. Joseph Alio, who runs a Shell station in East 
Los Angeles, said his sales volume has dropped by about 25 percent 
over the past three years. He not only lost direct revenue from 
sales, but rebates given as a reward for achieving high sales 
volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Alio's gasoline on Tuesday was priced at $1.35 a gallon, leaving  
him a profit of 8 cents on each gallon sold. The profit margin 
would be adequate if he could regain his old sales volume. He 
can't, he said, because two nearby Arco stations sell for $1.19 a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Another owner, Leopoldo Ramirez said he closed his West Covina,  
Calif., station last year after sales fell from about 100,000 
gallons per month to 35,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas station business has grown increasingly difficult in  
recent years. The number of service stations in the United States 
has dropped sharply during the past five years, from 202,800 to 
177,800, according to a survey by National Petroleum News, a trade 
magazine. The survey did not include separate numbers for 
independent dealers.

<HEADLINE> Bonnie Raitt, Musical Pals Team Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonnie Raitt had so much fun jamming with her  
musical pals during a recent benefit that she wants to take them 
all on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Raitt has teamed up with Jackson Browne, Bruce Hornsby, Shawn  
Colvin and David Lindley to meld their acoustic work into a 
five-person touring band. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea started when we were doing acoustic benefits  
together,'' Raitt said Tuesday. ``Last December, Jackson, Bruce and 
I did some shows for Hurricane Mitch relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few days after, we called each other and said that it was so  
much fun, we should really try to take this out on tour. We 
immediately thought to call Shawn Colvin and David Lindley to see 
if they would like to join up, with the idea we would all be one 
band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colvin didn't have to think twice.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard about this band, I couldn't wait to go see it,''  
Colvin said. ``Then I realized I was in it. Now I don't know what 
to do except pinch myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tour is expected to begin in August.

<HEADLINE>  May Named Top College Woman Athlete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Misty May, who helped Long Beach State to a  
perfect season and the volleyball national championship, was 
selected Monday night as the winner of the Honda-Broderick Cup as 
the nation's top college female athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	May, a two-time All-American setter for the Forty Niners, became  
only the second volleyball player to win the award, which was first 
given in 1976. Deitre Collins of Hawaii was the first, winning in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want everybody to have a chance to win this, but you're  
greedy,'' May said. ``In the back of my head, this is what I 
wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May noted that she came from a tennis-loving family.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone on my mother's side played tennis. All my relatives.  
Tennis was the way to go,'' she said. ``They never gave volleyball 
the same respect as tennis. I was sort of the black sheep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior from Costa Mesa, Calif., May was the co-MVP of the NCAA  
Final Four as her team completed a 36-0 season with a win over Penn 
State in the national title match. In the final, May had 70 
assists, 11 digs, nine kills and four blocks. For the tournament, 
May set an NCAA record with 20 aces. 
</P>
<P>
	May will spend the summer training with the U.S. national team  
in Colorado Springs, Colo., and touring with the team in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	May, a senior majoring in kinesiology/physical education, was  
among 11 finalists, all of whom received Honda Awards for being the 
best in their respective sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The other finalists were Danielle Fotopoulos of Florida for  
soccer, Danielle Henderson of Massachusetts for softball, Karin 
Lichey of Georgia for gymnastics, Katie McGregor of Michigan for 
cross-country, Martina Moravcova of SMU for swimming, Grace Park of 
Arizona State for golf, Suziann Reid of Texas for track and field, 
Mimi Smith of Old Dominion for field hockey, Stephanie 
White-McCarty of Purdue for basketball, and Vanessa Webb of Duke 
for tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner was selected by a national vote involving more than  
900 NCAA-member schools. The announcement and presentation of the 
awards was made at the Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Also presented Honda Awards for players of the year in their  
respective divisions were Melinda Almazan, a volleyball player from 
Division II Regis University; and Kelly Schade, a softball player 
for Division III Simpson College. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeni Jones, a volleyball player from Florida who came back from  
a neurological disorder, was presented with the Honda Inspiration 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Past winners of the Honda-Broderick Cup include Chamique  
Holdsclaw of Tennessee (1997-98, for basketball); Mia Hamm of North 
Carolina (1993-94, for soccer); Jackie Joyner of UCLA (1984-85, for

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `Tarzan' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After seeing the ballroom whirl in ``Beauty and the Beast'' and  
2,000 Huns charge on horseback in ``Mulan,'' moviegoers have a 
right to expect gems of animation from Disney's artists. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Tarzan,'' they won't be disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	Watch Tarzan whiz through the jungle canopy, surfing along  
branches. Watch him save Jane from a pack of baboons, and fight a 
leopard to the death. Hold onto your popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not all. Disney's animators combined traditional and  
computer techniques to create a deeply atmospheric jungle. You feel 
the humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the setting for a story that's entertaining but not quite  
as memorable as some of its scenes. An opening sequence deftly 
shows how the infant Tarzan comes to be adopted by the gorilla 
mother Kala (voiced by Glenn Close). In childhood, his gorilla pals 
deride him as ``the hairless wonder'' and Kala's mate makes it 
clear Tarzan is not really part of the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarzan vows to become ``the best ape ever,'' but in a fast-paced  
montage he develops in a most human-like way, throwing spears, 
tying branches, and doing that branch-surfing trick. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he's a young man (with the voice of Tony Goldwyn) he meets  
Jane (voiced by Minnie Driver). She arrives with her father and the 
malevolent guide Clayton to study gorillas. Tarzan and Jane get 
mighty interested in each other, of course. But evil intrudes as 
Clayton tries to capture Tarzan's ape relatives to sell back in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	You can take it from here. The movie makes much of Tarzan having  
to choose between being a gorilla or a person. Rest assured that he 
and Jane end up happily together. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some wonderfully clever scenes in this movie, like one  
that shows the 5-year-old Tarzan trying to snatch a hair from an 
elephant's tail, and the fast-paced sequence that takes him from 
childhood to adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you didn't get enough of Timon and Pumbaa from ``The Lion  
King'' and its video sequel, you can see them reincarnated in two 
of Tarzan's pals, Terk the ape and Tantor the elephant. Who'd have 
thought that Rosie O'Donnell (the voice of Terk) would sound so 
much like Nathan Lane (who voiced Timon)? 
</P>
<P>
	By Disney's count, this is the 48th movie adaptation of the  
Tarzan story but the first full-length animated feature. Good idea. 
It's a treat to look at. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tarzan,'' rated G, includes songs by Phil Collins. It's  
produced by Bonnie Arnold (``Toy Story'') and directed by Kevin 
Lima and Chris Buck.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Resists Security Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is resisting  
a presidential advisory group's call for dramatic revamping of his 
department in light of decades of lax security and controversy over 
the theft of nuclear secrets at federal weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blistering report, a special panel of the president's  
intelligence advisory board called for putting all nuclear weapons 
programs under a semiautonomous agency within the department or 
creating a totally independent agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``An independent agency is out of the question,'' said  
Richardson in an interview. Even a semiautonomous agency, ``I don't 
think is a good idea.'' He said it would create ``a new fiefdom'' 
and conflict with his efforts to streamline and strengthen 
counterintelligence and security directly under the energy 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The brouhaha over the loss of nuclear secrets, dating back to  
the 1980s, has prompted proposals in Congress to isolate and 
strengthen the authority of the nuclear programs within the Energy 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., who has proposed a largely self-contained  
Nuclear Security Agency within the DOE, said the advisory panel's 
recommendation will spur congressional action. ``It's hard hitting 
and the recommendation is almost exactly what we've been 
suggesting,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, who has proposed similar changes  
at DOE in the House, said improved security will be impossible 
``without major organizational reform'' as recommended by the 
intelligence panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The intelligence board, chaired by former Republican Sen. Warren  
Rudman of New Hampshire, concluded in a report released late Monday 
that an entrenched bureaucracy at the DOE has resisted security and 
anti-espionage measures for decades and that even today change is 
being resisted by mid-level bureaucrats and a ``culture of 
arrogance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps most troubling ... is the evidence that the lab  
bureaucracies, after months at the epicenter of an espionage 
scandal with serious implications for U.S. foreign policy, are 
still resisting reforms,'' the panel of the Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board said in its 57-page report. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he agreed with the Rudman report that there  
needs to be ``more accountability and centralization of security'' 
at the department and in the weapons labs. But he said ``what I 
don't want is micromanagement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson in recent months has consolidated counterintelligence  
activities and is searching for a ``security czar'' that would 
directly report to him on all security issues involving nuclear 
defense programs including activities at the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudman briefed President Clinton on the panel's findings Monday  
and told him only a dramatic restructuring of the Energy Department 
would ensure that lax attitudes toward security would change. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said today his administration ``has taken  
unprecedented steps to reduce the vulnerability of our secrets at 
the labs.'' He said he will carefully review the report's 
proposals. ``We remain committed to taking the necessary steps to 
safeguard our nation's secrets,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In its scathing report, the panel said the department was  
``incapable of reforming itself'' and that while measures by Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson to improve security were welcomed, there 
was no assurance they ``will gain more than a toehold'' once 
Richardson departs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organizational disarray, managerial neglect and a culture of  
arrogance -- both at DOE headquarters and the labs themselves -- 
conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure improved safeguards against the theft of nuclear  
secrets, the panel suggested two alternatives: create a 
semiautonomous agency within the Energy Department with ``a clear 
mission'' to maintain the nuclear weapons program; or, turn 
responsibility for nuclear weapons programs, including the labs, 
over to a new independent agency similar to the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the decision on which way to go should be left to the  
president and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The report acknowledges that inattention to security and the  
lack of concern about espionage date back to the creation of the 
Energy Department in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lapses exploded into the open in March when a scientist  
at the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico, Wenn Ho Lee, was fired 
for security violations. He had been suspected of providing secrets 
to China about one of America's most sophisticated warheads in the 
1980s, but has never been charged with a crime. Lee has denied any 
espionage, as has the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rudman panel's report criticized the handling of the Lee  
case by the Justice Department, but did not provide any new 
details, noting that the matter now was the subject of an internal 
Justice review. 
</P>
<P>
	It concluded that over a succession of administrations, dating  
back 20 years or more, an entrenched bureaucracy both at the 
department and in the research labs demonstrated ``an arrogant 
disregard for authority'' and took security and espionage concerns 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its findings, the intelligence panel said, were that:  
</P>
<P>
	--While Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser,  
was briefed about the Lee case and lax security at the labs in 
1996, there was not enough evidence at that time to warrant 
presidential action on security. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1995 or sometime later, authorities found an illegal wiretap  
at an unnamed weapons lab. Although an employee confessed to 
installing the tap, he was never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sometime in the 1980s, listening devices ``were discovered in  
weapons-related facilities.'' The panel cited classified documents 
and gave no further details.

<HEADLINE> Navy Jet Crashes in Persian Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Navy F-14 fighter jet on a routine training  
mission crashed in the north Persian Gulf today after its two crew 
members ejected safely, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot and the radar intercept officer from the F-14A  
``Tomcat'' were recovered aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kitty 
Hawk, the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet said in a statement. The crash 
occurred at 8:30 p.m. local time, or 1:30 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the crew members were withheld pending notification  
of family members. An investigation will be conducted, the Pentagon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kitty Hawk has been in the Gulf since April 20 as part of  
Operation Southern Watch. It had been assigned to the Pacific but 
was ordered to the Gulf so the USS Theodore Roosevelt could join 
NATO's air strikes in the Balkans.

of cancer the day before his 67th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Faloney, who died Monday night, was diagnosed last year with  
colon cancer, which ultimately spread to his liver. Shortly after 
his diagnosis, Faloney went public with his fight and became a 
spokesman for fund-raising to fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback began his CFL career with Edmonton in 1954,  
combining with Jackie Parker to lead the Eskimos to a Grey Cup 
title that season. He joined the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1957, 
leading the Ticats to seven Grey Cup appearances over the next 
eight years. In 1961, he was named the CFL's outstanding player. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to Montreal in 1965 and ended his career two years later  
with the B.C. Lions. Faloney was inducted into the Canadian 
Football Hall of Fame in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Faloney remained in the Hamilton area after his football career,  
forming his own construction company. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Ticats honored Faloney by retiring his jersey in  
a public ceremony and dinner attended by more than 1,400 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Faloney played in nine Grey Cup games during his CFL career,  
winning four. He will be inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of 
Fame on Oct. 6.

<HEADLINE> Fox Sues Turner Over New Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fox sued Turner Broadcasting and its parent  
company Tuesday, claiming Turner's new regional entertainment 
network violated a non-compete agreement the two media companies 
signed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net South asked a Superior Court judge on Tuesday to  
restrain Turner from offering its new network, known as Turner 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., said the Turner  
network, a division of Time Warner Inc., will directly compete with 
Fox's Sports Net South. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a $65 million deal in which Fox acquired SportSouth  
from Turner, the sides agreed in 1996 to a 12-year non-compete 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox claimed after receiving the $65 million payment in 1998,  
Turner ``secretly began to make plans to form its own regional 
cable television sports network to broadcast Atlanta Braves, 
Atlanta Hawks, and Atlanta Thrashers games in direct competition 
with SportSouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner South plans to offer movies, sitcoms, sports and original  
programs designed for the tastes of viewers in six southeastern 
U.S. states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turner intends to try to obscure the fact that Turner South is  
a regional cable sports network by claiming that it also offers 
other types of programming,'' the lawsuit says. ``However, this 
other programming is essentially secondary, with little independent 
value to advertisers, local operators, or subscribers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have complied with all of our contractual obligations to  
Fox,'' Turner spokesman Ronnie Gunnerson said. ``We believe the 
lawsuit regarding Turner South is entirely without merit.''

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquake Rocks Mexico City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook a large swath of  
central Mexico today, killing at least one person, injuring 
hundreds, damaging historic buildings and sending tens of thousands 
of residents fleeing into the streets as buildings swayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The first reports of significant damage of the quake, measured  
at a preliminary magnitude 6.7, were in the city of Puebla, about 
60 miles east of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	One person died and many were wounded, said Dr. Alejandro Soto,  
director of the Puebla city Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials reported major damage to the 300-year-old city hall, a  
colonial-era church, a major highway bridge and other structures. 
</P>
<P>
	Soto estimated about 200 were injured or hurt in the city, 10  
seriously. He also said there were problems with telephone service 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake, which struck at 3:41 p.m. (4:41 p.m. EDT), was  
centered near Huajuapan de Leon, about 125 miles southeast of 
Mexico City and 80 miles south of Puebla, the National 
Seismological Service said. In some areas the quake reportedly 
rumbled for 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ``felt very very strongly,'' said Hector Gonzalez, civil  
defense director of Huajuapan de Leon, a city of about 200,000 
people. He said it knocked out electricity and telephone service, 
but he had no reports of injuries or major damage. 
</P>
<P>
	President Ernesto Zedillo canceled a planned trip to the  
Caribbean coast and said he would fly to Puebla state to assess the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	There no reports of injuries in the Mexican capital in the first  
hour after the quake and only scattered reports of damage. 
Telephone service and power were disrupted in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cuernavaca, about 35 miles to the south of Mexico City, state  
civil defense director Arturo Sotelo said traffic lights were 
knocked out, causing some traffic accidents. He said electricity 
had been disrupted in at least 13 communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Three cars were knocked across the street in front of the  
Guerrero state capital of Chilpancingo, about 115 miles south of 
Mexico City, said Gustavo Pina of the state civil defense agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Streets in Mexico City were crowded with people fearful of  
returning to buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Teposcolula, a few miles south of Huahuapan, the city hall  
partially collapsed, two houses fell and the main church was 
damaged, according to Sergio Hampshire, civil defense director for 
Oaxaca state, but there were no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In another town near Huahuapan, Tamazalupam de Progreso,  
officials said four students at a teaching college were hurt by 
shattering glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's largest recent earthquake, on Sept. 19, 1985, was  
recorded at magnitude 8.1 and killed at least 6,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Meli, director of the National Center for Disaster  
Prevention, told local TV Azteca that Tuesday's quake was ``between 
five and 10 times smaller than the one in 1985.''

<HEADLINE>  Russia Troops in Kosovo Get Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The influential Serbian Orthodox  
Church called today for Slobodan Milosevic to step down, a Russian 
convoy crossed from Bosnia to resupply troops at Pristina's airport 
and Dutch soldiers discovered the charred remains of 20 Kosovo 
villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	The burned bodies found in a home in Velika Krusa are believed  
to be from a mass execution of ethnic Albanians, 860,000 of whom 
fled Kosovo and Serb troops from March until a 78-day NATO air war 
forced Yugoslavia to agree to peace last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went to the house to secure it for investigators from the  
Yugoslav (war crimes) tribunal. We found what looks like the 
remains of 20 burnt bodies and it was horrible,'' said Mike Bos, a 
spokesman for Dutch troops with the KFOR allied peacekeeping force 
just north of Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more mass graves were discovered today in western Kosovo,  
the second straight day of atrocities being unearthed by NATO 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The graves, just off the road leading through Koronica, six  
miles west of Djakovica, hold as many as 150 bodies, residents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A hand and arm protruded from one of the graves and the top of a  
head stuck out from the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, a burned house contained five charred bodies of men who  
appeared to have been shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Shule Morturi, a refugee from Koronica who returned to the  
village today as Italian peacekeeping forces expanded their control 
of the western sector of Kosovo, said Serb forces stormed the 
village April 27, taking away all males over age 16. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, British troops found 81 freshly dug graves in  
Kacanik. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse over the 200-300 Russia troops at Pristina's airport  
continued today when a resupply convoy left Bosnia, where a 
peacekeeping force is based, at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	David Scanlon, a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo, said the Russians  
``deployed a small convoy of 11 vehicles and 29 people.'' At last 
notice, the convoy was moving south of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian brigade told NATO they were taking fuel, water and  
food to the contingent in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	KFOR confirmed the Russians holding the airport asked British  
troops for water and said the British complied. 
</P>
<P>
	The information office of KFOR in Skopje, Macedonia, said an  
ethnic Albanian fired on a car of Serbs in Pristina today, killing 
one person in the car and wounding another. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian rebels emerged today in key areas of this  
war-ravaged province before NATO troops can secure them as Serb 
troops and paramilitaries pulled out of Kosovo to comply with terms 
of an 11-day pullout. 
</P>
<P>
	Several key positions are being taken over by the Kosovo  
Liberation Army, which is supposed to be demilitarized under the 
U.N. Security Council-approved peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 KLA guerrillas have taken over the Morini crossing  
point on the Albanian-Yugoslav border. Most of the refugees fled to 
Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Blace crossing on the Macedonia-Yugoslav border, the  
situation was chaotic. Dozens of civilian cars mingled with U.S. 
tanks. According to the U.N. refugee agency, 1,500 people crossed 
from Blace into Kosovo in the past 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Astrid Van Genderen Stort of the UNHCR said refugees have been  
warned not to go back but they still do -- mostly men to check on 
their houses who planned to return later for their families. 
</P>
<P>
	She said two people were killed and one was seriously wounded  
Monday evening when they tried to cross and set off land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	The West is struggling to reach an agreement with Russia on its  
role in the 50,000-strong peacekeeping mission, 7,000 of whom are 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright plan to meet their Russian counterparts in 
Helsinki, Finland, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has expressed interest in Russian participation in the  
peacekeeping force if their troops are under the command of the 
alliance -- which Moscow has refused. NATO has allocated five 
sectors of Kosovo to different allied forces but Russia wants its 
own sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Hashim Thaci, a senior rebel leader, warned that the KLA  
considers the Russians an unwelcome addition -- ``a provocation'' -- 
to the peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian Orthodox Church -- the most prominent Serb  
institution to call for the president to step down -- demanded 
Milosevic and his government resign, the independent Beta news 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every sensible person has to realize that numerous internal  
problems and ... the isolation of our country on the international 
scene cannot be solved or overcome with this kind of leadership,'' 
said the announcement from the church's highest body, the Holy 
Synod. 
</P>
<P>
	As NATO troops continued to deploy in southern Kosovo, hundreds  
of Yugoslav tanks, army and police vehicles, accompanied by private 
cars of Serb civilians, headed north from Pristina in keeping with 
the withdrawal schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Troops riding atop the vehicles flashed the three-fingered Serb  
salute. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's Serb minority fears the departure of Yugoslav forces --  
which they consider their protectors -- will expose them to reprisal 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring those fears, hundreds of KLA fighters streamed out  
of the mountains today in the Drenica region west of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed KLA fighters were also reported moving into ethnic  
Albanian neighborhoods of Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs on their way out of Kosovo were torching buildings of  
ethnic Albanians. Houses in the village of Donje Ljubce were on 
fire. Serb soldiers carrying gas cans could be seen moving through 
the village as it burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian police and the Yugoslav army were expected to pull most  
of their forces from Pristina today under terms of the peace 
agreement that calls for all 40,000 police, paramilitaries and 
soldiers to be out of the province by Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian police were supposed to vacate their headquarters  
complex in central Pristina by midnight (6 p.m. EDT). 
</P>
<P>
	``We have every indication that the deadline of midnight tonight  
will be met,'' KFOR spokesman Lt. Col. Robin Clifford. 
</P>
<P>
	But departing Serbs first vandalized buildings, smashing  
electrical fixtures, blocking up toilets, breaking doors and 
leaving piles of burned documents.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates urged Congress  
today to avoid burdensome regulations on the booming high-tech 
industry while encouraging investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incredible success of this industry in the United States  
owes a lot to the light hand of government in the technology area, 
the fact that people can take incredible risks and if they're 
successful they can have incredible rewards,'' said Gates, the 
world's wealthiest person. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I'd say the light hand is working very well,'' Gates  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates testified just a few blocks from the federal courthouse  
where his company is fighting government antitrust allegations. He 
has not testified in the trial, although the judge has watched 
hours of videotape showing Gates being questioned by government 
lawyers last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In testifying to a Joint Economic Committee hearing on  
technology, Gates generally steered clear of any discussion of his 
company's legal troubles, even when asked directly by Sen. Charles 
Robb, D-Va., about how he would reform the nation's antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many people who dive into that, but I think the laws  
as they are currently written are fine,'' Gates said, adding: 
``Certainly everything that's gone on in the technology industry 
has come about because of things like integrating new features in 
is one of the freedoms that all companies have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers allege in their antitrust lawsuit that  
Microsoft illegally included its Internet software into its 
dominant Windows computer operating system to undermine a rival 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates also answered questions from three groups of high school  
and college students from around the country via a videoconference 
link. 
</P>
<P>
	An industry group critical of Microsoft, the Project to Promote  
Competition in the Digital Age, accused Gates in a statement of 
choosing ``to appear in a friendly setting where the questions will 
come via the Internet from school children, rather than traveling 
the three blocks to the courthouse where he would be forced to 
testify under oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates spent much of his half-hour appearance describing future  
advances in technology, predicting that consumers will carry 
tablet-size computers connected to wireless networks holding their 
schedules, important telephone numbers and financial information. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day in the not-too-distant future, computers will be able  
to see, listen and speak,'' Gates said. ``At home or in the office, 
you'll be able to control your PC by talking to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' appearance wasn't totally without controversy. A group of  
young people lined one wall of the hearing room wearing white 
T-shirts with messages such as ``Bust the Trust'' and 
``Microsoft-Intel: Corporate predators versus Democracy.''

choosing ``to appear in a friendly setting where the questions will 
come via the Internet from school children, rather than traveling 
the three blocks to the courthouse where he would be forced to 
testify under oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates spent much of his half-hour appearance describing future  
advances in technology, predicting that consumers will carry 
tablet-size computers connected to wireless networks holding their 
schedules, important telephone numbers and financial information. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day in the not-too-distant future, computers will be able  
to see, listen and speak,'' Gates said. ``At home or in the office, 
you'll be able to control your PC by talking to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates' appearance wasn't totally without controversy. A group of  
young people lined one wall of the hearing room wearing white 
T-shirts with messages such as ``Bust the Trust'' and 
``Microsoft-Intel: Corporate predators versus Democracy.''

<HEADLINE> Heard Said To Coach Wizards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Detroit assistant Gar Heard has reached an  
agreement with the Washington Wizards to be the team's next coach, 
according to several media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN, Washington television stations WTTG, WUSA and WJLA and The  
Washington Post reported Tuesday night that the Wizards have agreed 
to terms with Heard, and a news conference announcing the hiring 
could come as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN reported it will be a multiyear deal worth up to $3 million  
per season. The Post said the contract was worth $1.5 million to $2 
million annually for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we've got a chance to turn things around quickly but  
we've got a lot of work to do,'' Heard told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Heard reportedly was offered the job after talks  
with former all-star guard and NBC studio analyst Isiah Thomas 
broke off. 
</P>
<P>
	Heard would replace Jim Brovelli, who took over the Wizards on  
an interim basis this season after Bernie Bickerstaff was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant for 12 seasons, Heard coached last season under  
Pistons coach Alvin Gentry. He also was an assistant with Dallas, 
Indiana and Philadelphia. He was the Mavericks' interim coach in 
1993 and went 9-44 as Richie Adubato's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for Seattle, Chicago, Buffalo, Phoenix and San Diego  
in an 11-year NBA career. Heard's buzzer-beater forced the first of 
three overtime periods in Phoenix's Game 5 loss to Boston in the 
1976 finals.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Tougher Brady Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring gun regulation is ``too important to  
be decided by strong-arm lobbying tactics,'' President Clinton 
today renewed his call to the Republican Congress to toughen the 
Brady gun law, which he said has proved itself one of the nation's 
must effective anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the law with its system of background checks has  
blocked more than 400,000 illegal gun sales, two-thirds of which 
involved either convicted felons or people with a current felony 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heart and soul of America is on the line,'' Clinton said  
as he urged ordinary Americans to tell House members to follow the 
lead of the Senate and pass strengthened gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a White House Rose Garden ceremony with congressional  
supporters and the families of many victims of gun violence, 
Clinton said the National Rifle Association was ``wrong, wrong, 
wrong'' in arguing against the Brady bill six years ago and is 
equally wrong now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now in the aftermath of the terrible shootings at Littleton  
our nation is even more galvanized to act against violent crime,'' 
and to keep guns out of the hands of juveniles and criminals, 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again the gun lobby is resisting with all its might; once  
again we are battling not only for the safety of our families but 
the soundness of our democracy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Congress to resist ``procedural and tactical  
smokescreens to confuse everyone and confuse the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want us to honor the sacrifices of the people in Littleton,  
Colo., and not to turn our backs on them,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called on Congress to strengthen the Brady law by  
requiring background checks of people seeking to buy guns at gun 
shows and flea markets, by raising the national age of handgun 
ownership from 18 to 21 and by passing other measures he said would 
help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. 
</P>
<P>
	The president made public a new Justice Department report  
showing that in the first five years of the application of the law, 
a period in which a five-day waiting period was required, some 
312,000 handgun purchase applications were rejected under state or 
federal law, 66.3 percent of them for felony convictions or 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first five years, state and local authorities were  
allowed up to five days to check backgrounds of handgun buyers 
before the guns were sold, unless a state already had its own 
instant-check system. If a check took less than five days, no 
additional waiting was required. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department report said that in the first six months  
under a new instant-check background search system, an additional 
90,000 illegal gun sales were blocked. The new system gives law 
enforcement officials access to a more extensive set of records and 
applies to all firearms, not just handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4.1 million background checks have been conducted by  
the FBI and the states under the new instant-check system, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appeal to House Republicans followed by a day a  
similar call from Vice President Al Gore. Gore told the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors in New Orleans that new government studies 
show that one in four gun murders are committed by people 18, 19 or 
20.

<HEADLINE> Electric Fields, Cancer Link Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While there is only weak evidence linking  
electrical fields with cancer, scientists say it is still 
worthwhile to reduce exposure to the fields because of lingering 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years of research produced little hard evidence that the  
magnetic fields around electric power lines cause cancer, according 
to a report sent to Congress Tuesday by a National Institutes of 
Health division. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the analysis added that EMF exposure ``cannot be recognized  
as entirely safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that some statistical studies of leukemia have  
indicated that it is more common in people exposed to 
electromagnetic radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``virtually all of the laboratory evidence in animals and  
humans and most of the mechanistic studies in cells fail to support 
a causal relationship'' between the fields and cancer, the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences said in its report. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistical studies, beginning with one in Denver in 1979,  
have found associations between electrical fields and childhood 
leukemia. Others linked EMF to chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 
adults exposed to the fields through their work, such as electric 
utility workers, machinists and welders. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Toronto reported Tuesday that  
they had found an increase in childhood leukemia. Their findings 
were reported in the International Journal of Cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Research is continuing on these ``lingering concerns'' and  
efforts to reduce human exposure to electromagnetic fields should 
continue, the National Institutes of Health said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of consistent, positive findings in animal or  
mechanistic studies weakens the belief that this association is 
actually due to EMF, but it cannot completely discount the 
epidemiological findings,'' NIEHS Director Kenneth Olden said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, he said, since virtually everyone in the country is  
routinely exposed to EMF, efforts to reduce such exposure should 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, the electrical industry should continue  
efforts to reduce the electromagnetic fields around large 
transmission lines, and communities should enforce electrical codes 
to avoid wiring errors that can increase EMF. 
</P>
<P>
	The report concluded that there was no connection between EMF  
and other problems, including Alzheimer's disease, depression and 
birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year a panel of scientists studying the issue concluded, in  
a 19-9 vote, that electromagnetic fields should be considered 
``possible human carcinogens,'' though the risk was ``probably 
quite small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was at odds with a 1996 report by a National Research  
Council panel of scientists.Those scientists evaluated about 500 
studies on the health effects of high voltage power lines and found 
``no conclusive and consistent evidence'' that electric and 
magnetic fields cause any human disease.

<HEADLINE> Road Repairs To Slow Summer Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The carefree voyage to that vacation or  
weekend getaway this summer may end up as frustrating as a 
rush-hour commute. 
</P>
<P>
	Widespread repair work on state and federal highways, combined  
with a record number of drivers expected to take advantage of 
still-low gas prices, threaten to create traffic backups from coast 
to coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The red flag from experts: Do not expect to go more than 40  
miles on major roads without encountering the cones and barrels of 
a construction zone, from California's Yosemite National Park to 
Pennsylvania's Amish country. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the work is the first fruit of the $203 billion highway  
bill that President Clinton signed into law a year ago Wednesday. 
The funding is a 40 percent increase over the nation's previous 
highway bill, and unlike past years, all states but Massachusetts 
saw a sizable jump in their share of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
	Government leaders gathered on Capitol Hill last week to  
celebrate the first anniversary of the law, which they said would 
create safer roads, ease urban congestion, alleviate suburban 
sprawl and promote mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
	The joviality was accompanied by a sober warning: The added  
construction has increased the risk of traffic accidents at 
construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year more than 700 people are killed and 37,000 injured in  
such accidents. One in seven deaths involves a construction worker. 
Many involve motorists who slam into the vehicle in front of them 
when it suddenly slows for a flagman or a police officer directing 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Political leaders asked the public to be vigilant behind the  
wheel during what will be a taxing summer on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it possible that with the 43 percent increase in funding  
there will be a 43 percent increase in construction zone 
accidents?'' asked Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, the top 
Democrat on the House Transportation Committee. ``It need not 
happen, it must not happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also appealed for patience.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., the committee's chairman, added: ``What  
seems like wasted time in traffic now will mean time and lives 
saved in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roadwork itself spreads from sea to shining sea.  
</P>
<P>
	The main entrance into Yosemite is under construction, closing  
it to traffic from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. daily. The speed limit 
there has also been reduced from 35 mph to 25 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. 30 near Lancaster, Pa., a main route into the area's  
popular Amish country, has closed lanes, and backups of as much as 
30 minutes are projected. Interstate 75, a north-south route from 
Michigan to Florida, will have a dozen construction zones, and 
there will be three on I-87 around New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	On I-15 in Salt Lake City, 17 miles of road are being doubled  
from four lanes to eight in preparation for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	AAA, the nation's largest automobile club, recommends that  
drivers plan routes around the construction zones and be ready when 
they encounter them. And the group says drivers should check their 
vehicle's cooling system, since it is more important in traffic 
because an engine doesn't get the benefit of fast-moving air. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers should also check the effectiveness of their air  
conditioning before setting out, since long delays can make a hot 
interior unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
	AAA spokesman Mitch Fuqua had one final piece of advice for this  
summer of snarl: slow down for safety's sake. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see an orange barrel, that means there's probably  
somebody behind it doing work,'' Fuqua said.

<HEADLINE> AOL Mulled Dumping Microsoft Browser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly disclosed e-mail shows that top  
executives at America Online Inc. debated whether to stop 
distributing Microsoft's Internet software during their secret $10 
billion negotiations last fall to buy Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Chairman Steve Case wondered whether Microsoft might not  
retaliate ``given current antitrust attention'' if AOL switched its 
nearly 17 million subscribers to Netscape's browser, suggesting 
that the software giant might be intimidated into inaction by the 
government's legal case. 
</P>
<P>
	But AOL's president and chief operating officer, Robert Pittman,  
argued to Case that Microsoft was ``too strong to throw them out of 
the tent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days later in another e-mail, Case asked for an analysis of the  
deal's implications, ``including an analysis of what would happen 
if we got really aggressive and swapped out'' Microsoft's browser 
for Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Other documents, also disclosed Monday at Microsoft's antitrust  
trial, confirmed that Netscape currently is working to create for 
AOL subscribers a version of its browser software under the project 
name ``Raptor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL ultimately decided to continue distributing Microsoft's Web  
browser under a contract that runs until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden disclosed the e-mails and other  
documents while questioning David Colburn, senior vice president of 
business affairs for AOL. He was called by Microsoft as a hostile 
witness during this final phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unclear whether Warden persuaded U.S. District Judge  
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will issue the verdict in the case 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In private meetings with lawyers, Jackson said many of the  
e-mails and documents Colburn ``has never seen before and he 
doesn't know anything about,'' and called Colburn's testimony ``not 
very illuminating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rather surprised at the lack of personal knowledge he has  
about the things you're asking him, but he's demonstrated it,'' 
Jackson told Warden. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also asked Microsoft whether it wanted to call Case  
himself as one of its final witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may be the point man insofar as explicating what the  
transaction is all about,'' Jackson said, according to transcripts 
of the meeting made available today. ``I would be willing to let 
you substitute, if you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, the judge again mentioned Case.  
</P>
<P>
	``The best person to call, you don't want to call,'' the judge  
told Warden. ``And I don't blame you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The government can call him,'' Warden offered.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want him, either,'' the judge said.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Mike Murray said today the company has no  
plans to call Case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to resume Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Colburn maintained Monday that AOL never seriously considered  
dropping Microsoft's browser. He said Microsoft's offer in exchange 
-- to distribute AOL's software within Windows -- was too important 
to risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Case's job is to make sure the operations people are  
thinking of all the issues,'' said Colburn, who added that AOL 
``never really did an analysis of swapping out one browser for 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants to convince Jackson that AOL's purchase of  
Netscape, finalized earlier this year, illustrates there is 
sufficiently robust competition in the high-tech industry such that 
federal intervention isn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally wielded its  
influence as the maker of the dominant Windows operating system to 
try to crush Netscape, one of its top software rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft believes AOL could resuscitate Netscape's flagging  
popularity by distributing its software to millions. Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates wrote in a December e-mail to his employees 
that AOL will switch browsers ``sooner or later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warden called Gates' message ``a very interesting document'' and  
tried to introduce it as evidence, but the judge blocked him. The 
Justice Department's lead lawyer, David Boies, complained that the 
message was sent ``by Gates during the litigation, a self-serving 
statement.'' The Associated Press had obtained a copy of the 
message the day it was sent. 
</P>
<P>
	In his own e-mail last September, Case called AOL's choice of  
browsers a ``big, big issue to figure out'' but noted that if AOL 
distributed Netscape's browser, its share of the software market 
would climb to ``more than two-thirds share again!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My main point is, we shouldn't assume we need or want to  
maintain (Microsoft's) as primary browser,'' Case wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pittman warned Case not to underestimate the company that  
Gates built. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can hurt us if they think they have no other option,''  
said Pittman. ``I think we need to stay in business with them, 
create a need for them to need us.''

<HEADLINE> Court Supports Internet Music Device </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A handheld device that can download  
high-quality digital music files from the Internet and play them at 
home does not violate a federal music piracy law, a federal appeals 
court ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-0 decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a  
defeat for the recording industry, which tried to stop distribution 
of the Rio portable MP3 player. But after losing the first round in 
court last year, the industry has tried to adjust to the new 
technology and is developing its own version of the device. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rio, which sells for $119, plugs into a computer and takes  
only minutes to transfers MP3 files, using software that compresses 
and stores digital versions of CD recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	Users can download near-CD-quality music from any one of the  
many MP3 Internet sites into personal computers for replay or, with 
widely available software, transfer it to another computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America, representing  
major record companies, contended the Rio was made for the illegal 
pirating of copyright music and could drain away billions of 
dollars in royalties from artists and publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins of Los Angeles denied an  
injunction last fall that would have prohibited distribution by the 
manufacturer, Diamond Multimedia Systems. The appeals court not 
only upheld Collins but also found that the Rio was not covered by 
the anti-piracy law invoked by the association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 prohibits only devices that  
make copies from digital music recordings, said the opinion by 
Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain. He said the Rio makes its copies from 
computer hard drives, not digital music recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew P. Bridges, a lawyer for San Jose-based Diamond  
Multimedia, said the ruling should end the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association of America is reviewing the  
ruling and hasn't decided whether to appeal further, said 
spokeswoman Alexandra Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	``We filed this lawsuit because unchecked piracy on the Internet  
threatens the development of a legitimate marketplace for on-line 
music, a marketplace that consumers want,'' the association said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, the shared interest in such a marketplace has  
overtaken the lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One recording industry venture, called the Secure Digital Music  
Initiative, seeks to create an encrypted version of MP3 that would 
be immune from illicit copying. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants hope to unveil a Walkman-like digital stereo  
alternative to the Rio by Christmas, followed by other types of 
players that could distinguish between approved and unapproved 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamond Multimedia also plans to provide a security device in a  
future version of the Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the case was going to die a quiet death anyway,'' said  
Mark Hardie, a senior analyst of entertainment industry technology 
for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Recording Industry Association is no longer arguing  
that digital devices will undermine copyright protection. A handful 
of labels in major record companies have even released their own 
MP3 products, ``even though last year they stood together 
arm-in-arm on a stage in New York swearing MP3 was the devil 
incarnate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Recording Industry Association vs. Diamond  
Multimedia, 98-56727.

<HEADLINE> Medical Privacy Bill Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee on Tuesday postponed for a  
third time action on legislation protecting the privacy of medical 
records, as members searched for bipartisan compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, who chairs the Health, Education, Pension  
and Labor Committee, is trying hard to avoid the kind of partisan 
fighting that surrounded debate over HMOs and patient rights. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that a bipartisan vote on privacy was ``essential'' to  
getting the bill to the Senate floor and getting it passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very, very close'' to consensus, Jeffords, R-Vt., said.  
``I want very much to come out in a bipartisan manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there is a broad agreement on the overall privacy issue,  
major disagreements remain over the details. A committee vote had 
already been postponed twice before. On Tuesday, action was 
postponed until Wednesday after interested parties had already 
gathered in the committee room. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the HMO debate, the right of patients to sue is at the  
center of the issue. In the privacy case, the question is how easy 
it will be for patients to sue those who improperly disclose 
personal health information. Also, Democrats and Republicans were 
divided over the rights of children to keep their medical records 
secret -- even from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation written by Jeffords sets out to establish the first  
federal right to privacy regarding medical records. While many 
states have privacy laws, no federal law prohibits the free 
distribution of someone's medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is working under an August deadline. If Congress does  
not act by then, a 1996 law requires the Clinton administration to 
write its own regulations.

<HEADLINE> Indians To Sue Tobacco Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- American Indian tribes claim they are  
being cut out of the nation's tobacco settlement, even though 
Indians have the highest smoking rates for adults among any ethnic 
group in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four tribes were to file a lawsuit Wednesday against the  
tobacco industry to recover billions of dollars they contend they 
spent treating smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes, mostly from the West and Midwest, are accusing the  
tobacco industry of deliberately targeting Indians, who have the 
highest smoking rates for adults among any ethnic group in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribes also want an end to advertisements that target Indian  
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal attorneys say damages could reach into the billions of  
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit comes seven months after the tobacco companies  
agreed to pay 46 states more than $200 billion in the first 25 
years to recover Medicaid costs for treating smoking-related 
illnesses. The tribes were not included in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got no money. They got no benefits of the settlement.  
They had no one representing them at the table,'' said Turner 
Branch, an Albuquerque attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner and a team of attorneys and representatives from the 34  
tribes were to announce the filing Wednesday at a news conference 
in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is against more than a dozen tobacco companies,  
including Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds and the Santa Fe Natural 
Tobacco Co. The latter company distributes American Spirit 
cigarettes, which feature a logo of an Indian in full feathered 
headdress smoking a peace pipe. 
</P>
<P>
	John Phillips, an attorney who represents Philip Morris Co.,  
said several tribes already have sued tobacco companies. Some of 
the cases have been dropped and a few are still tangled in 
jurisdictional issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such lawsuits are riddled with problems, Phillips said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The tribes have received their health funding, the vast  
majority of the funding, through the Indian Health Services, which 
is an arm of the federal government,'' Phillips said. ``Those are 
federal monies, not tribal monies. Only the federal government, not 
the tribes, have the right to sue for those funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Hale, a former Navajo Nation president and counsel to the  
Albuquerque law firm filing the lawsuit, disagrees. The federal 
government must allocate money for Indian health services as part 
of its treaties with the tribes, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moment it is appropriated, it is Indian money,'' he said.  
``It loses that federal money label.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the 1998 Surgeon General's report, about 39 percent  
of all American Indians smoke. That compares to 26.5 percent of 
blacks, 25.9 percent of Caucasians, 18.9 percent of Hispanics and 
15.3 percent of Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a problem because we have never been educated about the  
dangers of smoking,'' said Red Eagle Rael, governor of the Picuris 
Pueblo in northern New Mexico.

microwave oven are among the 10 inductees in the 1999 class at the 
National Inventors Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's class, announced today, brings the number of  
inventors in the hall of fame to 151. 
</P>
<P>

used commonly in telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Percy LeBaron Spencer, who patented and made the first  
microwave ovens. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Soccer Group OKs Yugoslav Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NYON, Switzerland (AP) -- Yugoslav clubs will be allowed to take  
part in next season's European Cups competitions due to improved 
conditions in the country, the Union of European Football 
Associations said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Partizan Belgrade will take play in the qualifying phase of the  
Champions Cup and Red Star Belgrade and Vojvodina will play in the 
UEFA Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	UEFA batted Obilic, which finished second in the league, from  
taking part ``for moral and ethical reasons,'' because of the 
involvement with Zeljko Raznatovic. The former team president, 
still a team official, was known as ``Arkan'' and was indicted for 
war crimes following his role as a Serb paramilitary leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only if credible and acceptable amendments are made to the  
executive board of the club would FK Obilic be granted a place in 
UEFA's club competitions in future seasons,'' UEFA said. 
</P>
<P>
	UEFA said its go-ahead for Yugoslav participation in the  
European Cups is subject to approval by its soccer task force by 
June 29 at the latest. The task force has been asked ``to check 
whether the logistical conditions required to play the matches 
concerned in Yugoslavia are fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other decisions, UEFA excluded Bosnian teams from next  
season's European Cups because the qualifying tournament -- 
involving clubs from Croat and Muslim zones -- was canceled. UEFA 
also rejected Polish champion Wisla Krakow's appeal against a 
one-year ban, imposed after Dino Baggio was struck and injured by a 
knife during a UEFA Cup match at Krakow in October.

<HEADLINE> Collector Buys DiMaggio Memorabilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A North Carolina businessman, who went to  
Yankee Stadium as a kid from New Jersey to watch Joe DiMaggio, is 
now the overjoyed owner of more than 10,000 pieces of DiMaggio 
memorabilia 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Perullo paid ``a price in the millions,'' for the items  
from the Hall of Fame outfielder's personal collection, including 
signed baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still pinching myself,'' he said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Yankee Clipper was his hero, but not only sentiment was  
involved. The 58-year-old Perullo plans on selling much of the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked out a deal with Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend an  
attorney who was assigned in the player's will to handle the sale 
of the memorabilia collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo's packaging warehouse in south Charlotte brimmed with  
rare DiMaggio collectibles, many being shipped to Philadelphia for 
a sports memorabilia show later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo, originally from Bayonne, N.J., also plans to keep a  
large number of the pieces for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	On a large oak table, he showed off some of his favorites: a No.  
5 Yankees jersey with DiMaggio's signature and ``Yankee Clipper'' 
written in his own hand underneath, a signed bat from 1941, several 
autographed baseballs and Joe DiMaggio baseball cards and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	A metal rack in a small office held more signed Yankee jerseys.  
On the floor in the next office were signed prints, posters and 
black-and-white photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was an intelligent businessman along with being a  
great ballplayer,'' Perullo said. ``When he would sign baseballs 
for a show, he always kept 50 or so for himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg said from his law office in Hollywood, Fla., that  
DiMaggio never would have approved of carving up his collection 
strictly for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Joe is watching all the moves I make,'' he said. ``I  
know what I did was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg put DiMaggio's personal memorabilia collection on the  
block several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After conducting preliminary discussions with Christie's auction  
house, the QVC television network and other potential bidders, he 
soon realized it would be difficult to find a buyer for the entire 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Perullo entered the picture.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was impressed with Ralph the first time we met,'' Engelberg  
said. ``He said he wouldn't do anything to hurt Joe's reputation. I 
trusted him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, they had a deal.  
</P>
<P>
	With each piece, Engelberg provided Perullo with a certificate  
of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg knews the history of some of the pieces. For example,  
DiMaggio signed the No. 5 Yankee jersey and added the words 
``Yankee Clipper'' on Oct. 9, three days before he was hospitalized 
with lung cancer. DiMaggio died at home March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Perullo also acquired 68 autographed baseballs that DiMaggio had  
signed on one of his better days during his lengthy 
hospitalization. Some of the signatures are legible, but some are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	``On some of them you can't make out his name, but I know he  
signed them because I was there,'' said Engelberg, who lived across 
the street from DiMaggio. ``And they are the last items he ever 
signed before he died.''

<HEADLINE>  Storm Watch Issued for Bermuda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A tropical storm watch was in effect for Bermuda  
today as forecasters watched to see whether sluggish Arlene would 
barrel into the island or curve away into open sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season had sustained  
winds of 50 mph today and some additional strengthening was 
possible during the day, forecasters said. At 2 p.m., it was 
centered about 265 miles southeast of Bermuda. Storm-force winds 
extended up to 115 miles from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene had slowed nearly to a stop during the morning, then  
drifted erratically, but a slow motion toward the north or 
northwest was expected to resume by midnight, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The storm may pass very close to Bermuda in 36 to 48 hours,''  
Jack Beven, a National Hurricane Center specialist, said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene was expected to turn away reaching the U.S. coast. Storms  
in this part of the Atlantic often die at sea as they go over 
cooler waters, which retard their development.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Manager Unexcited by Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles are finally displaying  
the brand of baseball they expected to show when they broke spring 
training. But is it too late to make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles entered Tuesday's game against Kansas City with a  
five-game winning streak and a 26-36 record. They've ended their 
two-month stay in the AL East cellar but still have plenty of 
winning to do in order to get back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't paid attention to the standings,'' manager Ray  
Miller said. ``Once we get to .500, then I'll see where we're at. 
If we can just continue to win series, then we can move up 
considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That makes sense, given that the Orioles have to go 64-36 the  
rest of the way to reach 90 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	If Baltimore keeps getting solid starting pitching, then  
anything's possible. Sidney Ponson seems to be in a groove, Scott 
Erickson has won two straight after a 1-8 start and Juan Guzman is 
coming off a 5-0 shutout of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the bullpen was well rested through Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not used to (having) guys with four, five days of rest,''  
Miller said. ``Hopefully, with our starters coming around, we can 
back off the bullpen a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Little Changed in Quiet Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar ended little changed against other  
currencies Tuesday, a day before the release of key inflation data. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0425, down  
from $1.0428 late Monday. The dollar also was quoted at 120.40 
Japanese yen, down from 120.62 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was quiet as dealers remained on the sidelines ahead of  
the release Wednesday of consumer prices for the month of May, an 
important inflation indicator watched by economists. A sharp rise 
in prices could signal a rise in short-term interest rates, which 
would boost the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5311 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5302, and 1.4621 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4607. The British 
pound fell to $1.5926 from $1.6069. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8762 German 
marks, up from 1.8755; 6.2933 French francs, up from 6.2893; and 
1,858.74 Italian lire, up from 1,855.29.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Prepares To Leave Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite his role as the main architect of  
racial reconciliation in South Africa after long years of white 
supremacist rule, President Nelson Mandela often has been a 
troublesome figure for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He once gave Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi South Africa's  
highest award for a foreigner, and he also sided with Libya in the 
United States' dispute with that country over the bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103 a decade ago. He has maintained friendships with Cuban 
President Fidel Castro and has had close ties radical Arab states 
other than Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, in a comment aimed at the United States, Mandela  
said, ``The contempt for blacks is still deep-seated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as Mandela prepares to leave office on Wednesday, Clinton  
administration officials as well as private analysts say the 
positive aspects of his five-year term overwhelm the disagreements. 
They believe that the relationship will deepen under Mandela's 
successor, President-elect Thabo Mbeki. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior official dismissed South Africa's penchant for  
friendships with countries on the U.S. terrorism list. This is a 
small consideration, the official said, ``compared with the overall 
vitality of the relations with the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a continent where ethnic tensions often turn into armed  
conflict, South Africa under Mandela's leadership has become a 
model for ethnic reconciliation, the officials say. And they also 
are hopeful that the rest of Africa will look to South African 
democracy as a worthy alternative to the one-man rule that has been 
so prevalent on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Salih Booker, of the Council on Foreign Relations, says Gadhafi  
has visions of playing the role of power broker on the continent, 
and that the administration hopes South Africa will assume that 
role instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States would much rather see South Africa as a  
regional power, as the definer of continental values,'' Booker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also predicted that Mbeki will be far less likely than  
Mandela to indulge in the kind of rhetoric that offends American 
sensibilities. Vice President Al Gore and Mbeki have worked closely 
over the years as co-chairmen of the U.S.-South African Bi-National 
Commission, which oversees official relations in trade, the 
environment and a variety of other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to create such a commission a few years ago is a  
measure of the importance the United States attaches to close ties 
with South Africa. It is one of a handful of bilateral arrangements 
the United States has entered into worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	However distasteful some officials find Mandela's friendship  
with Gadhafi, Booker says it may even have some advantages for 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He says Mandela's intervention a few months ago may have  
influenced Gadhafi to accept a proposal to allow two indicted 
Libyan suspects to stand trial for the Pan Am 103 bombing next 
February in The Netherlands. This has been a longstanding U.S. goal 
in its quest for justice in a terrorist incident that claimed 270 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadhafi is among the guests invited to Mbeki's inaugural.  
Mandela said Sunday he was ``overwhelmed'' by the presence in Cape 
Town of the Libyan ``revolutionary icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno will lead the U.S. delegation.  
</P>
<P>
	Mandela has been given the kind of flattery by the Clinton  
administration that few others have received. At one point a few 
years ago, with Mandela standing at his side, President Clinton 
said the South African leader was ``living proof that the forces of 
justice and reconciliation can bridge any divide. You have shown us 
the way and we look forward, sir, to walking down the road with 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On those rare occasions when the United States gently rebuked  
Mandela, he would react sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding at one point to American expressions of  
disappointment over his plans to travel to Tripoli, Mandela said 
after his arrival, ``Those who say I should not be here are without 
morals. I am not going to join them in their lack of morality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booker says such flareups should not obscure the strengths of  
the relations. South Africa, he says, ``is the closest thing the 
United States has to an ally in Africa.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 31.66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved moderately higher Tuesday as  
investors scooped up Internet, pharmaceutical and oil company 
shares at bargain prices, but the mood on Wall Street remained 
tense ahead of Wednesday's report on consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 31.66 to 10,594.99.  
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose slightly. The  
technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 16.36 to 2,414.67 and 
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 gained 7.16 to 1,301.16. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the calm before the storm,'' said David Orr, chief  
economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were hoping Wednesday's consumer price report for May  
would provide clues about inflation and whether the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates to slow the economy's growth when its 
Open Market Committee meets June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also looking forward to Fed Chairman Alan  
Greenspan's testimony before Congress on Thursday for hints about 
what action the Fed might take. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market, worried that higher rates will hurt corporate  
profits, has been nervous ever since the April Consumer Price 
Index, released May 14, showed the highest increase in consumer 
prices in nine years. Days later the Fed announced it was leaning 
toward increasing interest rates if necessary to stifle inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	A 309-point drop in the Dow last week reflected the market's  
expectation that rates will indeed rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A strengthening bond market prodded stocks higher for much of  
Tuesday's session, until Treasury prices fell late in the day. The 
benchmark 30-year bond yielded 6.10 percent, up from 6.09 percent 
on Monday, but still lower than the 19-month high of 6.16 percent 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet stocks, some of which have seen their prices  
fall by nearly half since April, recouped some of their losses. 
Those gaining ground included America Online, up 4 1/4 at 94 3/4, 
Amazon.com, up 4 1/2 at 96 1/2 and Yahoo!, up 6 at 125 1/4. Still, analysts 
said they expect the correction in Internet issues to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks are no longer riding high because there are so  
many more of them, Orr said. ``Supply is now equal to demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several big pharmaceutical stocks, which also have been battered  
since April, were picked up by bargain hunters. Pfizer was up 2 
7/16 at 97 9/16, Merck rose 1 3/8 at 67 5/8 and American Home Products 
rose 1 3/16 at 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were led by Dow components Exxon , up 1 at 82 1/8 , and  
Chevron, up 1 1/4 at 96. 
</P>
<P>
	But Coca-Cola, another Dow stock, fell 1 1/16 to 63 3/4 after  
Belgian officials banned sales of the company's soft drinks amid 
reports of people becoming ill after drinking them. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the market kept its focus on the economy.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are getting more optimistic about a benign CPI report  
and the possibility that the Fed is going to make its notion 
clear,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston. 
</P>
<P>
	If the CPI numbers are worse than expected, Riley warned the  
market might suffer a severe drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 6-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Composite volume totaled 842.40 million shares, up from 813.16  
million in Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 2.68 to 622.28, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.23 to 763.92 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.48 to 434.01  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.54 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 1.34 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
1.26 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.64 percent.

	Another borrower who had almost $11,000 in loans forgiven in  
September 1994 for the supposedly permanent disability of ``chronic 
low back pain'' went on to earn more than $57,000 just three years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a 2 1/2-year period, the Education Department forgave nearly  
$4 million in student loans for borrowers who were supposed to be 
dead but turned out to be quite alive. During the same span, the 
department also forgave more than $73 million in loans for people 
who claimed permanent disability but continued to work, according 
to a department audit recently presented to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really a clear case of no oversight,'' said Sharon  
Pinkerton, spokeswoman for Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., who oversees 
domestic issues on the House Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee, which is looking into the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The loans were forgiven mostly because the department didn't  
made sure lenders got original or certified copies of death 
certificates for discharges of loans based on a borrower's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Woods, who oversees the Education Department's loan  
division, ordered the audit. He said the department would use wage 
garnishment and other means to recover the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand this is real money,'' he said, adding that the  
department has also created new safeguards against ``a few 
dishonest individuals spoiling this program for the millions who 
depend on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, loans can be forgiven when the borrower  
either dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The process for claiming a disability is in the hands of the  
borrower. The department says a disability must keep a person from 
working and earning money or attending school, and must be expected 
to continue indefinitely or result in death. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrowers send a form completed and signed by a doctor to the  
lender or guaranty agency. The process does not require proof that 
a qualified doctor actually saw the patient or proof the borrower 
was not working. 
</P>
<P>
	The department, after witnessing disability fraud in other  
agencies, requested the audit of loan-discharge records from July 
1, 1994, through Dec. 31, 1996. The department's auditing arm 
matched all borrowers who received disability and death discharges 
with the Social Security Administration's master earning records 
for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that 35,000 borrowers had $216 million in student loans  
discharged for death during the period reviewed, but 708 borrowers 
were drawing wages in 1997 after receiving the death discharges. 
Lenders processing discharges relied on copies, not originals, of a 
death certificate or other proof of death acceptable under a given 
state's law. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit, which went to congressional offices Friday, also  
found that: 
</P>
<P>
	--9,798 individual borrowers, or 23 percent of the borrowers  
claiming disability, were earning wages after their loans were 
forgiven. Eighty-one of them earned more than $50,000 in 1997 after 
receiving a disability discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than 6,800 new loans totaling almost $20 million have been  
awarded to borrowers who returned to school after previously having 
loans totaling nearly $11.5 million discharged due to total and 
permanent disability. 
</P>
<P>
	--From 1994 to 1997, new loans awarded to borrowers with past  
disability discharges more than quadrupled, from $1.9 million in 
1994 to $8.6 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrowers who later ended up on payrolls were forgiven for total  
and permanent disabilities that included chronic low back pain, 
memory loss, reconstruction of right ankle, carpal tunnel syndrome, 
depression, fractured elbow and severe headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The department administers two types of loans for student  
borrowers: direct loans and loans made by private lenders that are 
subsidized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The report analyzed records for the subsidized program but  
noted, ``Similar procedures are followed for determining borrower 
eligibility for (federal direct loans).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods acknowledged the department hadn't given lenders enough  
guidance on how to process loan discharges. 
</P>
<P>
	Effective immediately, new policies include revising disability  
forms to require the doctor's professional license number and 
office telephone number and using the Social Security 
Administration's nationwide system of tracking records of disabled 
individuals.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Brought in Wrestler's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The widow of the professional wrestler  
killed in a stunt last month sued the World Wrestling Federation 
for wrongful death today, hoping to force changes in the wrestling 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Owen has died, and there is nothing I can do to bring him  
back,'' Martha Hart said, fighting back tears at a news conference. 
``My wish is that his death not be in vain, that his death can be a 
vehicle for vastly improving the safety of the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, 34, was killed May 23 when he fell from a cable as he was  
being lowered into the ring at a WWF spectacle at Kemper Arena. He 
fell 78 feet when the quick release on his harness opened early. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends the device he wore was grossly inadequate  
and that the WWF failed to provide a safety net and harness and 
backup cables. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are investigating the death to see whether criminal  
charges should be filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The circuit court lawsuit was filed by Mrs. Hart, and Hart's  
parents, Helen and Stu Hart, a pioneer of professional wrestling in 
Western Canada. It seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harts sued 13 defendants, including WWF, its parent company,  
Titan Sports, chairman Vince McMahon, and the city of Kansas City, 
which owns the arena. It also names the companies that made the 
harness and cable system and the people who set up the rigging 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation declined to comment until it sees  
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Schmelzle, general manager for Kemper Arena, had not seen  
the lawsuit, but said, ``None of our employees or equipment had 
anything to do with the accident.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Little Changed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen in late  
morning trading Wednesday as Japan's central bank moved to halt the 
rise of the yen. Tokyo stock prices were little changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded at 120.58 yen, up 0.24 yen from late in Tokyo  
on Tuesday and also above its late New York level of 120.40 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 36.72  
points, or 0.21 percent, to 17,245.28 at the close of morning 
trading. On Tuesday, the average gained 93.18 points, or 0.54 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar stayed in a narrow range as the market awaited clues  
as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	With growing sentiment that the Japanese economy is poised for a  
recovery, as well as anticipation that the Fed will tighten 
monetary policy, market participants are generally inclined to bid 
up the Japanese currency, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the strong message from the Bank of Japan and other  
financial authorities that Japan will prevent excessive yen 
strength is giving the greenback support, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank is moving to prop up the dollar amid  
concerns a strong yen could stifle economic recovery by driving up 
the prices of Japan's exports and making foreign imports cheaper 
domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be difficult for the dollar to break below 120 yen,''  
said Kazuo Watanabe, deputy general manager of the treasury 
department at Sumitomo Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, trading was quiet ahead of the release of  
key U.S. economic data later in the day, but analysts said 
sentiment remains positive on hopes for a recovery in Japan's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were awaiting the release Wednesday of the May U.S.  
consumer price index, which is expected to have a big influence on 
the U.S. Federal Reserve's next monetary policy move. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.24 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,383.83. 
The TOPIX closed up 3.80 points, or 0.28 percent, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 31.66  
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 10,594.99. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.76 yen, up from  
125.04 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.645 percent from Tuesday's 1.595 percent, driving its price 
down to 97.89 yen from 98.31.

<HEADLINE> NY's Lazio Likely To Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Rep. Rick Lazio said Tuesday he expects to  
announce this summer that he will seek the Republican nomination 
for the Senate seat that Hillary Rodham Clinton is also eyeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio will probably face New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the  
GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you beat Rudy Giuliani is you run as the Republican,''  
the Long Island congressman said, noting the mayor's crossing of 
party lines in 1994 to endorse Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo over 
Republican George Pataki in a race won by Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani political adviser Bruce Teitelbaum declined to comment  
on Lazio's plans. The mayor formed a Senate exploratory committee 
in April but has yet to announce his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate race is for the seat being vacated next year by  
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mrs. Clinton plans to form an 
exploratory committee in early July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go into it as the underdog and I have a keen understanding  
of what that means,'' Lazio, 41, said. ``It's a David-and-Goliath 
race against two titans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio said he will campaign on the theme that both the first  
lady and the mayor want to use the Senate seat as a stepping stone 
to higher office and that the blunt Giuliani has the wrong 
temperament for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be making an announcement sometime in the summer and I  
can't imagine right now that that announcement is not going to be a 
positive one,'' Lazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio is assistant majority leader in the House but is  
little-known off Long Island. He has been crisscrossing the state 
in recent months, courting Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Technology Said May Close Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A noted historian is dusting off a century-old  
warning that technology may force some libraries to close. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's doing it amidst the world's biggest collection of  
books, as the Library of Congress begins an embracing survey of 
human knowledge at the end of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning comes from Jonathan Denton Spence, a leading  
British-born historian at Yale University who was speaking today at 
an international conference, which over a week will cover more than 
20 topics, from cosmology -- the study of the universe -- to the 
condition of modern music. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet access to the Web sites attached to a particular  
monograph, as some authors are now beginning to provide, can allow 
the reader to enter a whole universe of sources that the book's 
author had no space to provide in the printed version,'' Spence 
said in his prepared remarks. ``Archives are swiftly moving to 
selective computer storage and retrieval, so they can be scanned 
from afar, and the relevant passages downloaded by the interested 
researcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Library of Congress itself has begun to put online the  
letters of George Washington and many other historical documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time,'' Spence went on, ``though books may still  
be cherished, as we are constantly told, more and more are being 
shipped out of jammed libraries and stored in 
temperature-controlled environments to which readers are denied 
access, so that browsing becomes a thing of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spence took his cue from a similar conference held in 1904 in  
St. Louis. There Guido Biagi, director of two great libraries in 
Florence, Italy, predicted that some libraries would have to close 
their doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The electric post or the air-ships will have then shortened  
distances,'' Spence quoted Biagi as saying, the telephone will make 
it possible to hear in Melbourne a graphophone disk (that had been) 
asked for, a few minutes earlier, from the British Museum. There 
will be few readers but an infinite number of hearers, who will 
listen from their own homes to the spoken paper, the spoken book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spence commented: ``Ninety-five years after Biagi issued those  
words, we have reached just that point, as perhaps only a librarian 
could have guessed.''

<HEADLINE> Defensive Lapses Key to Stars' Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- All it took was a couple of big mistakes  
for the previously shiny Dallas Stars to lose some luster in the 
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo Sabres took advantage of some suddenly inept Stars  
and evened the best-of-7 series at two games each with a 2-1 
victory Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	On the flip side of a sparkling performance by a Buffalo team  
that had looked ready for some golf after losing two games in a 
row, the second at home, the Stars coughed up the puck and failed 
to cash in on opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Namely, none of their 13 shots in the third period found their  
way past Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistakes dulled a sparkling effort by Dallas goalie Ed  
Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both goaltenders are playing so great that a little break here  
and there, that's what teams are looking for,'' Dallas center Guy 
Carbonneau said. ``We try to play a tight defensive style and look 
for some cracks in their game and take advantage of them. Tonight, 
they got a couple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres barged through the cracks for two unassisted goals  
against a Dallas defense that had stonewalled them in Game 3 so 
effectively that Buffalo managed only a dozen shots in that 2-1 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time the Dallas `D' backfired, and normally reliable  
defenseman Craig Ludwig got burned -- twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig, on the ice with Shawn Chambers at the time, was nowhere  
to be found when Sabres speedy wing Geoff Sanderson broke away in 
the first period. Sanderson froze a helpless Belfour with a fake 
slap shot and steered the puck around the prone goalie for a 1-0 
lead at 8:09. 
</P>
<P>
	Jere Lehtinen tied it two minutes later before another miscue,  
this one a glaring blooper by Ludwig, handed the Sabres the 
game-winner in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig flubbed a clearing attempt right in front of his own net,  
fell down in an attempt to stop the shot by Buffalo's Dixon Ward 
and wound up screening Belfour. Ward easily potted the goal for a 
2-1 lead at 7:37 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just dumped it out of their zone and got it inside the  
blue line. I just tried to hit it over to the boards and it hit off 
the top of my stick. Ward got it and put it in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig wanted to have that one back.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could have done 10 different things with it,'' he said. ``I  
could have fallen on it or picked it up and thrown it in the 
stands. Obviously I didn't do the right thing. That's part of 
hockey I guess. But we'll regroup and come back harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour was the only bright Star. He made the save of the series  
with just over four minutes left in the second period. Miroslav 
Satan, who led the Sabres in the regular season and was looking for 
his first goal of the series, threaded the puck behind Belfour and 
went to the other side to try to tap it in. 
</P>
<P>
	Belfour fell and shoved the stick in front of the shot. He also  
stopped Satan's low bid from the slot with two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the type of night where every little thing came back  
against us,'' Derian Hatcher said. ``There weren't too many of 
them, but that happens. What can you say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Next game, whatever we did wrong tonight, we'll try to make it  
better,'' Carbonneau said.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Stakes Claim in Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Daniel Barber was always thirsty for  
something. ``Cokes, water, milk, orange juice, whatever,'' the 
17-year-old recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was eating like a normal teen-ager, Daniel also was  
shedding pounds at an alarming rate. Then in January, he got severe 
flu-like symptoms he couldn't shake. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests revealed a surprising diagnosis: Daniel has Type II  
diabetes, a progressively destructive form of the disease which 
doctors long thought only developed in middle age. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight, the happy-go-lucky teen from Havana had joined the  
growing number of young people already living in many ways like an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallahassee Memorial Hospital's Diabetes Center, which draws  
patients from Florida, Georgia and Alabama, has seen the number of 
Type II cases among children triple in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It dawned on us this spring that ... four out of five new  
cases were Type II,'' said Larry Deeb, a pediatric endocrinologist 
at the center. ``And we said, `My Lord.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago, few people under 40 were even screened for this  
most common form of the disease. In fact, Type II was routinely 
called adult-onset diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
said diabetes screening should be considered for people as young as 
age 25 -- 20 years earlier than now recommended. The disease is the 
leading cause of blindness, kidney failure and amputations in the 
United States and kills 180,000 a year. It also can lead to heart 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 of the nation's 16 million diabetes cases are  
Type II. A much less common form of diabetes, Type I, generally 
strikes children and is easier to diagnose. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as many as a third of Type II cases go undiagnosed --  
sometimes until severe complications show up, like blurred vision 
and excessive thirst. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's so frightening about these kids,'' Deeb said.  
</P>
<P>
	The University of Miami's Diabetes Research Institute has joined  
forces with medical schools at the University of Florida and the 
University of South Florida to determine the extent of the problem 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In Daniel's case, his flu may have helped catch the disease  
early. Even though three generations of his family had diabetes, no 
one thought to test Daniel, even when he began losing weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never occurred to us, but when we got to adding up the  
pounds and remembering he drank like a seal, we said, `Why didn't 
we think of that?''' said Frank Hand, Daniel's father. 
</P>
<P>
	One key indicator may have been that Daniel was overweight. The  
federal government estimates that one in five American children are 
overweight -- a sign that parents should watch for 
</P>
<P>
	``The rise in the incidence of obesity is making its ugly face  
known,'' said Ronald Goldberg, a diabetes specialist at the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are so much less active than they used to be,''  
Goldberg said, ``and exposed to our western-type diets, they're 
putting on weight at alarming rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Type II diabetes is treated with a combination of better diet,  
weight control, increased physical activity, drugs and, if all else 
fails, insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority children are particularly at risk, experts say. Parents  
of black, Hispanic or American Indian children who are overweight 
should particularly be on the lookout for diabetes symptoms, Deeb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also are calling for more aggressive screening by  
pediatricians for children who are in high-risk groups, said Nancy 
Wright, an endocrinologist at Tallahassee Memorial's Diabetes 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Pediatricians often aren't looking for it, because they weren't  
trained to, Wright said. ``We've got to change the way we think 
about it.''

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Brought in Wrestler's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The device that dropped professional  
wrestler Owen Hart to his death was a ``makeshift contraption'' 
that was never designed to hold a 230-pound man, according to a 
lawyer for his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's widow and her children filed a wrongful death lawsuit  
Tuesday against the World Wrestling Federation and others they 
believe are responsible for Hart's death last month in an aerial 
stunt that went wrong at Kemper Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our legal and factual allegation is that Owen Hart died  
because this makeshift contraption was totally inadequate for this 
intended purpose,'' said attorney Gary Robb. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's widow, Martha Hart, said she hoped the lawsuit would  
force the WWF to take precautions so that no other wrestler would 
be subjected to unsafe conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Owen has died, and there is nothing I can do to bring him  
back,'' Mrs. Hart said. ``My wish is that his death not be in vain, 
that his death can be a vehicle for vastly improving the safety of 
the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, 34, was killed May 23 when he fell from a cable as he was  
being lowered into the ring at a WWF spectacle. He fell 78 feet 
when the quick release on his harness opened early. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends the device he wore was grossly inadequate  
and that the WWF failed to provide a safety net and harness and 
backup cables. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF spokesman Jim Byrne said his company had not yet been served  
with the lawsuit and couldn't comment on its allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hart said she was ``outraged and repulsed'' that the WWF  
continued the show after her husband's dead body was removed from 
the ring before 17,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Schmelzle, general manager for Kemper Arena, which was also  
named as a defendant in the suit, said the decision to continue 
meant no disrespect for Hart. He said event organizers ``honestly 
didn't know if he was dead at that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police are investigating the death to see whether criminal  
charges should be filed.

<HEADLINE> Wrecked Ship May Be Blackbeard's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Circumstantial evidence is mounting  
that a shipwreck off the Atlantic coast is Blackbeard the pirate's 
flagship, the Queen Anne's Revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiocarbon dating shows several pieces of wood taken from the  
wreckage near Beaufort Inlet were from the same time period as 
Blackbeard's ship, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists determined the wood was cut and milled about the time  
work was completed on Queen Anne's Revenge, a 90-foot former slave 
ship that sank in 1718. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also displayed other items brought up from the wreck  
last fall: a pewter syringe; a brass swivel from a surveying 
instrument; a musket side plate or brace; a gold nugget weighing a 
total of 2 grams; and a tiny piece of gold-specked lead shot. 
</P>
<P>
	State archaeologist Steve Claggett said it won't be known for  
certain that the ship was Blackbeard's unless divers find a bell or 
other item with the ship's name engraved on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship is one of 5,000 documented wrecks in North Carolina  
coastal waters, said Richard Lawrence, head of the state underwater 
archaeology unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything continues to be consistent with the time period,''  
Lawrence said. Evidence from the wreck about a mile off Fort Macon 
is consistent with Blackbeard's ship and not other wrecks during 
that time, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackbeard, whose real name was Edward Teach, survived the wreck  
but was later captured and executed on North Carolina's Ocracoke 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials warned that the excavation of the wreck may be its  
undoing. Sand has covered the wreck for nearly 300 years, keeping 
away oxygen and organisms that deteriorate its wood. Now that 
archaeologists have uncovered parts, even though they were 
recovered after each expedition, the wreckage is showing more wear 
and tear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that it's exposed, it's going to be gone soon if we don't  
do something about it,'' said Phil Masters, president of Intersal 
Inc., a Florida firm that found the wreck and aided the state's 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Claggett said his department has concluding that it would cost  
$5 million to $6 million to completely excavate the wreck, bring up 
all the artifacts divers could find and clean and conserve them. If 
legislators authorize less money, more limited searches could be 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the things divers have spotted on the ocean floor are 18  
cannons and only three have been brought up so far. The ship was 
believed to have 40 cannons on board.

<HEADLINE> Bogart, Hepburn Top Stars List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He didn't have the stunning good looks of  
Clark Gable. He didn't always perform better than his 
contemporaries, or die an icon-making death like James Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Humphrey Bogart had a beautiful relationship with  
America. 
</P>
<P>
	More than four decades after his death, Bogie's fans put him  
atop the American Film Institute's list of the greatest American 
male screen legends of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a guy who didn't think of acting as a competitive sport,  
he would have been honored and awestruck by this,'' said Stephen 
Bogart, the actor's son. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bogart had much to be proud of Tuesday. His mother,  
Lauren Bacall, was No. 20 on the greatest actress list, behind top 
vote getters Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked and I'm flattered beyond words,'' Miss Bacall said  
by telephone from Italy. ``My God! I would never have expected it. 
But I'm not surprised that Bogie's No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics complained that the list overlooks many stars of  
the seminal silent era as well as musicals, but most agree that 
those who made the cut deserved the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd find it hard to argue against anyone who's on the list,''  
film critic and historian Leonard Maltin said. ``But lists are 
fundamentally silly. It's never going to be to everybody's 
satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bogie, most agreed, had to be on it -- somewhere, at least.  
</P>
<P>
	``You look at the 75 films he's done, from `The African Queen'  
to `Casablanca,' `Treasure of the Sierra Madre' and `The Maltese 
Falcon.' These were all such disparate roles, yet he carried them 
all off,'' Stephen Bogart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Grant was No. 2 on the lists, followed by James Stewart,  
Marlon Brando, Fred Astaire, Henry Fonda, Clark Gable, James 
Cagney, Spencer Tracy and Charlie Chaplin. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Miss Davis among female legends were Audrey Hepburn,  
Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy 
Garland, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballots were sent to about 1,800 voters, including critics,  
historians, directors, producers and screenwriters. To be eligible, 
actors had to have made their debut in or before 1951; also 
eligible were those who made their debuts after 1950 but have since 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, current box office stars like Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep,  
John Travolta, Harrison Ford and Paul Newman weren't included on 
the list of 500 nominees announced in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were asked to consider five criteria: star quality  
(charisma and presence), craft (ability to embody different 
characters), legacy (body of work), popularity and historical 
context. The roster was revealed Tuesday night during a three-hour 
CBS-TV special. 
</P>
<P>
	Those eligible who didn't make the top 50 lineup included  
Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, 
Harold Lloyd, Alec Guinness, Mickey Rooney, Doris Day, Bob Hope, 
Will Rogers, Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Clara Bow and 
Gloria Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The silent film people always get the shaft. This is more a  
comment on a lack of cinema literacy,'' Maltin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment writers and editors of The Associated Press, in a  
recently compiled list of the 25 most significant stars of the 
century, also selected Bogart, Miss Bacall and Miss Hepburn, but 
included Fairbanks, Valentino and Laurel and Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFI compilation also paid little regard for musicals.  
Astaire, Miss Rogers and Miss Garland appeared from that film 
genre, but where was Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra? 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the film institute celebrated the centennial of  
movies by announcing the 100 greatest American motion pictures of 
all time, with ``Citizen Kane'' topping the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics and movie buffs quickly jumped on the AFI for  
overlooking so many silent movies. Only four were chosen, and way 
down in 44th place was D.W. Griffith's ``The Birth of a Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that sort of thing again. Someone will find fault,''  
AFI Chairman Tom Pollock said. ``Lists by their nature create 
controversy because of who is on them and who is left off them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Bacall, however, was tickled pink to make the recent list.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gee, this makes me feel a helluva lot more important than I  
am,'' said the star of ``To Have and Have Not'' and ``The Big 
Sleep,'' both with Bogart. ``I'm going to call my agent right 
now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The median age of Americans in 1998 reached a  
record high of 35.2 years, according to population estimates 
released Monday by the Census Bureau. The median age, the point 
where equal numbers of people are younger and older, is up from 
32.8 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the oldest and youngest populations held onto  
their positions from years past. West Virginia was highest with a 
median age of 38.6 years and Utah was lowest at 26.7 years. 
</P>
<P>
	People in the Northeast, at 36.6 years, had the oldest median

<HEADLINE> Smits' Feet Make Season Painful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana Pacers center Rik Smits is quoted as  
saying his painful feet could drive him out of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, I really didn't enjoy playing this  
season,'' Smits told a Dutch newspaper, De Volkskrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-4 Smits, who is from the Netherlands, has played on  
sore feet for several seasons. He had surgery to repair nerve 
damage in both of his feet in September 1996, but has never 
completely recovered. He missed 30 games in the 1996-97 season and 
nine games in the 1997-98 season because of foot-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he missed just one game this season, because of the  
flu, his feet required constant treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so sick of it,'' he was quoted as saying.  
</P>
<P>
	Smits made the comments within an hour of the Pacers' loss to  
New York last Friday that eliminated them from the Eastern 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Smits has one year remaining on his contract and is due to  
receive a base salary of $12,125,000 next season.

<HEADLINE> Lopez Promotes Album in Puerto Rico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Now living her own vida loca,  
Jennifer Lopez has returned to her family's native Puerto Rico to 
wow her many fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez was on the Caribbean island to promote her new  
English-language album, ``On the Six,'' which features a duet with 
Puerto Rican salsa singer Marc Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old actress-turned-singer planned to autograph  
copies of her album and meet with fans at a mall in the San Juan 
suburb of Bayamon during her brief visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting a lot of people -- people here are very proud  
of her,'' said Lourdes Laboy, a promotions manager for Sony Music, 
which produced the album. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Martin, another Puerto Rican artist, now trails Lopez's  
``If You Had My Love'' on the Billboard pop singles chart. Martin's 
``Livin' La Vida Loca'' was previously at No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time I can remember that two Puerto Rican  
artists have achieved this, first and second place, both male and 
female categories,'' Laboy said Tuesday. ``In Puerto Rico, that's 
really something.''

<HEADLINE> CNBC Gets Agressive As Dobbs Departs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNBC is moving aggressively to snatch some of  
television's wealthiest viewers following last week's resignation 
of Lou Dobbs, anchor of the nightly business program ``Moneyline'' 
on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial news network announced Tuesday that it is  
expanding its competing business wrap-up show to one hour and 
locking in its most marketable personality, stock market reporter 
Maria Bartiromo, to a new five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking advantage of an opportunity,'' said CNBC  
president Bill Bolster. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN and its financial news offshoot, CNNfn, say they won't back  
down and they claimed the exit of Dobbs -- perhaps the best-known 
business TV personality -- hasn't made a dent in the show's ratings. 
Dobbs said last week he was leaving for an Internet start-up firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Some bulging wallets are at stake in the financial news fight.  
CNN's ``Moneyline'' is watched by about 387,000 households, more 
than twice the 183,000 households that watch CNBC's ``Business 
Center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While those ratings are a fraction of the 10 million households  
that watched ``60 Minutes'' -- the No. 1 rated network show last 
week -- the viewers of the business shows are among the most wealthy 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CNBC audience has the aggregate value to buy damn near  
anything you can advertise, not to mention they could probably buy 
some of the companies that are advertising,'' Bolster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moneyline earns more advertising revenue than any other show on  
the network, said Larry Goodman, president of CNN's sales 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Goodman believes ``Moneyline'' earns more in  
advertising revenue per viewer -- a key measure for advertisers -- 
than any other show on broadcast or cable television. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC, which already is a big money-maker for parent NBC, sees  
that as a potent vein of gold to be tapped. Although executives 
won't give precise figures, they say CNBC already has been making 
double-digit gains in profits over the last few years. It may may 
soon eclipse NBC, which is losing viewers and revenue, as a profit 
center, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's boom during the late 1990s, with the increasing  
number of Americans investing in the stock market, has made 
``Moneyline'' an attractive advertising destination for financial 
service companies, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet companies also advertise there, as do states seeking  
economic development. ``There's a lot of business to business 
advertising,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS's ``Nightly Business Report'' has more viewers than both of  
its cable competitors, but it doesn't sell advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moneyline'' expanded to an hour a year ago. CNBC has tried to  
come after ``Moneyline'' before, starting ``Business Center'' two 
years ago with Bartiromo and former Money magazine editor Tyler 
Mathisen, but CNN repulsed the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can do what they want,'' said Jeff Guralnick, executive  
vice president of CNN financial news. ``We've got a franchise 
broadcast that is going to continue to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Dobbs' exit is important to both ``Moneyline'' and CNNfn,  
Guralnick said he believed its impact has been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC believes viewers tuned to CNN for Dobbs, not the show. Its  
new hour-long ``Business Center'' will be anchored by CNBC veterans 
Ron Insana and Sue Herera, starting Monday. Bartiromo, signed to a 
new contract in part so CNN won't be able to poach her, will now 
anchor CNBC's ``Street Signs'' program at 2 p.m. in addition to her 
morning reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartiromo will also anchor a new program looking ahead to the  
next week's financial stories that will air Fridays at 7 p.m. and 
be repeated during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded ``Business Center'' is also part of CNBC's plans to  
get ready for the possibility of expanded trading hours at the 
stock exchanges, Bolster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, CNN on Tuesday assigned Steve Korn, vice chairman of  
its news group, to oversee a search for Dobbs' replacement as both 
``Moneyline'' anchor and president of CNNfn. 
</P>
<P>
	Willow Bay, Jan Hopkins, Terry Keenan, Tony Guida and Jack  
Cafferty are some of the people mentioned as candidates for the 
anchor job. 
</P>
<P>
	Korn is also looking for a new CNNfn president, another one of  
Dobbs' roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate parent Time Warner has also committed to aggressively  
seeking more cable outlets for CNNfn, Guralnick said. Currently, 
CNBC is available in 69 million homes, about seven times as many 
households as CNNfn, which has less than 10 million.

<HEADLINE> CNBC Looking To Attack CNN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Strictly judging by audience size, CNN's  
``Moneyline'' is far from the most popular show in television. 
</P>
<P>
	But the composition of that audience -- Wall Street tycoons,  
wealthy investors and others interested in a nightly wrap-up of 
business activities -- make it a valuable show for advertisers and 
ripe for attack from a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Emboldened by last week's resignation of ``Moneyline'' anchor

<HEADLINE> Alou Hopeful for Summer Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Moises Alou is recovering more quickly than  
expected from an off-season knee injury and hopes to return to the 
Houston Astros in mid-July, according to general manager Gerry 
Hunsicker. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a goal right now,'' Hunsicker said after speaking with  
Alou on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou is not expected actually to play again until August at the  
earliest. The club initially feared he would miss the 1999 season 
after surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his 
left knee, which he injured while working out on a treadmill before

<HEADLINE> Drop in Numbers at No. 1 Ski State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado resorts had their worst season in nearly  
two decades last winter as a dearth of early-season snow 
contributed to a drop of about 5 percent in skiers in the nation's 
No. 1 ski state. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the gains we made in the last three years we gave back,''  
said John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA. ``It was the 
worst drop since 1980-81, the last major snow drought year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado skier days dropped to 11.3 million from nearly 11.8  
million, according to industry figures released Monday. A skier day 
is the equivalent of a full-day lift ticket. Nationwide, skier days 
fell 2.5 percent to 52.1 million, the biggest decline since 
1991-92, according to the National Ski Areas Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Frew said widely publicized ``buddy passes,'' which allowed four  
people to buy season tickets at 1970s prices, failed to make up for 
the bad snow. He said thousands of the passes were not even picked 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can give it away, and Colorado skiers are not going to show  
up (if snow levels are below average),'' Frew said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The resorts anticipated a good season because of La Nina, which  
some forecasters believed would deliver above-average snow to 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the phenomenon sent the snow to the West Coast and  
Canada. In Colorado, snowfall was down 11 percent and much of it 
arrived after the lucrative Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we closed, it snowed every day for a month,'' said Paul  
Witt of Vail Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak Canadian dollar also drew international travelers and  
American skiers north. Whistler-Blackcomb in Canada, beneficiary of 
a huge snowfall, was up 25 percent, said David Perry, marketing 
vice president of Intrawest Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Both domestic and international visits were down 7 percent in  
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail also dealt with a $12 million pre-season arson fire that  
destroyed a restaurant and damaged some chair lifts and other 
buildings on Vail Mountain. They were replaced quickly thanks to 
the light snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	An American Airlines pilots' sickout around Christmas also  
affected flights to Vail and Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way you can have a decent season with those numbers  
stacked against you,'' said J.P. Pellerito, co-owner of Bart &AMP; 
Yetis restaurant in Vail. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail, whose 16 percent drop was the largest of any major area,  
saw its sister resort of Breckenridge oust it as the nation's No. 1 
resort. Breckenridge, which benefited from buddy pass sales, was up 
6.5 percent to 1,385,927 skiers.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Ky. Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Ky. (AP) -- A University of Kentucky medical helicopter  
crashed on a rugged mountainside in eastern Kentucky shortly after 
taking off in thick fog, killing all four people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims in Monday night's crash were two pilots, a flight  
nurse and a paramedic, said Mary Margaret Colliver, a spokeswoman 
for the UK Hospital in Lexington. Their names were not immediately 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	No patients were aboard, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sikorsky S-76 helicopter had lifted off from the Jackson  
airport shortly after 10 p.m. on its way to Lexington, Colliver 
said. Airport officials later lost contact with the aircraft, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Breathitt County Constable J.C. Montgomery said there was thick  
fog in the area at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter was found on a rugged mountainside a few miles  
from Jackson, so badly wrecked that authorities had a difficult 
time identifying it, State Police Trooper Tim Mullins said. Thick 
smoke was still rising from the wreckage this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Former coroner Gene Watts said his son, Deputy Coroner Randy  
Watts, phoned from the scene to say two bodies had been removed 
from the crash site overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have some bodies to get out,'' Watts said this  
morning. His son reported it was so dark at the scene last night it 
was hard to see anything. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jackson-based helicopter, leased from Petroleum Helicopters  
Inc., was one of two used by the hospital to transport patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators were expected to arrive at the crash site  
today, Mulling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is about 70 miles southeast of Lexington.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Hooligans Apologize to Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESSEN, Germany (AP) -- Soccer hooligans on trial for attempted  
murder apologized in person Tuesday to the French policeman beaten 
comatose during the most savage attack of last summer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer David Nivel was attending the trial for the first time  
as an observer to face the four men accused of kicking him, 
stomping him and smashing his head with a metal bar. He will not be 
called to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Left blind in one eye and still undergoing therapy to regain his  
speech and ability to walk, Nivel, 44, stared motionless while two 
of his assailants offered apologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kicked you once or twice,'' Frank Renger, 31, told Nivel.  
``I'm ashamed about it. I'd like to apologize, even though it 
doesn't help you very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobias Reifschlaeger, 24, added: ``I am very sorry.''  
</P>
<P>
	Both men, as well as a third suspect, Andre Zawacki, 28, had  
already expressed regret. The three admit participating in the 
attack but not with the brutality that would have caused Nivel's 
severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one suspect, Christopher Rauch, 24, has not apologized.  
</P>
<P>
	Niven's wife, Lorette, rejected the apologies.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard their pleas for forgiveness,'' she told reporters  
afterward. ``But I cannot forgive. My husband lost everything on 
that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of German hooligans were in Lens, France, on June 21  
for the sold-out match between Germany and Yugoslavia. Despite 
heavy police security, the situation became chaotic after the game 
ended in a 2-2 draw. As French officers sought to push back the 
hooligans, one group slipped into a side street where Nivel was 
posted with two other police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get the cops,'' the hooligans shouted, according to the  
indictment. The other officers fled, and the group surrounded 
Nivel. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, a photo of Nivel lying unconscious in a pool of  
blood hit newspapers around the world, shocking billions of fans 
following soccer's premier event and casting a pall over the rest 
of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the brutality ``a disgrace  
for Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nivel's wife has said she and her husband wanted to attend the  
trial to know what motivated hooligans to beat him so horribly. In 
court on Tuesday, she gave a statement detailing her husband's 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nivel cannot drive a car, play sports, read or paint, his wife  
said. He can hardly talk. In addition to his diminished eyesight, 
his hearing is poor and he has lost most of his sense of taste and 
smell. He can no longer be an attentive father to their two 
children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the four suspects face sentences of up to 15  
years. The trial is expected to last into September.

	S.Korea Still Hopes for Talks  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea is vowing to pursue its  
policy of peaceful engagement with North Korea, despite a high-seas 
shootout that sank one northern patrol boat, badly damaged five 
others and is believed to have killed 30 North Korean sailors. As 
the neighbors blamed each other for the clash in the Yellow Sea, 
South Korea said it still hoped to meet North Korea in Beijing on 
Monday in the first talks between the two governments in 14 months. 
North Korea's reaction was belligerent. The official Korean Central 
News Agency called the shooting a ``deliberate and planned'' 
provocation ``aimed at driving the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula to the brink of war.''

	NATO Troops Find Charred Remains  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Russian convoy bearing food and  
fuel arrived from Bosnia today to resupply its troops at Pristina's 
airport. Dutch soldiers discovered the charred remains of 20 
villagers in Kosovo, the second-straight day that atrocities were 
unearthed by NATO forces. Hundreds of Kosovo rebels came out of 
hiding as Serb police evacuated the province ahead of a 
NATO-imposed deadline, ransacking offices and torching buildings as 
they left. The burned bodies found in a home in Velika Krusa are 
believed to be from a mass execution of ethnic Albanians, 860,000 
of whom fled Kosovo and Serb troops from March until a 78-day NATO 
air war forced Yugoslavia to agree to peace last week. 

</P>

	U.S. Says Serbs Following Schedule  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslavia is on schedule to withdraw all its  
troops and police from a designated zone in southern Kosovo by 
midnight, the Clinton administration said today. So far, 20,000 
troops have left the province and 15,000 allied troops have 
entered. NATO had threatened to resume its bombing if the Serbs 
dragged their feet in leaving Kosovo. Russia, meanwhile, has given 
the Clinton administration assurances it would not add to the 200 
soldiers it has sent to Pristina.

	KRAKOW, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II, in bed with the flu,  
canceled all his planned appearances today, surprising 1 million 
people standing in the rain waiting to see their beloved fellow 
Pole. The 79-year-old pontiff developed a slight fever -- below 100

	Electric Fields, Cancer Link Nixed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six years of research have produced little  
hard evidence that the magnetic fields around electric power lines 
cause cancer yet some lingering concerns remain, a National 
Institutes of Health division reported today. The report said there 
have been some statistical associations between the fields and 
childhood leukemia as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 
adults exposed to the fields through their work, such as electric 
utility workers, machinists and welders. Research is continuing on 
these ``lingering concerns'' and efforts to reduce human exposure 
to electromagnetic fields should continue, the report said.

title of Mr., Miss, Ms. or Mrs. The bill leaves it up to school 
boards to decide the punishment, which cannot include expulsion or 
suspension as an option. Many teachers and students are skeptical,

programs and smuggling them into Germany for commercial purposes.

<HEADLINE> Dan Marino Signs Two-Year Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The last quarterback from the NFL class of 1983  
intends to remain the Miami Dolphins' main passer into the next 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Marino signed a two-year contract extension with the Miami  
Dolphins, the team said Tuesday. The extension goes through the 
2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that if we are to have success again this year, Dan  
will be a big part of that,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said in 
a release. ``He performed extremely well last season, and I know he 
will do everything he can to have an even better year in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms weren't disclosed, but the deal was expected to  
include a signing bonus of about $6.4 million. The contract was 
designed primarily to create about $2 million in salary-cap space 
for the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said in January that the Dolphins planned to extend  
Marino's contract. Marino said in April that he expected to sign 
the deal soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to have this extension completed,'' Marino said in a  
statement. ``Not only does it put to rest any questions about my 
contract status before the start of the season, but it also gives 
the Dolphins more room under the salary cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Marino signed a one-year contract extension that would  
have expired at the end of the 1999 season. That extension came 
after signing a three-year contract in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who turns 38 in September, has said he plans to play  
until he's at least 40. He's the only active member of the NFL 
quarterback class of 1983 following the retirement of Denver's John 
Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway and Marino were among six quarterbacks drafted in the  
first round that year. The others were Jim Kelly, Ken O'Brien, Tony 
Eason and Todd Blackledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino started all 16 regular season games in 1998, completing  
310 of 537 passes for 3,497 yards and 23 touchdowns with 15 
interceptions. He ranked in the top three among AFC quarterbacks 
last year in attempts, completions, passing yardage and touchdown 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 16-year career, Marino has completed 4,763 of 7,989 passes  
for 58,913 yards and 408 touchdowns, all NFL career records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about the upcoming season,'' Marino said. ``I  
really feel as though we will continue to improve as a team like we 
have each of the last two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins have made steady improvement since Johnson became  
coach, from 8-8 in 1996 to 9-7 in 1997 and 10-6 last season, when 
they won a playoff game for the first time in four years, beating 
Buffalo 24-17 in a wild-card game. A 38-3 playoff loss against the 
Denver Broncos ended Miami's bid to return to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino played in his only Super Bowl in January 1985. San  
Francisco intercepted him twice and defeated Miami 38-16.

<HEADLINE> House Exploring Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans and Democrats prepared for a  
rare private meeting to explore a compromise Social Security rescue 
plan today as their Senate counterparts demonstrated that common 
ground remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee will meet Thursday morning  
behind closed doors to begin working on possible solutions for the 
retirement program, which faces insolvency by 2034 as the baby boom 
generation collects retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe now the time has come to move from the discussion  
phase to the action phase,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing from several outside experts on Social Security,  
Archer said he will ask the panel's members ``to engage in an open 
and frank discussion ... to see how we might be able to come 
together to solve this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Charles Rangel of New  
York, said the private session would remove some of the ``political 
aspect'' from Social Security, long one of the most sensitive of 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we really can get something done,'' Rangel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the optimism, there are deep divisions between the two  
parties, and between President Clinton and Congress. They differ 
greatly on ways to shore up the program and on the scope and 
financing of supplementary personal retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some problems were on stark display Tuesday when the Senate  
failed again to break a Democratic filibuster against legislation 
that would set up parliamentary roadblocks to prevent spending or 
tax cuts out of $1.8 trillion in Social Security surpluses over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from criticisms that the so-called ``lock box'' measure is  
long on symbolism and short on real enforcement, Democrats said 
they won't support it until they can offer amendments to also set 
aside Medicare money. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are precluded from offering amendments, we will oppose  
it on procedural grounds,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he would continue to  
force votes on the Senate measure and a House-passed alternative in 
hopes of intensifying political pressure on Democrats to drop their 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to keep coming back to this repeatedly,'' Lott  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last week demonstrated how difficult it will be to keep  
from spending the Social Security surplus: the Defense Department 
authorization bill included $15.6 billion in spending out of 
surplus for various military needs.

<HEADLINE> Sun Microsystems Teams Up With 3Com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sun Microsystems and 3Com announced Tuesday  
that 3Com's Palm, a line of hand-held computers, will use Sun's 
Java programming language. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced at Sun's annual conference for Java  
programmers in San Francisco, is a large part of the computer 
company's plan to rebuild momentum for Java as rivals develop their 
own versions of the language. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our combined technologies will give companies an open,  
standards-based environment for rapidly distributing information to 
everyone in the organization, for faster and smarter 
decision-making,'' said Robin Abrams, president for Palm Computing, 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance makes sense because the Palm's chief hardware  
rivals use Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, while Sun's 
Java effort also is threatened most by the Redmond, Wash.-based 
software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Java-enabled Palms should begin shipping this fall, Sun said.

<HEADLINE> CNBC Gets Agressive As Dobbs Departs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNBC is moving aggressively to snatch some of  
television's wealthiest viewers following last week's resignation 
of Lou Dobbs, anchor of the nightly business program ``Moneyline'' 
on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial news network announced Tuesday that it is  
expanding its competing business wrap-up show to one hour and 
locking in its most marketable personality, stock market reporter 
Maria Bartiromo, to a new five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking advantage of an opportunity,'' said CNBC  
president Bill Bolster. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN and its financial news offshoot, CNNfn, say they won't back  
down and they claimed the exit of Dobbs -- perhaps the best-known 
business TV personality -- hasn't made a dent in the show's ratings. 
Dobbs said last week he was leaving for an Internet start-up firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Some bulging wallets are at stake in the financial news fight.  
CNN's ``Moneyline'' is watched by about 387,000 households, more 
than twice the 183,000 households that watch CNBC's ``Business 
Center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While those ratings are a fraction of the 10 million households  
that watched ``60 Minutes'' -- the No. 1 rated network show last 
week -- the viewers of the business shows are among the most wealthy 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CNBC audience has the aggregate value to buy damn near  
anything you can advertise, not to mention they could probably buy 
some of the companies that are advertising,'' Bolster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moneyline earns more advertising revenue than any other show on  
the network, said Larry Goodman, president of CNN's sales 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Goodman believes ``Moneyline'' earns more in  
advertising revenue per viewer -- a key measure for advertisers -- 
than any other show on broadcast or cable television. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC, which already is a big money-maker for parent NBC, sees  
that as a potent vein of gold to be tapped. Although executives 
won't give precise figures, they say CNBC already has been making 
double-digit gains in profits over the last few years. It may may 
soon eclipse NBC, which is losing viewers and revenue, as a profit 
center, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's boom during the late 1990s, with the increasing  
number of Americans investing in the stock market, has made 
``Moneyline'' an attractive advertising destination for financial 
service companies, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet companies also advertise there, as do states seeking  
economic development. ``There's a lot of business to business 
advertising,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS's ``Nightly Business Report'' has more viewers than both of  
its cable competitors, but it doesn't sell advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moneyline'' expanded to an hour a year ago. CNBC has tried to  
come after ``Moneyline'' before, starting ``Business Center'' two 
years ago with Bartiromo and former Money magazine editor Tyler 
Mathisen, but CNN repulsed the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can do what they want,'' said Jeff Guralnick, executive  
vice president of CNN financial news. ``We've got a franchise 
broadcast that is going to continue to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Dobbs' exit is important to both ``Moneyline'' and CNNfn,  
Guralnick said he believed its impact has been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	CNBC believes viewers tuned to CNN for Dobbs, not the show. Its  
new hour-long ``Business Center'' will be anchored by CNBC veterans 
Ron Insana and Sue Herera, starting Monday. Bartiromo, signed to a 
new contract in part so CNN won't be able to poach her, will now 
anchor CNBC's ``Street Signs'' program at 2 p.m. in addition to her 
morning reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartiromo will also anchor a new program looking ahead to the  
next week's financial stories that will air Fridays at 7 p.m. and 
be repeated during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The expanded ``Business Center'' is also part of CNBC's plans to  
get ready for the possibility of expanded trading hours at the 
stock exchanges, Bolster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, CNN on Tuesday assigned Steve Korn, vice chairman of  
its news group, to oversee a search for Dobbs' replacement as both 
``Moneyline'' anchor and president of CNNfn. 
</P>
<P>
	Willow Bay, Jan Hopkins, Terry Keenan, Tony Guida and Jack  
Cafferty are some of the people mentioned as candidates for the 
anchor job. 
</P>
<P>
	Korn is also looking for a new CNNfn president, another one of  
Dobbs' roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate parent Time Warner has also committed to aggressively  
seeking more cable outlets for CNNfn, Guralnick said. Currently, 
CNBC is available in 69 million homes, about seven times as many 
households as CNNfn, which has less than 10 million.

<HEADLINE> S. Baptists To Recruit in Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Southern Baptist Convention president Paige  
Patterson asked church members today to get beyond their own 
concerns and focus on evangelizing cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Southern Baptists, will you weep before God until God gives us  
the souls of the cities?'' he asked in an opening speech at the 
church's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mark a dramatic shift for a denomination whose 16  
million members live mostly in the suburbs, small towns and rural 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 150 years since it was formed by rural slavery  
proponents, the Southern Baptist Convention kept to its racially 
exclusive roots even as the civil rights era changed the nation 
around it. 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent years, the nation's largest Protestant  
denomination has tried to distance itself from the past. Four years 
ago, it apologized to blacks for its decades of tolerating racism. 
It now has about 2,800 churches with mostly black congregations -- 
still only a fraction of all black Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the convention is pushing for further racial reform. While  
Patterson's speech did not specifically mention minorities, his 
call for a greater church presence in the cities was clearly 
related to the theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I can do to change things 100 years ago,''  
said the Rev. Phil Roberts of the convention's North American 
Mission Board. ``I do know what I can do now: Take the Gospel and 
reach out and minister to all the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson, who helped engineer a conservative resurgence in the  
convention, is also expected to be re-elected without opposition at 
the two-day annual meeting, which many moderates are skipping. 
Attendance at the convention, which concludes Wednesday evening, is 
not expected to exceed 14,000. It was once as high as 45,500 
people, in Dallas in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The outreach plan is less about reconciliation than growth, said  
the Rev. David Key, director of Baptist Studies at Emory 
University's Candler School of Theology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Southern Baptists have not been successful in an urban  
setting,'' he said. ``They want to be more than a white Southern 
rural denomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Southern Baptists are looking forward to more fervor  
than fighting at this year's gathering in the Georgia Dome. They 
are hoping for an end to the battles between conservatives and 
moderates of recent years, and said they don't expect more grand 
announcements, like the 1997 Disney boycott or the decision to 
target Jews for proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you are going to see in this convention is a return to  
normalcy,'' said the Rev. Timothy George, dean of Beeson Divinity 
School at Sanford University in Birmingham, Ala.

<HEADLINE> Broadcaster Sues Wrestling Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Kuwaiti broadcaster is suing the World  
Wrestling Federation over a promotional video that shows him being 
roughed up on the air by a wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassam Al Othman, the host of ``Good Morning Kuwait,'' filed the  
suit Monday in federal court, accusing the federation of slurring 
all Arabic people by repeatedly showing the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The video is a promotion for the wrestler ``Vader,'' who grabbed  
Othman's tie and threatened him during a 1997 interview after 
Othman asked another wrestler whether the sport was faked, 
according to Othman's lawyer, Douglas Clark Hollmann of Annapolis, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Othman ``managed to pry Vader's hands off him and walked off the  
set,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation has used the clip to promote its shows ``with the  
apparent belief that a video of a large white American wrestler 
shaking an Arab person by his tie had commercial value in the 
market their product is sold,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Byrne, a spokesman for the wrestling organization, would not  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said use of the video is ``clearly outrageous and  
insulting'' to Othman and to Arabic people everywhere and in 
violation of the civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	The video clip, broadcast on television around the world, has  
been seen in Kuwait, causing Othman embarrassment, the lawsuit 
said. It said the video clip constitutes defamation.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Sign Pick for $1.55M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays signed second-round pick  
Carl Crawford for a signing bonus of $1,553,000, the fourth-highest 
ever for a drafted player taken after the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, 17, was one of the top quarterback recruits in the  
country and had accepted a scholarship to play football at the 
University of Nebraska. Instead, the 6-foot-2, 195-pound outfielder 
agreed to a minor league contract and will report to the Devil 
Rays' rookie league team at Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ecstatic to have a player of his caliber,'' said Dan  
Jennings, Tampa Bay's director of scouting, who signed Crawford 
late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford went to Jefferson Davis High School in Houston and was  
the 52nd player taken overall in the amateur draft earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Rick Ankiel, the St. Louis Cardinals' second-round  
pick in 1997, got a $2.5 million signing bonus, and right-hander 
Chad Hutchinson, the Cardinals' second round pick last year, got a 
$3.5 million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Matt Belisle, taken by Atlanta on the second round  
last year, got a $1.8 million signing bonus.

<HEADLINE> Ex NBA-er Greg Anderson Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Former pro basketball player Greg Anderson  
has been sentenced to five months in a Houston jail for 
participating in a cocaine deal to which he had pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson broke into tears after was sentenced Monday in federal  
court in Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Atlanta Hawks backup center faced up to three years  
in prison for the charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine with the 
intent of distributing it. Anderson pleaded guilty to the charge 
after he was caught during an FBI sting operation at the Grand 
Casino Bayview Hotel in May, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the sentence by U.S. District Court Judge Walter Gex,  
the 6-foot-10-inch Anderson turned to a hallway wall and cried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm relieved,'' Anderson said, declining further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Three co-defendants already have been sentenced for the sale of  
three ounces of cocaine to an FBI informant. They received prison 
terms ranging from eight to 27 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given you a break now. Don't disappoint me,'' Gex told  
Anderson, who also was fined $5,000, and will be placed in a 
supervised-release program for four years after he is released from 
custody. ``If you have to come back before me, pack your bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson told the judge that he ``made a mistake. But I feel  
like I got my life back on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson hasn't given up his hopes of returning to the NBA. He  
recently played for a team in Buenos Aires, Argentina, that paid 
him $40,000 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors, who approved delays of Anderson's  
sentencing so he could play in China and Argentina, recommended 
that Gex deviate from federal sentencing guidelines. They cited his 
cooperation with investigators as a reason for a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, a former University of Houston star who earned the  
nickname ``Cadillac'' because he rode his bicycle to school, has 
said he met Howard Hill last season while playing for Atlanta. He 
denied knowing Hill was a Biloxi drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was a first-round draft pick by the San Antonio Spurs  
in 1987 and spent two two-year stints with the team. He also played 
for Milwaukee, Denver, Detroit. He played for Atlanta in 1994-95 
and rejoined the Hawks last year.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Weapons Agency Gets Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers demanding an overhaul of the Energy  
Department said today their efforts to create a more independent 
nuclear weapons agency were given a boost by a blistering report 
about lax security at weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, requested by President Clinton, concluded that  
improved security cannot be assured at nuclear facilities unless 
the weapons program is concentrated in an agency within the 
department that is largely free from outside interference. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he remains opposed to such  
an agency, saying it would create a new ``fiefdom'' and ``risk 
eroding the link between national security and science at its 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that his recent moves to consolidate security and  
counterintelligence and give them a higher profile is providing the 
safeguards lawmakers want. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dramatically improving and fixing the problem,''  
Richardson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But both in the House and Senate, lawmakers who have pressed for  
a more dramatic overhaul said the administration may have little 
choice but accept a new nuclear agency, although still within the 
DOE, considering the findings of the president's own intelligence 
advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is one of the sponsors of a proposal  
to create a Nuclear Security Agency within the department. He said 
approval of such an agency in some fashion was ``inevitable'' 
considering the new momentum on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how this can be resisted,'' said Domenici in a  
separate interview. ``The president is now confronted with whether 
he wants to follow the recommendations of a very distinguished 
board that is his, or if I read Secretary Richardson right, to 
follow his recommendation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has said he would recommend President Clinton veto  
any legislation creating a semi-autonomous nuclear agency along the 
lines being proposed in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The report released Monday by a panel of the president's Foreign  
Intelligence Advisory Board emphatically called for just such an 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	It said over 20 years the Energy Department and its labs had  
demonstrated an ``arrogant disregard'' for security and 
counterintelligence, and shown that it was ``incapable of reforming 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Republican Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, the  
board's chairman, is scheduled to appear before key Senate 
committees next week to discuss the panel's findings. The session 
is likely to provide even more momentum for broader structural 
changes at the Energy Department than the administration has 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the ranking Democrat on the  
Intelligence Committee, said support is growing for the kind of 
changes proposed by Domenici and several other Republican senators. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Richardson ought to stop opposing the measure and offer  
changes to make it more acceptable. ``He's got to move closer,'' 
said Kerrey. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said the Rudman  
report amounted to a ``ringing endorsement'' of the proposal he has 
made to restructure the Energy Department. He also wants a 
semi-autonomous agency within the department for nuclear defense 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	If the administration continues to oppose such a move, said  
Thornberry, ``It's much more likely the nuclear weapons complex 
will be lifted out of the department'' and put into a separate 
agency or under the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	While supporters of the plan say the administration would  
continue to be accountable to the energy secretary, Richardson said 
it would undermine his authority and make it more -- not less -- 
difficult to ensure security and combat espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``To set up a new fiefdom in the department of fiefdoms is not  
what I need,'' Richardson recently told the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., another sponsor of the measure, said he's  
baffled by Richardson's opposition. ``I don't see what the problem 
is,'' said Kyl. He argued that the agency head would still have to 
report to the energy secretary.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Farming impresses Chileans / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- Ordinary hog and potato farms in Ohio  
were enough to draw gasps of amazement from a group of Mapuche 
Indian farmers visiting from southern Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven Chileans, who grow wheat, oats and potatoes and raise  
cows and pigs on five-acre farms, toured the farms Tuesday as part 
of a trip arranged with the help of Wright State University. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the farmers, Mario Millapi, said he would be happy with a  
fraction of the machinery and technology U.S. farmers enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way they feed the animals, it's all electronic,'' he said.  
``Nobody working there is throwing the food to the pigs. That's 
very surprising to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said buying a tractor is too expensive for most Mapuche  
farmers, who are forced to rent the vehicles by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
	When U.S. farmer Todd Michael showed off machinery that enables  
him to plant as many as 50 acres of potatoes a day, a murmur of 
astonishment rose from the group. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of the farmers wore their native ponchos, others  
sported newly purchased American baseball caps. Most carried 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's trip was funded by the Chilean Ministry of  
Agriculture. The farmers were accompanied by officials from Chile's 
Universidad de la Frontera, which helped arrange the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the best of our heart comes from the Mapuche,'' said  
Eduardo Navarrete, dean of the university's business school. 
``Their life will be changed by this visit, and the quality of 
their life will be improved by what they learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Numbering more than 1 million, the Mapuche are the largest  
indigenous group in Chile. For more than 350 years they defended 
their nation from invasion, finally losing control of their lands 
in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were forced from their homes and live impoverished lives in  
small rural communities. But recently the Mapuches have taken steps 
to try to reclaim the land. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle has mostly centered in the courts, with more than 80  
lawsuits demanding restitution of land the Indians say nonnative 
Chileans illegally took from them. But some Mapuches have 
forcefully seized private farms that belonged to the Indians 
centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The group that came to Ohio asked to meet with American Indians  
to see how they work, take care of their families and fit into 
American society. Last week, they toured a farm rented by the 
Shawnee Nation and a Dayton-area plastics company owned by Tom 
Smith, a Cherokee Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	After stops at llama, buffalo and dairy farms, the group visited  
Chicago over the weekend and then resumed the agricultural portion 
of the trip in Ohio. The group plans to wrap up its weeklong visit 
with a stop in Washington, for meetings with officials from the 
U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Agassi and Novotna Face Tough Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Andre Agassi's hopes of becoming the  
first player in 19 years to win the French Open and Wimbledon in 
the same season weren't helped much with the Wimbledon draw 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, top-seeded Pete Sampras -- beaten in only one of his  
last 40 Wimbledon matches and champion five of the past six years -- 
should get off well when play begins Monday at the All England 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	For the women, nobody has a tougher road than defending champion  
Jana Novotna, who has an ankle injury and could face testing 
matches after a relatively easy first-rounder against Taiwan's 
Shi-Ting Wang. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi is headed for a fourth-round match against Germany's  
Tommy Haas, who beat him in the second round of Wimbledon last 
year. If Agassi beats Haas, 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard 
Krajicek (seeded No. 5) looms in the quarterfinals. They have split 
six career matches and Agassi holds a 2-0 advantage on grass, but 
they haven't met on that surface in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras -- 75-14 in his career on grass and unbeaten in his last  
12 matches on grass -- opens with Scott Draper. Although the 
Australian won the Queen's grass-court tournament a year ago, he's 
never beaten Sampras. After that, Sampras looks unchallenged until 
the quarterfinals, where he could meet big-serving Australian Mark 
Philippoussis, seeded No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Pat Rafter, who still seems uncertain on grass, has a  
tough draw. After facing a qualifier in the opening round, he could 
meet Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman in the second round and another Swede, 
Thomas Enqvist, in the third. Rafter teamed with Bjorkman to win 
the doubles five months ago in the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, slumping recently, might not  
get past his first-round match against hard-serving Magnus Larsson 
of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 6 Tim Henman, the best hope for winning Britain's first  
men's title in 63 years, could face a tough fourth-round match 
against Karol Kucera (13th seeded) and possibly Kafelnikov in the 
quarterfinals. That would bring him against Sampras in the 
semifinals, and Sampras holds a 5-0 career advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's other contender, No. 13 Greg Rusedski, has a difficult  
first-round match against Australian Jason Stoltenberg, a 1996 
Wimbledon semifinalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Goran Ivanisevic, runner-up last year to Sampras, is seeded No.  
10 and seems bound for a fourth-round match against rejuvenated 
Todd Martin (No. 8). Ivanisevic has won two of their three 
grass-court matches. 
</P>
<P>
	If plays goes according to form, the quarterfinals would be:  
Sampras vs. Philippoussis, Kafelnikov vs. Henman, Krajicek vs. 
Agassi and Rafter vs. Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Novotna, after her first-round match against Wang, she is  
likely to meet Cara Black of Zimbabwe in the second round. The 
third-round might be easier, but the fourth could find Novotna 
against doubles partner Natasha Zvereva (No. 16) -- a semifinalist 
last year -- with No. 3 Lindsay Davenport in the quarterfinals and 
top-seeded Martina Hingis waiting in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Zvereva injured Novotna's ankle when she fell on her while  
playing doubles in the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-time champion Steffi Graf (No. 2), who scored an emotional  
victory over Hingis in the French Open final 10 days ago, should 
have an easy first-round match against unseeded Ludmila Cervanova 
of Slovakia. But Mariaan De Swardt of South Africa could be a major 
obstacle in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	De Swardt beat Graf in 1995 -- the lowest-ranked player to beat  
her in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Hingis opens against a qualifier, then probably will  
face Mary Pierce (No. 9) in the fourth round and Arantxa 
Sanchez-Vicario (No. 7) in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	If form holds, the quarterfinals would be: Hingis vs.  
Sanchez-Vicario; Davenport vs. Novotna; Nathalie Tauziat vs. Monica 
Seles; Venus Williams vs. Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	There will not be an all-Williams final. Sisters Venus (No. 6)  
and Serena (No. 10) could meet in the fourth round. Venus should 
make it that far, but Serena has a tough first-round match against 
Austrian Barbara Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
	The most attractive first-round match has No. 15 Dominique Van  
Roost against Russian Anna Kournikova. Unseeded American Jennifer 
Capriati -- a 1991 Wimbledon semifinalist -- also has a difficult 
first-round match, against Anke Huber of Germany.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Has Tough Draw at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Five-time champion Pete Sampras will  
start defense of his Wimbledon title against Australia's Scott 
Draper and is scheduled to meet another big-serving Australian, 
Mark Philippoussis, in the quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tough start for Sampras, seeded No. 1 after regaining the  
top world ranking. He faces the player he succeeded as champion at 
Queen's Club, the pre-Wimbledon grasscourt championship which 
Draper won last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At last Sampras avoids two-time U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter,  
last season's Wimbledon runner-up Goran Ivanisevic, 1996 titlist 
Richard Krajicek and newly crowned French Open champion Andre 
Agassi until the final. They are in the other half of the draw. 
</P>
<P>
	After a rocky first five months of the year, Sampras also  
appears to be returning to some kind of form after winning the 
pre-Wimbledon grasscourt tournament at Queen's Club on Sunday by 
beating Britain's Tim Henman in a close, three-set final. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending women's champion Jana Novotna, seeded fifth, has a  
much easier first round draw than Sampras. She faces Shi-ting Wang 
of Taiwan while top seed and world No. 1 Martina Hingis will meet 
one of the qualifiers. The qualifying rounds are taking place this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-time champion Steffi Graf, who is seeded No. 2 and beat  
Hingis in the final of the French Open 10 days ago, meets 
Slovakia's Ludmila Cervanova, ranked 100 in the world. Lindsay 
Davenport, the No. 3 seeded, meets Alexandra Fusai of France while 
the two Williams sisters, Venus and Serena are scheduled to meet in 
the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's draw, second seed Rafter and Ivanisevic, 10th, meet  
qualifiers. Krajicek, seeded five, meets Christian Ruud of Norway 
and the fourth-seeded Agassi faces Romania's Andrei Pavel. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time champion Boris Becker, who plays tennis on a  
part-time basis these days and will make this his last Wimbledon, 
faces Britain's Miles Maclagan. Britain's Greg Rusedski, seeded 
9th, faces Jason Stoltenberg, a semifinalist in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential quarterfinals are Sampras-Philippoussis,  
Kafelnikov-Henman, Krajicek-Agassi and Todd Martin-Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	On the women's side it could be Hingis vs. Arantxa  
Sanchez-Vicario, Davenport-Novotna, Nathalie Tauziat-Monica Seles 
and Venus Williams-Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlights of the women's first round are Jennifer Capriati  
against Anke Huber, and Anna Kournikova, ranked 18 and unseeded, 
against No. 16 seed Dominic Van Roost of Belgium. Kournikova had to 
pull out last year with a thumb injury.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong May Call Y2K Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong thinks its computers will be able to  
avoid ``millennium bug'' problems but, to stay on the safe side, 
the government wants to make the last day of 1999 a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said that shutting down banks and other  
businesses that rely heavily on computers would avoid possible 
complications as the year changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The holiday was suggested by Hong Kong's Association of Bankers,  
whose members say an extra day off ahead of 2000 will give them 
time to wind up all their end-of-the-year accounting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would ensure that all the relevant records are accurate  
and complete after the millennium occurs,'' said Rebecca Lai, Hong 
Kong's deputy secretary for financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of closing Hong Kong's financial institutions was  
supported by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority -- the territory's de 
facto central bank -- and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures 
Commission, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The millennium bug problem arises from computers that may  
confuse the year 2000 for 1900 when the year changes. This may 
happen because older software was designed to recognize only the 
last two digits -- the two zeros in those years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong said it would not be alone in declaring Dec. 31 a  
holiday. Other places, including Britain, are closing for a 
holiday, along with numerous banks throughout continental Europe.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers OK Powerball Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Powerball fever could be declared a  
public safety emergency in Connecticut under a bill passed by the 
state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation passed Monday would allow towns that are swamped  
with hordes of jackpot-seekers to ask the state lottery commission 
to suspend sales of the game there for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow the town leader to declare a ``Powerball  
Emergency'' when ticket demand is so great that would impede 
traffic and ``create a risk of imminent breach of the peace and the 
threat to public health and safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was proposed after many wealthy Connecticut towns  
bordering New York were recently overrun with Powerball players 
from New York, New Jersey and other states that do not offer the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the state reimbursed Greenwich for $93,000 in police  
overtime, trash removal and other costs of controlling mobs of 
ticket buyers that flooded into the town in search a record $295.7 
million jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	People swooned from the heat, there were no bathroom facilities  
and many shops closed because the huge lines prevented customers 
from getting into their stores, said Rep. Janet Lockton, 
R-Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal passed overwhelmingly, but over the objections of  
some black lawmakers who equated the bill to a form of 
city-sponsored redlining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that this is not a way to keep certain people out of  
certain towns in this state,'' said Rep. Ernest Newton, 
D-Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill now goes to the governor.

<HEADLINE> Auto Exec Discusses Labor Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The fact that employees of the former  
Chrysler Corp. now work for a German company will have no effect on 
DaimlerChrysler AG's labor talks with the United Auto Workers, a 
top U.S. executive said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on the first UAW contract since Chrysler was  
acquired by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG began with the traditional 
handshake ceremony at the main bargaining table. The contract 
covers about 75,000 U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
	National contract talks began Monday at Ford Motor Co. and will  
start at General Motors Corp. on Wednesday. They will continue 
through the summer and intensify in early September when the union 
will pick a lead company to negotiate economic issues. The current 
three-year pacts expire Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit,  
said the talks would be held the same way they were before the 
merger. He said the final decisions will be made at 
DaimlerChrysler's U.S. headquarters, not in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Stuttgart informed, but there's no approval  
necessary from Stuttgart,'' Stallkamp said at a news conference 
with UAW President Stephen P. Yokich. ``It will be an Auburn 
Hills-UAW kind of an agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp said the company wants a contract that maintains its  
flexibility, which in the context of these talks usually means the 
ability to get work rules that make its plants more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is doing well, we're doing well as a company,'' he  
said. ``But we're always looking over our shoulder at our 
competition. We've had six to seven years of a very strong 
industry. We want to do what we can as a company to keep that going 
along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Health care costs, overtime, job security and parceling out more  
subassembly work to outside suppliers are other issues in talks 
with all three automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential hangup in this year's DaimlerChrysler negotiations  
could be the UAW's efforts to organize the company's nonunion 
plants in the United States: a Mercedes-Benz plant making sport 
utility vehicles in Alabama and three Freightliner commercial truck 
plants in the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is not a bargaining issue in these talks, any  
problems that arise in the organizing campaigns will affect 
DaimlerChrysler's relationship with its largest U.S. union and the 
tenor of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler has taken a neutral position in the organizing  
campaigns. Stallkamp said UAW leaders ``remind us whenever they 
find somebody who's not being neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW has been trying to organize the Freightliner plants  
since before the DaimlerChrysler merger. Yokich said there have 
been some serious problems there and at the Mercedes-Benz plant, 
though he was not specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``It started badly, very badly,'' Yokich said. ``Some of the  
things we went through as a union with both of the companies is 
unheard of, even with the anti-union people in America. I think 
we'll get it straightened out eventually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich, who was given a seat on the DaimlerChrysler supervisory  
board, said he has met several times with co-chairmen Juergen 
Schrempp and Robert J. Eaton to discuss the organizing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's different for the Germans, very different,'' Yokich said.  
``Both of those companies are controlled out of Germany, not out of 
Chrysler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich also said he has had ``some reservations'' about the  
merger after working with the former Daimler-Benz management. The 
UAW had endorsed the deal after it was announced in May 1998.

<HEADLINE> Erik Menendez Marries in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Erik Menendez got married in prison  
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez, 28, was wed Saturday at the state prison in  
Sacramento, said prison spokesman Billy Mayfield. Officials were 
uncertain of the bride's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez and his brother, Lyle, are serving life sentences for  
murdering their parents in 1989 in their Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers admitted shooting Jose and Kitty Menendez but said  
they did it out of fear that their parents were about to kill them 
to prevent disclosure of their father's molestation of Erik. 
Prosecutors said the sons were after their parents' millions. 
</P>
<P>
	From jail, Lyle Menendez married his pen pal girlfriend, Anna  
Eriksson, in a telephone conference call on July 2, 1996, the day 
he was sentenced.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- New York Knicks forward Larry Johnson is  
feeling improvement in his sprained right knee, but he wouldn't say 
Tuesday whether he'll play in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still going to be a game-time decision,'' Johnson said.  
``It feels better than it did yesterday. That's my positive sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks face the San Antonio Spurs in the best-of-7  
championship series starting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was injured against the Indiana Pacers on Friday.  
Johnson was taken to a hospital, and the Knicks went on to win the 
game and the Eastern Conference Finals that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Johnson said, referring to the possibility of  
being sidelined for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when I do come back, a bulky brace. Five, six days off,  
out of rhythm, a little bit out of shape. Tough. But this is the 
finals. There's no excuses, no lowering your head,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A massage therapist is working on the knee. Johnson plans to  
test it during a Wednesday morning shoot-around. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has said he may play in the series. The possibility of  
playing in Friday's Game 2 ``looks a whole lot better'' than it did 
only couple of days ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *EWING AS CHEERLEADER:* Patrick Ewing knows his job for the NBA  
Finals. The New York center will be in street clothes watching from 
the bench and rooting for his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard sitting here watching, but that's my fate. I've just  
got to do whatever I can do by talking to the guys and cheering 
them,'' Ewing said Tuesday at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said it's a ``terrible twist'' that  
Ewing managed to play despite injuries much of the season and 
helped New York make it this far but now cannot play. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing suffered the season-ending Achilles' tendon injury during  
the Eastern Conference Finals against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-year veteran, Ewing sees one major parallel between his  
career and that of 10-year veteran center David Robinson of the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither one of us has won one yet,'' Ewing said. ``At the end  
of this series one of us is going to walk away knowing that they're 
the champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINALS ARE NICE:* George ``Iceman'' Gervin made a return visit  
to the Spurs' basketball court Tuesday, this time in the role of 
historic franchise figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Gervin, known for his cool finesse and signature finger-roll,  
played for the San Antonio franchise beginning with its first year 
in town, the 1973-74 season as part of the old American Basketball 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the team merged into the NBA, he won league scoring titles  
in 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Gervin said he's proud to have been part of the foundation for  
the franchise, and he's proud of the current Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our city's been waiting on this opportunity a long time and it  
finally came,'' Gervin said. ``It's a long list of guys who tried 
to help us get to where the guys are today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Spurs players have said they want to win a championship for  
their predecessors, like Gervin and James Silas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being an old man, you're glad to hear young fellows or veteran  
players coming up saying they want to win something for the guys in 
the past. Our history is everything,'' he said. ``When I first got 
here it was Alamo town. Once we got started we really put the San 
Antonio Spurs on the map.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late in his basketball career, in the late 1980s, Gervin  
struggled with substance abuse. But he got sober and now spends his 
time as a Spurs community relations representative and working with 
a charter school for toubled youth that he helped form. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of hard lessons for all of us,'' he said. ``The  
key is to be here today to talk about them.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PERIMETER POINTS:* With so much attention paid to guarding big  
men Duncan and Robinson, the Spurs' outside shooters are sometimes 
left to produce offensively for San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Jaren Jackson likes the approach the perimeter shooters  
take -- an aggressive one. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we have the attitude where we have confidence in  
each other on the perimeter -- guys being very aggressive with their 
shot, just let it fly, don't let the fact that you missed a few 
shots affect your game -- you'll be all right,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IGNORING THE PUNDITS:* San Antonio forward Sean Elliott says if  
a player pays too much attention to newspaper or television 
reports, it can mess with his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pick up the paper and they have matchups and they say,  
well, edge goes to the Knicks, saying that you're going to get 
dogged or something. A guy loses focus. He tries to go out there 
and prove everybody wrong,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a decade in the league, Elliott has developed a solution.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I like to do is not read the paper, not watch the  
TV,'' Elliott said. ``A lot of the time the analogies and all that 
stuff are way off. You don't want to get caught up in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FELLOW SPORTSMAN:* Boxer ``Jesse'' James Leija of San Antonio  
is a friend and fan of several Spurs players, and he came to 
practice Tuesday to offer his support. 
</P>
<P>
	Leija, a former WBC lightweight champion and current lightweight  
champion of the fringe International Boxing Association, was at the 
Alamodome with sons, James, 8, and Dean, 3, who wore David Robinson 
and Tim Duncan jerseys, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy for the players and I'm happy for the fans,''  
Leija said. ``To get to this point doesn't come by accident. It 
only comes by hard work. I think it's the hardest-working team in 
the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Spurs players, including Sean Elliott, have come to his  
fights, and he has worked out in the offseason with some of the 
team members. But Leija is especially close to Will Perdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just ordinary people with great talent,'' Leija said.

<HEADLINE> Executive Bidding for Senate Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Wall Street executive with deep pockets and  
no experience in elected office took a major step today toward 
entering the race to be New Jersey's next U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon S. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,  
announced he has formed a campaign exploratory committee. Aides 
said he has all but decided to run for the seat being vacated next 
year by Sen. Frank Lautenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Also seeking the Democratic nomination are former Gov. Jim  
Florio; Rep. Frank Pallone; former Democratic state chairman B. 
Thomas Byrne Jr.; Edison Mayor George Spadoro; former Rep. Herb 
Klein; businessman Lloyd DeVos, and former gubernatorial candidate 
Michael Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's 21 Democratic county chairmen will meet Monday with  
all eight prospective candidates to try to winnow the field, said 
state chairman Tom Giblin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman is raising money in preparation to run for  
the Republican nomination. Florio is eager for a rematch against 
Whitman, who ousted him from the governorship in 1993, but some 
Democrats are hoping aloud that the party chooses someone other 
else to take on the popular Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement announcing his exploratory committee, Corzine  
said: ``The question for Democrats is who will make the strongest 
race against Governor Whitman in the general election. I have 
assured the members of this committee that I will conduct a 
relentless campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, soybeans, Pork, Copper Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures tumbled Tuesday on the Chicago Board  
of Trade after the government reported crops appear to have been 
unscathed by recent poor weather. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork futures fell sharply a second day, while  
copper also sank. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat fell on the U.S. Agriculture Department's report that  
winter wheat growing conditions improved last week, confounding 
expectations of a decline in crop ratings because of heavy rains 
that could foster disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also were pressured by excellent crop ratings.  
Some 70 percent of the nation's soybean crop -- which many expect to 
set another production record this year -- was in good to excellent 
condition, the USDA reported. And 75 percent of the corn crop was 
in good condition or better, compared to 76 percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices for the nation's spring-planted crops also were  
affected by forecasts for milder temperatures and beneficial

	BHP has delayed a decision on what to do with the unprofitable  
mines. Many copper companies have been affected by a slump in 
prices, which came as demand fell sharply following economic 
turmoil in Asia, parts of Europe and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper is used in construction for wiring and plumbing, and  
economic downturns typically negatively affect construction 
activity.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Helicopter Crash Kills Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Ky. (AP) -- A medical helicopter stationed in rural  
eastern Kentucky to provide a quick response to emergencies crashed 
into a rugged mountainside in dense fog, killing its four-person 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pilots, a flight nurse and a paramedic died in the crash  
last night, just minutes after the University of Kentucky 
helicopter took off from the airport in Jackson for a 125-mile 
flight to Lexington. It was not carrying a patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert L. Hancock of the National Transportation Safety Board  
said Tuesday that no distress call was received from the 
helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the crash, the National Weather Service had  
issued a dense fog advisory for motorists. Visibility on the ground 
was a quarter of a mile, and vertical visibility was 100 feet, said 
Mike Lewis, science and operations officer at the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was certified to fly in conditions with low  
visibility, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots were employees of Petroleum Helicopters Inc. of  
Lafayette, La., which owned the helicopter, a company spokesman 
said. The other two victims were employed by UK.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds Strikes Out on Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the nation's  
second-biggest cigarette company, is expected to be a tougher 
competitor now that it's no longer a part of a heavily indebted 
food and tobacco conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes began operating  
on its own Tuesday after being spun off from RJR Nabisco Holdings 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to be operating once again as a  
freestanding, publicly traded company,'' said Andrew Schindler, 
president and chief executive of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. The tobacco 
company had been the foundation for RJR Nabisco and now trades on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff left RJR Nabisco with an 80 percent stake in Nabisco  
Holdings Corp., which makes Oreo cookies and Planters nuts. So it 
renamed itself Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. and will also trade on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Financier Carl Icahn, who had been pushing RJR Nabisco leaders  
for a breakup for several years, didn't wait around for the 
spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	He disclosed in a government filing that he had sold his entire  
8 percent stake of RJR Nabisco shares late in Monday's session for 
about $813 million. That was about $130 million more than he paid 
for the stock accumulated over the past eight months, said people 
close to Icahn who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco won wide attention as the target of a 1980s takeover  
battle chronicled in the book ``Barbarians at the Gate.'' It was 
taken private in a $25 billion deal that long ranked as the biggest 
corporate buyout on record. But the heavy debt resulting from the 
buyout hobbled its growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn and other backers of a breakup long argued that Wall  
Street failed to appreciate the value in the company's food 
interests because of concerns about potential legal liability for 
its sibling tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	They say separating the two businesses will mean more value for  
investors than they would have seen with food and tobacco under the 
same parent. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, RJR chairman and chief executive Steven Goldstone  
announced RJR had reached an agreement to sell its international 
tobacco business for $7.8 billion to Japan Tobacco Co. and that the 
board had decided to split up its remaining tobacco and food 
businesses. The board eventually proposed spinning off the tobacco 
business, and used proceeds from the international tobacco sale to 
cut debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn had favored a different method for breaking up the  
company, saying it should spin off its food interests and keep its 
U.S. tobacco operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that spinning off the food business would more clearly  
shield it from those who may win liability awards against the 
tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goldstone said the tobacco spinoff could probably be  
accomplished more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn assembled a slate of candidate for the board to push his  
plan, but gave up the fight before the May shareholders meeting 
when it appeared he would not get the support of other large 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco company will continue to be based in Winston-Salem,  
N.C., and employs about 8,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds had once been the U.S. cigarette industry leader but  
lost its top position to Philip Morris Cos. and its Marlboro brand 
in the early 1980s. Reynolds now accounts for about 25 percent of 
U.S. cigarette sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Emanuel Goldman of Merrill Lynch said the high debt  
costs that followed the RJR Nabisco buyout limited what R.J. 
Reynolds could spend marketing its cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said with a lower debt, Reynolds should be able to  
respond more aggressively to Philip Morris' efforts to extend its 
50 percent-plus share of retail cigarette sales with tactics like 
giving selected retailers price discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business is in much better position to fight the battle,''  
he said.

two police officers with eggs got a year of probation and was 
ordered to pay $750.

officers, getting yolk on one officer's gun and radio and causing, 
according to a police report, $230 in damage.

	Hernandez was also sentenced to 25 hours of community service

<HEADLINE> Gas Surge Causes Mich. Home Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- A gas surge caused fires to break out  
in 18 homes Tuesday, injuring two people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears like some small home fires, not small if it's your  
home, but it's not like a raging inferno,'' City Manager Merrill 
Stanley told Detroit radio station WWJ. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage to most of the homes wasn't readily apparent from  
outside, but city officials said at least eight sustained 
significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction work was going on in the neighborhood when the  
pressure surge happened, said Jeff Kruithoff, director of the 
city's police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge may have caused pilot lights to increase their flames,  
said Jane Breederland, a spokeswoman for the Semco Energy Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas was shutoff to about 1,500 homes. Crews are going  
house-to-house to make sure the lines are clean. It may be two to 
three days before the gas is turned back on. 
</P>
<P>
	It was left up to homeowners where to spend the night. The Red  
Cross set up a shelter for those who wanted to leave.

<HEADLINE> Day Care Provider Guilty in Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A day care operator was convicted of fatally  
shaking a 13-month-old boy and slamming his head on the floor, 
apparently because he wouldn't stop watching television. 
</P>
<P>
	Manjit Basuta, 44, could get 25 years to life in prison at  
sentencing July 13. She was convicted Monday in the slaying of 
Oliver Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's mother, Audrey Amaral, is pushing for a law that would  
require stricter regulations for day care centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristina Carrillo, Basuta's Guatemalan housekeeper, testified  
that Ms. Basuta shook the toddler and slammed his head because he 
refused to stop watching television when it was time for a diaper 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Eugene Iredale argued that the boy died from a previous  
head injury, possibly at the hands of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the judge barred the defense from telling the jury that  
Ms. Amaral was accused of abuse by her former husband during a 
custody battle over Oliver. The allegations were later dropped.

<HEADLINE> AP's Century of Brightest Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The complete list of the 25 most significant stars and star  
pairings of the century, as chosen by Associated Press 
entertainment writers and editors for their contributions to the 
art and lore of Hollywood. The list was released April: 
</P>
<P>
	-- CHARLIE CHAPLIN: The first great international movie star, a  
comedian whose artistry remains timeless. He and Buster Keaton 
defined screen comedy for generations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MARY PICKFORD: She was called America's Sweetheart, but her  
sentimental films captured the world. 
</P>
<P>
	-- LILLIAN GISH: D.W. Griffith's favorite actress, she starred in  
his greatest films as well as others she produced. 
</P>
<P>
	-- DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS: A superb athlete with breathtaking stunts,  
he joined his wife, Mary Pickford, and Chaplin to form United 
Artists. With Erroll Flynn, he created the role of swashbuckling 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
	-- RUDOLPH VALENTINO: Women swooned over the first film matinee  
idol. His death at 31 contributed to his legend. 
</P>
<P>
	-- GRETA GARBO: She combined brooding drama and offscreen  
remoteness to create an aura of mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	-- STAN LAUREL and OLIVER HARDY: The greatest comedy team, with  
perfect slapstick timing and a wonderfully bumbling sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
	-- CLARK GABLE: His manly looks and unquestioned authority made  
him the No. 1 screen hero for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JAMES CAGNEY: His vitality and machine-gun delivery captured  
the tempo of the gangster era. He hoofed his way to an Oscar as 
George M. Cohan. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JUDY GARLAND: If Garbo concealed; Garland revealed. One of the  
great screen show-stoppers and heartbreakers, in song, drama and 
comedy. A generation later, Barbra Streisand continued that 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	-- CARY GRANT: Who could have imagined that a former vaudeville  
acrobat named Archie Leach would become the ace practitioner of 
high comedy? 
</P>
<P>
	-- KATHARINE HEPBURN and SPENCER TRACY: Her idiosyncratic manner  
and Yankee briskness bolstered a long career that earned her a 
record four Oscars. He brought naturalness to the screen, often in 
sophisticated sparring with Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
	-- FRED ASTAIRE and GINGER ROGERS: As Hepburn once said: ``Fred  
gives Ginger class, and she gives him sex appeal.'' The 
incomparable musical team. 
</P>
<P>
	-- BETTE DAVIS: An intelligent actress with a wide emotional  
range, her screen presence was electrifying. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SHIRLEY TEMPLE: A little girl's sunny optimism captivated the  
Depression generation. 
</P>
<P>
	-- HUMPHREY BOGART and LAUREN BACALL: He was a true original and  
an early portrayer of the anti-hero whose acting skill was little 
recognized until later in his career. Slender, stylish, cynical and 
smoky-voiced, she was his leading lady onscreen and off. They were 
married from 1945 until his death in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JOHN WAYNE: Larger than life on and off the screen, he became  
the epitome of the valiant frontiersman in a series of classic 
westerns. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JAMES STEWART: The quintessential American hero who could play  
a surprising range of roles. Except villains. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MARLON BRANDO: A student of the Method at the Actors Studio,  
his seemingly impromptu style influenced a generation of actors. 
With Laurence Olivier, one of the screen's greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MARILYN MONROE: Blazing across the sky like a comet, she  
redefined sex appeal, then disappeared before she could prove her 
worth as an actress. 
</P>
<P>
	-- SIDNEY POITIER: The first black actor to win an Oscar (Hattie  
McDaniel was the first black actress to do so), he destroyed 
Hollywood stereotypes by playing normal black Americans with 
dignity and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JACK NICHOLSON: His sly cynicism fitted perfectly into an era  
of disillusion. With Robert De Niro, one of the two great actors of 
the late 20th century, screen descendants of Brando. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MERYL STREEP: Like Nicholson, she has earned 11 Academy  
nominations and two Oscars. Her powerful performances were notable 
at a time when worthy roles for women were in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: His appeal defines international  
superstar; he and Sylvester Stallone were the first great high-tech 
action heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- MICKEY MOUSE: A true star though only celluloid, he is the  
timeless original of a genre, animation, that won hearts young and 
old.

<HEADLINE> Fox Sues Turner Over New Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Fox sued Turner Broadcasting and its parent  
company Tuesday, claiming Turner's new regional entertainment 
network violated a non-compete agreement the two media companies 
signed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net South asked a Superior Court judge on Tuesday to  
restrain Turner from offering its new network, known as Turner 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., said the Turner  
network, a division of Time Warner Inc., will directly compete with 
Fox's Sports Net South. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a $65 million deal in which Fox acquired SportSouth  
from Turner, the sides agreed in 1996 to a 12-year non-compete 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox claimed after receiving the $65 million payment in 1998,  
Turner ``secretly began to make plans to form its own regional 
cable television sports network to broadcast Atlanta Braves, 
Atlanta Hawks, and Atlanta Thrashers games in direct competition 
with SportSouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner South plans to offer movies, sitcoms, sports and original  
programs designed for the tastes of viewers in six southeastern 
U.S. states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turner intends to try to obscure the fact that Turner South is  
a regional cable sports network by claiming that it also offers 
other types of programming,'' the lawsuit says. ``However, this 
other programming is essentially secondary, with little independent 
value to advertisers, local operators, or subscribers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have complied with all of our contractual obligations to  
Fox,'' Turner spokesman Ronnie Gunnerson said. ``We believe the 
lawsuit regarding Turner South is entirely without merit.''

<HEADLINE> Free Web Service Manages E-Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- You don't need a computer for e-mail  
these days. A new free Web service allows people to access their 
e-mail from any telephone using a toll-free number. 
</P>
<P>
	The www.myTalk.com service, launched Tuesday by General Magic,  
Inc., is the latest of its kind to join competitors using voice 
recognition technology so that people can talk to the service to 
tell it what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a member can say ``Read it,'' ``Get rid of it,'' or  
``I'd like to reply'' to handle common tasks. Saying ``Next'' will 
immediately take the user to the next e-mail message. 
</P>
<P>
	Funded by advertising sponsorship, managers of the system said  
they hope to target some of the more than 90 million U.S. consumers 
who use e-mail these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Hess, an Internet marketing consultant, tested the system  
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so conversational that you almost forget you're talking  
to a computer. When I said 'Thank you,' it said 'You're welcome.' 
When I asked it to replay an e-mail message, it said 'Sure,' '' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works: New members sign up at the myTalk Web site,  
where they choose a username and password. Then they are given a 
toll-free phone number and a personal extension for added security. 
</P>
<P>
	When members are away from their computers, they use the  
toll-free number to check e-mail. To reply to an e-mail, the myTalk 
service records the user's words exactly as they are said. This 
voice message is then sent to the recipient's e-mail inbox as a 
``voice file.'' The recipient sees a message that he or she has a 
voice file from the member, which can be listened to by simply 
clicking on the file. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lowenstein, a senior vice president at market research firm  
The Yankee Group, said the system should make e-mail more useful to 
people in their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``MyTalk should appeal to consumers who want a simpler way to  
work with e-mail, to people without easy access to the Internet who 
can use the phone as an alternative, and to serious users who will 
enjoy the convenience of the e-mail collection feature,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the service, General Magic has developed a signup  
profile that has members select five or more topics in which they 
have interest so that over time, advertisements can be targeted 
toward them. Members will hear audio ads during their phone 
sessions and see Web banner ads when they are using the myTalk Web 
site to check e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Hill, McGraw Win at TNN Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Six of the 12 trophies at the TNN Music  
City News Country Awards went to the husband-and-wife team of Faith 
Hill and Tim McGraw. Country's power couple will have to share two 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few major awards McGraw and Hill didn't win Monday  
evening was the top prize, Entertainer of the Year. Neither was 
nominated, and Neal McCoy beat George Strait, Garth Brooks, Alan 
Jackson and Shania Twain to win it for the second straight year. 
All sell more CDs than McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't know how big a deal this is for me,'' McCoy  
said. ``We bust our butts over 200 dates a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw was named best male vocalist, and Hill best female  
vocalist. Their duet ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me'' won 
best vocal collaboration and song. Hill's pop-crossover hit ``This 
Kiss'' won for best video and single. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel greedy all of a sudden,'' Hill said after winning her  
third award, the best single honor. She started the evening as the 
top nominee with seven, and left the top winner with five. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Brooks, Jackson, Strait and Vince Gill to win best  
male vocalist, McGraw quipped: ``I'm glad my wife wasn't nominated 
for this tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strait was the only performer to beat Hill in a category in  
which she was nominated, winning best album for ``One Step at a 
Time'' over Hill's ``Faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixie Chicks, who were touring in Europe, were named best  
vocal band and female star of tomorrow. Brooks &AMP; Dunn took home 
their fourth trophy for best vocal duo, and Michael Peterson was 
named male star of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors of the Music City News fan magazine named Charlie  
Daniels, a veteran with hits like ``The Devil Went Down to 
Georgia,'' a living legend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to thank my three favorite people: the Father,  
Son and Holy Ghost,'' Daniels said. Lee Roy Parnell, Deana Carter, 
Vassar Clements and Steve Wariner joined Daniels to play his song, 
``The South's Gonna Do It.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of industry leaders selected Roy Clark to receive the  
Minnie Pearl Award for charity work. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, Gill and George Jones were among the performers on the  
show, which was televised live by The Nashville Network. Comedian 
Jeff Foxworthy was the host. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were held on the first day of International Country  
Music Fan Fair, which draws thousands of fans to Nashville 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans vote for the TNN Music City News Country Awards through  
ballots, or via telephone and the Internet. The two other major 
annual country music awards show are voted by industry workers.

<HEADLINE> Astros Manager Has Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker had surgery  
today to remove a tangled mass of blood vessels in his brain that 
caused him to have a seizure in the dugout on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation lasted about 5 1/2 hours. There was no immediate word  
on Dierker's condition, but a news conference was scheduled for 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nurses say Larry looked good this morning and was in good  
spirits before he was taken into the operating room,'' said 
Methodist Hospital spokeswoman Stefanie Asin. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of his players, Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio, visited  
Dierker in the hospital Monday and said he was in good spirits. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get here (today), hopefully we'll have more good  
news,'' Bagwell said Monday night, when the Astros defeated Atlanta 
10-4. ``We miss him. We hope he has a speedy recovery. He's in our 
thoughts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players, shaken by Dierker's collapse during Sunday's game  
in the Astrodome, at first feared he had a brain tumor 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker went into violent convulsions in the eighth inning of  
the game against the San Diego Padres. Players and coaches 
restrained him until medical personnel arrived and took him to 
Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests Monday revealed he had an arteriovenous malformation -- a  
condition in which people are born with malformed, sometimes 
tangled, arteries or veins in the brain. Over time, they can become 
dilated, so that the enlarged vessels either pressure neural tissue 
or even burst and bleed into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros put up Dierker's No. 49 jersey in the dugout Monday  
night in their first game without their manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the seriousness of Dierker's diagnosis, it was not as  
bad as his players first thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary to hear that he might have a tumor,'' right  
fielder Derek Bell said. ``You couldn't eat or sleep last night. It 
was great to see that he is OK. Now we can go out and do what he 
trained us to do the last three years, have fun and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said he was told by  
doctors that on a scale of 1 to 5 -- with 1 the least serious -- 
Dierker's condition is 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``But everything is unpredictable at this point,'' the general  
manager said. ``Until they go in and do the surgery we don't really 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also told Hunsicker the mass -- about 1 1/2 inches in  
diameter -- is located in a less-critical part of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other managers, Joe Torre of the New York Yankees and John  
Boles of the Florida Marlins, have been sidelined because of 
illness this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre missed the start of the season while recovering from  
prostate surgery, and Boles missed a total of 13 games following 
back surgery and a sprained neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's condition added to Houston's growing list of injured  
and ill players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	First base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 because of an  
irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw left six days 
later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz is expected back this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Moises Alou tore a knee ligament when he fell off a  
treadmill in February and will miss most of the season. And third 
baseman Ken Caminiti has been on the disabled list since May 22 
with a strained calf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through some tough years, but from an injury and  
illness standpoint, there's never been anything close to all 
this,'' Hunsicker said.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Waiting Period OK'd in Mich </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan will soon become the 14th state  
to require a waiting period before women can obtain abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the state and a coalition of more than 20 abortion  
clinics have settled a lawsuit that had suspended a 1993 law which 
required a waiting period for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Engler has already signed the law, which will now go  
into effect in 90 days. A federal judge was expected to approve the 
settlement today. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise announced Monday would require clinics to give  
women reading materials at least 24 hours before they request the 
procedure be performed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen states have abortion laws that include waiting periods  
and state-ordered counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	The materials discuss the risks and complications of abortion  
and show detailed drawings of the development of a fetus. They were 
written by the state Department of Community Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``This information doesn't sway people one way or the other,''  
department spokeswoman Geralyn Lasher said. ``This isn't 
information that Right to Life is putting together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One abortion-rights group called the materials ``false and  
misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be illegal for states to force women to delay a  
legal, medical procedure and subject them to medically biased, 
anti-abortion propaganda,'' said Julie Kay, an attorney with the 
New York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, which helped 
represent the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the compromise, a doctor who performs an abortion without  
a waiting period can be charged with a misdemeanor unless the 
abortion meets the U.S. Supreme Court's definition of a ``medical 
emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also allows the reading materials to be sent by  
mail, fax, or electronic mail. Abortion clinics wanted that change 
to prevent women from having to travel twice to an abortion clinic.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Satisfied With Yugoslav Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials say they are  
satisfied that the Yugoslav military is making a sincere effort to 
meet today's deadline for emptying a swath of southern Kosovo of 
all soldiers and police. The territory includes a section of Kosovo 
being patrolled by American troops. 
</P>
<P>
	It remained unclear how NATO would respond if it discovered Serb  
stragglers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are making a strong effort to get them out,'' the  
Pentagon's chief spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Monday. ``I can't 
predict now, 24 hours before the deadline, what will happen. But 
they are certainly making a very strong effort to get them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His comments suggested doubt that the deadline would be met.  
NATO had said it would resume bombing Yugoslavia if the Serbs 
deliberately dragged their feet in leaving Kosovo, a province of 
Serbia, although Bacon's description of the Serb withdrawal effort 
seemed to indicate a willingness to let the deadline slide a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roads are jammed, so they're having a hard time getting  
them out,'' he said. ``But we basically see a strong effort to try 
to comply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Serbs pulled out, NATO troops continued to pour in,  
numbering about 14,000 as of Monday. They include 1,000 U.S. Army 
soldiers and 900 U.S. Marines, the vanguard of a U.S. force 
eventually to total 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A contingent of about 200 Russian troops remained at the  
Pristina airport in central Kosovo while U.S. and NATO officials 
sought to work out an arrangement for the Russians to participate 
in a peacekeeping force under NATO control. The Russians are 
pushing to have their own geographic sector of Kosovo to patrol 
while resisting NATO's demand that all peacekeepers in Kosovo 
answer to NATO authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen made plans to meet Russian  
Defense Minister Marshall Igor Sergeyev on Wednesday and Thursday 
in Helsinki, Finland, to hash out the peacekeeping dispute. They 
were to be joined by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	More Russian peacekeepers were heading toward Kosovo today, the  
Defense Ministry said. Russia had sent an 11-vehicle convoy from 
Bosnia to resupply its troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian control of the airport has caused an embarrassing  
diplomatic standoff. The surprise arrival of the Russian troops 
ahead of NATO has given Moscow greater leverage in negotiations 
over its place in the peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told a White House news conference Monday a range of  
issues would be discussed at the Helsinki talks. Despite the 
stalemate at Pristina, ``there has not been long-term damage from 
this'' to U.S.-Russian relations, Albright said. ``We'll work the 
Russian part out because there is good will,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was to discuss the situation with Russian  
President Boris Yeltsin in Cologne on Sunday at a meeting of the 
world's seven richest nations and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be up to the commander of NATO's peacekeepers in Kosovo,  
British Lt. Gen. Sir Mike Jackson, to determine whether the Serbs 
have lived up to the ``military technical agreement'' they signed 
June 9 that laid down deadlines for pulling out of Kosovo. It gave 
the Serbs until today to vacate a stretch of southern Kosovo; they 
are to be completely out of a middle section of the province by 
Friday, and out of Kosovo altogether by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The area of Serb withdrawal in southern Kosovo includes large  
parts of the sector U.S. peacekeepers are patrolling, as well as 
parts of the German, Italian and British sectors, including the 
provincial capital of Pristina. Thus it includes Serbs who are 
encamped with the Russians at the Pristina airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the Serb forces were struggling with clogged  
roadways, a shortage of transport vehicles and vehicle breakdowns. 
He showed reporters video tape from a U.S. surveillance drone that 
showed an estimated 300 to 500 military and civilian vehicles 
forming a convoy headed north from south-central Kosovo on Monday. 
The convoy was being monitored by U.S. Army Apache attack 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do see firm evidence they are trying to get out,'' Bacon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 14,000 and 15,000 Serb army and police forces have left  
Kosovo, Bacon said, plus about 20 percent of their estimated 300 
tanks, about half of their armored troop carriers and as much as 15 
percent of their artillery. 
</P>
<P>
	The military agreement signed with NATO required the Serbs to  
have 100 percent of their air defense weapons out of Kosovo and 
beyond a 16-mile buffer zone in Serbia by last Saturday. Bacon said 
all of these weapons had been withdrawn except for an unspecified 
number of anti-aircraft artillery guns, ``which they are working to 
move as soon as possible.'' He said some of these are broken down. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Helsinki meeting, Cohen was to meet with NATO defense  
ministers or their representatives in Brussels, Belgium, then fly 
to the Balkans to meet with U.S. troops.

number of anti-aircraft artillery guns, ``which they are working to 
move as soon as possible.'' He said some of these are broken down.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 31.66  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose moderately today as investors  
scooped up Internet, pharmaceutical and oil company shares at 
bargain prices yet waited anxiously for tomorrow's report on 
consumer prices. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 31.66 
at 10,594.99. Broader stock indicators were also modestly higher. 
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 16.37 to 2,414.68. 
Tomorrow's consumer price report for May is expected to provide 
important clues about inflation and whether the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates to slow the economy's growth when its 
Open Market Committee meets June 29-30.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a new sign of the globalization of financial

investment firm plan to launch a computerized stock market in

	Still No Decision on WTO Head

	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization is still deadlocked  
in the search for a new director-general despite signs of growing 
support for former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore, trade diplomats 
said today. In a letter to the 134 member countries, WTO general 
council chairman Ali Mchumo said there was still no immediate 
likelihood of a decision, and advised them to ``draw the 
appropriate conclusions and act accordingly.'' Mchumo said 80 
delegations were prepared to accept Moore -- who is backed by the 
United States and many European nations. But, in reference to Japan 
and other Asian nations, he said several members continued to 
maintain a formal objection.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The outbreak of the Worm.Explore.Zip computer

weeks, anti-virus experts reported today as systems managers at 
infected companies worked to contain the damage. Officials 
cautioned that the complex design of Worm.Explore.Zip might make it 
harder to contain than the Melissa and Chernobyl viruses that hit 
earlier this spring. The flow of new firsthand reports is not 
increasing, said Mark Zajicek, member of the government-chartered

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates urged a Senate

high-tech companies that are helping to drive the nation's booming 
economy. Gates testified in a packed room on Capitol Hill, just 
blocks from the federal courthouse where Microsoft is fighting a 
landmark antitrust case. He barely discussed his legal problems, 
except to say that antitrust laws ``are fine'' and don't need to be 
rewritten. He said the technology industry's success in the United 
States owes a lot to the ``the fact that people can take incredible 
risks and if they're successful they can have incredible rewards.''

	AACHEN, Germany (AP) -- A German state court today convicted a  
Texas man of counterfeiting more than $63 million worth of 
Microsoft computer programs. John-Joseph Staud, 39, was sentenced 
to four years in prison for three counts of counterfeiting patented 
programs and smuggling them into Germany for commercial purposes. 
Microsoft Corp. greeted the court's decision as ``a meaningful 
signal'' toward thwarting computer piracy. The Redmond, 
Wash.,-based software giant said the counterfeit case was its 
biggest in terms of the operation's sophistication and the 
magnitude of damage.

	Coke Products Banned in Belgium

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. admitted today that  
problems at two of its factories led to the contamination of some 
products in Belgium, where dozens of people fell ill after drinking 
Coke beverages. Philippe Lenfant, general manager of Coca-Cola 
Belgium, said separate errors occurred at Coca-Cola plants in 
Dunkirk, France, and Antwerp, Belgium. In Antwerp, Lenfant said, 
gas used to carbonate drinks about two weeks ago was ``of bad 
quality.'' In Dunkirk, a pesticide used on some wooden crates in 
which the cans are placed leaked onto the underside of the cans. 
People who drank from these cans probably fell ill after inhaling 
the substance, Lenfant said. He said the pesticide had not leaked 
into drinks. Beldium's health minister yesterday banned sales of 
Coke and other Coca-Cola brands. Coca-Cola stock was down 1 1/16 at 
63 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Accounting Firm To Pay $1.1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An accounting firm has agreed to pay $1.1 million  
to settle a state investigation into its role in preparing 
financial documents that led to former Gov. Fife Symington's 
conviction on federal bank fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement announced Tuesday also concludes a 4-year-old  
probe of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand's role in the alleged rigging of a bid 
to win a $1.5 million state contract in 1991, Attorney General 
Janet Napolitano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington, a two-term Republican, was convicted of seven counts  
of bank and wire fraud in 1997 stemming from his former career as a 
Phoenix developer. One count was later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington was forced to resign but remains free on appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged Symington gave false personal financial  
statements to lenders to get millions of dollars in loans to fund 
his failing projects in the 1980s and early '90s. Symington 
prepared some of the statements and others were prepared or 
reviewed by his accountants. 
</P>
<P>
	Coopers &AMP; Lybrand merged with Price Waterhouse in 1998 to form  
PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington contended that his inflated net worth and other  
mistakes in the documents were unintentional and should have been 
caught by Coopers accountants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy with the way the matter was concluded,'' said  
Lee Stein, an assistant attorney general who helped negotiate the 
settlement. ``It's a significant amount of money, and it resolves 
the allegations and brings a conclusion to a big case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PricewaterhouseCoopers said it was glad the matter was over  
with. 
</P>
<P>
	``This investigation was launched years ago. We're gratified  
that the settlement announced today finally enables state officials 
to put the matter to rest,'' the firm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Symington and his attorney did not return phone calls Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Rik Smits Says He May Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Rik Smits, the Indiana Pacers center the  
past 11 years, is quoted in a Dutch newspaper as saying he might 
consider retirement because of the constant pain in his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time, I really didn't enjoy playing this  
season,'' Smits said in Monday's editions of the daily De 
Volkskrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-4 Smits, a native of Eindhoven, Holland, has played  
on sore feet for several seasons. He had surgery to repair nerve 
damage in both of his feet in September 1996, but has never 
completely recovered. He missed 30 games in the 1996-97 season and 
nine games in the 1997-98 season because of foot-related problems.

<HEADLINE> Internet Porn Biz Owner Eyes Caesars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A business that proudly boasts it runs the  
world's biggest Internet sex site was greeted with widespread 
skepticism as it announced a $3.6 billion offer to get into the 
casino gambling business by buying one of industry's 
most-recognized names. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean Fund International, which owns the Sex.com Web site and  
describes itself as a British Virgin Island mutual fund, said 
Tuesday it wants to purchase Caesars casinos as well as some 
nongambling properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We characterize that as bizarre and we underscore the word  
bizarre,'' said Jason Ader, a gambling industry analyst for Bear 
Stearns &AMP; Co. ``Our advice to investors is to dismiss this as so 
much noise. It's not likely to have much credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place Entertainment Corp. already has reached agreement to  
buy Caesars casino-hotels from Starwood Hotels and Resorts for $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place said its plan to purchase the Caesars properties is  
``on track and scheduled to close in the fourth quarter of 1999.'' 
It said it did not plan to respond to the unsolicited offer from 
Ocean Fund, which also caught Starwood officials by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never heard of Ocean Fund International,'' Starwood  
spokesman Jim Gallagher said. ``We have no knowledge whatsoever of 
their purported offer. They have talked to no one here. Their press 
relations guy said the offer was sent to one of our executives, but 
that executive has never heard of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O. Robert Meredith, a Salt Lake City attorney representing Ocean  
Fund, said he faxed an offer to both Starwood and Park Place late 
Monday. He said Ocean Fund is ``legitimate,'' adding ``I know they 
pay their bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher said Starwood was continuing to work with Park Place  
toward completion of a deal announced in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Starwood was  
up 43 3/4 cents at $31.87 1/2 a share, while Park Place was down 18 3/4 
cents at $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed purchase was announced in a statement released on  
PR Newswire, a commercial service for distributing news releases. 
Renu Aldrich, public relations manager for PR Newswire, told The 
Associated Press on Tuesday that the company had launched an 
investigation into the release after an internal check system 
``raised red flags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said PR Newswire had concerns about the release until  
Meredith provided a copy of the offer, which the lawyer said was 
sent to Russell Sternlicht at Starwood and Arthur Goldberg at Park 
Place. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Ocean Fund picked Caesars, Meredith said: ``They felt  
the bid on the table was substantially less than what it was 
worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even the lawyer for Ocean Fund was skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``My thought is they're going to have an uphill battle'' getting  
licensed in the various states because they feature pornographic 
material, Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Coccimiglio, a casino analyst for Prudential Securities,  
said licensing ``would be a great challenge, particularly in all 
the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ader agreed it would be hard for Ocean Fund to obtain gambling  
licenses in Nevada, New Jersey, Mississippi and Indiana because of 
the nature of its Internet business. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Neilander, a member of the Nevada Gaming Control Board,  
said the agency is unfamiliar with Ocean Fund and has had no 
contact with the company. He said Nevada gambling laws include a 
morals clause and that issue ``would be a tough one to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith said Ocean Fund's offer sought Caesars Palace, Las  
Vegas; Caesars, Atlantic City, N.J.; and Caesars Tahoe, Stateline, 
Nev. It also sought to buy a Caesars property in Robinsonville, 
Miss.; Caesars Pocono Resorts in Pennsylvania; the ``Glory of 
Rome'' riverboat in Indiana; Caesars Manila in the Philippines; and 
Caesars Johannesburg in South Africa, which is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caesars properties in Pennsylvania include four resorts and  
do not have gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Place offer included only the gambling properties.  
</P>
<P>
	Starwood has been shopping the Caesars properties for more than  
a year, wanting to get out of the gambling business. Gallagher said 
the company was flooded with offers, some serious, during that time 
but he was perplexed by the Ocean Fund proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at Ocean Fund by the AP were not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Chris Wloszczyna, a spokesman for the Investment Company  
Institute, said Ocean Fund was not one of ICI's 7,500 members and 
he had no records on them. ICI is a trade association of U.S. 
mutual funds. Dow Jones Newswires reported Ocean Fund is not 
registered as a mutual fund in the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	A news release from Ocean Fund said Sex .com boasts over 9  
million members who pay $24.95 per month for access to its Internet 
site, which receives more than 146 million unique ``hits'' daily. 
Advertisers on the 1,000-page-deep porn site pay up to $1.5 million 
monthly to display their banners, the company claimed.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Hope To Reel In Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While Phil Jackson is in Los Angeles stumping  
for a presidential candidate this week, he might also use the trip 
to take a job as Los Angeles Lakers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, reportedly offering him a four-year, $24 million  
contract, have made their pitch and await his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers executives Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak spoke Monday with  
Jackson, who had been on a fishing trip to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our first actual contact with him,'' team spokesman  
John Black said. ``The conversation went very well. There is no 
deal done, but we're hopeful that we can get something done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said that Lakers owner Jerry Buss, West and Kupchak ``like  
him very much and we hope to come to an agreement with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement is expected this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson already was scheduled to be in Los Angeles on Wednesday  
and Thursday to campaign for Bill Bradley, a former NBA star. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to pursue Jackson came after the Lakers indicated  
recently that Kurt Rambis, hired on an interim basis when Del 
Harris was fired 12 games into the season, would return as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	But Buss apparently decided to open his checkbook and go after  
the high-profile Jackson. The Lakers contacted his agent, Todd 
Musburger, last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis, an assistant before replacing Harris, is expected to  
remain with the team as an assistant or in some other capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers haven't won a championship since 1988 and haven't  
made the finals since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	They were swept out of the playoffs the past two years, this  
season by San Antonio in the second round after losing to Utah in 
the Western Conference finals in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who won six NBA titles at Chicago with Michael Jordan,  
would be faced with the challenge of helping Shaquille O'Neal win 
his first championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson took last season off, but it was widely believed he  
wanted to eventually return to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, asked recently if he thought Jackson would coach again,  
said, ``I'm pretty sure he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts spoke with  
Jackson about the New York Knicks' coaching job in April, but 
current coach Jeff Van Gundy may have secured his job by guiding 
the Knicks into the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Nets also were believed to be interested in  
Jackson at one time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson will try to blend O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, two of the  
NBA's marquee players, and their teammates into a championship 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	At Chicago, he was successful in dealing with the very distinct  
personalities of Jordan, Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen, and the 
Bulls became one of the best teams in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	Although O'Neal has three years remaining on his contract, there  
is a clause that would allow him to become a free agent this year. 
But Jackson's hiring probably would influence O'Neal to stay, and 
Fox Sports News reported that the center's agent, Leonard Armato, 
met Monday with West to discuss a contract extension.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Schools Teach Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Add another ``R'' to the reading,  
'ritin' and 'rithmetic being taught in Louisiana classrooms: 
Respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are on the verge of passing Gov. Mike Foster's bill  
requiring students to address teachers and other school employees 
as ``ma'am'' or ``sir'' or use the appropriate title of Mr., Miss, 
Ms. or Mrs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed by the Senate last month and the House this  
week, awaits only a final Senate vote on House amendments before 
the Legislature adjourns Monday night. It may be a national first. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring respect is one way to add discipline, the Republican  
governor insists: ``It'll make a difference. It becomes habitual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says who?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not anything they can legislate,'' said Mark Teal, who  
has taught for 14 years in the town of Sulphur. ``They'd have to 
pass laws on the parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asia Ayman, an eighth-grader in New Orleans, said: ``Kids don't  
respect their parents at home. What makes them think they're going 
to go to school and respect their teachers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But retired teacher Jean Kennedy of New Orleans said she likes  
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good idea to try whatever method there might be  
to raise the consciousness of students and parents, and this may be 
a way of doing that,'' she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be the first such law in the nation. Jeanne Allen,  
president of the Center for Education Reform in Washington, said 
she knows of no other such attempt to require respectful 
conversation through state law. 
</P>
<P>
	Some school systems require parents or students to sign codes of  
discipline, and some states, including Arkansas and Georgia, 
require ``character education,'' teaching honesty, fairness and 
respect for others. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would apply to kindergarten through fifth grade in the  
school year that starts this fall. Higher grades would be added one 
year at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure doesn't outline enforcement. It leaves punishment up  
to school boards, though the House eliminated expulsion or 
suspension as options. That leaves even some supporters in a 
quandary. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this passes and becomes law, how will it be enforced?'' Ms.  
Kennedy said. ``There are so many laws on the books now that 
students do not follow and sometimes, teachers cannot enforce 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Conn. Eyes Indian Tribe Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A wealthy Indian tribe is using its status as a sovereign nation  
to compete with health maintenance organizations and pharmacy 
chains in the prescription drug business. And the state of 
Connecticut is considering becoming the tribe's biggest client. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mashantucket Pequots, who made a fortune in casino gambling,  
have a side business called the Pequot Pharmacy Network, which has 
provided many Connecticut employers and group insurers with 
prescription drugs since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	As a federally recognized tribe, the Pequots have access to a  
federal pricing schedule for pharmaceuticals that is lower than 
that offered to health maintenance organizations and local and 
chain drug stores. The change would affect about 85,000 elderly and 
disabled Medicaid patients in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we met with the Pequots, they described their purchasing  
power and ... their ability to attain the lowest possible price,'' 
said Michael Starkowski, deputy commissioner of the state 
Department of Social Services. ``They described to us a pricing 
schedule that would be 40 to 50 percent less than what we would be 
paying otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature last week mandated that the department  
reduce its pharmaceutical expenditures by $21 million. Department 
officials anticipate a total cost of $226 million this year. 
Negotiations between the state and the Pequots could begin in the 
next few weeks, Starkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Grayson, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and  
Manufacturers of America, an industry group in Washington, D.C., 
said the state should not have to circumvent manufacturers, 
pharmacies and HMOs in order to save money and that the deal would 
give consumers fewer options. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state is trying to find some easy out,'' Grayson said.  
``It seems to us that it would be better for the state, rather than 
to try to find a loophole in the law, to work within the existing 
statutes. ... We don't believe this is the way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pequot Pharmaceutical Network currently dispenses about  
1,700 prescriptions per day with the assistance of a robot that 
handles about 225 of the most commonly prescribed drugs. The 
network ships out by mail-order about 1,500 prescriptions per day, 
while about 225 are picked up by tribal members or tribal employees 
at a pharmacy on the tribe's reservation in Ledyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal with the state, Medicaid patients would still  
go to a local pharmacy to pick up their prescriptions, but the 
pharmacists would only get a handling fee because the medicine is 
actually just shipped to the store from the Pequot Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said  
Tuesday that he is reviewing whether the agreement would be legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a slew of legal questions that have to be  
answered,'' Blumenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	What concerns him most is the idea that the tribe's sovereignty  
could allow the tribe to claim immunity for mistakes or other 
issues of liability in the sale of the pharmaceuticals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Starkowski said the tribe already has liability  
insurance and the Department of Social Services would purchase 
liability insurance separately to answer deal with any claims.

<HEADLINE> FCC Fights Internet Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I've been doing a lot of shopping online lately. How can I  
protect myself from fraud on the Internet? 

</P>
<P>
	A: An increasing number of people are shopping on the Internet  
instead of running to the mall or flipping through a mail-order 
catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, federal regulators say they've seen a dramatic rise  
in the number of hucksters and downright criminals flocking there 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission has gone after dozens of companies  
for Internet fraud over the past five years. The agency has seen a 
rise in complaints about prescription drug scams, and last year 
shut down a company for advertising computers over the Net but 
never delivering the goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, shopping on the Net can be as safe as shopping in a  
store or by mail, but certain precautions have to be taken. The FTC 
publishes a brochure of tips for e-shopping. It's also available on 
its Web site (http://www.ftc.gov). 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the FTC's recommendations:  
</P>
<P>
	--Use a secure browser.  
</P>
<P>
	This is the software used to navigate the Internet. A browser  
should comply with industry security standards, such as Secure 
Sockets Layer (SSL) or Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). These 
standards encrypt or scramble the purchase information sent over 
the Net and protect each transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	--Shop with known companies.  
</P>
<P>
	Anyone can set up shop online under almost any name. If you're  
not familiar with a merchant, ask for a paper catalog or brochure 
to get a better idea of the merchandise and services. Also, 
determine the company's refund and return policies before placing 
an order. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pay by credit or charge card.  
</P>
<P>
	If you pay by credit or charge card online, the transaction will  
be protected by the Fair Credit Billing Act. Under this law, 
consumers have the right to dispute charges under certain 
circumstances and temporarily withhold payment while the creditor 
investigates them. Consumers are only liable for the first $50 in 
unauthorized charges. 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep a record.  
</P>
<P>
	Print a copy of the purchase order and confirmation number for  
your records. Orders made via the Internet also are covered by the 
federal Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule. This means that 
unless stated otherwise, merchandise must be delivered within 30 
days, or the company must notify you. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pay bills online.  
</P>
<P>
	Some companies let you pay bills and check your account status  
online. Before signing up for any service, though, evaluate how the 
company is securing your financial and personal information. Many 
companies explain security procedures on their Web site. If you 
don't see a security description, call or e-mail the company. 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep passwords private.  
</P>
<P>
	Be creative when establishing a password, and never give it out.  
Avoid using a telephone number, birth date, or a portion of a 
Social Security number.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $76M for Birth Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A jury has ordered the city's hospital agency to  
pay $76 million to a child who suffered severe brain injuries at 
birth when she was apparently choked by her umbilical cord. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came Friday in a case brought on behalf of  
12-year-old Gaelle Prindilus, who has cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl requires 24-hour care, needs a wheelchair and is unable  
to read or write because of her botched delivery by unsupervised, 
overworked and inexperienced residents at Harlem Hospital, said her 
lawyer, Thomas Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father works two jobs to pay for her care.  
</P>
<P>
	Gaelle was born in 1987. During delivery, Moore said, the  
umbilical cord was wrapped tightly around her neck, decreasing her 
oxygen intake. 
</P>
<P>
	When the girl's mother, a Haitian immigrant with limited  
English, arrived at the hospital, a resident failed to do a 
sonogram that would have shown the cord around the baby's neck, 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman delivered the baby alone in her room, ``no doctor, no  
nurse, no one,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Luke Pittoni, a lawyer for the agency that oversees city  
hospitals, said it will appeal. Gaelle's condition existed in the 
womb and showed up in a CAT scan before delivery, Pittoni said.

<HEADLINE> Storm Watch in Effect for Bermuda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Bermuda was under a tropical storm watch Tuesday as  
forecasters waited to see whether Tropical Storm Arlene, drifting 
in the north Atlantic, would move toward the island or curve away 
into open sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene, the first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, had  
sustained winds of 60 mph, up from 50 mph earlier in the day, and 
little change in strength was expected through Wednesday night, the 
National Hurricane Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the storm remained a threat for Bermuda but was  
expected to turn into the open ocean before reaching the U.S. 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Arlene's center was about 225 miles southeast of  
Bermuda. Storm-force winds extended up to 145 miles from the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene, stationary in the morning before it drifted erratically  
for several hours, began moving to the northwest about 3 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms in this part of the Atlantic often turn out to the open  
sea and die as they enter cooler waters, which discourage 
development.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Leaves Game With Calf Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn's quest for 3,000 career hits was  
again slowed Tuesday night when he was lifted for a pinch hitter 
because of a re-aggravated calf injury in the second inning of the 
San Diego Padres' game against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who was making his third start since missing 19 games  
because of a strained left calf, was removed due to tightness in 
the same calf. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his return, Gwynn went 2-for-8 to move within 23 hits of  
becoming the 22nd player to reach the 3,000 mark. He popped up in 
the first off Philadelphia's Chad Ogea. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was placed on the disabled list on May 22. The Padres were  
7-12 in his absence.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Fryman May Go on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Travis Fryman's bad back has the Cleveland  
Indians' third baseman on the brink of a career first -- a trip to 
the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman missed his eighth straight game Tuesday night because of  
back spasms, and Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said Fryman may be 
placed on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Travis is better, but he's still not quite ready,'' Hargrove  
said Tuesday before the Indians opened a three-game series against 
the Oakland Athletics. ``We'll look at him again tomorrow, but 
we're probably closer to putting him on the DL than we have been. 
We'll see, but it wouldn't surprise me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Fryman received a cortisone injection in his lower  
back. He got one last September after back spasms forced him to 
miss five of the season's last six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, it took about 36 hours after the injection for it  
to take effect,'' Fryman said. ``So we'll see. I'm trying to get to 
a point where I can be active again without risking the possibility 
of worsening it. It's not an easy balance and there's no clear-cut 
answer as to whether or not it's going to be helpful. We just have 
to wait it out and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman is hitting .261 with eight homers and 37 RBIs. He hasn't  
played since June 5, and if the Indians decide to place him on the 
DL retroactively to that date, he may miss just five more days. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, 30, has never had to go on the DL in his professional  
career, a span of 1,687 games. He played in 146 games in 1998, his 
lowest total of any full season in the majors since the 
strike-shortened 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been fortunate in my career not to have any injuries that  
forced me to miss any extended period of time,'' he said. ``I'm 
disappointed this has happened. But there's not much else I can do 
about it. One thing I do is everything I can to avoid injury. But 
at some point, things can happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Manto, recalled last week from Triple-A Buffalo, started  
his sixth game at third on Tuesday. The Indians also have used 
utility infielder Enrique Wilson at third. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Indians place Fryman on the DL, they could recall hitting  
prospect Russell Branyan from Buffalo. Branyan is hitting .236 with 
20 homers and 44 RBIs, but has struck out 108 times in 60 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever we would call up it would be temporary,'' Hargrove  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman said he talked briefly with Hargrove about the club's  
options if his back didn't improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're discussing the best way to approach it,'' he said. ``I  
don't know what they're feeling is. I'll just go by what they tell 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Indians catcher Sandy Alomar, sidelined since  
undergoing surgery on his left knee last month, began jogging for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm ahead of schedule,'' said Alomar, projected to  
return around the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar said he has been encouraged by his recovery time from the  
surgery, the seventh procedure on his left knee. He said if all 
goes well he could begin squatting next week.

<HEADLINE> Michael Irvin Meets With Jerry Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Michael Irvin, whose role in the Dallas  
Cowboys' offense and the team's future appear to be diminishing, 
missed a mini-camp practice Tuesday morning while meeting with 
owner Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, who has skipped twice-weekly voluntary workouts since  
May, returned for an afternoon session and appeared to be his usual 
jovial self, throwing around smaller defenders and loudly berating 
players he beat. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Irvin walked to the locker room without  
stopping to talk to reporters, saying only, ``Not today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former All-Pro receiver is at odds with management because  
it hasn't offered to extend his contract beyond this season. There 
also has been talk of the Cowboys trying to trade Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin has a base salary of $2.99 million and a salary-cap charge  
of $3.613 million. An extension, which has been common for the 
headliners on Dallas' Super Bowl teams of the early 1990s, would 
reduce that figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Emmitt Smith said Irvin deserves to know where he  
stands with his bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's necessarily a matter of pride,'' Smith  
said. ``I think it's a matter of fairness and respect for who you 
are and for what you've done for this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Cowboys could use some salary-cap relief, they're  
hesitant to make a longer commitment to a 33-year-old player who 
caught just one touchdown pass last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem Irvin faces is that he's no longer the team's  
go-to guy. Actually, there isn't one under the system installed 
last year by coach Chan Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Irvin led the team with 74 catches last year, it was  
his fewest for a full season. He also was upset when his streak of 
117 games with a reception ended in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey, however, said he spoke with Irvin and believes the  
receiver understands his spot in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all those roles and all those situations are  
understood,'' Gailey said. ``So, evidently, it's in the contractual 
area more than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Irvin was the first player at team headquarters  
Tuesday morning. They expected their meeting to wrap up in time for 
the first workout, but the two well-practiced talkers kept yapping 
until the team was already going through drills, so they agreed 
Irvin would wait until the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, it takes me a little while to communicate and  
Michael likes a lot of time to communicate,'' Jones said, smiling. 
``So we can get into some lengthy meetings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones refused to give any specifics of their discussion, or of  
Irvin's future with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, it's very possible that things will work out so  
that we get all of the very best of Michael on our team this 
year,'' he said. ``If it weren't possible, we wouldn't be wasting 
time here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones mentioned Irvin's contributions to the teams past success  
several times, and said he'd like the receiver to remain a Cowboy 
his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the right set of circumstances, that'd be great for both  
Michael and the Cowboys,'' Jones said. ``In a manner of speaking, 
that's the way it should be, and he's capable of really helping us 
for the rest of his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Daryl Johnston said the Cowboys need Irvin.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we can be as good with Michael out of the lineup  
as we are with him in it,'' Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Tuesday no-show whose absence wasn't excused was linebacker  
Randall Godfrey. Godfrey has been offered a one-year, $429,000 
contract, but he hasn't signed it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate him being a part of the team this year,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Cowboys released running back Nicky Sualua for what  
Jones insisted were football reasons. Sualua was with former Dallas 
offensive lineman Mark Tuinei the night he died after taking 
ecstasy and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about football,'' Jones said. ``There's not anything to  
do with anything else.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Station Owners Sue Oil Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Independent gasoline station owners on  
Tuesday filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Texaco Inc., Shell Oil 
Co. and a Saudi oil company of conspiring to fix gasoline prices 
and force them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent owners contend Shell, Texaco and Saudi Refining  
Inc. have tried to use joint marketing agreements to fix prices 
while raising rents and the wholesale price dealers must pay for 
gasoline. The goal, the owners contend, is to replace small 
independents with bigger company-owned operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Company representatives said the allegations were false.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court lawsuit claims prices have been fixed  
since 1996 through joint refining and marketing ventures 
established by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past 18 months, the prices dealers have paid for gas  
have risen between 25 cents and 55 cents per gallon, said Tom 
Bleau, co-counsel for the 39 dealers named as plaintiffs in the 
suit. Over the same period, the price in the gasoline futures 
market has declined by more than 4 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rent increases have ranged from 30 percent to 100 percent, Bleau  
said. An independent dealer rents a gas station location from an 
oil company, but owns the business itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a straight, old-fashioned price-fixing agreement,'' said  
Joseph Alioto, another attorney for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies refine and market gasoline in the eastern  
United States through Houston-based Motiva Enterprises LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco and Shell refine and market in the West and Midwest  
through a separate firm, Equilon Enterprises LLC, also based in 
Houston. Saudi Refining is not part of Motiva. 
</P>
<P>
	A third company, Equiva Services, provides various services to  
Motiva and Equilon. The three ventures also were named in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of Equilon, Motiva and Equiva was done for  
legitimate business reasons,'' said Andy Norman, a spokesman for 
Texaco. ``It was totally proper and the formation of those 
companies has led to a number of efficiencies in our ... 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of the ventures was the subject of an investigation by  
the Federal Trade Commission and attorney generals in several 
states where the companies operate. No wrongdoing was found, Norman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Equilon issued a statement calling the allegations preposterous.  
Calls to the other defendants were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, dealers contend their rents and prices were raised  
soon after the joint ventures began. As a result, they have had to 
sell gasoline at uncompetitive prices, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Small stations, whether independent or company owned, have  
struggled to sell enough gasoline to stay open, but ``these are 
market forces. They're not collusion,'' said Bill Berman, publisher 
of The Pump Price Report, a weekly survey of gasoline prices and 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not intentional efforts by the refiners or  
wholesalers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several independents spoke in support of the suit at a news  
conference Tuesday. Joseph Alio, who runs a Shell station in East 
Los Angeles, said his sales volume has dropped by about 25 percent 
over the past three years. He not only lost direct revenue from 
sales, but rebates given as a reward for achieving high sales 
volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Alio's gasoline on Tuesday was priced at $1.35 a gallon, leaving  
him a profit of 8 cents on each gallon sold. The profit margin 
would be adequate if he could regain his old sales volume. He 
can't, he said, because two nearby Arco stations sell for $1.19 a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Another owner, Leopoldo Ramirez said he closed his West Covina,  
Calif., station last year after sales fell from about 100,000 
gallons per month to 35,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas station business has grown increasingly difficult in  
recent years. The number of service stations in the United States 
has dropped sharply during the past five years, from 202,800 to 
177,800, according to a survey by National Petroleum News, a trade 
magazine. The survey did not include separate numbers for 
independent dealers.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Y2K Bill To Hit $8 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government raised to at least  
$8.06 billion its estimate today of how much it expects to spend 
fixing the Year 2000 computer problem, $1.3 billion more than it 
predicted just three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House Office of Management Budget, in a report  
released Tuesday night, said the increase was due mostly to the 
Defense Department's use of $1.05 billion in emergency funds set 
aside by Congress to fix the most important computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost estimate includes money spent on the problem by federal  
agencies since fiscal 1996, when some of the earliest repair work 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB's latest quarterly report on the Y2K problem said 93  
percent of the government's 6,190 most important computers have 
been repaired, replaced or never were vulnerable, up from 79 
percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 410 computer systems government-wide that aren't ready,  
most are being repaired, it said. Thirty-five computer systems are 
being replaced and 24 are being scrapped, it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen federal agencies said all of their most important  
computers were prepared. Ten other agencies -- including the 
departments of agriculture, commerce, energy and justice -- still 
have unfinished work. Among the systems still not ready is part of 
the FBI's automated fingerprint system, the report said, but the 
Justice Department said it should be fixed by next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had earlier set a March 31 deadline for all  
agencies to have their most important systems repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB also said the Clinton administration's top Y2K experts  
rejected a proposal to move the federal holiday from Dec. 31 to 
Jan. 3 to give companies and agencies another day to resolve any 
problems before workers return during the first work week of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moving the holiday would be unwise, since it would require  
extensive reprogramming of systems to account for the change that 
would only add to the burden of Year 2000 work,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when those machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Most computers can be reprogrammed, but many devices have  
embedded microchips that must be physically replaced. 
</P>

	The latest report said agencies are making ``good progress'' on  
replacing the affected embedded chips and predicted that part of 
the Y2K problem, at least, ``will not have a significant effect on 
the delivery of their programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those few agencies (such as the Defense Department and NASA)  
that use specialized, mission-critical equipment that relies on 
embedded chips are working hard to find and fix any problems,'' the

<HEADLINE> Book: Clinton Excuses Irked Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prosecutor Kenneth Starr turned aside repeated  
efforts by some members of his staff to omit graphic sexual detail 
from the impeachment referral to Congress on President Clinton, a 
new book says. 
</P>
<P>
	The lurid descriptions of Clinton's encounters with Monica  
Lewinsky prompted strong criticism of Starr for including the 
material inasmuch as the president admitted an inappropriate 
intimate relationship with the former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors Brett Kavanaugh and Notre Dame professor William  
Kelley urged their boss to scale back the impeachment referral to a 
section of charges detailing the evidence of obstruction of justice 
and presidential perjury, says the book by Washington Post reporter 
Bob Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, we need to have an encyclopedia,'' Starr is quoted as  
saying in the book. ``It will show all the information. It will 
show how much work we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report's lengthy narrative ``shows how pathetic Clinton is,  
that he needs therapy, not removal,'' the book quotes Kavanaugh as 
saying. ``Our job is not to get Clinton out (of office). It's just 
to give information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another section of the book, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the  
Legacy of Watergate,'' says Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett hit the 
roof when he heard the president might argue that he was truthful 
when he denied having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky 
because oral sex did not fit the definition. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't do this,'' the book quotes Bennett as telling  
Clinton adviser Mickey Kantor. ``It's insanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton made that argument anyway, in testimony to Starr's  
grand jury. And Clinton's assertion that what he did with Ms. 
Lewinsky did not constitute a sexual act helped him escape removal 
from office in the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett himself had laid the groundwork for parsing the legal  
meaning of sex when, in representing Clinton in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case, he had objected to a broad definition of 
sexual relations. The judge drew a more limited definition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bennett told Kantor he had just been throwing the usual  
legal hurdles into a case on behalf of a client and did not think 
any strategy making a distinction between types of sexual acts 
would work. 
</P>
<P>
	``These distinctions are absurd,'' he is quoted as saying.  
``This crap won't fly with anyone. ... It's awful, awful advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton went on to testify to the Starr grand jury that he had  
an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, but said, ``I did 
not have sexual relations, as I understood this term to be 
defined,'' with her. 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed, he said he did not consider the type of relations  
the two had to fall within the definition drawn in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book's acknowledgments, Woodward thanks his agent, Robert  
B. Barnett, the law partner of David Kendall, Clinton's main lawyer 
through the 5 1/2 years the president has been under criminal 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Gore Returns to Hometown To Declare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Plugging Carthage's favorite son,  
Markham's Department Store is stocking $12 blue-and-gold mugs that 
say, ``Al Gore, 43rd President of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what if he loses?  
</P>
<P>
	A hand-printed sign warns there will be no refunds.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore returns to his hometown Wednesday to officially announce  
that he is a candidate for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Democratic front-runner spent much of his childhood  
in Washington, he returned to the family farm outside of Carthage 
most summers and vacations. Many residents say they consider him 
one of their own, and have overwhelmingly backed President Clinton 
and Gore in the last two presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be from somewhere and he's never claimed to be  
from anywhere else,'' Mayor David Bowman said. ``Carthage is the 
only place he's ever called home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But one of the town's leading Republicans begs to differ.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a Washington product. He lived there and went to private  
schools there. He only comes back here when he wants something,'' 
said Albert McCall, co-owner of D.T. McCall's Furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Republican National Committee chairman Jim  
Nicholson plans a tour Wednesday of the hotel suites that served as 
the Gore family home while Albert Gore Sr. was serving as a 
congressman and senator from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	He will arrive by mule-driven cart -- a response to comments made  
last month by the vice president about plowing fields on the family 
farm behind a team of mules. 
</P>
<P>
	Carthage has generally voted Democratic.  
</P>
<P>
	Residents know Gore as a warm, caring neighbor; a local boy who  
spent summers working on his family's farm and never forgot his 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in college. You wouldn't think with all that money he'd  
have helped,'' said Tommy Gooch, an auto mechanic who did yard work 
on the Gore farm as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd always ask how my family was and I bet if I saw him now  
he'd call my name,'' said Gooch, who was mending a pair of pants as 
he sat on the front porch of his sister's trim white house on the 
hilly streets just off the downtown square. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith County Sheriff Johnny Bane recalls the vice president's  
telephone call to him two weeks ago when Bane's father died. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad was just a sharecropper, but the vice president called  
because we were neighbors,'' said Bane, whose office walls are 
adorned with photos of himself and other deputies with Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	At Markham's Department Store, there is a ``Clinton-Gore Store''  
section that includes campaign buttons, memorabilia and Gore 2000 
T-shirts and caps. Owner Bill Markham, a Gore supporter, said he 
plans to devote half his store to Gore if he wins.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Slip Ahead of Economy Reports / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slipped in cautious trading Tuesday,  
as traders refrained from buying bonds ahead of a string of closely 
watched economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/16  
point, or $1.86 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 6.11 percent from 6.09 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose in early trading, but drifted lower as a  
cautious atmosphere took over in advance of the government's 
releases on May consumer prices, housing construction and regional 
economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were expected to sift through the reports for  
indications of whether the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates 
to try to check nascent inflationary pressures. An increase in 
prevailing rates would hurt the value of already-sold Treasury 
securities, which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged and intermediate maturities were down 1/32 point to 
3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.72 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.60 percent from levels at 
Monday's auction. Six-month yields were 5.06 percent, as the 
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.86 percent from levels at 
auction. One-year yields were 5.07 percent as the discount fell by 
0.02 percentage point to 4.82 percent from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.69 percent from 4.75 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 3/32 point to 119 5/32 from late 
Monday. The average yield to maturity fell to 5.53 percent from 
5.54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Joe McIlvaine Suffers Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A front office official for the Minnesota Twins,  
Joe McIlvaine, is hospitalized after a seizure similar to the one 
that felled Houston manager Larry Dierker. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine was stricken Sunday, about the same time Dierker had a  
seizure in the eighth inning of the Astros' game with the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine, a special assistant to Twins general manager Terry  
Ryan, was in New Orleans to scout the Class AAA Salt Lake Buzz when 
he had a seizure while walking in a mall with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said Monday that McIlvaine was having tests to determine  
the cause of the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same thing Dierker had, but I'm not sure how  
serious his was compared to Dierker's,'' Ryan said. ``But they had 
to strap him down and take him away in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was with his wife, and he said he felt a little woozy and  
sat down. Next thing he knew, he woke up in the hospital,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine, the former general manager of the Padres and New York  
Mets, was hired as Ryan's special assistant in 1998 and has scouted 
Latin America, the major leagues and the minor leagues for the 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Ryan, McIlvaine has no history of seizures.

<HEADLINE> Diability Work Bill Likely To Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People with disabilities could go to work  
without fear of losing their health insurance under legislation the 
Senate is set to move tomorrow, although senators dodged a dispute 
over how to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Fear of losing Medicare and Medicaid is the No. 1 reason that  
less than one-half of 1 percent of Americans receiving disability 
benefits ever return to work, advocates say. People with 
disabilities usually have serious medical problems and often have 
trouble getting private health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a crazy system we have allowed to develop,'' said  
President Clinton, who was on Capitol Hill to help give Rosa Parks 
the Congressional Gold Medal and joined senators in praising the 
disability legislation as nothing less than life-changing for 
millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., called it a ``landmark'' that  
would finish the work of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which 
banned discrimination based on disability and broke down barriers 
to public accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't really get the job done,'' Kennedy said. ``But we  
believe that this is the landmark legislation that is going to open 
the American dream of full participation in the hopes and dreams of 
our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation has 77 co-sponsors in the Senate but was snagged  
last month on Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm's objections to the 
obscure corporate tax change used to pay for the bill, which will 
cost $800 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers agreed to drop the tax change. The legislation now  
directs that its cost be paid with unspecified spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, similar legislation has cleared the Commerce  
Committee but must move through the Ways and Means Committee. It 
has considerable support in the House, but there is no agreement 
about how to pay for it and no vote has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would affect about 9 million adults who collect  
federal disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who use the Social Security Disability Insurance program  
could keep their Medicare benefits after returning to work. States 
would get the option to extend Medicaid to those in the 
Supplemental Security Income program for low-income people, 
allowing them to buy into the program and pay premiums that would 
rise as their income grows. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also inject competition among those who  
train the disabled to work. The disabled could choose to continue 
getting services from government rehabilitation programs, or they 
could go to privately run programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the bill would give the trainers an extra  
incentive to get people to work -- the trainers would get some of 
the money saved because of decreased government disability 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation was headed to the Senate floor until Gramm  
objected to the way the bill was funded. It would have increased 
tax revenues by changing the rules for U.S. companies operating 
abroad. Specifically, it would have made it more difficult for 
those companies to claim a tax credit on taxes they pay to other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the bill directs an eventual House-Senate conference  
committee to find spending cuts to pay for it.

<HEADLINE> Australia Names Davis Cup Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter will  
lead the Australian Davis Cup team when it plays the United States 
in the centennial celebration of the team tennis competition next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named to the squad Tuesday were Mark Philippoussis, Mark  
Woodforde, Todd Woodbridge, Lleyton Hewitt, Andrew Ilie and Sandon 
Stolle. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain John Newcombe, in naming the team during a telephone  
news conference, said the squad must be cut to five players 10 days 
before the July 16-18 competition, then will be narrowed to just 
four prior to the draw, which will be held July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the centennial celebration, the best-of-5 match  
competition is being held at the Longwood Cricket Club, where the 
first Davis Cup was played in 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States team will consist of Jim Courier, Todd Martin  
and Pete Sampras, with a fourth player expected to be named before 
a July 6 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	That person will be ``a very good doubles player'' like Alex  
O'Brien, Justin Gimelstob or Richey Reneberg, said U.S. captain Tom 
Gullikson.

<HEADLINE> MailStation Focuses on E-Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The newest high tech gadget launching  
this summer doesn't surf the Information Superhighway, blink bright 
lights or even play music. No bells. No whistles. Just e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail in. E-mail out. That's it.  
</P>
<P>
	Designed for technophobes, the $99 MailStation from Morgan  
Hill-based Cidco Inc., will be the first e-mail only product on the 
market when it reaches stores next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's neat and it works,'' said Gary Arlen, an analyst at Arlen  
Communications. ``The hard core Web Heads I hang out with were 
shocked that it didn't have any Internet access, but ... there's a 
niche of people who want real limited capabilities. This should 
fill that niche.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MailStation, which weighs about two pounds, looks like a  
cross between a small notebook computer and a handheld digital 
device. It has a keyboard and a small screen and plugs into a 
standard telephone jack. It takes just 30 seconds for a user to 
dial in and send and receive all their messages. Up to five 
different people can have e-mail addresses on one machine. 
</P>
<P>
	The MailStations come set up with e-mail addresses and local  
telephone numbers to connect. Users pay $9.95 a month for the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything about the devices, from the simple buttons to the  
standard telephone jack plugs, is designed to be easy to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``The computer has gotten overly sophisticated for newbies,''  
said David L'Heureux, director of product management at Cidco. 
``What they want is simplicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a possible oversimplification, MailStation doesn't open  
attachments -- the notes, photos and references that come tagged 
onto the bottom of some e-mail messages. Users who get a message 
with an attachment have to go to a regular personal computer to 
open them. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent industry studies show that 48 percent of American homes  
have personal computers. That penetration is expected to slow down, 
or even stop, at about 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the country, said L'Heureux, may not want computers.  
But they may still want e-mail, which has become the most common 
way for Americans to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts figures show that by 2001, 135 million people in the  
United States will be using e-mail, generating 7 trillion messages 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This brings everyone in. We're looking at the mature audience,  
seniors who aren't tech-savvy, and baby boomers who want to 
communicate with their parents,'' said Tim Dooley, executive vice 
president at Cidco. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Badding, an analyst at Carmel Group, said the MailStation  
is ``a clever product for the older generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some older people, they don't want all that techno-gadget  
stuff,'' he said. ``They want something simple that doesn't cost 
them an arm and a leg.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 50; Nasdaq Is Up 7 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened higher. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is up 50 points in today's early going. 
Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold an 8-5 lead over 
decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up seven points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is up three points. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't look for too much movement in the market today.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike yesterday, there's very little on the news front to move  
stock sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	And even though Internet stocks got hard hit yesterday, some  
analysts expect to see even more of a correction. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the bond market is continuing to strengthen.  
And that's giving a little upward momentum to blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, the government releases its May report on retail  
inflation tomorrow, and it's likely the markets will move 
cautiously ahead of the numbers.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 78.83 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today amid a mild recovery  
among Internet shares and a second day of lower bond yields. But 
investors remained hesitant ahead of Wednesday's consumer price 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 78.83 at 10,642.16, adding to a 72-point gain on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology-laden  
Nasdaq composite index rose 23.24 to 2,421.55 and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 was up 12.62 at 1,306.62. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the calm before the storm,'' said David Orr, chief  
economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. 
Traders were looking to the Wednesday's Consumer Price Index report 
and testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before 
Congress on Thursday for clues on the direction of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks moved higher in tandem with bonds, which rose for a  
second straight day largely on the strength of the dollar against 
the yen. The dollar's gains make U.S. investments such as Treasury 
bonds more attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for the government's benchmark 30-year bond rose, pushing  
the yield down to 6.07 percent today from 6.09 percent Monday and a 
19-month high of 6.16 percent Friday. Bond prices and yields move 
in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Internet stocks, some of which have seen their prices  
fall nearly in half since April, were recouping some of their 
losses today. America Online was up 5 3/8 to 95 7/8, Amazon.com rose 5 5/8 
to 97 5/8 and Yahoo! was up 8 5/32 to 127 13/32. But analysts said 
they expect the correction in Internet issues to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks are no longer riding high because there are so  
many more of them, Orr said. ``Supply is now equal to demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM led the Dow higher, rising 2 3/8 to 117 7/8, and J.P. Morgan was  
up 1 7/16 to 128. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola was off 1 5/16 to 63 1/2, after Belgian officials banned  
sales of the company's soft drinks amid reports of people becoming 
ill after drinking them. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 462.75 million 
shares, up from Monday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 5.34 at 624.94 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.01 at 764.70.

<HEADLINE> Coles Loses Any Hope of Sydney Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- If Phil Coles still hoped to have a  
hand in organizing the 2000 Games in Sydney, he learned otherwise 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after being forced to resign from the board of the Sydney  
organizing committee and being demoted in the International Olympic 
Committee, Coles was told there was no support role left for him in 
the games either. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had speculated he might be able to keep his seat on  
Sydney's sports commission, which coordinates the planning for the 
28 sports on the program for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Knight, president of the organizing committee  
(SOCOG), dismissed that notion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Coles has resigned from SOCOG,'' Knight said. ``I take  
that to mean he is off everything on SOCOG.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight later said he received a letter from the IOC confirming  
that Coles' resignation covered all aspects of the Sydney 
committee, including the sports commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said Coles would still enjoy all the courtesies extended  
to IOC members at the games, but ``he will certainly have nothing 
to do with the organizing of the Sydney Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight also indicated that Coles might not get his wish of  
running with the Olympic torch along Sydney's Bondi Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles became known in Australia as a surf life guard at Bondi.  
As a result of allegations against him in the recent Olympic 
scandals, he lost his job as head of the committee organizing the 
torch relay across Australia before the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said Coles, as a three-time Olympic kayaker, still was  
entitled to run a leg of the relay. But he added: ``Where he runs 
is another matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, meanwhile, canceled his trip to Seoul for the IOC general  
assembly. The meeting, opening Thursday, will include the selection 
of the host city for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC and Australian Olympic officials said Coles decided to stay  
in Sydney to avoid causing a distraction from the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was reprimanded by the IOC on Monday for ``serious  
negligence'' in writing notes about his colleagues, some not very 
flattering. He also was barred from serving on IOC commissions for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes written by Coles and his companion, Patricia  
Rosenbrock, were prepared for the Sydney bid committee. But they 
also wound up with officials involved with Salt Lake City's winning 
bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC ruled that Coles' involvement with the notes did not  
warrant expulsion, even though he previously had received a ``most 
severe'' warning in March for accepting lavish hospitality from 
Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC told Coles he had to resign from the Sydney committee,  
which Knight and other Australian officials had demanded for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish it hadn't taken so long,'' Knight said. ``I'm pleased  
we can now put this issue behind us. It's the last major problem we 
had to get over.''

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Internet Music Recorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Not long ago, digital copying of music from  
the Internet was the province of high-tech pirates, with followers 
in college dorm rooms around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Gradually, the established recording industry has come to terms  
with a practice it once denounced as a threat to the rights of 
artists and publishers. And now a federal appeals court has given 
the process a legal stamp of approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
said a 1992 federal music piracy law does not prohibit a palm-sized 
device that can download high-quality digital music files from the 
Internet and play them at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The court upheld a federal judge's refusal last fall to issue an  
injunction sought by the Recording Industry Association of America, 
representing five major record companies. After losing the earlier 
ruling, the industry has tried to come to terms with the new 
technology and develop a version of the device that would prevent 
illicit copying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We filed this lawsuit because unchecked piracy on the Internet  
threatens the development of a legitimate marketplace for on-line 
music, a marketplace that consumers want,'' the association said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, the shared interest in such a marketplace has  
overtaken the lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came as supporters of MP3 gathered in San Diego for  
a two-day summit focusing on the legal, technical and business 
issues influencing the movement toward Internet-based music 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	John Perry Barlow, a retired Wyoming cattle rancher and a former  
lyricist for the Grateful Dead, said the victory shows that ``music 
is the common property of humanity and it's a form of sacrilege to 
try and own it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barlow, the lead off speaker for the summit, is co-founder of  
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which promotes freedom of 
expression in the digital media. 
</P>
<P>
	Copyright law has value when it allows artists to have some  
control over their work, but the control should belong ``to those 
who create, not the bottling plants,'' Barlow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology industry analyst Mark Hardie, of Forrester Research  
in Cambridge, Mass., said one sign of the times was a recent 
decision by a handful of labels of major record companies to use 
MP3 files, the software that compresses and stores digital versions 
of CD recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year they stood together arm-in-arm on a stage in New  
York swearing MP3 was the devil incarnate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved the Rio portable MP3 player, made by Diamond  
Multimedia Systems of San Jose. The device, which sells for $119, 
plugs into a computer and rapidly downloads digital music files 
found on numerous MP3 Internet sites, producing near-CD-quality 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	With widely available free software, the files can be  
transferred from one computer to another. 
</P>
<P>
	The Recording Industry Association contended the Rio was made  
for the illegal pirating of copyright music and could drain away 
billions of dollars in royalties from artists and publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins of Los Angeles denied an  
injunction last fall that would have prohibited distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	In upholding her ruling, the appeals court said the Audio Home  
Recording Act of 1992 prohibits only devices that make copies from 
digital music recordings. The court said the Rio makes its copies 
from computer hard drives, not digital music recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The act seems to have been expressly designed to create this  
loophole,'' said the opinion by Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain. 
``...The Rio's operation is entirely consistent with the act's main 
purpose -- the facilitation of personal use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew P. Bridges, lawyer for San Jose-based Diamond Multimedia,  
said the ruling should end the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a statute that the recording industry has consistently  
misdescribed,'' he said. ``It does not say anything about what 
consumers can and cannot do except by making it clear that 
consumers have immunity for certain types of home taping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has agreed to install a security device in future  
versions of the Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	One response by the recording industry has been the Secure  
Digital Music Initiative, which seeks to create an encrypted 
version of MP3 that would be immune from illicit copying. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants hope to unveil a Walkman-like digital stereo  
alternative to the Rio by Christmas, followed by other types of 
players that could distinguish between approved and unapproved 
copies. Eventually, protections would be built into every CD.

<HEADLINE> Gore Makes Error in Speech on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore misspoke when he said  
18- to 20-year-olds can legally buy handguns from licensed gun 
dealers, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told more than 300 city leaders during an address Monday in  
New Orleans that while adults younger than 21 cannot legally buy 
alcohol, ``they can walk into any gun shop, pawn shop or gun show 
in America and buy a handgun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's office released a statement later in the  
day saying that wasn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
	While young adults may buy handguns at gun shows or from friends  
and unlicensed sellers, they may not legally purchase them from 
federally licensed gun shops and pawn stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact remains that under current law, 18-to 20-year-olds  
can legally purchase handguns in many places, and can legally 
possess handguns, regardless of where they obtained them,'' the 
statement added. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president spoke during the annual meeting of the U.S.  
Conference of Mayors. While pressing for tougher gun laws, he 
released a government study showing that people age 18 through 20 
commit 24 percent of all gun murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, prepared by the Treasury and Justice departments,  
said this was the case even though that group of youthful Americans 
made up only 4 percent of the population.

<HEADLINE> Japan, US Progress on Telecom Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP ) -- U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators made some  
progress today on expanding sales opportunities for American 
telecommunications companies but remain far apart on several 
issues, a U.S trade official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides agreed in talks that started Monday to meet again  
before the end of the month, probably in San Francisco, said the 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to say what action the United States might take if  
no agreement is reached by July 1. On that date the Japanese 
government plans to split its giant Nippon Telephone and Telegraph 
Co. into four successor companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. official said this will create ``tremendous  
uncertainties,'' particularly with regard to the procurement 
procedures of these companies in the $35 billion Japanese 
telecommunications market. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing a Japanese draft plan for procurement processes,  
she said, ``We believe it will be less open and competitive than 
under current arrangements'' because the government will abandon 
its monitoring role. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are left with the impression that NTT can be trusted to do  
the right thing and that's not acceptable to us,'' the official 
said. ``We're surprised it's acceptable to the government and 
people of Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the United States had received no assurances that the  
NTT successor companies will proceed in a transparent and 
nondiscriminatory manner and may favor longtime domestic suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The official says the United States wants both governments to  
remain involved in a monitoring process that began in 1980 and has 
been renewed roughly every three years.

<HEADLINE> Dierker Has Successful Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker is expected  
to make a full recovery following a 5 1/2-hour operation Tuesday that 
removed a life-threatening tangle of malformed blood vessels from 
his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, who collapsed Sunday when he had a seizure in Houston's  
dugout during a game in the Astrodome, will be hospitalized 5-10 
days and will need at least four weeks to recover from the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rob Parrish said he was confident the entire vessel mass,  
known as an arteriovenous malformation, was removed from an area 
where a blood clot hemorrhaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having an AVM that ruptures is certainly life-threatening,''  
Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the malformation as ``significant, 4-by-3  
centimeters ... bigger than a walnut, smaller than a melon -- maybe 
a lime, or a really big jalapeno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Later this week we'll do another angiogram to make absolutely  
certain we got all of it out,'' Parrish said. ``He's awake, alert 
and following commands and looks quite good right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem vessels were located just beneath the surface of the  
front part of Dierker's brain. Parrish said surgeons cut a 
``window'' in his skull to access the target area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took the blood clot out, sent the blood clot to pathology  
to make absolutely sure there was no tumor or anything -- and there 
was none,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons determined remaining vessels had an abnormal blood  
flow, found a second malformation in the area and removed that one 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we got it out, we sewed him up and put his bone flap  
back in the window we had made in his skull so he'll be 
hard-headed,'' Parrish said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Dierker asked him before the surgery: ``You mean no more  
head butts?'' And Parrish said he replied: ``Yes. No more head 
butts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the surgeon's making jokes, I guess the skipper is going to  
be OK,'' Jeff Bagwell said. ``Obviously, we're greatly relieved. 
The news has just been getting better every day. It's a breath of 
fresh air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Methodist Hospital officials said Dierker, known for his laid  
back attitude and affinity for Hawaiian shirts, was upbeat headed 
into surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker began convulsing uncontrollably during the eighth inning  
of a game against the San Diego Padres. He was treated by Astrodome 
paramedics until an ambulance took him to nearby Methodist 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish credited paramedics with keeping Dierker's air passages  
clear during the seizure so he could breathe properly. There should 
be no aftereffects, 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect him to be completely intact,'' Parrish said.  
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said once Dierker had been revived by the  
anesthesiologist, Parrish said his patient greeted him with a ``Hi 
Rob!'' and raised his hand in a high-five motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Dierker smiled at  
him through an oxygen mask and gave him a thumbs-up signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best we could have hoped for,'' Astros owner  
Drayton McLane said. ``We're very pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a visit by Craig Biggio and Bagwell on Monday, Dierker  
told them to go out and win three out of four games from the 
Atlanta Braves. Houston won the first one 10-4 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Interim manager Matt Galante directed the team seated next to  
Dierker's empty chair. The team hung Dierker's No. 49 jersey in the 
dugout above his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish said Dierker watched Monday night's game on television  
and expected the manager to watch Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker was the third member of the Astros' staff to become ill  
this season. First base coach Jose Cruz left the team May 10 
because of an irregular heartbeat, and hitting coach Tom McCraw 
left six days later for prostate cancer treatment. Cruz is expected 
back this week.

<HEADLINE> Miami Waits Another Day in Omaha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- It's bad enough the Miami Hurricanes have to  
wait an extra day to find out who they will play in their next 
College World Series game. 
</P>
<P>
	Not having ESPN2 in their hotel rooms makes it worse.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were coming out to scout this game,'' coach Jim Morris said  
Tuesday while he waited for a rain-delayed game between Rice and 
Alabama to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	It never did. The NCAA postponed the Rice-Alabama game to 2:30  
p.m. CDT on Wednesday, with the winner meeting the Hurricanes at 
2:30 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami had been expecting to play Wednesday night against the  
Rice-Alabama survivor and the Hurricanes instantly found themselves 
with even more time on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't know what they (players) are doing tonight,''  
Morris said. ``They probably don't want to sit in the rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said he still planned to start right-hander Darryl Roque  
(4-1, 4.21 ERA) when the Hurricanes play again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could give us an extra day that could be an advantage in  
needed rest,'' Morris said. ``But we're not looking for another 
day. We're ready to go out and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami second baseman Kris Clute said it doesn't matter who the  
Hurricanes play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to face whoever we face,'' he said. ``But we were  
going to watch some of the game, and our hotel doesn't have 
ESPN2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Hurricanes (48-13) already have beaten Rice  
(59-14) and Alabama (52-15) in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared,'' Clute said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said some players likely would watch the game in the hotel  
bar or brave the stands if the weather cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said the warm-weather Hurricanes had a miserable  
intrasquad scrimmage Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were freezing,'' he said. ``We didn't have a very good  
practice today because we were freezing to death. They were wearing 
gloves, everything.''

<HEADLINE> Reform of Forfeitures Gains Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government would be forced to meet a  
higher standard of proof in order to seize private property 
believed to be linked to a crime under a bill that cleared the 
House Judiciary Committee today. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the measure by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., also  
would make it easier for citizens to challenge such seizures, which 
reap millions of dollars a year for the government from cash and 
property used in criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee voted 27-3 to send the bill to the full House for  
a vote. Republican Reps. Ed Bryant of Tennessee and Asa Hutchinson 
of Arkansas -- both former U.S. attorneys -- and Rep. Anthony David 
Weiner, D-N.Y., voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has opposed similar measures in the past.  
Department officials did not return telephone calls for comment 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, the committee chairman, has sought reform of the civil  
asset forfeiture laws for years. He contends that while the 
statutes serve a meaningful purpose, they also are used to deprive 
innocent citizens of property without due process -- especially 
those who had no idea their assets were being used illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the government need to do to seize and confiscate your  
property is establish that probable cause existed to believe that 
the property was involved in some crime, ... that it facilitated a 
crime or represents its proceeds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say the laws are applied fairly in the  
majority of cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The main feature of the bill would shift the burden of proof  
away from the individual and require the government to prove -- by 
clear and convincing evidence -- that property seized had been used 
illegally. Individuals now have to prove their property wasn't 
linked to criminal activity in order to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges also would be allowed to release such property pending  
the outcome of the case if continued possession by the government 
would cause ``substantial hardship'' to the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said they supported Hyde's attempt to inject fairness  
into the process but objected, among other things, to raising the 
government's burden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson also criticized provisions for the appointment of  
counsel, the innocent owner's defense and the return of property in 
hardship cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department also has opposed these provisions.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's important reform that takes us in the right direction but  
that tilts too far against law enforcement in favor of, 
potentially, the drug dealer,'' Hutchinson said. ``The reform goes 
too far.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Exxon, Texaco, ENI Buy Brazil Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc. and  
Italy's ENI, spending a total of $90 million, on Tuesday bought 
offshore exploration rights for oilfields off Brazil's Atlantic 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first day of a two-day auction, the three oil companies  
won the rights to 5,483 square miles. In the process they broke an 
exploration monopoly held by Brazil's state-owned petroleum company 
Petrobras for more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	ENI's subsidiary Agip Oil do Brasil offered the equivalent of  
$75.3 million for rights to explore the Santos basin, just across 
from Santos, Latin America's largest port, in Sao Paulo state. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid was almost seven times the $11.2 million offered by  
British Exploration Brazil Ltda. and 60 times higher than a joint 
bid by Kerr McGee and Amerada Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's subsidiary Esso Brasileira de Petroleo Ltda., with a bid  
of $10.8 million, won exploration rights to Espirito Santo state 
coast, just north of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco paid $3.4 million for a tract of the Campos basin, 78  
miles off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Agip, in a bid with Petrobras and the Argentine company YPF,  
also won the first auction to explore an area in the Campos basin, 
so far Brazil's richest oil field. 
</P>
<P>
	David Zylbersztajn, general director of Brazil's National Oil  
Agency, said the entry of foreign oil companies would bring almost 
inconceivable wealth to Brazil, which along with other Latin 
American nations has struggled with a weak economy over the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Zylbersztajn estimated taxes and royalties just from areas now  
being developed would amount to $60 billion over the next 15 to 18 
years, and that 250,000 new jobs would be created. 
</P>
<P>
	The free-market reformers who took power in Brazil in 1995 ended  
the monopoly that year, but it took more than three years to 
determine which areas Petrobras would keep and which would be 
auctioned among domestic and foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Covering a territory bigger than the 48 continental United  
States, Brazil has 27 sedimentary basins where oil theoretically 
could exist. But since its creation in 1953, Petrobras worked only 
three of them intensively. Today it produces 1.1 million barrels 
per day -- about two-thirds of the oil Brazilians consume -- mostly 
from off-shore fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction attracted 37 companies to bid for 27 areas.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana GOP Chairman Fires Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- The chairman of the Louisiana Republican  
Party fired two top officials and changed the locks at 
headquarters, prompting a party executive committee tpnight to 
strip him of check writing powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode was the latest example of a years-long split between  
traditional GOP members and the more conservative Christian 
Coalition wing, which supports chairman Mike Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since there is little money in the bank account, the action  
against Francis may not mean much, acknowledged Dianne Christopher, 
vice chair of the party, who called the emergency meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, it's a no confidence vote, said Christopher and  
the other three members of the seven-member committee who showed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the meeting, Francis said any action means nothing. He  
contends that only he has the power to call the executive committee 
into session. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing is illegal,'' Francis said.  
</P>
<P>
	He did not return phone calls after the meeting ended.  
</P>
<P>
	Francis has irked party moderates by pushing for Louisiana's  
presidential caucus to be held even before Iowa's traditional 
first-in-the-nation caucus. His critics said that at a meeting 
Saturday, he improperly engineered approval of an early caucus 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Monday, he dismissed the state GOP's executive director,  
Becky Miller, and her deputy, Terry Benham. They had not taken 
public stands on the caucus issue, and the reason they were fired 
was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``He walked in, sat down, told us that our job at the party was  
done. We needed to clear our desk and move out,'' Benham said. 
``He's totally out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's meeting of the central committee had been called to  
decide how to run Louisiana's 2000 Republican presidential caucus. 
Francis had said it would be the nation's first even if it had to 
be held on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee voted Saturday to hold its caucus one week before  
Iowa's, even though national GOP rules say Iowa must be the first 
state to choose a nominee and delegates to the national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	At Saturday's meeting, critics said, Francis ignored a proposal  
to hold an Internet primary and refused twice to make sure enough 
members were present for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Louisiana held a caucus before Iowa, but most  
candidates shunned Louisiana because they worried about offending 
Iowa Republicans. Only about 20,000 out of nearly 500,000 
registered Republicans voted. Conservative Pat Buchanan finished 
first.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Won't Roll Over Fogler's Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Eddie Fogler's five-year contract won't be  
rolled over by the University of South Carolina, athletic director 
Mike McGee said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Fogler still has four years on his contract and will  
keep the same base salary of a little more than $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not the policy of the athletic director to roll over a  
contract after a losing season,'' South Carolina assistant athletic 
director Kerry Tharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks were a disappointing 8-21 overall last year and  
3-13 in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	That came just two years after Fogler and the Gamecocks were the  
toast of the town for winning the 1996-97 regular season SEC title. 
However, that season and the next, the Gamecocks suffered losses to 
obscure colleges in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogler has been at South Carolina six years. His record is 93-85  
overall and 46-50 in the SEC.

	NOT-SO-LOW-PRICED PCs: Prices for personal computers continue to  
drop, and some companies are advertising machines as low as $299. 
But FamilyPC magazine, which looked at some of the low-end 
computers, found they lack some basic features -- including a 
monitor, CD-ROM and floppy drives and speakers -- that users will 
want and need. Adding those pieces of hardware brings the cost of 
the PC up to over $500, the magazine reports. Moreover, the 
rock-bottom price may not include free technical support, which 
means every time buyers have to call the manufacturer for help, it 
will cost them even more. Some of the low-cost makers sell warranty 
packages that will include technical support; others may charge $20 
per phone call. A neophyte with a lot of questions could run up a 
big bill.

	WORKING VACATIONS: If you hate the idea of having to work while  
on vacation, at least you have lots of company in your misery. In a 
survey of 5,000 executives conducted by the search firm Management 
Recruiters International, 82 percent said they mix business with 
pleasure. Of those who work on vacation, 28 percent said they stay 
in touch with the office by phone, and 13 percent send work-related 
e-mail. Another 13 percent have cut their vacations short because 
of work. Allen Salikof, the president of Management Recruiters, 
attributes the high number of working vacationers in part to the 
tight job market -- companies are short of staffers and there isn't 
enough help to provide back-up for people taking time off. 

</P>
<P>
	BEING A POLITICAL ANIMAL ON THE JOB: Mention office politics,  
and many people will roll their eyes and think, ``Ugh.'' Get used 
to it, according to Michael Frisch, a consultant with the human 
resources firm Personnel Decisions International. ``Every office 
has office politics,'' Frisch says. ``It's a fact of life -- like 
the weather. And like the weather, it can be good or bad.'' He 
suggests that taking part in office politics is a good opportunity 
to share ideas with coworkers and bosses. And not taking part may 
make people think you don't have any opinions at all.

<HEADLINE> Phil Jackson To Coach Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Zen is about to meet Showtime.  
</P>
<P>
	Phil Jackson, who led the Chicago Bulls to six titles with an  
enlightened, offbeat approach to basketball, agreed in principle 
Tuesday to coach the Los Angeles Lakers next season, team spokesman 
John Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers reportedly offered Jackson a four-year, $24 million  
deal. Barring a last-minute snag in contract details, he is 
expected to be introduced at a press conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who would replace interim coach Kurt Rambis, was also  
sought by the New Jersey Nets and, to a lesser degree, the New York 
Knicks before they made their improbable run to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers fired Del Harris 12 games into last season and  
promoted Rambis from his job as an assistant. They were swept in 
the playoffs for the second year in a row, losing in the second 
round to San Antonio. Utah swept the Lakers in the Western 
Conference finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who returned from an Alaskan fishing trip Monday,  
already was scheduled to be in Los Angeles on Wednesday and 
Thursday to campaign for presidential candidate Bill Bradley, a 
former NBA star who played alongside Jackson with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	A family member who answered the phone at Jackson's home in  
Montana said the coach wasn't available for comment. Neither Todd 
Musburger, Jackson's agent. nor Jerry West, the Lakers' vice 
president, returned calls from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers had indicated that Rambis might keep the job, but  
owner Jerry Buss instead decided to spend millions more to hire the 
high-profile Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to inheriting three of the NBA's marquee players,  
Shaquille O'Neal, Glen Rice and Kobe Bryant, Jackson also will be 
working in a sleek new building. The Lakers have left the aging 
Forum and will play in the new Staples Arena next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan keyed Jackson's run of NBA titles at Chicago,  
where Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman also played major roles in 
making the Bulls one of the best teams in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Jackson, who took this season off, had a 545-193  
record in nine seasons at Chicago and was 111-41 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers began talking to Musburger, last week. Team  
executives West and Mitch Kupchak spoke by telephone to Jackson on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	West and Kupchak were favorably impressed after talking with  
Jackson about the Lakers players and the team's future, and left it 
up to him to decide whether he wanted the job. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, able to fuse the very distinct styles -- and egos -- of  
Jordan, Pippin and Rodman into a championship combination, will 
face a similar challenge in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Although O'Neal is the NBA's dominant center, he has yet to win  
a championship in his six years in the league. Bryant is a 
freelancer by nature, a flashy player who can do almost everything 
but create open shots for his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	There also has been friction between O'Neal, 26, and Bryant, 20.  
</P>
<P>
	After Harris was fired and the Lakers' experiment with Rodman  
ended, the Lakers provided O'Neal with the outside shooter he 
thought was the missing link for a title, Glenn Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles traded Eddie Jones, a former All-Star and an  
outstanding defender, and Elden Campbell to Charlotte to get Rice. 
But Rice, coming off elbow surgery, was mostly disappointing.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Red Violin' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The search for perfection is a recurring theme in ``The Red  
Violin,'' and it is not extravagant to say that this remarkable 
movie comes close to achieving that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a film that touches all of the senses -- eyes, ears, mind  
and heart -- with the blending of evocative storytelling and 
symphonic music that is a rare treat in this summer of the 
big-budget blitzkrieg of special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Violin'' is clearly a labor of love and a passion for  
all involved in making this film for an astonishingly low $9 
million. The Canadian-Italian co-production takes viewers on a 
journey across five countries and three centuries as it tells the 
imagined story of a very special violin as it transforms the lives 
of its owners. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, ``The Red Violin'' feels like five movies in five  
languages. But the clever plotting of the story and the mystery 
that is solved only in the final frames bring all of them together 
in a satisfying and surprising climax. Subtitles for all but the 
English-language sections keep the authenticity of each locale. 
</P>
<P>
	The only ``stars'' likely to be recognized by American audiences  
are Samuel L. Jackson as a violin expert who becomes enamored of 
the legendary instrument and Greta Scacchi as the romance writer 
and muse to an unconventional violinist (Jason Flemyng) in 
19th-century England. But all of the performances are expert. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, written by Canadian director Francois Girard and Don  
McKellar, begins in 17th-century Italy where a noted violin maker, 
Nicolo Bussotti (Carlo Cecchi), creates his masterpiece, a perfect 
violin intended as a gift for his unborn son. But the future of the 
baby and of Bussotti's beautiful wife (Irene Grazioli) are shadowed 
by tragedy predicted by a fortuneteller (Anita Laurenzi) whose 
readings of tarot cards are a unifying thread of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	With the death of Bussotti's dream, the Red Violin, so named for  
its unique varnish color, begins its journey across continents, 
showing up first in Vienna at a monastery where monks train orphan 
boys as violinists. There, it is assigned to an angelic 6-year-old 
prodigy, Kaspar Weiss, portrayed by real-life violin prodigy, 
Christoph Koncz. The small boy turns out to be a genius and is 
adopted by a French music master, providing another short 
film-within-a-film. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the violin falls into the hands of Gypsies who take  
it to England where it inspires the virile virtuoso Frederick Pope 
(Flemyng). It then makes its way to Shanghai and becomes a 
political hot potato in China's cultural evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Each story allows for violin solos, performed by acclaimed  
musician Joshua Bell. The London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted 
by Esa-Pekka Salonen, plays John Corigliano's haunting score for 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The violin's ultimate arrival at a prestigious auction house in  
present-day Montreal is telegraphed throughout the film as we see a 
high-stakes auction in repeated flashbacks. In yet another subplot, 
Jackson, in a virtuoso performance of his own, is the violin expert 
brought in to authenticate the Red Violin. When he concludes that 
he has found perfection and unravels the violin's shocking mystery 
through use of computers and DNA testing, he faces an ethical 
crisis that provides the film's grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Girard first drew attention last year with his ``Thirty-Two  
Short Films About Glenn Gould.'' His early background was in 
filming architecture, dance and music, which explains the exquisite 
look and sound of this movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Production designer Francois Seguin, photography director Alain  
Dostie and costume designer Renee April have crafted scenes that 
are vivid paintings of each era. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Violin'' was produced by Niv Fichman and is being  
released domestically by Lions Gate Films, and by New Line 
International Releasing, Channel Four films and Telefilm Canada 
overseas. Released without a rating, this movie has brief nudity, a 
whimsical sex scene and little violence. A bit too sophisticated 
for young children. Running time: 126 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Schools Teach Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Respect is about to become the law in  
Louisiana's classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature is on the verge of passing Gov. Mike Foster's  
bill requiring students to address teachers and other school 
employees as ``ma'am'' or ``sir'' or use the appropriate title of 
Mr., Miss, Ms. or Mrs. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be the first such law in the nation.  
</P>
<P>
	Lest it be dismissed as a knee-jerk answer to the recent  
violence at Columbine High and other schools, the Republican 
governor stressed: ``It's something I've been thinking about for a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the bill 34-5 last month, the House 89-19  
this week. A final Senate vote on House amendments could take place 
some time before Monday night when the Legislature adjourns. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill leaves it up to school boards to decide the punishment,  
though the House eliminated expulsion or suspension as an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, some school systems require parents or  
students to sign codes of discipline. Some states, notably Arkansas 
and Georgia, require ``character education,'' teaching honesty, 
fairness and respect for others. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform  
in Washington, said she knows of no other such attempt to require 
respectful conversation through state law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to say this is the answer to discipline, but  
what do we have to lose?'' said the bill's Senate sponsor, Donald 
Cravins, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Many teachers and students are skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to solve our problems,'' said Mark Teal, a  
14-year teacher in the town of Sulphur. ``I believe our problems 
will be solved in the homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asia Ayman, an eighth-grader in New Orleans, said: ``Kids don't  
respect their parents at home. What makes them think they're going 
to go to school and respect their teachers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But retired teacher Jean Kennedy of New Orleans said she likes  
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with those who say you can't really legislate  
respect,'' she said, ``but I think it's a good idea to try whatever 
method there might be to raise the consciousness of students and 
parents, and this may be a way of doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would apply to kindergarten through fifth grade in the  
school year that starts this fall. Higher grades would be phased in 
one year at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Louisiana enacted the nation's first covenant  
marriage law, which lets couples choice a type of marriage license 
that makes it more difficult to get divorced. Louisiana has also 
adopted some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 48.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as Internet shares  
rebounded from Monday's sharp losses and the bond market continued 
its own recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 48.76 to 10,612.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite  
index rose 11.25 at 2,409.56 and the S&AMP;P 500 was up 5.60 at 
1,299.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds rose for a second consecutive day largely on the strength  
of the dollar against the yen. The benchmark 30-year bond, which 
had its first two-day gain in three weeks on Monday, had a yield of 
6.07 percent today, down from 6.17 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks, some of which have seen their prices fall in  
half since April, were recovering today. America Online was up 2 3/8 
at 92 7/8, Amazon.com rose 4 to 96 and Yahoo! was up 5 at 124 1/4. But 
analysts said they still expect the correction in Internet issues 
to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM led the Dow higher, rising 1 11/176 to 117 3/16, and J.P.  
Morgan was up 1 1/16 to 127 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 80.76 million shares, 
up from Monday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.01 at 621.61 , and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.24 at 762.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.54 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.34 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.35 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.64 percent.

	``You obviously need a good script and a good director, but the  
casting of the right actor and right actress in the right park is 
essential to the success of any movie,'' said Sherry Lansing, 
chairwoman of Paramount Motion Picture Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters were asked about an individual's ability to attract

<HEADLINE> Gates Buys Sygma Photo Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Corbis, a photo and image agency owned by Bill  
Gates, is getting into the news photography business with the 
purchase of the major French photo agency Sygma. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Tuesday will create what Corbis said will be  
the largest photo and image database in the world with some 65 
million images, including 2.1 millions online. 
</P>
<P>
	The two closely held companies did not disclose financial terms  
of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbis, based in Seattle, had already accumulated a bank of 25  
million images, many of them through the company's 1995 purchase of 
the Bettman Archive. Corbis also sells images of fine art, 
celebrity shots and Ansel Adams landscape photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Sygma is a leading news photo agency and has a collection of  
some 40 million images. It competes with other agencies like Sipa 
and Gamma. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, its photo assignment business and its sale of photo  
republication rights compete with some of the photo services 
provided by The Associated Press and its wholly owned subsidiary 
Wide World Photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbis president Steve Davis said the acquisition of Sygma gives  
Corbis adds ``real-time news imagery to our celebrity, 
contemporary, historical and fine art imagery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corbis distributes images over the Internet, and hopes the Sygma  
acquisition will help propel it into the business of providing 
real-time news and celebrity pictures to consumers and publishers.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- How closely matched are the Buffalo Sabres  
and Dallas Stars? 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres and Stars have played with the score tied or a  
one-goal difference for all but 26 seconds of the four games in the 
Stanley Cup finals thus far. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night was another nail-biter, with the Sabres winning  
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BEST OF THREE:* Now that the Stanley Cup finals are tied 2-2,  
guess how important Game 5 is to the Stars and Sabres? 
</P>
<P>
	Only this: The team that takes a 3-2 lead in the series has won  
the Stanley Cup 12 of 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OVERFLOW:* The Sabres had a great turnout by their fans on  
Tuesday night, and not only at Marine Midland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	With all 18,595 seats filled at the arena, a crowd of 5,000  
showed up at Dunn Tire Field just down the street to watch the 
Stanley Cup game with Dallas on a video scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn Tire Field is the home field for the Buffalo Bisons of the  
International League. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RARE BUFFALO:* When the Sabres went into the third period with  
a 2-1 lead Tuesday night, it marked the first time they led after 
two periods in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CUP OFFICIALS:* Tuesday night's Game 4 of the finals was  
officiated by referees Dan Marouelli and Bill McCreary and linesmen 
Gord Broseker and Kevin Collins. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SITTING SUPERSTAR:* Brett Hull very much wanted to play Tuesday  
night. Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, however, had other plans 
for his injured forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's out -- no matter what he says, he's out,'' Hitchcock said.  
``He's fighting it, he wants to go in. He's just not ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, who has two goals in the first three games of the  
tightly-played finals and seven overall in the playoffs, suffered a 
groin injury in Game 3 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hull argued with his coach, Hitchcock pretty much felt all  
along that he would not be available for Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just needs to be pain-free,'' Hitchcock said.  
</P>
<P>
	Will Hull be ready for Game 5 in Dallas on Thursday night?  
</P>
<P>
	``He's really day-to-day,'' Hitchcock said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RANDY'S READY: * Randy Cunneyworth has to feel lucky. Just off  
an appearance in the Calder Cup finals, he suddenly finds himself 
playing in the Stanley Cup finals with the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran was one of three players brought up from the  
Rochester Americans. That made it two finals in three days for 
Cunneyworth, whose Americans lost the Calder series to the 
Providence Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been past the second round,'' said Cunneyworth, who  
had played in 42 previous NHL playoff games but never in the 
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SELF-HELP:* Buffalo Sabres Lindy Ruff admits that he has talked  
to other coaches in the league in an attempt to get some 
information on how to beat the Dallas Stars. It's a common practice 
among NHL coaches, but not for Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do it differently here,'' Hitchcock said. ``I have a guy  
like (general manager) Bob Gainey. ``I lean on him hard. I'm lucky 
to have people who have won (the Stanley Cup). Bob Gainey and Doug 
Jarvis. I prefer to stay within the bubble.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOCKEY HACKER:* There's at least one player's vote for the  
NHL's new two-referee system, and it comes from a surprising source 
-- Dallas forward Brian Skrudland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the game has gotten better. (The two-ref system) keeps  
players from taking cheap shots behind the play,'' Skrudland said. 
``I never thought I'd like it, considering the way I like to 
hack.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHANGE OF STYLE: Joe Nieuwendyk won the Stanley Cup with the  
Calgary Flames in 1989 and now is trying to win another with the 
Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Any similarities between the teams' style?  
</P>
<P>
	``The game's changed so much,'' Nieuwendyk says. ``It's used to  
be more wide-open. Now it's more tight-checking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is one thing that hasn't changed, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams do whatever it takes to win.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TRADE TALK:* New York Islanders general manager Mike Milbury  
has confirmed that he is trying to trade Zigmund Palffy, the team's 
best offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are getting complicated, though. There are two other  
teams involved, reportedly the New York Rangers and Los Angeles 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	And a lot of cash, Milbury says.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're talking seven figures, and it's not my money, then  
there are other people getting involved,'' said Milbury, who 
attended a meeting of NHL general managers at the Stanley Cup 
finals.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Reed Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jerry Reed has been released from the  
hospital less than two weeks after the entertainer had quadruple 
heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, 62, who lives about in nearby Franklin, had the surgery at  
Baptist Hospital on June 3 after complaining of chest pains. He 
previously had two angioplasty procedures to open clogged blood 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, a songwriter and guitarist, is known for hit songs like  
``When You're Hot, You're Hot.''

<HEADLINE> Jays Activate Quantrill, Berroa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Paul Quantrill, who broke his right leg in an  
offseason snowmobile accident, was activated by the Toronto Blue 
Jays before Tuesday night's game against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing that his contract might be voided, Quantrill originally  
said he sustained the injury after slipping on a toboggan. Three 
days later, he admitted the snowmobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I let my teammates down by not being available, and for that  
I'm sorry,'' said Quantrill, who now has a steel rod in his leg. 
``The club has been outstanding from day one. They've taken real 
good care of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quantrill had seven saves and a 2.59 ERA in 82 games last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	In other moves, the Blue Jays activated Geronimo Berroa and  
designated Dave Hollins for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired from the Anaheim Angels in spring training, Hollins was  
to become the Blue Jays' designated hitter, but he hit just .222 
with two homers and six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave him 100 at-bats and he didn't swing the bat well,''  
Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said. ``We needed a spot open on the 
40-man roster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollins, who missed five weeks because of a fractured left hand,  
said he understood the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't take it personally,'' he said. ``They're making some  
changes, the team's not winning, and I didn't produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berroa becomes the DH. The Blue Jays haven't been able to  
replace the offense lost when Jose Canseco left to sign with Tampa 
Bay. Canseco hit 46 homers last year and began Tuesday with 25.

<HEADLINE> Hill, McGraw Win at TNN Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Six of the 12 trophies at the TNN Music  
City News Country Awards went to the husband-and-wife team of Faith 
Hill and Tim McGraw. Country's power couple will have to share two 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few major awards McGraw and Hill didn't win Monday  
evening was the top prize, Entertainer of the Year. Neither was 
nominated, and Neal McCoy beat George Strait, Garth Brooks, Alan 
Jackson and Shania Twain to win it for the second straight year. 
All sell more CDs than McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't know how big a deal this is for me,'' McCoy  
said. ``We bust our butts over 200 dates a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw was named best male vocalist, and Hill best female  
vocalist. Their duet ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me'' won 
best vocal collaboration and song. Hill's pop-crossover hit ``This 
Kiss'' won for best video and single. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel greedy all of a sudden,'' Hill said after winning her  
third award, the best single honor. She started the evening as the 
top nominee with seven, and left the top winner with five. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Brooks, Jackson, Strait and Vince Gill to win best  
male vocalist, McGraw quipped: ``I'm glad my wife wasn't nominated 
for this tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strait was the only performer to beat Hill in a category in  
which she was nominated, winning best album for ``One Step at a 
Time'' over Hill's ``Faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixie Chicks, who were touring in Europe, were named best  
vocal band and female star of tomorrow. Brooks &AMP; Dunn took home 
their fourth trophy for best vocal duo, and Michael Peterson was 
named male star of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors of the Music City News fan magazine named Charlie  
Daniels, a veteran with hits like ``The Devil Went Down to 
Georgia,'' a living legend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to thank my three favorite people: the Father,  
Son and Holy Ghost,'' Daniels said. Lee Roy Parnell, Deana Carter, 
Vassar Clements and Steve Wariner joined Daniels to play his song, 
``The South's Gonna Do It.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of industry leaders selected Roy Clark to receive the  
Minnie Pearl Award for charity work. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, Gill and George Jones were among the performers on the  
show, which was televised live by The Nashville Network. Comedian 
Jeff Foxworthy was the host. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were held on the first day of International Country  
Music Fan Fair, which draws thousands of fans to Nashville 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans vote for the TNN Music City News Country Awards through  
ballots, or via telephone and the Internet. The two other major 
annual country music awards show are voted by industry workers.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds Spinoff Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the nation's  
second-biggest cigarette company, began operating on its own 
Tuesday after being spun off from the conglomerate at the center of 
the most famous takeover battle of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. distributed shares in the maker of  
Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes to RJR shareholders after the 
stock market closed on Monday, creating a separate $5.7 billion 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased to be operating once again as a  
freestanding, publicly traded company,'' said Andrew Schindler, 
president and chief executive of R.R. Reynolds Tobacco. The tobacco 
company had been the foundation for RJR Nabisco and now trades on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff left RJR Nabisco with an 80 percent stake in Nabisco  
Holdings Corp., which makes Oreo cookies and Planters nuts. So it 
renamed itself Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. and will also trade on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	In NYSE trading, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco closed at $32.43 3/4 a  
share, up 18 3/4 cents from where it had been trading in expectation 
of the spinoff, and Nabisco Group Holdings closed at $21.56 1/4, up 25 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Financier Carl Icahn, who had been pushing RJR Nabisco leaders  
for a breakup for several years, didn't wait around for the 
spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
	He disclosed in a government filing that he had sold his entire  
8 percent stake of RJR Nabisco shares late in Monday's session for 
about $813 million. That was about $130 million more than he paid 
for the stock accumulated over the past eight months, said people 
close to Icahn who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco won wide attention as the target of a 1980s takeover  
battle chronicled in the book ``Barbarians at the Gate.'' It was 
taken private in a $25 billion deal that long ranked as the biggest 
corporate buyout on record. But the heavy debt hobbled its growth 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn and other backers of a breakup long argued that Wall  
Street failed to appreciate the value in the company's food 
interests because of concerns about potential legal liability for 
its sibling tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	They say separating the two businesses will eventually mean a  
higher combined stock price for investors than they would have seen 
with food and tobacco under the same parent. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR chairman and chief executive Steven Goldstone had supported  
the concept of a breakup but had resisted moving ahead in part 
because of concerns about the legal environment for tobacco 
companies and the possibility that a breakup would face lengthy 
challenges in court. 
</P>
<P>
	But the major tobacco companies agreed late last year to pay  
$206 billion over 25 years to settle claims by 46 states for the 
health costs they were paying for treating sick smokers. That 
resolved one huge perceived legal threat. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Goldstone announced RJR had reached an agreement to  
sell its international tobacco business for $7.8 billion to Japan 
Tobacco Co. and that the board had decided to split up its 
remaining tobacco and food businesses. The board eventually 
proposed spinning off the tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn had favored a different method for breaking up the  
company, saying it should spin off its food interests and keep its 
U.S. tobacco operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that spinning off the food business would more clearly  
shield it from those who may win liability awards against the 
tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goldstone said the tobacco spinoff could probably be  
accomplished more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Icahn assembled a slate of candidate for the board to push his  
plan, but gave up the fight before the May shareholders meeting 
when it appeared he would not get the support of other large 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The financier sold the more than 25.7 million shares of RJR  
Nabisco stock for $31.62 1/2 a share to undisclosed buyers, the filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission said. RJR closed at $32 
a share on Monday. In the spinoff, shareholders received one share 
of the new tobacco company for every three shares of the old RJR. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco company will continue to be based in Winston-Salem,  
N.C., and employs about 8,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Schindler was the only company insider among directors named to  
the tobacco company's board on Tuesday. Others include Joseph 
Viviano, vice chairman of Hershey Foods Corp.; Nana Mensah, 
president and chief operating officer of Long John Silver's 
Restaurants Inc., and Denise Ilitch, vice chairwoman of Little 
Caesar Enterprises Inc.

	Rebels Free Some Colombian Hostages  
</P>
<P>
	CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels tonight ceremoniously  
released 33 hostages in front of live television cameras, 17 days 
after kidnapping them during a Sunday Mass. But the rebels held at 
least 20 others captive. They delivered the freed hostages to a 
12-member commission of Colombian and international politicians 
including Venezuela's ambassador and German lawmaker Bernd 
Schmidbauer. Among those released by the National Liberation Army, 
or ELN, were three minors and the parish priest, the Rev. Humberto 
Cadavid.

	Strong Earthquake Rocks Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	PUEBLA, Mexico (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook a large swath of  
central Mexico today, killing at least 12 people, injuring 
hundreds, damaging historic buildings and sending tens of thousands 
of residents fleeing into the streets as buildings swayed. The 
earliest reports of significant damage from the quake, measured at 
a preliminary magnitude 6.7, were from Puebla, 60 miles east of 
Mexico City. The National Seismological Service said the quake hit 
at about 3:41 p.m. (4:41 p.m. EDT) and was centered near Huajuapan 
de Leon, about 125 miles southeast of Mexico City and 80 miles 
south of Puebla.

	PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Pro-independence guerrillas stepped  
up their military and administrative presence in western Kosovo on 
Tuesday, but NATO peacekeepers said that alliance forces were in 
full control of the region. Fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army 
wielding AK-47 assault rifles strode through Kosovo's 
second-largest city to cheers, victory signs and hugs from little 
children. In Djakovica, the KLA set up a headquarters to help 
residents and protect them from what it said were armed Serb 
remnants. Despite the rebels' claims of authority, German 
peacekeepers here and Italians in Djakovoica insist they are 
dictating the terms in accordance with the international peace 
agreement.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- More than 3,000 ethnic Albanian refugees

said. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported that a 
1 1/2-mile-long line of people was streaming into Kosovo from 
Macedonia, spokesman Fred Eckhard said. The UNHCR predicted 2,000

game for Buffalo sends the series back to Dallas for Game 5

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Gun Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is turning to women for help  
in the congressional showdown this week over new gun control 
restrictions as he struggles to keep Democrats from crossing party 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of that key Democratic constituency joined him at a  
White House rally today in support of an amendment by Rep. Carolyn 
McCarthy, D-N.Y., that Democrats say would tighten background 
checks at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again the gun lobby is resisting with all its might; once  
again we are battling not only for the safety of our families but 
the soundness of our democracy,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was an effort to keep Democrats in line as the House  
later this week takes up a juvenile justice bill for the first time 
since the Littleton, Colo., high school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt quietly  
urged two senior lawmakers in his party not to join Republicans in 
sponsoring National Rifle Association-backed gun legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	One, Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, later told reporters he  
wasn't certain what he would do. The other, Rep. John Dingell of 
Michigan, a former NRA board member, met recently with the GOP 
whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, and is supporting a proposal favored 
by the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are about 80 percent of the Democrats who favor these  
gun safety measures, and about 80 percent of the Republicans are 
against them,'' Gephardt, D-Mo., said on ``Meet the Press'' on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans counter that attempts to make it a partisan issue  
won't stand up to scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an issue that divides constituencies across the  
parties,'' said Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, who chairs the 
Republican House campaign committee and said he intends to vote for 
some gun restrictions when the issue reaches the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether gun control would prove to be a defining campaign  
issue in next year's campaign, Davis said, ``nationally, no. This 
is an issue that will play differently'' in different regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, said the issue cuts across  
party lines because Western and Southern Democrats tend to be more 
conservative on the gun issue. 
</P>
<P>
	And in fact, in recent closed-door meetings, some Democrats have  
recalled the loss of seats in 1994 after a vote on banning 
assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	One first-term Democrat, Rep. Ronnie Shows of Mississippi, said,  
``I definitely come from a different cultural area and background 
(from many Democrats). I'll just vote my way. I think they'll 
understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Needing to pick up only six seats next year to gain a House  
majority, Democratic leaders have seized on the issue in the wake 
of the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it's a lightning rod issue, just as shutting down  
the government, trying to shut down the Department of Education, 
not funding the air war over Kosovo and impeachment were issues,'' 
said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the Democratic 
campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., added that recent school shootings  
have altered the political landscape because people fear for their 
children's safety and may be more willing to express their concerns 
at the ballot box. ``Nobody is sure how much,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist, said, ``I think that's  
more wishful thinking than it is reality. The offices that I'm 
visiting, NRA members and members (lawmakers) are making their 
views known that they don't think that the anti-gun members' 
attempts to lay the blame for Littleton are fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said he believes 40 to 50 Democrats may support the  
proposal backed by Dingell, and 15 to 20 Republicans may support a 
White House-backed version that cleared the Senate, with more 
undecided. Dingell's proposal contains a provision on gun show 
background checks that is less restrictive than the Senate-passed 
measure.

<HEADLINE> Paula Abdul Sues Juice Promoter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Paula Abdul has filed an invasion of  
privacy lawsuit against a diet juice promoter that she claims 
wrongfully used her name in magazine ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of Ms. Abdul's name in ads for the Hollywood 48-Hour  
Miracle Diet suggested the singer endorsed, needed or used the 
diet, said her attorney, Barbara Berkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads appeared in Vanity Fair and Cosmopolitan and read:  
``Stars like Paula Abdul ... have been rushed this amazing juice 
formula by the diet juice guru himself, James Kabler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abdul seeks more than $1 million for libel, invasion of  
privacy and violation of her right to control her own publicity, 
Ms. Berkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Spurs, Knicks Set for NBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs are impressed with the  
way the New York Knicks reached the NBA Finals despite a 
psychological face lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been incredible,'' Tim Duncan said Monday. ``They're a  
very resilient team. They just find ways to get it done. Everybody 
counts them out. They just prove everybody wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs and Knicks begin their best-of-7 championship series  
Wednesday night at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the top-seeded Spurs are 11-1 in the playoffs and swept  
the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers to reach the 
finals, San Antonio's players say they aren't overlooking the 
capabilities of the Knicks, the eighth-seeded team in the East. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to respect them because they've come through the  
East and they've beaten all the teams in the East they needed to 
beat,'' Spurs center David Robinson said. ``Man, they are playing 
great basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York defeated the Indiana Pacers 4-2 to win the Eastern  
Conference finals, even after losing power forward Larry Johnson to 
a knee injury. The Knicks advanced to the NBA Finals for the first 
time since 1994, when New York lost to Houston in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, who last won a title in 1973, are the first  
eighth-seeded team to make it to the finals. No other eighth-seeded 
team won more than one playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never played in the Eastern Conference finals, never done  
any of these things,'' the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell said. 
``Obviously I know what I'm playing for and what's at stake, but I 
just focus on this being the next game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have never been to the NBA Finals since joining the  
league in the late 1970s from the American Basketball Association. 
The Spurs are the first of the old ABA teams to make it this far. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs have been relatively injury-free this season,  
the Knicks have been anything but. Johnson suffered a sprained 
ligament in his right knee Friday. It will be a game-time decision 
as to whether he'll play Wednesday, the Knicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's there, obviously he's going to play a huge role. If  
not, we'll depend on other people,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson predicted he will play at some point in the series.  
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing will be missing from the Knicks lineup after  
suffering a torn Achilles' tendon in the Indiana series. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Johnson, containing Duncan and Robinson would be even  
more difficult for New York than it already is likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing Duncan and Robinson can do is cause so much foul  
trouble. The depth factor inside is critical for us,'' Van Gundy 
said Monday in New York before the team flew to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy and the Knicks players refuse to say if they'll depart  
from common strategy and use single-coverage rather than 
double-teams against Duncan and Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs and Knicks don't really know how they'll stack up  
against each other with their current lineups because they never 
faced each other this lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing with New York is they just formed their team  
in the playoffs,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``They are who 
they are now. The way they played against Indiana is who this team 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last meeting between San Antonio and New York was March 31,  
1998, at Madison Square Garden. The Spurs won that game by 17 
points largely because of injuries to Ewing and Chris Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio has been watching the Knicks' every move on  
television the past two weeks after defeating Portland in four 
games and getting a nearly 10-day layoff until the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the players. We've played against them,'' Robinson  
said. ``Just this combination we don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few days ago, the Spurs acted thrilled to have made it to  
the finals. On Monday, they were concentrating on the job at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks arrived in San Antonio on Monday to find a town  
virtually plastered with ``Go Spurs Go'' signs and cars tooling 
around with Spurs flags flapping from their antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks may be trying to ignore the distractions, but so are  
the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to hear it,'' San Antonio guard Mario Elie said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I live by myself, so I've got to go out and get me some  
groceries now and then, and people ask me, `Are you going to win?' 
I'm rude. I don't answer them. I just get my food and leave,'' Elie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand these people around here are excited, but there's  
a lot of work to be done.''

<HEADLINE> Electric Fields, Cancer Link Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six years of research have produced little  
hard evidence that the magnetic fields around electric power lines 
cause cancer, yet some lingering concerns remain, a National 
Institutes of Health division reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually all of the laboratory evidence in animals and humans  
and most of the mechanistic studies in cells fail to support a 
causal relationship'' between the electromagnetic fields and 
cancer, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 
said in the report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it said there have been some statistical associations  
between the fields and childhood leukemia as well as chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia in adults exposed to the fields through their 
work, such as electric utility workers, machinists and welders. 
</P>
<P>
	Research is continuing on these ``lingering concerns'' and  
efforts to reduce human exposure to electromagnetic fields should 
continue, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of consistent, positive findings in animal or  
mechanistic studies weakens the belief that this association is 
actually due to EMF, but it cannot completely discount the 
epidemiological findings,'' NIEHS Director Kenneth Olden said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, he said, since virtually everyone in the country is  
routinely exposed to EMF, efforts to reduce such exposure should 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the electrical industry should continue efforts to  
reduce the electromagnetic fields around large transmission lines 
and communities should enforce electrical codes to avoid wiring 
errors that can increase EMF. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus on a possible link to cancer stemmed from a 1979  
Denver study that tied leukemia to EMF, but the researchers also 
concluded that there was no connection between EMF and other 
problems including Alzheimer's disease, depression and birth 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a year ago, a panel of scientists studying this issue  
concluded, in a 19-9 vote, that electromagnetic fields should be 
considered ``possible human carcinogens'' though the risk was 
``probably quite small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was at odds with a 1996 report by a National Research  
Council panel of scientists.Those scientists evaluated about 500 
studies on the health effects of high voltage power lines and found 
``no conclusive and consistent evidence'' that electric and 
magnetic fields cause any human disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the link between electricity and disease has long been  
controversial, some consumer groups have sued power companies or 
forced utility firms to move power lines or install shielding.

<HEADLINE> College World Series Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska is home to one of the nation's  
perennial contenders in college football. So it came as no surprise 
when talk at the College World Series turned to the gridiron. 
</P>
<P>
	After Stanford beat Florida State, Seminoles coach Mike Martin  
was asked if nagging injuries to his relievers contributed to the 
loss. He said he wouldn't make excuses, then he borrowed one from 
Seminoles football fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're talking about Florida State football, I'm gonna use  
the backup quarterback excuse,'' Martin said. ``We'd have won a 
national championship if we'd have had Weinke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a reference to Seminoles quarterback Chris Weinke, the  
26-year-old sophomore who threw for 19 touchdowns last fall before 
his season ended with a neck injury against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke sat out Florida State's 23-16 loss to Tennessee in the  
Fiesta Bowl, but Martin didn't need to look all the way back to 
Tallahassee to find a quarterback. There was one in the other 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford right fielder Joe Borchard, a sophomore, is vying to be  
the Cardinal's starting signal-caller next fall. Last season, he 
came off the bench to lead Stanford to victories over Washington 
State and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 37-34 defeat of the Tar Heels, Borchard had a 41-yard carry  
in the final minute to set up the game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A REAL HEAD-SCRATCHER:* Official scorer Lou Spry and the people  
who keep statistics for the NCAA had a difficult time trying to 
decipher a strange play in the game between Cal State-Fullerton and 
Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bacani doubled to lead off the fifth. Reed Johnson tried  
to move him over with a bunt toward third. Aggies third baseman 
Dell Lindsey threw to first for a close play, but umpire Ken Couch 
ruled Johnson safe. 
</P>
<P>
	As first baseman John Scheschuk began walking toward the mound,  
apparently thinking Couch had granted his request for a timeout, 
Johnson ran for second at the urging of first-base coach Mike 
Kirby. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacani, who went to third on the bunt, made a move for home then  
raced back to third when Scheschuk held the ball. Meanwhile, 
Johnson ran to second behind Scheschuk. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer Oborn then brought Bacani and Johnson home with a single  
to left, giving the Titans a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The play initially was ruled a bunt single, with Johnson  
advancing to second on a fielder's choice. It took Spry and other 
statisticians about 35 minutes to sort it out. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, about a dozen NCAA officials conferred in the  
scorer's booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a great deal of consternation and gnashing of teeth, we  
have arrived at the following conclusion,'' Spry finally said over 
the press box intercom. ``Give Johnson a two-base hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JENNINGS SCORES AGAIN:* Baylor pitcher and designated hitter  
Jason Jennings will need a trunk for his return trip to Waco, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings was named player of the year by the American Baseball  
Coaches Association on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That goes with his other player of the year awards handed out in  
Omaha. He was honored by the Collegiate Baseball Writers 
Association and two magazines -- Baseball America and Collegiate 
Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings was taken 16th overall earlier this month in the  
amateur draft by the Colorado Rockies, who will use him as a 
pitcher. He was 13-2 with a 2.58 ERA and 172 strikeouts in 147 2-3 
innings. Jennings also hit .386 with 17 home runs and 68 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCOUTS IN ACTION:* During each CWS game, about a dozen  
professional scouts are usually seated behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	With the amateur draft already held June 2-4, the scouts aren't  
charting new prospects. They're keeping an eye on the ones they've 
already selected. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at your guys, the guys that you have under your  
control,'' said Des Hamilton, the Midwest scout for the Seattle 
Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scouts, holding clipboards bearing the logos of the  
Minnesota Twins and Kansas City Royals, were seated in the front 
row shortly before the first pitch of Sunday night's game between 
Rice and Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's draft was heavy on high school players. Among the  
rosters of the eight teams that advanced to Omaha, only six players 
were taken in the fourth round or higher. 
</P>
<P>
	They are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- From Texas A&AMP;M, right-hander Chance Capel, first round by the  
St. Louis Cardinals (No. 30 overall), and left-hander Casey Fossum, 
first round by the Boston Red Sox (No. 48). 
</P>
<P>
	-- From Florida State, right-hander Nick Stocks, first round by  
the Cardinals (No. 36). 
</P>
<P>
	-- From Miami, shortstop Bobby Hill, second round by the Chicago  
White Sox (No. 66), injured catcher Russ Jacobsen, third round by 
the Philadelphia Phillies (No. 96), and right-hander Alex Santos, 
fourth round by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (No. 115). 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RECORD CROWD:* The attendance of 24,859 for Sunday's late game  
between Rice and Oklahoma State was a record for a College World 
Series contest. The previous mark of 24,456 came during last year's 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been another good series at the gate. The crowd of 23,302  
for Saturday night's game between Stanford and Cal State-Fullerton 
was the third straight time the Rosenblatt Stadium fans had set a 
record for the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's attendance of 22,824 was a session 5 record.

<HEADLINE> Gun Issue Dominates Mayors' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Mayor Alvin P. DuPont of Tuscaloosa, Ala., is  
no fan of gun control. Like a lot of people in his part of the 
world, DuPont considers the right to bear arms non-negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the World War II veteran himself owns seven guns for  
quail hunting and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	But recent killings at American schools have DuPont  
reconsidering the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I grew up, everybody had a gun, but we only used them for  
hunting. Now it seems guns are more available and more 
affordable,'' DuPont said. ``We need to do something about guns. 
I'm not sure what, but times have changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's concerns underscored the overriding sentiment at the  
67th annual U.S. Conference of Mayors this week that the time is 
right for city leaders to get behind national gun control 
legislation. But while the mayors want something done about guns, 
no single solution won consensus here. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Senate has passed a gun control measure, and  
the House is expected to soon start debating restrictions that 
would require background checks at gun shows and ban purchases by 
people under 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are too accessible. There are simply too many out  
there,'' said Mayor Wellington Webb of Denver, the group's new 
president. ``I say the fewer guns in circulation the better, and I 
think that public policy is moving that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five day meeting of more than 300 mayors had its usual  
parade of federal officials and discussions of urban issues like 
welfare reform, affordable housing and public school reform. But 
the topic of guns and how to keep them from the hands of children 
dominated discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first day of the meeting, a bipartisan group of mayors  
called on House leaders to enact a strict gun safety bill. More 
than 100 mayors signed a letter sent to House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert asking Congress to raise the age from 18 to 21 at which a 
person could buy a gun and to require background checks for all 
purchases, even at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday, Vice President Al Gore drew cheers by accusing  
Republican leaders in the House of delaying passage of gun 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some mayors privately expressed hopes that more cities would  
announce intentions to sue gun makers in product liability suits 
for failing to incorporate safety features like safety locks on 
their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	They said that a large-scale suit filed on behalf of 100 or more  
cities seeking to hold the gun industry accountable for injuries 
caused by guns would have a greater impact than the 20 individual 
suits filed so far by such cities as New Orleans, Chicago, 
Cleveland, Newark and Boston. But no such suit was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want this to be a forum where people can discuss whether a  
lawsuit would be right for them. There isn't any heavy lobbying for 
any position,'' said Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini, the 
outgoing conference mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, whose city filed the first suit  
against the gun industry, said litigation is only a part of the 
strategy that he believes will ultimately make the streets in his 
city safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to push on the federal level and that's why we are  
asking the House for some leadership,'' he said. ``But we want 
parents to be more responsible as well as the gun makers 
themselves. Its going to take all those different elements.''

<HEADLINE> Oracle Profits Rise 31 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Oracle, a leading maker of business  
software, reported a 31 percent increase in quarterly earnings and 
separately disclosed it was laying off 325 employees who will be 
replaced by technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the layoffs, which are effective immediately  
and account for about 1 percent of the work force, are not related 
to the financial results for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, 
which were better than expected. But it also said productivity 
gains would be necessary to maintain growth in its profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle said Tuesday its earnings for the quarter ended May 31  
rose to $527.4 million, or 36 cents a share, beating analyst 
expectations of 32 cents a share. In the same period a year ago, 
Oracle earned $403.8 million, or 27 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 22 percent to $2.94 billion from $2.41 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were released after financial markets closed  
Tuesday while the layoffs were disclosed during trading. Oracle 
stock slumped 5 percent, closing down $1.31 1/4 at $25.12 1/2 a share on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Glass, an Oracle spokeswoman, said the layoffs are part  
of Oracle's efforts to ``become a model e-business company,'' and 
that the workers were being replaced by technology. 
</P>
<P>
	For fiscal year 1999, earnings rose 58.5 percent to $1.29  
billion, or 87 cents a share, from $813.7 million, or 54 cents a 
share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 24 percent to $8.83 billion 
from $7.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've now shown four consecutive quarters of consistent margin  
improvement,'' said Jeffrey O. Henley, Executive Vice President and 
Chief Financial Officer. ``This kind of margin expansion over the 
next couple of years will be possible principally through continued 
productivity gains, as we transform our business to an 
e-business.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Request To Add Davis Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks tried to add Ben Davis to  
their playoff roster Tuesday, but were denied by the NBA Board of 
Governors. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 15-11 vote, with two abstentions, the board said the Knicks  
could not add the 6-foot-8 forward because the team's situation did 
not meet the ``extreme hardship'' standard required by league 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year forward from Arizona, who had 17 points in eight  
games, has been practicing with the team during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks wanted to add Davis because of injuries to forward  
Larry Johnson, center Patrick Ewing and guard David Wingate. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who sprained his right knee in the Knicks'  
series-clinching victory over Indiana last Friday night, is a 
game-time decision for Wednesday night. Ewing suffered a partial 
tear in his left Achilles, ending his season after two games of the 
Eastern Conference finals. Wingate, who has a torn quadriceps 
muscle, practiced Tuesday and said it was possible he could play in 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
	If none of the three play, the Knicks will have just nine  
players on their active roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Governors is comprised of one representative from  
each NBA team.

<HEADLINE> Steps Limited To Curtail Sweatshops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. clothes and sneaker manufacturers  
criticized several years ago for using foreign sweatshops and child 
labor have made some voluntary improvements in health and safety in 
overseas factories, activists say. 
</P>
<P>
	But nearly three years after accusations surfaced against Kathie  
Lee Gifford, Nike Inc. and others, a White House-orchestrated 
effort to improve worker conditions is still on the drawing board -- 
and only a handful of companies have signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	One monitor who recently returned to a Vietnamese factory making  
Nike products found ``significant improvements around health and 
safety issues,'' including better ventilation and a switch to less 
toxic glue, said Medea Benjamin, spokeswoman for a San 
Francisco-labor rights group, Global Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	A Reebok International effort to bar Pakistani children from  
stitching soccer balls for pennies has become a model. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, human rights groups caution it's much harder to take the  
next step and wipe out widespread abusive child labor -- a proposal 
President Clinton will make Wednesday in a speech to the 
International Labor Organization, an arm of the United Nations. 
Critics say the Clinton administration should make such protections 
part of free-trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Clinton ordered federal agencies to list  
products suspected of being made by forced child labor. He also 
required federal contractors to certify that no abusive child labor 
went into goods they buy. The administration has identified problem 
industries, including carpets and bricks from India and Pakistan, 
fishing platforms from Indonesia and fireworks from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas factories drew Americans' attention after activists  
revealed that clothing sold in Wal-Mart under Gifford's name was 
produced in a Honduran sweatshop. The Vietnamese factory making 
Nike products was accused of mistreating workers and having 
dangerous levels of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House convened manufacturers and human rights groups  
in 1996 to address such abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	After many false starts, eight of those companies and four of  
those human rights groups have created the Fair Labor Association, 
said Justine Nolan of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. The 
FLA, which has a charter but no full-time staffers yet, hopes to 
have independent monitors in place by this winter, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that join the association agree to monitor factories  
where they contract to make products, and to let independent, 
FLA-accredited monitors check those workplaces as well, with 
results made public. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, they will be allowed to publicize their efforts to  
prevent sweatshop labor, perhaps with ``No Sweat'' tags. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies in FLA thus far are Nike, Reebok, Liz Claiborne,  
Patagonia, Gifford, Nicole Miller, Philips Van Heusen and L.L. 
Bean. FLA's human rights groups are the Lawyers Committee for Human 
Rights, the National Consumers League, the Robert F. Kennedy 
Memorial Center for Human Rights and the International Labor Rights 
Fund. Also participating are 83 universities whose students have 
sought to prevent sweatshop labor from making clothes bearing 
school logos. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some human rights groups -- particularly the Interfaith  
Center for Corporate Responsibility and Global Exchange -- say they 
won't participate because they consider the requirements too weak, 
specifically complaining that they don't guarantee workers a 
``living wage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, several companies have pressed forward on their own.  
Nike uses an accounting firm to monitor each factory, inviting 
local monitors along in some places. It says workers must be 16 in 
clothing factories and 18 in shoe factories, and it has begun some 
in-factory schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Reebok encourages workers to file confidential complaints  
against managers, either by phone or in suggestion boxes or prepaid 
mailing envelopes. It also has paid for a U.S. union's overseas arm 
to give Indonesian workers information about their right to form 
independent unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Benjamin says Global Exchange still receives  
reports of workers forced to pay for ``free'' schools, or given 
safety masks only on days when inspectors are due. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it perfect? No,'' says Maria Eitel, Nike's vice president  
for corporate responsibility. ``But I think we're developing a 
strong system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tougher challenge is ending child labor to make products not  
sold to American shoppers, but to foreign customers, said Doug 
Cahn, vice president of Reebok's human rights program. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Reebok began trying to prevent Pakistani children from  
stitching soccer balls -- in part, by bringing workers to factories 
rather than sending balls to homes, and by starting a free school. 
Nevertheless, an estimated 6 million Pakistani children still work 
in other industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have to be alternatives for families that may have been  
depending on that income,'' Cahn said. ``Getting rid of child labor 
is not an easy, simple thing.''

<HEADLINE> Coke Products Banned in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Stores across Belgium removed all  
beverages of the Coca Cola Co. from their shelves today, complying 
with a ban prompted by the hospitalizations of people who got sick 
after drinking Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	For a second consecutive day, poison alert centers across  
Belgium received hundreds of phone calls from people seeking 
information. Some callers said they too had become nauseous after 
drinking Coke or Coca Cola brands. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche banned all sales  
of Coke and Coca Cola brands such as Fanta, Sprite, Aquarius, 
Bonaqua and Minute Maid fruit juices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hard at work trying to find the cause of the  
problems,'' said Maureen O'Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Coca Cola in 
Belgium. ``We are also implementing a total recall of our 
products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ban was imposed after nearly 50 people, most of them young  
people, were hospitalized Monday suffering from nausea after 
drinking Coke products. Eight remained in the hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, 31 school children fell ill after drinking Coke,  
forcing the company to recall 2.5 million bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person hospitalized showed symptoms of hemolysis,  
an excessive destruction of red blood cells that causes anemia and 
vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Health inspectors were checking the packaging of Coke products  
as well as the contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests were conducted at Coca Cola's bottling plants in the  
cities of Antwerp and Ghent, as well as at its plant just across 
the border in Dunkirk, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been working and continue to work around the clock to  
identify the reasons behind the product complaints,'' said Robert 
Baskin, a Coca Cola spokesman in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cases appear to be isolated to Belgium, where those  
who became ill reported a foul odor on the outside of cans and 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we have are symptoms of nausea likely induced by  
the off odor,'' Baskin said, adding the company has no evidence the 
cans or products caused any ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Baskin said tests run by Coca-Cola and an independent lab found  
nothing wrong with other beverages in the same vending machines. 
Additional test results were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban comes as Belgium is still reeling from revelations that  
cancer-causing dioxin had entered the food chain through animal 
feed in recent months. That led the government to forbid sales of 
chicken, pork, beef, eggs and meat products.

<HEADLINE> Estrogen Sub Lowers Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An estrogen substitute used to prevent brittle  
bones in women who are past menopause reduces the risk of breast 
cancer dramatically, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year study of 7,705 women found a 76 percent lower  
risk of breast cancer among those taking raloxifene compared with 
those given a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene is marketed under the name Evista by Eli Lilly and  
Co., which paid for the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in tomorrow's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, was led by Dr. Steven R. Cummings, a professor 
of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very exciting beginning,'' Cummings said. ``But we've  
only had 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 years of experience with this. I think women 
should be cautious about any medications used for prevention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene is part of a new generation of drugs scientists hope  
will mimic the good effects of estrogen -- stronger bones and a 
lower risk of heart disease -- while inhibiting the possible harmful 
effects, which may include promoting breast and uterine cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene, the first ``designer estrogen,'' was approved in  
1997 by the Food and Drug Administration for preventing 
osteoporosis. It has not been shown to affect heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Many women are afraid to use estrogen because of conflicting  
evidence on whether it promotes breast cancer. However, a study 
released last week on 37,000 women suggested that hormones do not 
increase the risk of breast cancer, except for some uncommon and 
highly curable forms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Raloxifene isn't risk-free. It increases the chances of serious  
blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cummings' study, 5,129 post-menopausal women younger than 81  
received raloxifene daily, while 2,576 got a dummy pill. Thirteen 
cases of breast cancer were diagnosed among the women on 
raloxifene; 27 cases were found among those taking the placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	Women taking raloxifene had a 90 percent lower risk of a type of  
cancer called estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, raloxifene had almost no effect on estrogen-receptor  
negative breast cancer, one of the hardest forms of the disease to 
treat. It is most commonly developed by younger women and those 
with a genetic predisposition to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Janet Wolter of Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center  
in Chicago, said she is encouraged by the findings and hopes more 
research will determine whether the breast cancer drug tamoxifen or 
raloxifene is more effective and produces fewer side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	An accompanying editorial called the findings encouraging but  
cautioned that raloxifene cannot yet be considered suitable for 
most women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its contributions to knowledge intensify the anticipation of  
finding something even better on this new frontier,'' said Drs. 
Adele L. Franks of the Prudential Center for Health Care Research 
in Atlanta and Karen K. Steinberg of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention.

<HEADLINE> Rosa Parks Honored by Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hailed by lawmakers as the mother of civil  
rights, Rosa Parks was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal 
today, the highest civilian award given by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks, 86, was lauded by the House and Senate leadership  
and President Clinton for an act of defiance more than four decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 1, 1955, the seamstress, tired after a day's work in  
Montgomery, Ala., refused to give up her seat to a white man on a 
segregated city bus and was arrested for her defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Her arrest set off a lengthy bus boycott by thousands of blacks  
-- led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., then a local minister. 
The boycott lasted about a year until the Supreme Court declared 
Montgomery's bus segregation law unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is the mother of the civil rights movement,'' said Rep.  
Julia Carson, D-Ind., who pushed for the legislation granting the 
Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Parks, who now lives in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a celebration of the life of Rosa Parks, who is  
receiving the honor while she can still see it,'' Carson said of 
Mrs. Parks, who appeared frail and had to be helped to her feet 
from her wheelchair, sometimes steadying herself on the arm of 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God that when your time came, you were not afraid,''  
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said at the Capitol 
Rotunda ceremony. ``You had courage, and you sat down for all of 
America and all of America's freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional lawmakers gave Mrs. Parks an artist's drawing of  
the medal, which is not yet finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank you,'' she said in a low, halting voice, adding that  
she accepted the award for a ``free people'' and for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The gratitude went both ways.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thank you for what you have done,'' Clinton told Mrs. Parks.  
</P>
<P>
	``She sat, anchored to that seat, as Dr. King said, by the  
accumulated indignities of days gone by and the countless 
aspirations of generations yet unborn,'' the president said. ``Rosa 
Parks said, 'I didn't get on that bus to get arrested; I got on 
that bus to go home.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was only 9 when Mrs. Parks refused to  
stand up. He and his friends ``couldn't figure out anything we 
could do since we couldn't even vote. So we began to sit on the 
back of the bus when we got on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks action cost her the seamstress job and prompted  
harassment and threats to her family. So she moved to Detroit in 
1957. She joined the staff of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1965 
and worked there until retiring in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Mrs. Parks co-founded a nonprofit group, the Rosa and  
Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, to help young people 
in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	A guest at Clinton's State of the Union address in January, Mrs.  
Parks has received numerous awards, including the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation awarding her the Congressional Gold Medal was  
approved by the Senate without dissent April 19. The House voted 
424-1 for it the next day. The only ``no'' vote was cast by Rep. 
Ron Paul, R-Texas, who said he opposes spending government money on 
such awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers initially used the Congressional Gold Medal to honor  
military leaders but began using it during the 20th century to 
recognize excellence in a range of fields. More than 320 medals 
have been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was given to George Washington in 1776 for ``wise and  
spirited conduct'' during the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent honorees include Frank Sinatra, Mother Teresa and South  
African President Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Ex NBA-er Greg Anderson Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Former NBA player Greg ``Cadillac''  
Anderson was sentenced to five months in a Houston jail for 
participating in a cocaine deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson broke into tears after he was sentenced Monday in  
federal court in Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Atlanta Hawks backup center faced up to three years  
in prison for the charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine with 
intent to distribute it. Anderson pleaded guilty to the charge 
after he was caught during an FBI sting operation at the Grand 
Casino Bayview Hotel in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the sentence by U.S. District Court Judge Walter Gex,  
the 6-foot-10-inch Anderson turned to a hallway wall and cried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm relieved,'' Anderson said, declining further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Three co-defendants already have been sentenced for the sale of  
3 ounces of cocaine to an FBI informant. They received prison terms 
ranging from eight months to 27 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've given you a break now. Don't disappoint me,'' Gex told  
Anderson, who also was fined $5,000, and will be placed in a 
supervised-release program for four years after he is released. 
``If you have to come back before me, pack your bags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson told the judge that he ``made a mistake.''  
</P>
<P>
	``But I feel like I got my life back on the right track,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Anderson hasn't given up his hopes of returning  
to the NBA. He recently played for a team in Buenos Aires, 
Argentina, that paid him $40,000 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors approved delays of Anderson's sentencing so  
he could play in China and Argentina. They had asked the judge to 
give him a lighter sentence, citing his cooperation in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, a former University of Houston star who earned the  
nickname ``Cadillac'' because he rode his bicycle to school, has 
said he met Howard Hill last season while playing for Atlanta. He 
denied knowing Hill was a Biloxi drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was a first-round draft pick by the San Antonio Spurs  
in 1987 and spent two two-year stints with the team. He also played 
for Milwaukee, Denver, Detroit. He played for Atlanta in 1994-95 
and rejoined the Hawks last year.

<HEADLINE> Cards' La Russa To Decide on Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Tony La Russa has a job as the St. Louis  
Cardinals' manager next year, if he wants it. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said he'll decide later this season whether to take the  
team's owners up on their offer of a contract extension for a fifth 
season with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too much left in the season,'' La Russa said Tuesday.  
``The only thing I would never wait to say is I think this is the 
best managing situation in the major leagues, and I'm including the 
New York Yankees and anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If La Russa leaves, he said it would be because he's not  
universally loved. Among his critics are Ozzie Smith and Whitey 
Herzog, who led the team to three World Series in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's retirement was hastened in 1996 when La Russa made him  
split the job with Royce Clayton. Herzog was critical of La Russa 
in his recent book, ``You're Missin' a Great Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of fans who are trying to figure out  
whether I should be here or not: sometimes yes, sometimes no, 
sometimes maybe,'' La Russa said. ``But I've got powerful enemies, 
and I never forget that. That makes it a little unfair at times 
here. It doesn't change what I do, but I'm aware of it.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Boosts Stake in Pets.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc. said it increased its ownership  
in Pets.com Inc. to 54 percent under a new financing agreement with 
the online pet retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based online bookseller -- along with Hummer Winblad  
Venture Partners and Bowman Capital Management LLC -- agreed to pump 
a combined $50 million into Pets.com, continuing a trend among 
online companies to try to grab a piece of the $23 billion 
pet-products market, Dow Jones News Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman Capital is an institutional investor specializing in  
technology companies. Hummer Winblad is a venture capital fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, several major competitors are selling a wide range of  
pet-related goods via the Web, including a new and aggressive 
effort from old-line retailer PetSmart Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Amazon invested several million dollars in San  
Francisco-based Pets.com, as did Hummer Winblad. 
</P>
<P>
	Pets.com said it will use the new money to fund marketing and  
brand-building efforts, as well as building its infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded last fall, Pets.com recently opened its first warehouse  
and is about to introduce a newly redesigned Web site, which is 
expected to be heavily promoted on Amazon's main site.

<HEADLINE> AOL Mulled Dumping M'soft's Browser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly disclosed e-mail shows that top  
executives at America Online Inc. debated whether to stop 
distributing Microsoft's Internet software during their secret $10 
billion negotiations last fall to buy Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Chairman Steve Case wondered whether Microsoft might not  
retaliate ``given current antitrust attention'' if AOL switched its 
nearly 17 million subscribers to Netscape's browser, suggesting 
that the software giant might be intimidated into inaction by the 
government's legal case. 
</P>
<P>
	But AOL's president and chief operating officer, Robert Pittman,  
argued to Case that Microsoft was ``too strong to throw them out of 
the tent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days later in another e-mail, Case asked for an analysis of the  
deal's implications, ``including an analysis of what would happen 
if we got really aggressive and swapped out'' Microsoft's browser 
for Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Other documents, also disclosed Monday at Microsoft's antitrust  
trial, confirmed that Netscape currently is working to create for 
AOL subscribers a version of its browser software under the project 
name ``Raptor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL ultimately decided to continue distributing Microsoft's Web  
browser under a contract that runs until January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John Warden disclosed the e-mails and other  
documents while questioning David Colburn, senior vice president of 
business affairs for AOL. He was called by Microsoft as a hostile 
witness during this final phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was unclear whether Warden persuaded U.S. District Judge  
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will issue the verdict in the case 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In private meetings with lawyers, Jackson said many of the  
e-mails and documents Colburn ``has never seen before and he 
doesn't know anything about,'' and called Colburn's testimony ``not 
very illuminating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm rather surprised at the lack of personal knowledge he has  
about the things you're asking him, but he's demonstrated it,'' 
Jackson told Warden. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also asked Microsoft whether it wanted to call Case  
himself as one of its final witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may be the point man insofar as explicating what the  
transaction is all about,'' Jackson said, according to transcripts 
of the meeting made available today. ``I would be willing to let 
you substitute, if you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, the judge again mentioned Case.  
</P>
<P>
	``The best person to call, you don't want to call,'' the judge  
told Warden. ``And I don't blame you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The government can call him,'' Warden offered.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want him, either,'' the judge said.  
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Mike Murray said today the company has no  
plans to call Case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to resume Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Colburn maintained Monday that AOL never seriously considered  
dropping Microsoft's browser. He said Microsoft's offer in exchange 
-- to distribute AOL's software within Windows -- was too important 
to risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Case's job is to make sure the operations people are  
thinking of all the issues,'' said Colburn, who added that AOL 
``never really did an analysis of swapping out one browser for 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants to convince Jackson that AOL's purchase of  
Netscape, finalized earlier this year, illustrates there is 
sufficiently robust competition in the high-tech industry such that 
federal intervention isn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally wielded its  
influence as the maker of the dominant Windows operating system to 
try to crush Netscape, one of its top software rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft believes AOL could resuscitate Netscape's flagging  
popularity by distributing its software to millions. Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates wrote in a December e-mail to his employees 
that AOL will switch browsers ``sooner or later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warden called Gates' message ``a very interesting document'' and  
tried to introduce it as evidence, but the judge blocked him. The 
Justice Department's lead lawyer, David Boies, complained that the 
message was sent ``by Gates during the litigation, a self-serving 
statement.'' The Associated Press had obtained a copy of the 
message the day it was sent. 
</P>
<P>
	In his own e-mail last September, Case called AOL's choice of  
browsers a ``big, big issue to figure out'' but noted that if AOL 
distributed Netscape's browser, its share of the software market 
would climb to ``more than two-thirds share again!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My main point is, we shouldn't assume we need or want to  
maintain (Microsoft's) as primary browser,'' Case wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pittman warned Case not to underestimate the company that  
Gates built. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can hurt us if they think they have no other option,''  
said Pittman. ``I think we need to stay in business with them, 
create a need for them to need us.''

<P>
	POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man convicted of killing a St. Louis  
restaurant worker was executed by injection early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Kilgore, 38, never denied his involvement in the 1986  
kidnapping of Marilyn Wilkins, 54, but said he was innocent of 
slashing her throat. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilgore was pronounced dead at 12:05 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	His last words were: ``I really enjoyed my life. I tried to live  
it the best I could. I am leaving this world without any bitterness 
and may God have mercy on our souls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kilgore had blamed his partner, Willie Luckett, who is serving  
life in prison. Luckett blamed Kilgore. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckett, who had worked with Ms. Wilkins, was fired after Ms.  
Wilkins told their boss he was stealing food from the restaurant. 
Luckett and Kilgore kidnapped her from the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	The execution was the state's seventh in 1999 and the most since  
the death penalty was reinstituted in 1989.

<HEADLINE>  Coke Products Banned in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Stores across Belgium removed all  
beverages of the Coca-Cola Co. from their shelves today, complying 
with a ban prompted by the hospitalizations of people who got sick 
after drinking Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	For a second straight day, poison alert centers across Belgium  
received hundreds of phone calls from people seeking information. 
Some callers said they too had become nauseous after drinking Coke 
or Coca-Cola brands. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche banned all sales  
of Coke and Coca-Cola brands such as Fanta, Sprite, Aquarius, 
Bonaqua and Minute Maid fruit juices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hard at work trying to find the cause of the  
problems,'' said Maureen O'Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola in 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola stock was down 1.5 percent, or by $1, at $63.81 1/4 a  
share at midmorning today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola has recalled its products in Belgium and said it may  
do so in the Netherlands. There have been no related reports of 
illnesses in the neighboring country but some Coca-Cola products 
made in Belgium are exported to the Netherlands, as well as to 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban was imposed in Belgium after nearly 50 people, most of  
them young people, were hospitalized Monday suffering from nausea 
after drinking Coke products. Eight remained in the hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, 31 school children fell ill after drinking Coke,  
forcing the company to recall 2.5 million bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person hospitalized showed symptoms of hemolysis,  
an excessive destruction of red blood cells that causes anemia and 
vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Health inspectors were checking the packaging of Coke products  
as well as the contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests were conducted at Coca-Cola's bottling plants in the  
cities of Antwerp and Ghent, as well as at its plant across the 
border in Dunkirk, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been working and continue to work around the clock to  
identify the reasons behind the product complaints,'' said Robert 
Baskin, a Coca-Cola spokesman in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cases appear to be isolated to Belgium, where those  
who became ill reported a foul odor on the outside of cans and 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we have are symptoms of nausea likely induced by  
the off odor,'' Baskin said, adding the company has no evidence the 
cans or products caused any ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Baskin said tests run by Coca-Cola and an independent lab found  
nothing wrong with other beverages in the same vending machines. 
Additional test results were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban comes as Belgium is still reeling from revelations that  
cancer-causing dioxin had entered the food chain through animal 
feed in recent months. That led the government to forbid sales of 
chicken, pork, beef, eggs and meat products.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial Declared in Dahmer Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -- A judge declared a mistrial today in  
the murder case of a businessman accused of taking part in the 1966 
slaying of civil rights leader Vernon Dahmer. The judge said the 
jury improperly heard a key prosecution witness mention a possible 
Ku Klux Klan-related threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys for the businessman, Charles Noble, had sought  
the mistrial after FBI informant Billy Roy Pitts testified he was 
being watched last week by a former Klansman and felt threatened 
because of his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Noble, a 56-year-old poultry company executive, is accused of  
helping a group of Klansmen firebomb Dahmer's home on Jan. 10, 
1966. The black grocer, who was severely burned and later died at a 
hospital, was targeted because he was accepting poll taxes at his 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	Noble denies that he participated in the firebombing. He was  
first tried in 1969 on federal conspiracy charges in connection 
with Dahmer's killing. That case ended in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The state case was reopened in 1991. Last May, Noble was  
indicted along with former Klan Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers and 
Deavours Nix. Bowers was convicted in August and sentenced to life 
in prison. Nix died in September before standing trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Richard McKenzie sent the jury home Monday  
afternoon after Pitts made his comment, and had said he might 
declare a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Joe Sam Owen, in asking for either a mistrial  
or outright dismissal of the charges, said asking jurors to 
disregard Pitts' comment is ``like throwing a skunk in a box and 
telling someone to disregard the smell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This man's rights have been trampled upon,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Robert Helfrich said later that  
Pitts, who also had testified against Bowers, had a right to 
discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fearful of the Klan,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pitts was released in 1971 after serving less than three years  
in prison on a federal conspiracy conviction. Last year, he spent 
about seven months in jail. Gov. Kirk Fordice suspended the state 
prison sentence last August and granted him a pardon May 21.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Baseball Pick Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Josh Hamilton, the No. 1 overall pick  
in this month's amateur draft, spent his first day in the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays' organization in a hospital bed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton became sick on a bus ride between St. Petersburg, Fla.,  
and Princeton, W.Va. The cause wasn't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to be hospitalized overnight at Princeton  
Community Hospital, a half-mile from Hunnicutt Field, where his new 
teammates took batting practice Tuesday and worked on fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's mother, Linda, and her husband, Tony, accompanied  
their son on the bus trip to be with their son on his first day as 
a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 18, was the first high school player taken with the  
first pick since Seattle selected Alex Rodriguez in 1993. He agreed 
to a $3.65 million signing bonus, the largest ever given to a 
drafted amateur player who signed with the team that selected him. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite going 18-3 as a pitcher the last two seasons, Tampa Bay  
plans to develop him as a right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Princeton Devil Rays are scheduled to begin the Class A  
Appalachian League season Friday against the Bluefield Orioles.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Schools Teach Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Respect is about to become the law in  
Louisiana's classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature is on the verge of passing Gov. Mike Foster's  
bill requiring students to address teachers and other school 
employees as ``ma'am'' or ``sir'' or use the appropriate title of 
Mr., Miss, Ms. or Mrs. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be the first such law in the nation.  
</P>
<P>
	Lest it be dismissed as a knee-jerk answer to the recent  
violence at Columbine High and other schools, the Republican 
governor stressed: ``It's something I've been thinking about for a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the bill 34-5 last month, the House 89-19  
this week. A final Senate vote on House amendments could take place 
some time before Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill leaves it up to school boards to decide the punishment,  
though the House eliminated expulsion or suspension as an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, some school systems require parents or  
students to sign codes of discipline. Some states, notably Arkansas 
and Georgia, require ``character education,'' teaching honesty, 
fairness and respect for others. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform  
in Washington, said she knows of no other such attempt to require 
respectful conversation through state law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to say this is the answer to discipline, but  
what do we have to lose?'' said the bill's Senate sponsor, Donald 
Cravins, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Many teachers and students are skeptical.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to solve our problems,'' said Mark Teal, a  
14-year teacher in the town of Sulphur. ``I believe our problems 
will be solved in the homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asia Ayman, an eighth-grader in New Orleans, said: ``Kids don't  
respect their parents at home. What makes them think they're going 
to go to school and respect their teachers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But retired teacher Jean Kennedy of New Orleans said she likes  
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with those who say you can't really legislate  
respect,'' she said, ``but I think it's a good idea to try whatever 
method there might be to raise the consciousness of students and 
parents, and this may be a way of doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would apply to kingergarten through fifth grade in the  
school year that starts this fall. Higher grades would be phased in 
one year at a time.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips, Tokyo Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Profit-taking pushed the dollar down against the  
yen Tuesday, a day after intervention by Japan's central bank 
caused the value of the U.S. currency to soar. Tokyo stocks rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.34 yen in afternoon trading, down 0.32 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
120.62 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 93.18  
points, or 0.54 percent, to finish the day at 17,282.00. On Monday, 
the index lost 9.73 points, or 0.06 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong words from Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and  
other officials that they would take action against sudden 
dollar-yen moves briefly sent the U.S. currency back up to its New 
York levels. But it soon edged back down on profit taking, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most market participants remain reluctant to take new positions  
in the wake of the Bank of Japan's aggressive dollar-buying binge 
in Monday's Asian session, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for  
international affairs, confirmed on Monday that the Bank of Japan 
intervened in the currency market to prevent an excessively fast 
strengthening of the yen, which some fear could endanger Japan's 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen is a threat to the exporters that power Japan's  
economy because it makes their goods more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.28 yen and 120.67 yen in Tuesday's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, buying by foreign investors boosted share  
prices, said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division 
at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that domestic institutional investors remained  
cautious about the direction of the economy and the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also jittery on news that South Korea had sunk  
one, and possibly two, North Korean boats in disputed waters in the 
Yellow Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Korean situation is not helping,'' said Robert Sasaki,  
head of the quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors were also refraining from big moves ahead of the  
release Wednesday of the May U.S. consumer price index, which may 
provide an indication about U.S. interest rate policy. The Federal 
Reserve has said its bias is towards tightening. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average gained  
72.82 points to close at 10,563.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.80 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,385.07. The 
TOPIX gained 0.59 points the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 584.03 million shares, down from 623.9 million shares 
Monday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 650 to 517, while 
147 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies Monday, the euro was traded at 125.04 yen,  
down from 126.49 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.5950 percent from 1.6350 percent Monday, driving its 
price up to 98.31 from 97.97.

<HEADLINE> FCC Won't Seek Broadband Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Communications  
Commission on Tuesday said cable companies should not be regulated 
as they move to offer lightning-quick Internet, phone and 
television services. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman William Kennard's views, given to a cable TV  
convention, are consistent with his previous positions. 
Nonetheless, they had been eagerly awaited in the wake of a federal 
court ruling earlier this month in which a judge said 
municipalities in Oregon can demand that AT&AMP;T Corp. sell access to 
its high-speed cable TV lines to rival Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do what you say you are going to do and embrace the  
openness of the Internet, this marketplace will explode and the 
entire country will benefit,'' Kennard told cable industry 
representatives at a convention here. ``We're going to be watching. 
We're not necessarily going to be regulating, but we will be 
watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon ruling could have precedent-setting ramifications on  
the way and speed in which Americans receive a new generation of 
digital and interactive communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies that have invested billions in laying  
``broadband'' lines capable of providing super-fast Internet 
service and handling phone calls have balked at the possibility of 
allowing slower-moving competitors such as MCIWorldCom Inc. and 
America Online Inc. to share the wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service providers say cable's refusal to let them share  
lines effectively stifles competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard suggested the judge in Oregon erred in allowing  
local governments to control the regulatory and technical standards 
that would determine rates for and access to broadband. He urged 
cable companies to come up with their own national standards -- 
while the FCC stands by as an interested party. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Information Superhighway will not work if there are 30,000  
different technical standards or 30,000 different regulatory 
structures for broadband,'' he said. ``The market would be rocked 
with uncertainty. Investment would be stymied. Consumers would be 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks echoed those a day earlier by AT&AMP;T chief executive  
C. Michael Armstrong, who said the free market would foster 
competition more effectively than regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard's remarks were welcomed by big cable companies at the  
National Cable Television Association convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like the idea of open and free,'' said Jerry Wolfer, senior  
vice president for engineering at MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you start controlling (the industry) right up front, it's  
going to take a hard road to hoe to convince anyone to make such 
deep-pocket investments when some other guy will benefit from them 
for practically free,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-based OpenNet Coalition -- a group of more than 70  
Internet providers -- predicted, however, that it would be just a 
matter of time before the FCC would be forced to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read this speech to say he's handing the cable industry a  
lot of rope and is expecting them to open up their wires on their 
own,'' said Greg Simon, co-director of the group. ``He doesn't 
support 30,000 local statutes, but I believe the federal government 
is eventually going to have to guarantee open access so local 
communities don't have to.''

<HEADLINE> NL Upholds Valentine's Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The National League upheld manager Bobby  
Valentine's two-game suspension and $5,000 fine for returning to 
the New York Mets' dugout in disguise after he was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was allowed to manage Tuesday night against the  
Cincinnati Reds. He'll miss the final day of a three-game series 
Wednesday and the opener of a series in St. Louis on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Benedict, the Mets' bench coach, will fill in for  
Valentine, who had anticipated that the suspension and fine would 
be upheld despite his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have my thoughts on it, but I'm going to keep it personal,''  
Valentine said after NL president Len Coleman made his decision 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment was a response to a caper that Valentine  
considered an attempt at levity. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was ejected in the 12th inning by plate umpire Randy  
Marsh for arguing a catcher's interference call on Mike Piazza last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager said he went into the trainer's room and came out  
with eye black on his upper lip. He showed it to a couple of his 
pitchers in the clubhouse, who laughed and then gave him sunglasses 
and a hat. 
</P>
<P>
	A television camera spotted him. Valentine insisted he never  
actually went into the dugout, but stayed in a tunnel that connects 
it with the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman handed down the punishment last Friday, but it was put  
on hold when Valentine appealed. The manager, general manager Steve 
Phillips and Coleman talked about it by phone on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine declined to discuss their conversation in detail.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I was in the tunnel,'' Valentine said.  
</P>
<P>
	When Coleman announced the penalty last Friday, he referred to a  
league rule that requires anyone ejected from a game to remain in 
the clubhouse or sit in the stands away from the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman had not yet made his decision on the appeal when  
Valentine arrived at the ballpark Tuesday afternoon. Valentine said 
he didn't think their conversation would change anything, and he 
was waiting to hear from Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sitting in the manager's office in a black Mets T-shirt  
and blue shorts, a pair of sanitary socks wrapped around his neck, 
talking about starter Rick Reed's ailment when the phone rang at 
4:45 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Phillips relaying Coleman's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``OK. So this is the announcement?'' Valentine told Phillips.  
``Super. Thank you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was surprised by the outcome, Valentine simply said,  
``No.'' He said he had agreed not to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who was scheduled to start Tuesday night, developed what  
was believed to be a urinary infection or a kidney stone and got 
treatment on Monday night. He was feeling better Tuesday afternoon, 
but Valentine was prepared to go to reliever Allen Watson if he 
faltered early.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Continues Redemption Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell donned a pair of designer  
sunglasses Tuesday for his mandatory interview session on the eve 
of the NBA Finals. The shades, his effort to ``look cute,'' had 
yellow-tinted lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of brightens up a cloudy day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On this day, it wasn't just the rare rainy weather in San  
Antonio that made it somewhat gloomy for Sprewell. It was having to 
go through another round of hearing the same questions about his 
attack on P.J. Carlesimo, his long suspension from the NBA and his 
efforts to rehabilitate his image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I enjoy it?'' he asked of the endless scrutiny. ``Well, I'm  
getting better at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has been the most accessible of the Knicks this season  
in an effort to undue the damage he caused with his infamous attack 
on Carlesimo, his former coach, in December 1997, which led to the 
longest non-drug-related suspension in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost 30 minutes, Sprewell stood beneath one of the baskets  
at the Alamodome and politely answered questions about his new 
team, the Knicks; his old team, the Warriors; and the team he was 
almost traded to, the San Antonio Spurs -- who also happen to be his 
opponent in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 is Wednesday night at 9 p.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	Back at the start of the 1997-98 season, the Spurs and Warriors  
were close to making a three-way trade that would have sent 
Sprewell to San Antonio. So close, in fact, that Sprewell actually 
yelled something to the effect of ``Pull the trigger, Pop'' at 
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich during a Warriors-Spurs game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking I was going to be here in '97, but it didn't  
happen. But there was a very good chance it was going to happen,'' 
Sprewell said. ``It was very close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days later, with the deal still pending, Sprewell attacked  
Carlesimo during practice, wrapping his hands around the coach's 
neck and threatening to kill him. He then stormed upstairs to 
general manager Garry St. Jean's office, loudly reiterated his 
trade demand, went back downstairs and tried to go after Carlesimo 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	It led to a 68-game suspension, the loss of millions in salary  
and his eventual trade to the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	What if that San Antonio trade had happened?  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have had to go through all that,'' he said of the  
attack and suspension. ``But then I wouldn't be as popular as I am 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Sprewell's popularity is at its peak, especially in New  
York. 
</P>
<P>
	His new sneaker commercial was broadcast during every Knicks  
telecast, with Sprewell reading a script pronouncing himself ``The 
American Dream'' to a soundtrack of Jimi Hendrix's version of ``The 
Star-Spangled Banner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His moves are imitated on playgrounds, his hairstyle -- although  
cornrows are still far from becoming mainstream -- is being copied 
by kids and adults alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a tendency to forgive and forget as time goes  
along, and I think that has been the case with me,'' Sprewell said. 
``I think New Yorkers were great from day one. In other cities I 
maybe would have had to win the fans over through time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's no doubt that a big part of Sprewell's public acceptance  
in New York has been because of the success of the Knicks, who had 
one of the unlikeliest playoff runs imaginable. They beating Miami, 
Atlanta and Indiana and have overcome a season-ending injury to 
Patrick Ewing, a major starting lineup change and an injury to 
forward Larry Johnson in the final game against Indiana. They enter 
the finals with the public believing they have little chance 
against the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they are the dominant team and we're the underdogs,''  
Sprewell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome Kersey of the Spurs was a teammate of Sprewell for one  
season with Golden State, and he, too, was involved in a fight with 
Sprewell during practice in which he reportedly tried to go after 
Kersey with a 2-by-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players refused Tuesday to discuss the exact details of  
that altercation, although they said some aspects of it were 
inaccurately reported. Both also said they hold no grudges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're cool,'' Kersey said. ``He could walk in here right now  
and we'd shake hands. And I'm not just blowing smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell remains friends with Spurs point guard Avery Johnson,  
who spent one season with Golden State, and is so close to 
Popovich, who was an assistant with the Warriors, that he used the 
word ``love'' to describe their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of lessons I've learned,'' Sprewell said.  
``The thing I learned the most is ... you really find out who your 
friends are when you're going through tough times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was never really clear why the Spurs and Warriors didn't pull  
off a Sprewell trade, but San Antonio chairman Peter Holt was known 
to be skittish about bringing in a player with a bad reputation. 
The Spurs had tried it with Dennis Rodman in 1995, and his stay in 
San Antonio was a tumultuous one. 
</P>
<P>
	``To each his own, you know. But I'm totally not like Rodman.  
He's a little more wild than I am,'' Sprewell said. ``I'm happy 
where I'm at. Things worked out for me, things worked out for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they really don't know me as a person, so they came up  
with their own ideas about the way I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lots of people did that with Sprewell, which is why he stood  
there as patiently as possible Tuesday and tried to change a few 
more minds.

<HEADLINE>  Coke Products Banned in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Stores across Belgium removed all  
beverages of the Coca-Cola Co. from their shelves today, complying 
with a ban prompted by the hospitalizations of people who got sick 
after drinking Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	For a second straight day, poison alert centers across Belgium  
received hundreds of phone calls from people seeking information. 
Some callers said they too had become nauseous after drinking Coke 
or Coca-Cola brands. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche banned all sales  
of Coke and Coca-Cola brands such as Fanta, Sprite, Aquarius, 
Bonaqua and Minute Maid fruit juices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hard at work trying to find the cause of the  
problems,'' said Maureen O'Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola in 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola stock was down 1.5 percent, or by $1, at $63.81 1/4 a  
share at midmorning today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola has recalled its products in Belgium and said it may  
do so in the Netherlands. There have been no related reports of 
illnesses in the neighboring country but some Coca-Cola products 
made in Belgium are exported to the Netherlands, as well as to 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban was imposed in Belgium after nearly 50 people, most of  
them young people, were hospitalized Monday suffering from nausea 
after drinking Coke products. Eight remained in the hospital today. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, 31 school children fell ill after drinking Coke,  
forcing the company to recall 2.5 million bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person hospitalized showed symptoms of hemolysis,  
an excessive destruction of red blood cells that causes anemia and 
vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Health inspectors were checking the packaging of Coke products  
as well as the contents. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests were conducted at Coca-Cola's bottling plants in the  
cities of Antwerp and Ghent, as well as at its plant across the 
border in Dunkirk, France. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been working and continue to work around the clock to  
identify the reasons behind the product complaints,'' said Robert 
Baskin, a Coca-Cola spokesman in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cases appear to be isolated to Belgium, where those  
who became ill reported a foul odor on the outside of cans and 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we have are symptoms of nausea likely induced by  
the off odor,'' Baskin said, adding the company has no evidence the 
cans or products caused any ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Baskin said tests run by Coca-Cola and an independent lab found  
nothing wrong with other beverages in the same vending machines. 
Additional test results were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban comes as Belgium is still reeling from revelations that  
cancer-causing dioxin had entered the food chain through animal 
feed in recent months. That led the government to forbid sales of 
chicken, pork, beef, eggs and meat products.

<HEADLINE> How Watergate Affected Presidencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Because of the Watergate scandal, Jimmy Carter  
set a high public moral standard that ``came back to haunt me'' 
when his administration fell short. After Watergate, George Bush 
saw a ``frenzy of sleaze'' and cynicism develop in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents, like the public, have had to live with the sour  
legacy of a scandal that brought down one of their own 25 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,'' by  
Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, himself of Watergate fame, 
some of those presidents talked about what it meant to lead in a 
climate where respect for politicians seemed to vanish. The book 
went on sale Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who won election promising ``I'll never lie to you,''  
lost budget director Bert Lance in an early tempest over Lance's 
personal finances, then faced a special prosecutor's investigation 
into whether chief of staff Hamilton Jordan had used cocaine at a 
disco. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was cleared, but Carter said the episode took a toll.  
``It was much more serious because of my claiming the high moral 
ground than it would have been if I had not ever raised the subject 
that I'm more filled with integrity than others,'' he says in the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it cut both ways,'' he said. ``It helped me get elected,  
but it also came back to haunt me later on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Watergate, Woodward and fellow reporter Carl  
Bernstein became an inspiration to a rising generation of 
investigative journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, in a letter to Woodward declining to be interviewed, said  
Watergate and the Vietnam War created an ``intrusive, 'take no 
prisoners' kind of reporting that I can now say I find offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new young cynical breed wants to emulate you,'' he wrote.  
But many ... question the word and the integrity of all in 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writing in February 1998 as the Monica Lewinsky scandal was  
breaking, Bush criticized a ``frenzy of sleaze and alleged tawdry 
behavior'' and a media culture that treats people as guilty unless 
proven innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush dealt with fallout from the Iran-Contra affair that dogged  
Ronald Reagan before him. Then he watched with fury as the personal 
life of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was made public 
fodder. 
</P>
<P>
	The book recounts another struggle, this one behind the scenes,  
involving Supreme Court Justice David Souter. It says Souter tried 
to withdraw his nomination when the press began speculating about 
his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had known how vicious this process is I wouldn't have let  
you propose my nomination,'' Souter is quoted as telling his friend 
and sponsor, then-Sen. Warren Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
	Souter tried to use the phone in Rudman's apartment to call Bush  
and withdraw his name, the book says, but the senator grabbed him 
and wouldn't let him call. The standoff lasted for hours until 
Souter agreed at 3 a.m. to hang in. The Senate later solidly 
confirmed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the most immediate and yet the most lasting impact of  
Watergate was on the president who succeeded and pardoned Richard 
Nixon. Even now Gerald Ford faces questions about whether the 
pardon was the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he hadn't tried harder to get Nixon to admit  
wrongdoing, Ford pulled out a dog-eared paper that he has carried 
around for years to answer critics. It was from an old Supreme 
Court decision suggesting that someone who accepts a pardon is 
also, in a sense, acknowledging guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was always very reassuring to me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who takes up over half the book, declined to  
be interviewed. Reagan's health did not permit an interview. 
Woodward frequently quotes private conversations among officials, 
using unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bush's letter expressed suspicion about that technique.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I read books by today's new school journalists I see my  
name in direct quotes, words in my mouth I never uttered,'' he 
wrote. ``I talked to our publisher at Knopf about this method. 
'Literary License,' says he. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't like it.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Station Owners Sue Oil Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three major gasoline companies are trying to  
push independent service stations out of business by conspiring to 
fix prices, according to a lawsuit filed by a group of California 
station owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court contends  
Shell Oil Co., Texaco Inc. and Saudi Refining Inc. have tried to 
use joint marketing agreements to fix prices while raising rents 
and the wholesale price dealers must pay for gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, the owners contend, is to replace small independents  
with bigger company-owned stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Company representatives said the allegations were false.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that prices have been fixed since 1996  
through joint refining and marketing ventures established by the 
companies. It seeks unspecified damages and to have the joint 
ventures dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a straight, old-fashioned price-fixing agreement,'' said  
Joseph Alioto, the attorney for 39 dealers named as plaintiffs in 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past 18 months, the prices dealers have paid for gas  
have risen between 25 cents and 55 cents per gallon, said Tom 
Bleau, co-counsel for the 39 dealers named as plaintiffs in the 
suit. Over the same period, the price in the gasoline futures 
market has declined by more than 4 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Rent increases have ranged from 30 percent to 100 percent, Bleau  
said. An independent dealer rents a gas station location from an 
oil company, but owns the business itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies refine and market gasoline in the eastern  
United States through Houston-based Motiva Enterprises LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco and Shell refine and market in the West and Midwest  
through a separate firm, Equilon Enterprises LLC, also based in 
Houston. Saudi Refining is not part of Equilon. 
</P>
<P>
	A third company, Equiva Services, provides various services to  
Motiva and Equilon. The three ventures also were named in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of Equilon, Motiva and Equiva was done for  
legitimate business reasons,'' said Andy Norman, a spokesman for 
Texaco. ``It was totally proper and the formation of those 
companies has led to a number of efficiencies in our ... 
operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of the ventures was the subject of an investigation by  
the Federal Trade Commission and attorney generals in several 
states where the companies operate. No wrongdoing was found, Norman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Equilon issued a statement calling the allegations preposterous.  
Calls to the other defendants were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, dealers contend their rents and prices were raised  
soon after the joint ventures began. As a result, they have had to 
sell gasoline at uncompetitive prices, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Small stations, whether independent or company owned, have  
struggled to sell enough gasoline to stay open, but ``these are 
market forces. They're not collusion,'' said Bill Berman, publisher 
of The Pump Price Report, a weekly survey of gasoline prices and 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not intentional efforts by the refiners or  
wholesalers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas station business has grown increasingly difficult in  
recent years. The number of service stations in the United States 
has dropped sharply during the past five years, from 202,800 to 
177,800, according to a survey by National Petroleum News, a trade 
magazine. The survey did not include separate numbers for 
independent dealers.

<HEADLINE> Tiger's Patience May Help at Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Tiger Woods will be able to pull out the  
driver on the relatively forgiving fairways at Pinehurst No. 2. 
He'll chip with a delicate and effective 3-wood around the famed 
domed greens. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes Woods a favorite to win his first U.S. Open, though,  
may be the quality those who run the Open cherish most: a newfound 
patience born of past Open disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned from my own mistakes,'' Woods said before a  
practice round Tuesday. ``Most importantly of all is I'm not afraid 
to go out on the golf course and apply what I've learned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a course that sets up perfectly for his game and on a streak  
that could renew the Tigermania of his rookie season, Woods seems 
filled with a quiet confidence as he tries to win his first major 
since the Masters two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His chances were good even before David Duval burned himself  
last week. They may be even better now that the U.S. Golf 
Association decided to trim the rough to a more manageable three 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the rough would be higher, the fairways be  
narrower,'' Woods said. ``The golf course is playing a little more 
friendly than I thought it would. I like it a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off two straight victories capped by a dazzling  
short-game show on the final day of the Memorial, Woods believes he 
is now playing the best golf of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	That's mostly credited to increasing maturity at age 23 and a  
series of swing changes he and instructor Butch Harmon made to help 
him control the ball better without sacrificing distance off the 
tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I do miss it, it's not two fairways over like it used to  
be,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who rarely used his driver at Olympic in last year's  
Open, will have ample opportunity to take it out the bag at 
Pinehurst, where the fairways will hold a drive and the rough isn't 
deep enough to prevent shots to the green. 
</P>
<P>
	That will help set up short iron shots that Woods can fly in  
higher than other players. That, in turn, makes it easier for him 
to attack pins on greens where ball placement is critical if a 
player expects his ball to stay on the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course from tee to green is very simple,'' Woods  
said. ``It's around the green where it becomes complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More important than tinkering with his swing, though, may be an  
adjustment in attitude to a tournament that tends to reward more 
methodical golfers who play the ball down the middle and have a 
light touch around the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first U.S. Open as a pro, Woods stubbornly kept trying to  
hack the ball out of the deep rough lining the fairways at 
Congressional. In his second, he was too aggressive on the greens 
at the Olympic Club, knocking putts way past the hole and 
four-putting twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Making birdies in a tournament in which the winner has never  
been more than 8-under is not as important as avoiding the double 
bogeys that wait at every turn. Woods has had his share of those, 
pushing his scores to a combined 34-over-par in 13 Open rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still learning how to play the game,'' Woods said. ``I  
recognize that. But I've come a long way as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, a key to Woods' success this week might not be his  
length or his iron play. 
</P>
<P>
	It may come from a shot he uses that few other players attempt --  
a 3-wood from around the fringes of the green that pops up a bit 
more than a putter, then rolls along the green. 
</P>
<P>
	If Woods has confidence in the shot, that could be critical. On  
Tuesday, players hit irons of all shapes and sizes as well as 
putters from shaved areas off the green in attempts to figure out 
what would work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rarely ever practice the shot, really,'' Woods said. ``But  
this week I am because I'm going to use it a little bit more.''

<HEADLINE> Serbian Church Wants Milosevic Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The influential Serbian Orthodox  
Church today demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Holy Synod, the church's highest body, insisted that the  
ouster of Milosevic and his government was ``in the interest of the 
people and their salvation.'' The church is the most prominent Serb 
institution to call for Milosevic to step down since NATO began 
airstrikes March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every sensible person has to realize that numerous internal  
problems and ... the isolation of our country on the international 
scene, cannot be solved or overcome with this kind of government 
and under the present circumstances,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the church's holiest sites are in Kosovo and the church  
is concerned that the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from the 
province, and the accompanying exodus of Serbs, will leave the 
sites unprotected from vandalism by mostly Muslim ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The church called for immediate protection of Serb Orthodox  
shrines and monasteries throughout Kosovo, including the ancient 
seat of the Serb Church in the town of Pec in western Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's statement struck a defiant note in referring to the  
international war crimes tribunal's indictment of Milosevic, saying 
the church is ``convinced that the final justice is with our Lord 
and not in the hands of an instrumentalized court in The Hague.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church expressed deep concern about the flight of Serbs from  
Kosovo and called for international troops to protect Serbs as well 
as the ethnic Albanian refugees, who began returning to Kosovo 
after Milosevic agreed to a peace deal last week. 
</P>
<P>
	It issued an appeal to Kosovo's Serbs urging them to ``remain on  
their ancient homesteads and not abandon their shrines, convinced 
of the truth in Christ's words: 'Salvation shall come to the 
steadfast'.''

<HEADLINE> USDA Sends Aid To Pork Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog producers who are recovering from last  
year's plunge in pork prices will get a second round of payments 
from the government of up to $5,000 per farmer, Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The checks will total $125 million. The Agriculture Department  
handed out $50 million in similar payments earlier this year, and 
was authorized by Congress last month to provide up to $245 million 
in additional assistance. It was left up to USDA to decide how much 
to spend and how to distribute it. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork producers ``have suffered extreme difficulty. This will  
help them, certainly,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork prices fell to 8 cents a pound in December, well below the  
production cost of about 40 cents a pound. On Tuesday, hogs were 
selling in Minnesota and Iowa for 33.5 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in pork prices has mirrored a general downturn in the  
farm economy that resulted from a worldwide glut in grain and other 
commodities. On Tuesday, farm-state Democrats tried unsuccessfully 
to add $6.4 billion in general farm aid to a Senate subcommittee's 
version of USDA's fiscal 2000 budget. The proposal failed on a 
party-line 6-5 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tens of thousands of farmers and their families are losing  
their livelihood and their life savings,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa. ``I'm telling you it is a bad situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate  
agricultural appropriations subcommittee, said the Clinton 
administration should take the lead and propose an aid package of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing and ready to discuss with the administration,''  
Cochran said. ``We've heard nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman later declined to comment on whether the administration  
would make such a request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do believe there will in all likelihood be the need for  
additional assistance. I can't tell you what it will be or in what 
amounts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House voted Tuesday to give Congress more  
oversight over trade sanctions that inhibit exports of farm 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Selective Agricultural Embargoes Act, which passed by voice  
vote, would require the president to submit a report to Congress 
within five days of imposing a selective embargo on agricultural 
goods. If Congress disapproved, the embargo would cease 100 days 
after the date of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The pork payments will be distributed to farmers in the next  
month, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman is targeting the money to small and medium-sized farms  
by capping the amount an individual farmer can get at $5,000. He 
said the payments would cover 96 percent of hog farms and 41 
percent of the hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said USDA should be handing out the  
``lion's share'' of the $245 million that Congress authorized. 
``Hog farming has been ravaged by a financial catastrophe,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Pork Producers Council was not critical.  
``Certainly the need exists, but we understand there are other 
commodities that suffered losses during the year,'' said Steve 
Cohen, a spokesman for the group.

<HEADLINE> Abbott Gets First Major League Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jim Abbott got his first major league hit, a  
fifth-inning single to left field in the Milwaukee Brewers' game 
against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score tied at 1 and runners on first and second, Abbott  
lined the first pitch from Jon Lieber just over the reach of 
shortstop Jose Hernandez. Sean Berry scored from second for 
Abbott's first RBI, but Sammy Sosa threw out Geoff Jenkins at third 
base to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago argued unsuccessfully with umpire Charlie Williams that  
the run should not have counted because Berry had not touched home 
plate before Jenkins was tagged out. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who was born without a right hand, was in his 14th  
at-bat and 18th plate appearance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He struck out in the second inning and flied to left in the  
sixth, leaving his season average at .067 (1-for-15). He also has 
three sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott, who before this year played exclusively in the American  
League, didn't bat in a regular-season game until joining the 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 1-for-4 during spring training this year with two  
groundouts, a flyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Balancing the bat with his right arm, he singled off Seattle's  
Butch Henry in spring training on March 10 -- his third career hit 
in spring training. On March 28, 1992, he singled for the Yankees 
off Florida's Mike Myers. and on March 18, 1991, he tripled for the 
Angels against San Francisco's Rick Reuschel. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott played in the American League with California, New York  
and Chicago from 1989-98. He was out of baseball in 1997 and played 
late in the 1998 season with the White Sox.

<HEADLINE> Dumars Becomes a Pistons' VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Joe Dumars wasn't ready to leave the  
Detroit Pistons after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, who recently retired as an active player after 14 years  
in the NBA -- all with Detroit -- joined the club's front office 
staff Tuesday as vice president of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars will result Rick Sund, the Pistons' executive vice  
president and general manager. Together, they will deal with free 
agent recruiting and acquisition, player trades and the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not after the GM's job,'' Dumars said. ``I would always  
want to work with somebody else. That's why having Rick is perfect 
for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars also has no interest in becoming a coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never,'' he said emphatically. ``Coaching doesn't appeal to  
me, and never has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sund, who joined the organization in 1995 at the urging of  
then-coach Doug Collins, will continue to oversee the scouting 
department and all administrative aspects of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had a good relationship with Rick,'' Dumars said,  
smiling. ``I remind him every day that he didn't draft me when he 
was in Dallas (in 1985).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sund will have final say in everything, said Tom Wilson, the  
team's president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is very comfortable with that,'' Wilson said. ``In fact,  
he wanted it that way. There was no jealousy on the part of either 
Rick or Joe. This is what they both wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look around the NBA, a lot of teams are going to a  
two-man setup just like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, who has business interests outside of basketball, said  
his only hesitation in taking the job was making sure he could find 
the time to do it right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Busy people seem to find ways,'' Dumars said. ``I'm sure I can  
make everything fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a big job, and the first year could be daunting.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pistons, who already were thin in the backcourt even before  
Dumars retired, have no first-round draft pick, and no room under 
the NBA's salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation to come in under,'' Dumars said. ``You  
can't script it. But, I believe that we can still get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, 36, played 38 games during the lockout-shortened 1999  
season, helping the Pistons into the Eastern Conference playoffs 
for the third time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the years, you build up an affinity for the organization  
you've played for,'' Dumars said. ``Pride is a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 14 years in Detroit gave him more tenure than any other  
player in Pistons history and his 1,018 regular season games played 
rank him first on the team's career list. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a key in the Pistons' NBA championships in 1989 and 1990,  
and earned the Most Valuable Player Award in the 1989 finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars played in six All-Star games. He was All-NBA Second Team  
once and All-NBA Third Team twice.

	One Dead in Mexico Earthquake  
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook a large swath of  
central Mexico today, killing at least one person, injuring 
hundreds, damaging historic buildings and sending residents fleeing 
into the streets as buildings swayed. The first reports of 
significant damage from the quake, measured at a preliminary 
magnitude 6.7, were in the city of Puebla, about 60 miles east of 
Mexico City. One person died and about 200 were wounded, said Dr. 
Alejandro Soto, director of the Puebla city Red Cross.

	Serbs Leaving Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The roads leading northward out of  
Kosovo were packed today with Serbs -- either Yugoslav soldiers 
departing under terms of the peace deal or civilians frightened of 
retaliatory attacks for the bloody ethnic violence. Serbian police 
were supposed to vacate their headquarters complex in central 
Pristina by midnight. Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, a spokesman for the 
allied force, said: ``We have every indication that the deadline of 
midnight tonight will be met.'' A more complete assessment would 
not be available until daylight Wednesday. All Serb forces must be 
out of Kosovo by Sunday night

	Cohen To Meet Russian Counterpart

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen spoke to his  
Russian counterpart today in preparation for a longer face-to-face 
meeting in Finland tomorrow, a Pentagon spokesman said. Cohen hopes 
to defuse the standoff between NATO troops and about 200 Russians 
who have occupied the Pristina airfield since Saturday. While 
insisting that Russia is welcome to help keep peace in Kosovo now 
that the Serb forces are leaving, NATO has so far refused to cede a 
separate patrol zone to Russia. A second column of Russian troops 
arrived in Kosovo on Tuesday. Though the column is small -- 29 
soldiers, according to NATO -- its arrival could increase the 
tension between Russia and the alliance.

	Britain: Suspend Iraq's Sanctions

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Britain is now recommending that the

Baghdad answers the remaining questions about its banned weapons 
programs. The new British position leaves the United States alone 
among permanent members of the Security Council in opposing the 
suspension or lifting of sanctions. Britain is conditioning the 
suspension on the creation of financial controls to prevent Iraq 
from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, according to a draft 
resolution circulated today.

Senate leadership and President Clinton for an act of defiance in 
1955. The seamstress, tired after a day's work in Montgomery, Ala., 
refused to give up her seat to a white man on a segregated city 
bus. Her arrest set off a bus boycott that lasted about a year 
until the Supreme Court declared Montgomery's bus segregation law 
unconstitutional.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will leave tonight for  
Europe to consult with other leaders on a costly plan to rebuild 
war-torn Kosovo and other trouble-plagued nations of southeast 
Europe. European nations will bear the largest share of the 
financial burden of rebuilding, Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright said, because the United States absorbed the heaviest cost 
of the 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. But Clinton has

birth when she was apparently choked by her umbilical cord. A 
lawyer for 12-year-old Gaelle Prindilus says the girl has cerebral

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Fetters To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Orioles right-handed reliever Mike Fetters will  
have elbow surgery to remove bone spurs from his pitching elbow and 
will miss six to eight weeks, Baltimore general manager Frank Wren 
said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lewis Yocum will operate in California later this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know more once the surgeons know exactly what they've  
found,'' Wren said. ``There are spurs in there they want to take 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fetters, signed to a minor-league contract during the offseason,  
made the team out of spring training and was 1-0 with a 5.48 ERA in 
20 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	He injured his elbow on June 6 and was placed on the 15-day  
disabled list the next day. Fetters sought a second opinion after 
an examination by team orthopedist Dr. Michael Jacobs, and was 
re-evaluated by Yocum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles will delay moving Fetters to the 60-day disabled  
list pending the outcome of the surgery.

<HEADLINE> UC Irvine Settling Fertility Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- The University of California is paying $20  
million to settle all but a few of the lawsuits tied to its 
fertility clinic scandal at its Irvine campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount includes four settlements to be considered when the  
regents meet on Thursday in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases involve allegations that two UCI physicians misused or  
lost embryos and eggs from dozens of couples who went to their 
clinics from 1986 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, eggs and embryos were given secretly to other  
couples, or used for research. Eggs of some women were taken 
without their consent and implanted in other women, some of whom 
had babies. 
</P>
<P>
	The university has acknowledged 46 eggs and embryos were  
transferred without donor consent, said Byron Beam, the school's 
attorney. It also has admitted that a dozen births occurred using 
eggs pirated unknowingly from women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other cases remain pending, though they could be settled as  
early as fall. Case settlements are averaging $184,000.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Eyes Indian Tribe Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With the cost of providing medicines to the poor rising  
dramatically, the state of Connecticut is considering an unusual 
alliance with a wealthy Indian tribe which uses its status as a 
sovereign nation to beat the drug prices of health maintenance 
organizations and pharmacy chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mashantucket Pequots, who made a fortune in casino gambling,  
have a side business in called the Pequot Pharmacy Network, which 
has provided many Connecticut employers and group insurers with 
prescription drugs since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	As a federally recognized tribe, the Pequots have access to a  
federal pricing schedule for pharmaceuticals that is lower than 
that offered to health maintenance organizations and local and 
chain drug stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we met with the Pequots, they described their purchasing  
power and ... their ability to attain the lowest possible price,'' 
said Michael Starkowski, deputy commissioner of the state 
Department of Social Services. ``They described to us a pricing 
schedule that would be 40 to 50 percent less than what we would be 
paying otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature last week mandated that the department  
reduce its pharmaceutical expenditures by $21 million. Department 
officials anticipate a cost of $226 million this year for Medicaid 
pharmaceuticals. Negotiations between the state and the Pequots 
could begin in the next few weeks, Starkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision would affect about 85,000 elderly and disabled  
Medicaid patients in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pequots Pharmaceutical Network currently dispenses more than  
1,700 prescriptions per day with the assistance of a robot that 
handles about 225 of the most commonly prescribed drugs. The 
network ships out by mail-order about 1,500 prescriptions per day, 
while about 225 are picked up by tribal members or tribal employees 
at a pharmacy on the tribe's reservation in Ledyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, Medicaid patients would still go to a local  
pharmacy to pick up their prescriptions, but the pharmacists would 
only get a handling fee because the medicine is actually just 
shipped to the store from the Pequot Network. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Tuesday he is  
reviewing whether the agreement would be legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a slew of legal questions that have to be  
answered,'' Blumenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal said that what concerns him most is the idea that the  
tribe's sovereignty could allow it to claim immunity for mistakes 
or other issues of liability in the sale of the pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the tribe already has liability insurance and the  
Department of Social Services would purchase liability insurance 
separately to answer such questions, Starkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Grayson, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and  
Manufacturers of America, an industry group in Washington, D.C., 
said the state should not have to circumvent manufacturers, 
pharmacies and HMOs in order to save money and that the deal would 
give consumers fewer options. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state is trying to find some easy out,'' Grayson said.  
``It seems to us that it would be better for the state, rather than 
to try to find a loophole in the law, to work within the existing 
statutes.''

<HEADLINE> Seattle Gives Up on Pitcher Suzuki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners have given up on  
right-hander Mac Suzuki, the third Japanese-born player to play in 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners on Tuesday designated Suzuki, 24, for assignment.  
They have 10 days to trade him, release him or send him outright to 
the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki last pitched for the Mariners in Saturday night's 15-11  
loss to San Francisco. In one inning, he gave up three runs on two 
hits and two walks, leaving him with a 9.43 ERA in 42 innings 
during 16 games, including four starts. He was 0-2 with 32 
strikeouts and 34 walks this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In parts of three seasons with the Mariners, Suzuki went 1-4  
with an 8.78 ERA in nine starts and 14 relief appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki, from Kobe, Japan, was signed by the Mariners as a free  
agent on Sept. 5, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he became the first Japanese-born pitcher to play in  
the majors without starting his career in Japan's professional 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two Japanese-born players to play in the majors also  
were pitchers: Masanori Murakami with the San Francisco Giants in 
1964-65 and Hideo Nomo with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki spent most of last season at Triple-A Tacoma, going 9-10  
with a 4.37 ERA in 28 games and 21 starts. In 131 2-3 innings, he 
had 117 strikeouts and 70 walks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners recalled right-hander Melvin Bunch from Triple-A  
Tacoma of the Pacific Coast League. Bunch, 27, was 4-1 with a 3.91 
ERA in nine games.

	U.S. Group Wins Brit Defense Deal  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A consortium led by the U.S. defense contractor  
Raytheon has won a $1.3 billion contract for an airborne radar 
system for the British military, the Ministry of Defense said 
Tuesday. Although the Airborne Stand-Off Radar System -- or ASTOR -- 
will be developed, produced and serviced by the Raytheon 
consortium, all of the contract value will be with British firms 
and its project management team will be located here, Defense 
Secretary George Robertson said. The deal will create or sustain 
2,500 jobs in Britain, Robertson said. The team headed by Raytheon, 
based in Lexington, Mass., includes Short Brothers, Motorola U.K. 
Ltd., GEC Marconi Avionics and Marshall SV. Raytheon stock was up 2

	Hong Kong May Call Y2K Holiday  
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong thinks its computers will be able to  
avoid ``millennium bug'' problems but, to stay on the safe side, 
the government wants to make the last day of 1999 a holiday. The 
government said that shutting down banks and other businesses that 
rely heavily on computers would avoid possible complications as the 
year changes. The holiday was suggested by Hong Kong's Association 
of Bankers, whose members say an extra day off ahead of 2000 will 
give them time to wind up all their end-of-the-year accounting. 
``This would ensure that all the relevant records are accurate and 
complete after the millennium occurs,'' said Rebecca Lai, Hong 
Kong's deputy secretary for financial services.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as Internet shares  
rebounded from yesterday's sharp losses and the bond market 
continued its own recovery. Just before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones 
industrial average was up 92.13 at 10,655.46. Broader stock 
indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite index was up 
28.76 at 2,427.07. Bonds rose for a second consecutive day largely 
on the strength of the dollar against the yen. The benchmark 
30-year bond, which had its first two-day gain in three weeks 
yesterday, had a yield of 6.07 percent today, down from 6.17 
percent Friday. Internet stocks, some of which have seen their 
prices fall in half since April, were recovering today. America 
Online was up 2 3/8 at 92 7/8, Amazon.com rose 4 to 96 and Yahoo! was up 
5 at 124 1/4. But analysts said they still expect the correction in 
Internet issues to continue.

distributing Microsoft's Internet software during their secret $10 
billion negotiations last fall to buy Netscape Communications Corp. 
AOL Chairman Steve Case wondered whether Microsoft might not 
retaliate ``given current antitrust attention'' if AOL switched its 
nearly 17 million subscribers to Netscape's browser, suggesting 
that the software giant might be intimidated into inaction by the 
government's legal case. But AOL's president and chief operating

Yokich acknowledged that many UAW members have become used to 
working the kind of overtime that can boost their wages well above

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Airbus Expect Plane Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- Boeing Co. said Tuesday that it  
expects to take an order next month for as many as 100 of its 
latest model of 737 airliners. Its main rival -- Airbus Industrie of 
Europe -- said it anticipates selling an additional 23 aircraft of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies announced the commitments from potential  
buyers at the Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	International Lease Finance Corp. plans to order 50 Boeing 737s  
in July and will consider ordering another 50 at an unspecified 
future date, ILFC chief executive Steven Udvar-Hazy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but International Lease  
didn't pay the list price, Udvar-Hazy said. The list price for the 
first 50 planes would total at least $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	International Lease plans to order mostly 737-700s and 737-800s.  
Deliveries are to start in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate deal, Boeing said that Korean Air, a South Korean  
airline, has ordered a batch of 747-400 cargo planes with 
deliveries set for May and June of next year. It didn't disclose 
terms of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Airbus said it expects to sell 20 A320 airliners  
and three A321s to Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise in a deal 
valued at more than $1 billion. The Asian firm had already placed 
firm orders for 18 Airbus planes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to make Airbus more competitive with Boeing,  
ministers from France, Germany, Italy and Spain have asked members 
of the four-nation consortium to prepare a plan by the summer to 
transform the enterprise into a joint-stock company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The creation of the single corporate entity is vital for the  
restructuring of the European aerospace industry,'' French 
Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The four ministers said it would be easier for them to provide  
Airbus with financial support to develop the ``super jumbo'' A3XX 
once it becomes a regular private company. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus comprises Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG, Spain's  
Construcciones Aeronauticas, France's Aerospatiale Matra SA and 
British Aerospace PLC. The German and Spanish partners announced 
plans on Friday to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Raytheon Co. was selected as the preferred bidder  
for a $1.29 billion Airborne Stand-Off Radar surveillance system 
for the British Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon bid together with the Marconi defense unit of Britain's  
General Electric Co. PLC. The team beat out rival bids by teams 
including Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp.

<HEADLINE> Robin Leach Under Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Investigators are looking into allegations that  
TV host Robin Leach and six young women were involved in a night of 
revelry at a Las Vegas steakhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach, the former host of ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,''  
said the May 31 party at The Venetian's Delmonico Steakhouse was 
nothing more than a harmless food fight. 
</P>
<P>
	A restaurant employee said the women with Leach stripped and  
spread whipped cream and chocolate sauce on their bodies while 
dining in a glass-enclosed room, the Las Vegas Review-Journal 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clark County business license agency is investigating. The  
newly opened restaurant's liquor license is potentially at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach, who was hired as a consultant by the Venetian resort,  
characterized the charge Monday as a ``gross exaggeration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a private party held in a private room and no  
restaurant patrons were offended, shocked or walked out,'' the 
57-year-old Leach said. ``No sexual acts in any manner or form took 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Business license investigators learned of the alleged incident  
after the employee complained to representatives of Culinary Local 
226. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is trying to organize workers at the hotel, and Leach  
suggested union officials were using the report to discredit the 
resort. The union denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Internet Porn Biz Owner Eyes Caesars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A company that claims to run the world's  
largest online sex site says it has offered $3.6 billion to buy 
several Caesars casinos in the United States and abroad to get into 
the gambling business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that owns Caesars says it's never heard of the  
purported bidder, Ocean Fund International, and neither has the 
company that is supposed to buy Caesars hotel-casinos later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We characterize that as bizarre and we underscore the word  
bizarre,'' said Jason Ader, a gambling industry analyst for Bear 
Stearns &AMP; Co. ``Our advice to investors is to dismiss this as so 
much noise. It's not likely to have much credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean Fund International, which owns the Sex.com Web site and  
describes itself as a British Virgin Island mutual fund, said it 
wants to buy Caesars casinos as well as some nongambling 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	A news release from Ocean Fund said Sex.com boasts over 9  
million members who pay $24.95 a month for access to its Internet 
site, which displays sex videos and pictures. Dow Jones Newswires 
reported Ocean Fund is not registered as a mutual fund in the 
British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place Entertainment Corp. has reached an agreement to buy  
Caesars casino-hotels from Starwood Hotels and Resorts for $3 
billion and said the deal is scheduled to close in the fourth 
quarter. It said it did not plan to respond to the unsolicited 
offer from Ocean Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood officials also were taken by surprise.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have never heard of Ocean Fund International,'' Starwood  
spokesman Jim Gallagher said Tuesday. ``We have no knowledge 
whatsoever of their purported offer. They have talked to no one 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O. Robert Meredith, a lawyer representing Ocean Fund, said he  
faxed an offer to Starwood and Park Place late Monday. Ocean Fund 
is legitimate, he said, adding, ``I know they pay their bills.''

<HEADLINE> Charges Against Seahawk RB Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Charges that Seattle Seahawks running  
back Ahman Green assaulted his former girlfriend have been 
dismissed after the woman told prosecutors she would not return for 
his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland Municipal Court Judge Mariane Spearman dismissed the  
charges Monday with prejudice, meaning Green cannot be charged 
again later. 
</P>
<P>
	Green was arrested in March and charged with fourth-degree  
domestic-violence assault after an argument with Shalynn Vance, his 
girlfriend at the time, at their Kirkland apartment. Vance told 
police Green had pushed a door into her face, chipping a tooth and 
causing a bloody lip. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vance moved to Florida and recently told prosecutors she  
would not return for Green's trial, Green's attorney, David Allen, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Green rushed for 209 yards and one touchdown on 35 carries last  
season, his rookie year.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Name Dumars Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Joe Dumars, after 14 years as a  
player for the Detroit Pistons, moved into the club's front office 
today as vice president of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars will have a role in trades and free agent acquisitions.  
</P>
<P>
	Those duties have been held by Rick Sund, whose title is  
executive vice president and general manager of basketball 
operations. Sund will still make the final decisions, but Dumars 
will work with him, Pistons president Tom Wilson said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is very comfortable with that, in fact he wanted it that  
way,'' Wilson said. ``There are no jealousies. This is the way Joe 
wanted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars said there should be no problems between the two.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's room for conflict when there's personalities  
that create a conflict. But I just don't see that here. It's just 
not my personality to create a situation like that,'' Dumars said 
at the Piston's practice facility this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars, 36, spent his entire NBA career with the Pistons before  
retiring last month when the club was eliminated from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged 16.1 points during his career -- all with the Pistons  
-- after being a No. 1 draft pick in 1985 out of McNeese State. 
</P>
<P>
	He played his last game with the Pistons in the team's 87-75  
loss to Atlanta in the deciding game of the first round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer as quick, no longer as strong, Dumars was still a  
factor in his final season. While the headlines most often went to 
Grant Hill and Lindsey Hunter, Dumars continued to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	During his final regular-season home game, May 2 against  
Philadelphia, Dumars scored 15 points, including a crucial 
3-pointer that gave the Pistons an eight-point lead with 3:15 
remaining. He made three free throws down the stretch and Detroit 
hung on for a 100-96 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumars played with the Bad Boys. He was an integral part of the  
Pistons' two championships -- earning Most Valuable Player honors in 
the 1989 finals. Yet, he never fought, never was fined. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got great character,'' Pistons coach Alvin Gentry has  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been named NBA all-Defense four times, played in six  
All-Star games. He has been all-NBA Second Team once and all-NBA 
Third Team twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've accomplished everything I wanted to accomplish, both on  
and off the court, individually and team-wise,'' Dumars said 
shortly before he retired.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Visits Boy Hit by Foul Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Randy Johnson and Arizona manager Buck Showalter  
went to a Phoenix hospital Tuesday to visit a 6-year-old boy hit in 
the head by a foul ball Monday night during the Diamondbacks' 2-0 
victory over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, identified by team officials as Phillip Johnson, was  
attending a game for the first time. He was struck in the forehead 
by a line drive foul off the bat of Florida's Kevin Orie in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was picked up by his grandfather and carried from his  
seat just a few rows back from the field at Bank One Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter asked Randy Johnson, who was on the mound when the boy  
was injured, if he wanted to go to the hospital to visit the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said `Let's go. Where's the car?' '' Showalter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the boy's skull apparently was fractured by the  
blow and he may have to undergo surgery to install a metal plate. 
Johnson took the boy a pair of Big Unit baseball shoes and a couple 
of T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the boy was conscious and coherent during the visit but  
the spot where he was hit was seriously bruised. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed to smile a little bit,'' Johnson said. ``I told him  
when he feels better to come to a baseball game. He can be my 
guest.''

<HEADLINE> Mandela Prepares To Leave Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite his role as the main architect of  
racial reconciliation in South Africa after long years of white 
supremacist rule, President Nelson Mandela often has been a 
troublesome figure for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He once gave Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi South Africa's  
highest award for a foreigner, and he also sided with Libya in the 
United States' dispute with that country over the bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103 a decade ago. He has maintained friendships with Cuban 
President Fidel Castro and has had close ties radical Arab states 
other than Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, in a comment aimed at the United States, Mandela  
said, ``The contempt for blacks is still deep-seated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as Mandela prepares to leave office on Wednesday, Clinton  
administration officials as well as private analysts say the 
positive aspects of his five-year term overwhelm the disagreements. 
They believe that the relationship will deepen under Mandela's 
successor, President-elect Thabo Mbeki. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior official dismissed South Africa's penchant for  
friendships with countries on the U.S. terrorism list. This is a 
small consideration, the official said, ``compared with the overall 
vitality of the relations with the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a continent where ethnic tensions often turn into armed  
conflict, South Africa under Mandela's leadership has become a 
model for ethnic reconciliation, the officials say. And they also 
are hopeful that the rest of Africa will look to South African 
democracy as a worthy alternative to the one-man rule that has been 
so prevalent on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Salih Booker, of the Council on Foreign Relations, says Gadhafi  
has visions of playing the role of power broker on the continent, 
and that the administration hopes South Africa will assume that 
role instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States would much rather see South Africa as a  
regional power, as the definer of continental values,'' Booker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also predicted that Mbeki will be far less likely than  
Mandela to indulge in the kind of rhetoric that offends American 
sensibilities. Vice President Al Gore and Mbeki have worked closely 
over the years as co-chairmen of the U.S.-South African Bi-National 
Commission, which oversees official relations in trade, the 
environment and a variety of other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to create such a commission a few years ago is a  
measure of the importance the United States attaches to close ties 
with South Africa. It is one of a handful of bilateral arrangements 
the United States has entered into worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	However distasteful some officials find Mandela's friendship  
with Gadhafi, Booker says it may even have some advantages for 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He says Mandela's intervention a few months ago may have  
influenced Gadhafi to accept a proposal to allow two indicted 
Libyan suspects to stand trial for the Pan Am 103 bombing next 
February in The Netherlands. This has been a longstanding U.S. goal 
in its quest for justice in a terrorist incident that claimed 270 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadhafi is among the guests invited to Mbeki's inaugural.  
Mandela said Sunday he was ``overwhelmed'' by the presence in Cape 
Town of the Libyan ``revolutionary icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno will lead the U.S. delegation.  
</P>
<P>
	Mandela has been given the kind of flattery by the Clinton  
administration that few others have received. At one point a few 
years ago, with Mandela standing at his side, President Clinton 
said the South African leader was ``living proof that the forces of 
justice and reconciliation can bridge any divide. You have shown us 
the way and we look forward, sir, to walking down the road with 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On those rare occasions when the United States gently rebuked  
Mandela, he would react sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding at one point to American expressions of  
disappointment over his plans to travel to Tripoli, Mandela said 
after his arrival, ``Those who say I should not be here are without 
morals. I am not going to join them in their lack of morality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booker says such flareups should not obscure the strengths of  
the relations. South Africa, he says, ``is the closest thing the 
United States has to an ally in Africa.''

<HEADLINE> Circuit City Plans Online Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Circuit City Stores, Inc., the nation's  
largest retailer of brand-name consumer electronics and major 
appliances, will offer online shopping starting next month, company 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ``E-Superstore'' at www.circuitcity.com will initially  
offer about 700 brand-name products, including televisions, 
camcorders, VCRs, stereo equipment and computers, the 
Richmond-based company said. It said it expects to sharply expand 
those online offerings in time for the 1999 holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives said Circuit City's nationwide store network  
gives online customers the choice of picking up pre-ordered 
products themselves or choosing home delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned through our personal computer build-to-order  
business ... that the majority of customers for big-ticket products 
prefer the convenience and security of in-store pickup,'' said Alan 
McCollough, Circuit City's president and chief operating officer. 
He said the flexible delivery and pickup options are something 
``only a retailer with a nationwide store base can offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit City operates 546 superstores, two consumer  
electronics-only stores and 46 mall-based Circuit City Express 
stores. It had $9.3 billion in sales last year.
