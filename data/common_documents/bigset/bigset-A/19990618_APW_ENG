<HEADLINE> Caribbean Tourism Forecast Gloomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- The forecast for the usually sunny  
Caribbean is gloomy, at least for the vital tourism industry that 
most islands depend on. 
</P>
<P>
	With new competition turning up every year, tourism industry  
leaders at this week's Caribbean Hotel Association's conference in 
the Bahamas say their best-case projections show no growth, with 
declines possible in many areas, unless some action is taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brand called the Caribbean will continue to see a loss of  
market share from North America, unless something else is done to 
market this brand,'' said Robert Lawrence, vice president of Go-Go 
Worldwide Vacations. ``There are just too many destinations and 
distribution systems to compete with today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime hotelier Royston Hopkins of Grenada told more than  
1,000 people at the convention that 20 percent fewer guests have 
come to the region from Europe, compared with last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caribbean, he said, is ``in deep crisis, of catastrophic  
proportions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that Caribbean  
tourism -- with projected revenues of $16.5 billion this year -- 
accounts for 21 percent of the region's gross domestic produce, 16 
percent of employment and 26 percent of capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
	One solution would be to have regular sales to attract tourists,  
Hopkins said. ``There has been no time in the history of the 
Caribbean that you have had continuous sales put on by the airlines 
and the hotels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Elder, Caribbean editor of Travel Agent Magazine, agreed  
that high air fares were part of the problem. That is despite the 
fact that regional airlines including Trinidad-based BWIA 
International and Kingston's Air Jamaica have expanded routes to 
loosen a decade-long stranglehold by American Airlines, the 
region's dominant carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are finding air fares to other countries are much  
cheaper,'' Elder said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the airlines said they were not profiting either. Tom Hill,  
director of sales and marketing for Air Jamaica said their revenue 
was flat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see it turning unless we do something dramatic in the  
next few months,'' Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even American Airlines had lower-than-usual profits for the  
first quarter of this year and projects declining profits in the 
second quarter, said Horace Hord, the company's regional marketing 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruise lines, which include airfare in their prices, said their  
business was equally flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Laverty, marketing and communications manager for  
Carnival Cruise Lines, said his company would reduce its capacity 
in the Caribbean, or at least maintain the same level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the total Caribbean market share of the cruise  
business, including Bermuda, will be about 50 percent, which is a 
15 percent drop in the last 10 years,'' Laverty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caribbean Hotel Association says it's working on a  
collective marketing strategy for the region. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bahamas tourism director Vincent Vanderpool Wallace said the  
individual islands' private sectors have to stop looking for 
government handouts if they want to save their market share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who believes that you're going to have a Caribbean  
campaign that has less money to spend than the largest individual 
country in the Caribbean, in terms of supporting a brand, is 
dreaming,'' Wallace said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Friday as Japan  
enlisted European support for its effort to bolster a Japanese 
economic recovery by holding down the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first confirmed intervention in currency markets, the  
European Central Bank bought euros and sold yen at Japan's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar was caught in the crossfire,'' said Henry Willmore,  
senior economist at Barclays Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 120.44 Japanese yen  
from 119.25 yen Thursday. The euro was quoted at $1.0384, up from 
$1.0339. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan had the European Central Bank organize an  
intervention through central banks in the 11 countries using the 
euro as its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a fact that we made that action,'' the Kyodo news  
service quoted Haruhiko Kuroda, director general of the Finance 
Ministry's International Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan already had intervened twice this month in  
Japanese markets -- on June 10 and this past Monday -- to slow the 
rise in the value of the yen, seeking to keep it around 120 to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent figures indicate an improving economy as Japan fights to  
recover from its worst recession in 50 years. A rising yen hurts 
profits from exports, one of the ways Japan hopes to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'll probably be successful in keeping the yen from  
being too strong,'' said Willmore, the Barclays Capital economist. 
``I think it's sensible. If the yen got too strong, it would 
threaten the recovery by making it more difficult to compete in 
export markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against other currencies, the dollar was quoted at 1.5383 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.5427, and 1.4645 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4632. The British pound rose to $1.5997 from $1.5926. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8835 
German marks, down from 1.8918; 6.3170 French francs, down from 
6.3452; and 1,864.67 Italian lire, down from 1,872.66.

<HEADLINE> Helms: Holbrooke Approval Is Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee said today that Richard Holbrooke, whose diplomatic work 
helped bring peace to Bosnia, would likely be confirmed as U.N. 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about Holbrooke's ethical conduct have held up the  
process for a year since President Clinton first raised his name 
for the post, but Holbrooke appears to have allayed senators' 
concerns at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the committee, said on the  
Senate floor today that Holbrooke ``probably will be confirmed in a 
week or so as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remark came as Helms was urging that payment of U.S. debts  
to the United Nations be tied to a plan to reform the world body. 
He noted approvingly that Holbrooke ``strongly favors the reform of 
the United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the 10 Republicans on the committee, including Sen. Dick  
Lugar of Indiana, a former chairman, expressed support for 
Holbrooke's nomination Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the eight committee Democrats has expressed  
reservations, so only two Republicans need to back Holbrooke to 
send his nomination to the full Senate. Two more days of hearings 
are scheduled next week before the committee votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke acknowledged at the hearing into his private business  
dealings that he ``may not have been careful enough about the 
appearances'' of his contacts with State Department officials 
between 1996 and 1999 when he acted both as an investment banker 
with Credit Suisse First Boston and an unpaid State Department 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he violated no laws and did not discuss private  
business with U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Republicans leaning toward supporting him, Sen. Bill  
Frist of Tennessee, said after the hearing that he was impressed by 
Holbrooke's contrition. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said the hearing 
confirmed his previous favorable opinion of the nominee. And a 
third Republican, Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon, is ``likely to 
support the nomination,'' his spokeswoman, Mary Healy, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke served as an assistant secretary of state during  
Clinton's first term and was architect of the 1995 Dayton, Ohio, 
peace accords that ended the war in Bosnia. When he left for the 
private sector, he continued as an unpaid adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law imposes a one-year ``cooling-off'' period for  
government workers like Holbrooke, designed to prevent lobbying of 
former co-workers. During that year, former government officials 
cannot discuss official matters with employees of their former 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said Holbrooke ignored legal advice that could have  
prevented conflicts of interest while he served in both roles. He 
also criticized the nominee's acceptance of $900,000 for speeches 
and articles about U.S. foreign policy. A federal law says even 
special employees cannot receive compensation for speaking and 
writing on subjects involved in their official duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said his discussions with State Department officials  
involved only U.S. foreign policy and no private business, but he 
should have made the distinction clear. ``With regret, I must say 
that carelessness on occasion on my part contributed to these 
misconceptions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke paid a $5,000 Justice Department fine for blurring his  
public and private roles during a trip to South Korea. He said he 
settled the case so his nomination could move forward, and the 
State Department cleared him of any wrongdoing on the speaking 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were effusive in their support, pointing out that  
allegations of wrongdoing by Holbrooke began with an anonymous 
letter to the State Department inspector general, who proceeded 
without showing the nominee a copy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe strongly that none of these matters even approach  
the level where they should be considered disqualifying. I do not 
believe for one minute that Richard Holbrooke is an unethical 
person,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said.

	Clinton Pleased With Kosovo Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- President Clinton said today he was  
pleased with the agreement between U.S. and Russian leaders which 
allows Russian peacekeeping power in certain parts of Kosovo, but 
maintains overall NATO command. The deal, which still needs formal 
approval by NATO, came after three days of difficult negotiations. 
The deal ``gives Russia a unique role'' by allowing its forces to 
operate within three of the five sectors of Kosovo controlled by 
NATO, Defense Secretary William Cohen said at a news conference. 
The dispute began when 200 Russian troops startled the West by 
marching into the Pristina airport ahead of the alliance.

	Gore Aims at Bush on Gun Control  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore took direct aim at  
George W. Bush today, accusing the Texas governor of being soft on 
gun control for signing a bill limiting cities' ability to sue 
firearms manufacturers and dealers. Gore never mentioned Bush by 
name, but his reference to the Texas bill was an unmistakable shot 
at the leading Republican presidential contender. Gore's remarks 
came the same day the House killed a gun-control bill that would 
have imposed some new restrictions. The vice president called the 
House vote ``a step in the wrong direction.'' 

</P>
<P>
	House Rejects Gun Control Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House overwhelmingly  
rejected a gun control bill today that would have lessened some 
current restrictions on gun control while imposing others. The vote 
was 280-147. The rejection came as many Democrats rebelled against 
National Rifle Association-backed provisions in the bill to loosen 
some existing gun controls, while dozens of conservative 
Republicans objected to the imposition of new ones. ``The American 
people will not stand for this,'' President Clinton said in a 
statement issued in Europe. ``Our nation is waiting for Washington 
to pass a real law that keeps guns away from children and out of 
the hands of criminals.''

	U.S. Warplanes Bomb Iraqi Defense  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed an Iraqi radar  
facility today after being fired upon by Iraqi forces in the 
northern no-fly zone, U.S. military officials said. Iraq said one 
person was injured and buildings were destroyed in the attack. U.S. 
and British warplanes have been enforcing a no-fly zone above the 
36th parallel in northern Iraq to protect Iraqi Kurds. A similar 
no-fly zone was also set up in southern Iraq to protect Shiite 
minorities. Baghdad says the zones violate international law and 
has challenged allied planes since December.

	Clinton Blocks Israeli Embassy Move  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today overruled Congress and  
kept the U.S. Embassy in Israel from relocating to Jerusalem, the 
declared capital of the Jewish state. Under law, the shift was 
supposed to begin May 31 -- unless Clinton decided it would 
jeopardize U.S. national security. His decision, announced in 
Germany, was based on that judgment, and keeps the embassy in Tel 
Aviv for at least six months. In a letter to Sen. Daniel P. 
Moynihan, D-NY, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated 
Press, Clinton said he was prepared to discuss with members of 
Congress addressing the issue ``in a way that protects our national 
security interests.''

its computer storage products and the loss of top managers. Iomega 
said Friday it will lose 5 cents to 10 cents a share in the current 
financial quarter, excluding a restructuring charge, compared to 
analysts' expectations of zero profits. A year earlier, the company 
lost 13 cents a share.

Duval, the No. 1 player in the world, made a 12-foot birdie putt on 
No. 17 that gave him an even-par 70 and left him tied with Stewart 
and Mickelson at 137. ``All in all, I'm very pleased with my 
score,'' Duval said. ``It's a wonderful score, all things 
considered. I'm hanging right there.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers Sign No. 1 Pick Eric Munson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Eric Munson, Detroit's No. 1 draft pick and the  
third player taken overall this month's amateur draft, agreed 
Friday to a $6.75 million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers said they would decide this weekend on a minor-league  
assignment for Munson. 
</P>
<P>
	Munson took batting practice with the Tigers prior to Friday  
night's game against Oakland. He hit one ball into Tiger Stadium's 
right-field upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was the third-largest for a player who signed with the  
team that drafted him, trailing only first baseman Pat Burrell's $8 
million, five-year contract with Philadelphia and J.D. Drew's $7 
million, four-year deal with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, a 21-year-old junior catcher, said he was happy  
negotiations went smoothly because he wants to immediately begin 
his pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signing quickly was one of the biggest things for me,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers general manager Randy Smith denied that Munson was  
seeking a $10 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where that figure came from,'' Smith said. ``It  
was never mentioned to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, a 21-year-old junior catcher, hit .346 with 15 home runs  
and 41 RBIs for Southern California this season. He missed 21 games 
with a broken bone in his right hand but returned for the final 
five regular-season games, the Pac-10 and NCAA tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets a $3.5 million signing bonus and $250,000 this season --  
topping the $3.65 million Josh Hamilton, the top pick in the draft, 
got as a signing bonus when he agreed to a minor league deal with 
Tampa Bay earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Munson gets $750,000 next year, $1 million in 2001 and $1.25  
million in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Munson would prefer to remain a catcher, but there's also talk  
of grooming him as a first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind,'' Munson said. ``It depends if my defense keeps  
up with my bat. I'd love to catch, and if not, I'm not going to cry 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he expects Munson to make rapid progress in the  
minors. Each of the Tigers' last two draft picks, right-handed 
pitchers Matt Anderson and Jeff Weaver, were in the majors less 
than a year after signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'd love to be here as fast as I can,'' Munson said.  
``But I understand there are things I need to work on.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss, Italian Towns Vie for Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Small Alpine town vs. big industrial  
city. Swiss reliability vs. Italian flair. Pirmin Zurbriggen vs. 
Alberto Tomba. 
</P>
<P>
	That shaped up as the most likely choice facing the IOC on  
Saturday in the first selection of an Olympic host city since the 
Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion, a provincial capital of 26,000 in the heart of the Swiss  
Alps, and Turin, the northern Italian industrial city of 2.2 
million, appeared to be the top contenders in an unpredictable 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The four other candidates in the all-European field are  
Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and 
Zakopane, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee appointed a 16-member panel  
Saturday morning (Friday night EDT) that will pick two finalists. 
Then, 89 IOC members will choose the winner by secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``selection college'' was composed of eight members elected  
by the IOC, including former Olympic champions Jean-Claude Killy of 
France and Valery Borzov of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	The international federations appointed Joseph Fendt of luge,  
while Spain's Feliciano Mayoral represented the national Olympic 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Three athletes' representatives were named to the panel: Prince  
Albert of Monaco, who competed in bobsled and is now an IOC member; 
Thomas Gustaffson of Sweden, a speedskater; and cross-country skier 
Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, former FIFA president Joao  
Havelange of Brazil and Japanese IOC member Chiharu Igaya filled 
out the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the IOC voted on a Winter Olympic site, in 1995,  
Salt Lake City won the 2002 games in a landslide. As it turned out, 
the victory was aided by more than $1 million in inducements to IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, which broke six months ago, plunged the IOC into  
the biggest crisis of its 105-year history. Ten members have 
resigned or been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the scandal, IOC members were banned from  
visiting the 2006 bid cities, and the voting process was changed to 
allow a ``selection college'' to narrow the field to two. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials said the new rules were designed to make the  
system ``fireproof'' against any form of corruption or improper 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sion has been the front-runner from the start, delegates  
said Turin made a strong impression in Friday's presentation to the 
IOC assembly and could have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head final between Sion and Turin, the Swiss fear  
the vote could be swung by the strong Italian lobby in the IOC and 
possible bloc support from other Latin countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion is bidding for the third time, following failed attempts  
for the 1972 and 2002 Games. Switzerland hasn't staged the Winter 
Games since 1948 in St. Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first bid from Turin, seeking to bring the Winter  
Olympics back to Italy for the first time since 1956 (Cortina 
D'Ampezzo). 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki, whose bid includes Alpine ski events in Lillehammer,  
Norway, is hoping to get the Winter Games for Finland after five 
previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt is proposing a ``games without borders'' concept that  
includes sites in Austria, Slovenia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Slovak and Polish bids were given virtually no chance, with  
delegates saying they need more time to develop their economies and 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on member visits has been seen as an advantage for Sion,  
which played host to more than 60 IOC members during the 2002 bid. 
The Swiss say they have a vastly improved bid this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion was worried about possible resentment by some IOC members  
over the role of Switzerland's Marc Hodler in blowing the whistle 
on Olympic corruption in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Significantly, Hodler did not speak during Sion's presentation  
Friday, which revolved around a film featuring a ``modern Heidi'' 
searching for five golden rings in the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We changed our tactic from the last time,'' Sion bid president  
Adolf Ogi said. ``We underlined not the technical side but the 
emotional side of our bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sion delegation included Zurbriggen, the former Olympic and  
World Cup ski champion. Tennis star Martina Hingis offered her 
support in a videotaped message. 
</P>
<P>
	Turin made a businesslike presentation, emphasizing it is the  
largest city in the arc of the Alps. Bid leaders said Turin can 
provide all the amenities of a big city, while offering easy access 
to world class mountain venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomba, the three-time Olympic ski champion, sat with the Turin  
delegation but did not speak to the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke enough in the past,'' he said later.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor of Turin, Valentino Castellani, said of Tomba: ``He's  
so great he has no reason to speak. Just viewing him is 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC delegates got to view another ski great, Austria's Franz  
Klammer, who spoke on behalf of Klagenfurt's bid.

	The presentation included footage of Klammer's spectacular run,  
which earned him the downhill gold medal at the 1976 Innsbruck 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those 1 minutes and 45 seconds changed my life forever,''  
Klammer said. ``For me, this bid is the best thing since my gold 
medal.''

<HEADLINE> GoTo.com Plans IPO As Market Cools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) --Internet search engine GoTo.com planned  
to test investor interest in Internet stocks by going public today 
after a two-month slide in share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	GoTo.com intended to sell 5 million shares on the Nasdaq market  
at $13 to $14 per share in a bid to raise up to $70 million for the 
company that emerged last year from idealabs!, the Pasadena, 
Calif., incubator founded by Bill Gross. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big, fast gains for new Internet offerings may be a  
thing of the past, analysts say. A two-month slide in Internet 
stocks suggests investors have begun to look askance at sky-high 
valuations and are deciding that some stocks aren't a good bet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have become more discriminating in their choice of  
IPOs,'' said Youssef Squali, an analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I think the Internet companies that can still make it are  
companies that are relatively dominant in their niche market or 
companies that have strong backing from well-known venture 
capitalists or have a very strong management team,'' Squali said. 
``I think GoTo.com falls in the second category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Internet companies, GoTo.com has yet to turn a profit.  
In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company 
said it has lost $21 million since it was founded in 1997 and will 
continue to lose money for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues have grown, however, jumping in the first quarter of  
1999 to $1.4 million from $38,000 a year earlier, and GoTo.com's 
base of users and paying clients has risen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC rules prohibit company officials from commenting in the  
period before an IPO is launched. 
</P>
<P>
	IPOs have provided big initial returns for other companies that  
have yet to make money. Just last month, Santa Monica, Calif.-based 
eToys Inc. raised $166 million with an offering in which the share 
price jumped from $20 to $85 as investors snapped up the company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then eToys has fallen more than 50 percent from its  
high, trading Thursday at $40 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-profile Internet stocks, including Amazon.com Inc.  
and Priceline.com Inc. have taken a beating in recent weeks. 
National Discount Brokers Group, an online stock brokerage, on 
Tuesday canceled its plans to sell 2.6 million new shares because 
of market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks did get a bounce this week, sending the Dow  
Jones Internet Index up 22 percent on Wednesday. The market was up 
slightly in trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the jump, the index was down 36 percent since  
peaking on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're finding now is the Internet is starting to  
mature,'' said Jack Staff, chief economist at Zona Research. ``We 
have long said that as soon as some of the Internet companies start 
to make their first profits, there will be a softening in the 
Internet sector as a whole because Internet stocks will go from 
being stocks of possibility to stocks of reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are indications GoTo.com's pay-for-play business model is  
working. In GoTo.com's system, clients bid a price they are willing 
to pay for a high ranking on results pages. The name of the highest 
bidder appears at the top of the page, with others ranked in 
descending order according to their bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A note attached to each link on GoTo.com's results page tells  
users how much a company paid to be there. For example, a search 
for ``books'' turned up Best Buy at the top of the list; it paid 57 
cents for the placement. (Amazon.com was second -- it paid 56 
cents). 
</P>
<P>
	This system contrasts with most other search engines, which make  
money from selling ads that appear on their Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Users don't seem to mind. Between Jan. 1 and April 30, searches  
via GoTo.com increased 85 percent to more than 1 million per month, 
and the clientele of paying advertisers grew 150 percent to more 
than 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	During April, GoTo.com attracted 7.2 percent of all Web surfers,  
placing it 10th among search engines, according to Media Metrix.

<HEADLINE> Minister Faces Federal Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons, once the powerful  
leader of one of the nation's largest black church groups and now 
an inmate at a state prison, faced further humbling in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old minister was to be sentenced today on federal  
tax evasion and bank fraud charges to which he pleaded guilty in 
March. The five counts carried a total possible sentence of 75 
years in prison, but his lawyers expected a term of fewer than 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges grew out of his business dealings while president of  
the National Baptist Convention USA. He admitted failing to pay 
taxes on $1.3 million in income, defrauding a bank and making false 
statements to a financial institution and to federal housing 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors dropped 49 other charges, including  
extortion, conspiracy and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was convicted Feb. 27 in state court of bilking  
corporations out of nearly $4 million, and of stealing almost 
$250,000 donated by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith for 
burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison for racketeering and  
grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	A repentant Lyons has emerged since he began his state sentence  
April 1 at Lowell Correctional Institution near Ocala, his lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's reading the Bible and reading prayer every day ... trying  
to find peace for himself,'' said attorney Jeff Brown.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Shares Up on Rumor of Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp. stock closed up nearly 12 percent  
Friday after a published report said the company could be the 
target of a merger with supermarket giant Safeway Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart's stock closed at $17, up $1.81 1/4 in heavy trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Week magazine reported Thursday that Safeway was  
looking at Kmart in the wake of Wal-Mart Corp.'s recent purchase of 
British supermarket chain Asda Group PLC. Kmart chairman Floyd Hall 
said in October that the company would consider merging or aligning 
with a grocery business. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Kmart and Wal-Mart have been designing stores  
that combine groceries and other retail goods under one roof. While 
Wal-Mart has been successful with its sprawling Supercenters, some 
Wall Street analysts have said Kmart needed another company's help 
to build a food distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart spokeswoman Mary Lorencz said Friday the company had no  
comment on the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Plaisance, spokeswoman for California-based Safeway,  
declined to comment directly on the report, but repeated an earlier 
statement that ``the focus of the company's acquisitions has been 
high-quality supermarkets.''

<HEADLINE> Coach Reflects on Women's Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Coach Tony DiCicco believes this is  
the best U.S. women's soccer team ever put together. He also knows 
it might not be good enough to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Under DiCicco, who took over from Anson Dorrance in 1994, the  
Americans are 93-8-7. They own a bronze medal from the 1995 World 
Cup -- the United States won the inaugural world championship in 
1991 -- and a gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	That history is important to DiCicco. He wants his players to  
remember the monumental victories and the deflating defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly are a better team than we've ever been,'' DiCicco  
said Thursday as his squad entered the final stretch of preparation 
for Saturday's opener against Denmark. ``But so are the others. 
There is not a weak team in this field, and even though I think we 
all know what to expect, there'll be some surprises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid any of those surprises happening to his team, DiCicco  
emphasizes keeping alive the memories of a 1-0 loss to Norway in 
the '95 World Cup semifinals. He also mentions just often enough to 
keep them fresh the pair of losses to China this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want them to forget it,'' he said. ``It's important  
that they remember. There are two things I really want them to 
remember: the loss to Norway and how that felt, and getting the 
chance in the gold medal game of the Olympics and that feeling of 
winning. Both serve as motivations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco says he is lucky that all of his players are  
self-motivators. He points, in particular, to veterans Michelle 
Akers, who has chronic fatigue syndrome, and Joy Fawcett and Carla 
Overbeck, who returned to the national team after having babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best example I can mention,'' he said. ``It takes  
tremendous dedication to go through what they have and to remain 
great players, which they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those players will return the praise. Goalkeeper Briana Scurry  
says, ``Tony is the perfect coach for us. He's calm when he needs 
to be, gets fired up when he needs to, is a great teacher and works 
very hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent practice, DiCicco spent 30 minutes working with  
Scurry and the other goalies. Then he oversaw 4-on-4 scrimmages in 
which he shouted encouragement for good plays and never publicly 
criticized mistakes. A full-team scrimmage was punctuated by his 
loud instructions, always delivered in a coaxing, not scolding, 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are grown women,'' DiCicco said. ``They deserve an adult  
approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mainly, DiCicco's approach is to play an aggressive game. After  
all, he says, it's the American way. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can play a negative style, and we may see some of that in  
the World Cup,'' said DiCicco, who was the goalkeepers' coach with 
the '91 team and became head coach in 1994. ``That's a game played 
not to lose instead of to win. For sure, this team plays to win. To 
change that would be going against their natural sporting 
tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fans like an aggressive team that attacks. We have  
athletes that play with a lot of heart and put everything out on 
the field. That's the way of our society in general, and sports 
mirror society. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``In the United States, we are aggressors, by and large, an  
aggressive country. That's why I try to put that type of team out 
there. We tried to hold them back, and it doesn't work. Our 
aggressiveness is one of our most important components of American 
sports, and this team epitomizes that.''

<HEADLINE> Pennsylvania Hostage Standoff Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A two-day hostage standoff at  
Pennsylvania's largest mental hospital ended Friday with a fired 
nurse killing one of his captives and critically wounding the other 
after police broke a window to get a better look at him. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, Dennis Czajkowski, 40, was hospitalized in fair  
condition with cuts, broken bones and other injuries that state 
police said were apparently caused when officers seized him. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski had worked at Norristown State Hospital for 11 years  
but was fired in April after his performance deteriorated, said 
Mary Ellen Fritz, a spokeswoman for the Public Welfare Department. 
She would not be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Czajkowski took hostage two supervisors who had a  
role in his dismissal and demanded an investigation into his 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	He hadn't eaten or slept since the standoff began. Police had  
hoped to wait him out but said he grew agitated and they feared for 
the safety of the hostages, so they shattered a window to get a 
better look inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski opened fire, killing Carol Kepner, 54, and wounding  
Maria Jordan, 37, before being grabbed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors planned to charge him with homicide and attempted  
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaken after the standoff ended badly, State Police spokesman  
Robert Whitbeck said Czajkowski had never threatened the hostages, 
``but his agitation caused us to feel that we had to get a visual 
of the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to speak to the women and to see them and he  
was not letting us,'' Whitbeck said. ``The primary objective 
throughout the entire thing was to keep all three of them safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitbeck wouldn't say what Czajkowski did to lead police to  
believe he was agitated, and described the gunman's conversations 
with negotiators as ``even-keeled or consistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, 37, was wounded in the chest and abdomen, but her  
surgeon said she was doing well and would make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	For years Czajkowski's supervisors considered him a  
well-qualified registered nurse and assigned him to provide the 
highest level of patient care, Fritz said. His annual evaluations 
were positive, until his work began to go downhill, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired after numerous failed attempts to resolve problems  
on the job, Fritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital's 650 patients were moved to safe quarters on  
Wednesday. Areas away from the nursing offices continued to operate 
normally Thursday for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
	The 118-year-old hospital on 233 acres has a locked area where  
the worst of the criminally insane are kept. It also serves the 
chronically mentally ill. Neighbors have sought tighter security 
after dozens of patients walked away from the hospital over the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski and his captives were in Ms. Jordan's office in an  
administrative building. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was terminated and the two women he is holding were part of  
that decision,'' Whitbeck said. ``He specifically targeted at least 
Maria Jordan. We don't know whether he knew for sure whether Carol 
Kepner would be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations had centered on an investigation of Czajkowski's  
firing, Trooper Dave Lester said. Police promised to look into the 
matter, but Czajkowski wanted certain individuals, whom the trooper 
would not identify, to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Bush Signs Texas Electric Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush ushered in a new era for Texas  
utilities Friday by signing a bill that will allow most electric 
customers to begin shopping for lower rates in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition in the electric industry will benefit Texans by  
reducing monthly rates and offering consumers more choices about 
the power they use,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill marks a sweeping overhaul of the state's $20  
billion-a-year utility industry, the second-largest in the country 
behind California. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas joins more than a dozen other states that have already  
opened their utilities markets to competition or are doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation includes a complex set of measures to limit the  
power of the incumbent utilities -- many of which have held 
monopolies in their areas for more than 50 years -- so that new 
companies can compete. 
</P>
<P>
	New utility companies are expected to move into Texas' markets  
to offer lower prices and new technology, which could range from 
selling ``green power'' to providing gadgets that tell consumers 
when they are wasting electricity.

<HEADLINE> Bank Profits Hit Record $18 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Profits at U.S. commercial banks reached a  
record $18 billion in the first quarter, up 12.9 percent from the 
January-March period last year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results followed bank profits in 1998 that set a  
record for the seventh straight year, rising 4.7 percent to $61.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Improved overseas operations and a decline in merger costs at  
big banks boosted first-quarter earnings, the FDIC said in 
announcing results for the nation's 8,721 commercial banks that it 
insures. 
</P>
<P>
	A basic yardstick of bank profitability -- return on assets -- was  
an average 1.32 percent in the January-March quarter, up from 1.26 
percent a year earlier. More than half of all commercial banks, 59 
percent, reported an average return on assets of 1 percent or 
higher, the FDIC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the nation's 1,669 savings institutions insured by  
the FDIC reported earnings of $2.7 billion in the first quarter, up 
3.8 percent from a year earlier. The FDIC said the gain was largely 
the result of lower expenses for credit losses and strong growth in 
interest-earning assets.

<HEADLINE> Ueberroth Group Buys Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pebble Beach, one of the world's most famous  
golf courses, has a new ownership group that includes one of the 
sport's greatest stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold Palmer, Clint Eastwood and Peter Ueberroth were part of a  
group that agreed Thursday to buy the golf course and related 
properties in California for $820 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth, a former baseball commissioner and head of the 1984  
Los Angeles Olympics, put together a group that also includes 
former United Airlines chief executive Richard Ferris and General 
Electric Pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth's group becomes the fourth owner of the Pebble Beach  
Co. this decade. Bank America is providing financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Davis sold it in 1990 to Minoru Isutani for a price  
estimated at $850 million, and Isutani sold it two years later to 
The Lone Cypress Co., a Japanese golf resort company, for a price 
estimated at $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Perocchi, formerly involved with Ueberroth and Ferris in  
Doubletree Hotels, will become chief executive officer of Pebble 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's properties in the Monterey area include four golf  
courses -- the Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill Golf Course, 
The Links at Spanish Bay and Del Monte Golf Course -- along with The 
Lodge at Pebble Beach and The Inn at Spanish Bay. It also owns the 
17-Mile Drive that winds through Pebble Beach and nearby Del Monte 
Forest and plans to develop a new course and 300 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 99th U.S. Amateur will be played at Pebble Beach and  
Spyglass Hill on Aug. 16-22. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebble Beach was host to the U.S. Open in 1972, 1982 and 1992  
and is scheduled to be host to the 100th U.S. Open next summer.

<HEADLINE> Hallmark Selling Low-Cost Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This Father's Day, if you care enough to send  
the very best, you can do it for under a buck. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark has begun selling a line of 99-cent cards with simpler  
designs and basic messages to mark holidays and other, less formal, 
occasions. The nation's top greeting card maker hopes the strategy 
will eliminate its pricey image and boost sales in a flat market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' said Eleana Conde, 36, while buying eight  
Father's Day cards on Friday at a Hallmark store in midtown 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying traditional greeting cards for fathers, stepfathers,  
godfathers, and grandfathers for herself and her two children gets 
quite expensive -- even before buying a gift, Ms. Conde said. 
``These cards really help me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other greeting card companies have sold $1 cards for years, but  
Hallmark's move stands out because it's the industry biggest player 
as well as the emphasis the company is placing on the new cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the privately held Kansas City, Mo.-based company has  
sold about 63 million of the 99-cent Warm Wishes cards since it 
began a national rollout in March. Still, the Warm Wishes sales 
will make up only a small portion of the 3.5 billion cards Hallmark 
expects to sell this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Schaadt, a securities analyst with Fourteen Research in  
New York, said Hallmark's foray into bargain prices is an attempt 
to capture consumers who increasingly buy cards at drugstores, 
grocery stores or mass retailers such as Wal-Mart because they 
believe greeting card stores have become too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark acknowledged the pricey image exists, though questioned  
its accuracy. ``There has been a perception that Hallmark cards are 
expensive when we are in fact middle of line,'' said Jay Dittman, 
Hallmark's vice president of business research. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark cards sell for an average of about $2, though it's not  
hard to find their cards for $2.95 or $3.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schaadt said the new cards also will be helped by the  
novelty factor. ``The industry really lives and breathes on new 
merchandise,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark is prominently displaying the cards at its 5,000 stores  
and is spending $50 million to advertise them. In all, the cards 
are available at more than 20,000 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers say the 99-cent cards have the Hallmark quality. With  
their bright, glossy color, quality paper and fun and corny 
language, the cards don't look like a cheap version of their 
standard assortment. 
</P>
<P>
	By selling the cards for less than $1, Hallmark officials say  
they hope consumers will be motivated to buy cards for more casual 
relationships such as neighbors, co-workers and acquaintances -- in 
other words, people for whom you might balk at buying a $3 card 
just to say ``Hello.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lower price may also persuade some consumers to send a  
traditional card rather than using a less personal -- but free -- 
electronic greeting card offered by companies such as Blue Mountain 
Arts and Amazon.com, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark's chief rival, American Greetings, said it does not  
envision a price war breaking out in the industry, in part because 
the company already sells cards for less than $1. And more 
significantly, consumers don't see price as a barrier, said Steve 
Laserson, executive director of product management at Cleveland, 
Oh.-based American Greetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more a matter of having cards relevant to people's  
lives,'' he said. ``And having cards talk the way people talk.''

<HEADLINE> 1,700 Pounds of Cocaine Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Four men were arrested after police saw  
them exchange a package in a parking lot that led them to the 
seizure of 1,749 pounds of cocaine, which police said had a street 
value of $127 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers trailed a van of one of two men Thursday after spotting  
the exchange. The driver fled in another vehicle when officers 
approached, leaving the van behind, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A police dog detected drugs in the van, where officers said they  
found 236 pounds. The rest was found at a house. 
</P>
<P>
	The four men, including two from Mexico, were charged with  
possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.

<HEADLINE> Accused SLA Fugitive Denied Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A judge today denied bail for a woman  
believed to be Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Ann 
Soliah, wanted in California on allegations that she put pipe bombs 
under police cars in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey County District Judge Kathleen Gearin determined that a  
1976 grand jury indictment in Los Angeles County included a count 
punishable by life imprisonment under California law both then and 
now, and so bail should be denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah, who authorities say started a new life in St. Paul  
as Sara Jane Olson, has refused to waive her right to fight 
extradition to face the California charges. Her next hearing was 
scheduled for July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Thursday, defense lawyer Howard Bass did not concede  
that 52-year-old Ms. Olson, living quietly as a doctor's wife, 
mother of three and sometime actress, is Ms. Soliah. FBI 
spokeswoman Coleen Rowley said a fingerprint analysis concluded 
that Ms. Olson and Ms. Soliah are the same person. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass did not return telephone calls from The Associated Press  
today. Another defense attorney, Susan B. Jordan of Oakland, 
Calif., said earlier that the prosecution is a political one, a 
leftover from the era of protest and ``intense scrutiny of all 
political activists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the atmosphere following the SLA's kidnapping of Patricial  
Hearst 25 years ago, ``law enforcement could well have been wrong 
or misled'' in concluding that Ms. Soliah was involved in 
wrongdoing, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth will emerge in the legal proceedings,'' Jordan said.  
Like Bass, she did not acknowledge that Ms. Olson is Ms. Soliah. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say prosecuting Ms. Soliah in California will be a tough  
job because of fading witness memories and public unfamiliarity 
with the SLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola Law School in Los  
Angeles, said that the woman facing jurors in a trial would bear 
little resemblance to the 1970s radical who was charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she has lived an exemplary life, there will be sympathy,''  
Levenson said. ``No one is going to applaud her actions, but it is 
harder to prosecute a person who lives like the lady next door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons  
declined to say what evidence remains against Ms. Soliah, who 
allegedly placed pipe bombs under two police cars in 1975. They did 
not explode. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have successfully prosecuted cases older than this one,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Hanlon, a lawyer who has represented radicals in the San  
Francisco area, recalled puzzled jurors when he won a murder 
acquittal for SLA member Russell Little in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trial was in Salinas and we had some 19- and 20-year-old  
jurors who had no idea what the SLA was,'' he said. ``And that was 
in 1981.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury that indicted Ms. Soliah in 1976 heard from 28  
witnesses, including a police bomb expert who has since died. It is 
unknown how many witnesses remain alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a physical evidence case, it's easier,'' Hanlon said.  
``If it's a witness case, it's almost impossible to try it 25 years 
later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the anti-government SLA became front-page news when its  
members kidnapped Ms. Hearst, the 19-year-old newspaper heiress. 
The casetook a bizarre twist when Ms. Hearst sent word that she had 
joined the group that abducted her. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Hearst was arrested in San Francisco in October 1975,  
she was living with Ms. Soliah and her brother, Steven. Ms. Hearst 
eventually was convicted of an SLA bank robbery and sent to prison. 
She served two years before President Carter commuted her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fugitives from that era have received light treatment,  
including Weather Underground figure Bernardine Dohrn, an alleged 
conspirator in bombings who was allowed to plead guilty to lesser 
counts and drew probation. She went on to become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Ann Power, an anti-war radical implicated in a fatal  
bank robbery in Boston in 1970, surrendered in 1993 and pleaded 
guilty to manslaughter. With continued good behavior in prison, she 
can be freed in January.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Mixed on House Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley believes the legislative amendment passed by the House 
allowing the posting of the Ten Commandments in schools may be 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential candidates had a broad range of reaction to the Ten  
Commandment amendment and to gun control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have to be tested in the courts,'' Bradley said  
Thursday of the Ten Commandments amendment. ``My hunch is it's 
unlikely to pass constitutional muster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said: ``It's a lot easier to childproof a  
gun than to bulletproof a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, said states and  
localities should have the authority to make their own decisions 
about their own schools, said spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential candidate, Gary Bauer took partial credit for  
the measure, saying the amendment is ``a bill I helped draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe if more American children read the Ten Commandments  
and are taught what they mean, they will predictably engage in less 
crime,'' he said, noting the sentiment for religion in the schools 
after the recent student massacre in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to Littleton, Colo.,'' Bauer said. ``What you see are  
little handmade signs everywhere, 'Let our children pray,' and 
'Bring religion back in to our schools.' I think there's something 
stirring out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP candidate, Steve Forbes, called the House's approval  
of displaying the Ten Commandments ``a positive thing. The Ten 
Commandments, we need to understand and adhere to. The more we see 
them, the better off we'll be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was in Los Angeles to lay out his agenda on guns, which  
included a call for a ban on ``junk'' handguns, the inexpensive, 
cheaply made weapons most often linked to crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``These can explode in a user's hand,'' the former three-term  
senator from New Jersey said while holding up a Lorcin .380 
semiautomatic gun. ``They are dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley called the gun one of the 10 most often used in crimes  
and said that in Los Angeles alone there are 45 varieties of such 
guns. He quoted numbers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms that show 81 percent of the guns it links to crimes can be 
called junk guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The stance seemed a slight retreat from reports last month that  
Bradley was considering pushing a ban on the sale of all handguns. 
His aides say the ban on all handgun sales is a long-range goal, 
but they were announcing measures that could be pursued 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who is challenging Gore for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, said he would support a ban on both the possession and 
sale of junk guns, also known as Saturday night specials. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also proposed a one-per-month limit on handgun  
purchases, banning anyone convicted of domestic violence from 
owning a gun, restricting firearms dealers to commercial areas, 
bumping up the cost of licenses for gun dealers, requiring a 
registration process for handguns similar to auto registration, and 
requiring background checks on buyers at gun shows.

<HEADLINE> Olazabal Breaks Hand, Out of US Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Jose Maria Olazabal couldn't handle the  
course. He fared even worse against a wall in his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	The Masters champion, irate over poor play in the U.S. Open,  
dealt a one-punch knockout to himself when he took a swing at the 
wall and broke a bone in his right hand. He was forced to withdraw 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was upset with myself,'' said Olazabal, who was injured  
Thursday night after shooting a 5-over 75 in the first round. ``I 
wanted to do well this week. After the way I played ... I did 
something I should not have. Now, I'm paying the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a splint, Olazabal arrived at Pinehurst No. 2 to try a  
few practice swings with a club in his hands. But, as soon as the 
Spaniard realized he couldn't play the second round, he walked to 
the parking lot and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman and Nick Price teed off without the other member of  
their threesome. A ``WD'' on the scoreboard served as golf's 
version of the white towel. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal was rated among the favorites at Pinehurst, where the  
spacious fairways, short rough and treacherous greens seemed a 
perfect fit for a player with an imaginative short game. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, his withdrawal left Jack Nicklaus as the last man to  
win both the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year. That happened 
27 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Told of Olazabal's misfortune, defending Open champion Lee  
Janzen said nonchalantly, ``I guess that takes him out of the Grand 
Slam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman and Corey Pavin didn't provide a lot of sympathy,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have kicked the wall,'' quipped Norman, who failed to  
make the cut after dueling with Olazabal at the Masters. ``I 
wouldn't have punched it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's under the stupid-things-I-did-in-my-life category,''  
Pavin added. ``I'm sure he feels pretty dumb about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two players at opposite end of golf's mental spectrum said they  
could relate to the Olazabal's frustration after the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's understandable,'' said Tiger Woods, who was among the  
leaders at the midway point of the tournament. ``We do get angry 
out here. We do get frustrated and sometimes we take it home with 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Daly should know. He's had several drunken rampages during  
his continuing battle with alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is crazy,'' he said. ``I've done a lot of crazy  
things with my fists. I never hit anybody, but I tore up a few 
houses and a few cars. It's not the total glamorous life that 
everybody thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Daly seemed taken aback that a player known for his calm  
temperament had let his emotions get the best of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hell, if I'd have won the Masters, I don't think I'd have been  
punching the walls,'' Daly said. ``I'm the only one right now who 
has a reason to punch anything. I haven't done crap all year. At 
least he's got the green jacket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal broke the fifth metacarpal on his right hand and will  
be out 3-4 weeks, possibly jeopardizing his spot in the British 
Open at Carnoustie July 15-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, it is a clean fracture,'' Olazabal said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also, a broken hand is not nearly as serious as the ailment that  
threatened the Spaniard's career after his first Masters victory in 
1994. Olazabal was out of golf for 18 months because of foot 
problems that were mistakenly diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	He feared he wouldn't be able to walk again, much less play  
golf. Now, he's simply got to work on his temper.

<HEADLINE> Grant, Savarese in Heavyweight Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Grant says he knows what to expect from  
Lou Savarese in their 10-round heavyweight fight Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a coming-at-you type of guy,'' Grant said. ``He pretty  
much stands there (in front of you).'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Grant expects, Savarese says, what he's going to get.  
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody told me, `You got stay away from him . . . stick and  
move,' '' Savarese said. ``I said, `Buddy, you haven't seen me 
fight. I'm going to be there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory could move either fighter into a shot at WBC champion  
Lennox Lewis. At the very least, it would keep the winner very much 
in the championship picture. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss would be especially damaging to the 33-year-old Savarese  
(39-2, 32 knockouts), of New York. He has won three straight since 
consecutive losses on a 12-round split decision to George Foreman 
and on a fifth-round knockout by David Izon in 1997. In his last 
fight, Savarese had to get up from a knockdown to outpoint 
relatively inexperienced Lance Whitaker March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Grant (29-0, 21 knockouts), of Norristown, Pa.,  
is coming off an 11th-round win over Ahmad Abdin Jan. 30, but that 
was only his fourth match in 19 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis is scheduled to attend the fight to scout a possible  
opponent should his November rematch against Evander Holyfield fall 
through. That could happen if an agreement cannot be reached 
between HBO and promoter Don King. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Grant officially weighed in Thursday at 256 pounds  
for the match in The Theater at Madison Square Garden. The 6-5 
Savarese weighed 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be preceded by a 10-round heavyweight bout  
between Jason Williams, 217, (34-2, 31 knockouts) of Long Beach, 
Calif., and Maurice Harris, 205, (14-9-2, nine knockouts) of 
Newark, N.J., on HBO's ``Boxing After Dark Series.'' The telecast 
will begin at 11 p.m. EDT.

	U.S., Russia Agree on Kosovo Plan  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- U.S. and Russian negotiators reached  
agreement today on Kosovo peacekeeping arrangements, ending an 
impasse that began a week ago when 200 Russian troops surprised 
NATO by rolling into the Pristina airport, a U.S. official said. 
Negotiators called a news conference late today in the Finnish 
capital. The agreement came after the two sides struggled for three 
days to resolve the delicate problem of how to give Moscow a 
prominent role but not sole control over any sector of the Kosovo 
province.

	House Rejects Gun Control Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House rejected a gun  
control bill today that would have lessened some current 
restrictions while imposing others. The vote against was 280-147. 
The bipartisan rejection came at the end of a tumultuous three-day 
debate as lawmakers struggled to respond to this spring's high 
school shootings in Colorado and Georgia. The vote leaves the fate 
of gun control legislation uncertain. The Senate last month 
approved stronger restrictions, and compromise talks with the House 
are likely to begin this summer. The House had voted to include in 
the bill loosening of restrictions on sales at gun shows -- a move 
that had drawn a veto threat from President Clinton.

coordinated arson attacks today, and hate literature blaming the 
``International Jewsmedia'' for the war in Kosovo was found at one 
of the buildings. The fires caused moderate damage to two 
synagogues and gutted a third temple's library, destroying a 
collection of videos on Jewish history. The federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is taking over the investigation and 
is assuming it is a hate crime, said Bill Newberry, assistant 
special agent in charge of the ATF's San Francisco division. 
Investigators took one youth into custody and were seeking several 
others who were seen near Congregation B'nai Israel, where the 
library was broken into and set on fire.

Duval, who hadn't made a bogey all tournament, took a double bogey

meanwhile, withdrew after breaking a bone while punching his hotel

<HEADLINE> Police: Man Kills Wife and Two Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- A man despondent after accidentally  
suffocating his wife spent at least a day in his home, first 
killing their two young children and then himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Gilbert, 25, apparently allowed her husband, Michael,  
27, to asphyxiate her, but he did not mean to kill her, Lt. Craig 
Van Schyndle said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears activities between them were consensual to her  
death,'' Van Schyndle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities would not elaborate, citing the ``sensitivity of  
these deaths.'' They declined to comment when asked whether Mrs. 
Gilbert's death was sex-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe she died Sunday. Gilbert, upset after his  
wife's death, killed 1-year-old Evangeline and 2-month-old Ivan and 
then himself on Monday, Van Schyndle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's bodies were found Tuesday. The woman and the  
children died of asphyxiation, medical examiner Joe Grantham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert apparently tried to commit suicide several ways in the  
24 hours after killing his family. He died of carbon monoxide 
poisoning, drugs or alcohol or some combination, Van Schyndle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths have baffled people in this city of 100,000 best  
known as the home to pro football's Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on accounts of police, neighbors and co-workers, the  
Gilberts had no record of domestic violence and lived quietly in 
their two-story home.

	Both parents were described as dedicated to their children.  
Gilbert was a mechanic for a company that rents and sells lift 
equipment; his wife had given up a part-time office job since her 
son's birth this spring.

	Mrs. Gilbert's father, Randy Fameree, found the family in the

went to the home after his son-in-law failed to show up for work.

<HEADLINE> Internet Use Rises 11 Pct. in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Internet use has risen to 11 percent of Japanese  
households, although high costs and privacy problems on the World 
Wide Web remain hindrances, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telecommunications Ministry's report found that Internet use  
was spreading in Japan at a faster rate than the proliferation of 
computers and cellular phones, taking only five years to reach 10 
percent of the nation's households. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 13 years for at least 10 percent of households to have  
computers and 15 years for cellular phone use to top that rate, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet use climbed 47 percent in the fiscal year ended in  
March to a total of nearly 17 million people, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said one problem with expansion was the possible violation of  
people's privacy and other crime on the Internet. It also said that 
telephone charges for Internet use in Tokyo were about three times 
those in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said that electronic commerce was taking off,  
doubling in the last fiscal year to more than 166 billion yen ($1.4 
billion).

<HEADLINE> Go2Net Shareholders OK Allen Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Go2Net Inc. shareholders have approved $426  
million in transactions that will give billionaire investor Paul 
Allen a 34 percent stake in the Internet portal. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Allen, who is making big investments in  
Internet and television content to feed his growing cable empire, 
made an unsuccessful bid to acquire 54 percent of Go2Net. Though 
the offer failed, Allen acquired the right to take a one-third 
interest in Go2Net, pending shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders on Thursday approved an additional $133 million  
purchase of Go2Net preferred shares, lifting Allen`s total holdings 
of the company's preferred securities to $300 million, Dow Jones 
News Service reported. Shareholders also approved Allen's 
acquisition of 1.4 million common shares from company directors for 
$90 a share, or a total of $126 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Allen launched a $90-a-share bid for 54 percent of  
Go2Net, which was then trading at around $87. Excited investors 
then drove the company's stock up close to $200, making Allen's 
offer no longer attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Go2Net, which operates a number of popular Web sites such as  
Silicon Investor and MetaCrawler, also said Thursday that its 
shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized 
shares to 500 million from 50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, through his Vulcan Ventures Inc., has made a number of  
large investments in media companies, including taking stakes in 
Ziff-Davis Inc. and Oxygen Media Inc. Allen, a co-founder of 
Microsoft Corp., also has been on a cable buying spree that will 
make his Charter Communications the nation's fourth-largest cable 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Go2Net closed Thursday at $119.50, up $4.50, or about  
4 percent, on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Bush Gets Endorsements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- George W. Bush gained two more Republican  
endorsements Friday in his quest for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns and Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon are  
the latest GOP officials to back the Republican front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's tested as a chief executive and in my judgment, he has  
passed this test,'' Johanns said. ``He is truly a leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who will also serve as Bush's Oregon state chairman, said  
Bush's record as Texas governor sets him apart from the GOP field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been able to bring disparate opinions together to  
improve education, cut taxes and remove obstacles to opportunities 
in Texas,'' Smith said. ``Our country will be greatly served by a 
man of his integrity and ability to lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has now captured the endorsement of 20 of his 31 fellow GOP  
governors. Smith's endorsement brings the total to 13 of 55 
Republican senators.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Bauer urged his Republican presidential  
rivals to reject campaign donations from the gambling industry, 
calling betting an ``addictive blight'' on the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's plea came on the heels of a study by the National  
Gambling Commission released Friday outlining explosive growth of 
legal gambling in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have witnessed in America is the advent of a new  
epidemic,'' Bauer said. ``It is time for a time-out, for a 
moratorium on the expansion of legalized gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer also called for a series of changes to help curb the  
growth of legalized gambling, including raising the minimum age to 
21, using a portion of state gambling revenue for addiction 
treatment and cutting back on the number of ``convenience gambling 
outlets'' like those found in neighborhood stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The longtime conservative activist said gambling is detrimental  
to families and communities.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Stock Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette's stock dropped sharply today in the wake  
of the shaving and consumer products company's warnings that its 
earnings would be lower than expected this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed Thursday, Gillette Co. announced it will  
report a 20 percent decrease in earnings per share compared with a 
year ago, falling well short of analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	It cited an unexpectedly low recovery in Japan, Brazil, Russia  
and Germany. Sales for Gillette's Braun appliance, stationery and 
toiletries businesses also were disappointing, the company said, 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, ``we still expect sales to be up in a low  
single-digit increase,'' said Stephen Brayton, company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings will return to normal levels in the second half,  
Brayton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, Gillette shares skidded as much as 12.8  
percent. By early afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, its 
shares were trading at $42.43 3/4, a drop of 10.3 percent or $4..87 1/2 a 
share in heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second quarter of 1998, Gillette earned $372 million, or  
33 cents a share, on sales of $2.3 billion. The company's warning 
means it expects profits to drop about 7 cents per share this 
quarter to 26 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. were predicting 29 cents a  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Long known as a steady money maker for blue-chip investors,  
Gillette announced in September it would lay off 4,700 employees 
worldwide, or 11 percent of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes Sensor shaving products, Oral B toothbrushes  
and Duracell batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette also announced Thursday that its board of directors has  
authorized and expansion of its stock repurchase program from 50 
million to 75 million shares.

<HEADLINE> Tallest Lighthouse Begins Journey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- Hundreds of spectators watched as the  
nation's tallest lighthouse began its slow journey to a new site a 
half-mile away from the ocean breakers that have threatened to 
undermine it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to see it go into the ocean,'' said Tiffany Garren of  
Columbus, Ohio, as she watched the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse move 
its first few inches on Thursday. ``I was really glad I could say I 
was here when they moved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse inched along as the move resumed this morning.  
</P>
<P>
	On the first moving day, the 208-foot lighthouse was rolled  
silently 10 feet, 4 inches in about an hour. Rangers had expected 
to hear a screeching, metal-on-metal sound. 
</P>
<P>
	National Park Service officials said they were confident the  
lighthouse could safely be moved along rails, pushed by hydraulic 
jacks. But the first push of about 5 inches made them feel better. 
A cheer went up from the crowd as the landmark's trek began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we've really gotten someplace,'' said Bob  
Reynolds, superintendent of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. He 
rode atop the lighthouse during its incremental move, standing on a 
circular platform near an American flag draped over the railing. 
</P>
<P>
	Threatened with destruction by the encroaching sea, the  
white-and-black barber-pole-striped lighthouse is being moved 2,900 
feet inland, a trip that will take four to six weeks. The 4,800-ton 
brick tower, which was built in 1870 to warn ships away from shoals 
off a flat shoreline, is set to reopen next Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will cost taxpayers $10 million and keep the lighthouse  
safe for more than a century, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone feels good about the relocation. John Hooper, owner  
of a motel in this Hatteras Island village, said he wished the 
lighthouse had been left on the shore, and felt it could have been 
saved with wave barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, I was sure they could do it,'' said Hooper, who  
led a committee that opposed the move. ``It was just the wrong 
bureaucratic decision.''

<HEADLINE> Modano Gets Pep Talk From Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Mike Modano had one of his best all-around  
games in the Stanley Cup finals on Thursday night. His incentive? A 
phone call from coach Ken Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock had called his star player the night before the game  
to offer his support. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to win this series, Mike had to be a player of  
significance whether or not he scored a point,'' Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently Hitchcock wasn't happy with Modano's performance in  
the Stars' 2-1 loss to Buffalo in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a phone call getting him to think in some other  
direction,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think he took it to heart and he 
went about his business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock felt Modano was more involved in the Stars' game on  
Thursday night, assisting on a goal by Darryl Sydor as Dallas beat 
Buffalo to take a 3-2 lead in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Modano of the phone call from Hitchcock:  
</P>
<P>
	``He just plain and simple asked me what type of player I was  
going to be., I told him I was going to be a player who is very 
involved in every aspect of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT STANDING PAT:* What a tough year it's been for Pat Verbeek.  
The onetime 40-goal scorer only had 17 goals for the Dallas Stars 
and when he went down with a knee injury in the last month of the 
season, he thought for sure he'd never get into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was wrong. He missed the first round, but came back in the  
second. And Thursday night's goal which helped the Stars beat 
Buffalo 2-0 in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals had Verbeek feeling 
a lot better about himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just tremendous to be a hockey player and I am really  
enjoying myself right now,'' Verbeek said after scoring his first 
goal and first point of the finals. ``It's just fun to be an 
athlete and to be able to play in front of a crowd like we did 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ARGUABLE CALL:* Tempers are getting shorter as the Stanley Cup  
finals get longer. Now even the coaches are getting into it. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of Game 5 on Thursday night featured a shouting match  
between Buffalo's Lindy Ruff and Ken Hitchcock of the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was angry because Hitch was angry at me, so I guess we were  
both emotional '' Ruff said. ``He started yelling at me. I was 
yelling back. The crowd was so loud, I couldn't hear what he was 
yelling. I doubt if he could hear what I was yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock was asked about the incident after the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of like two guys from Alberta saying hello to each  
other,'' the Stars' coach said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEFENSE FIRST:* The Buffalo Sabres are known as a defensive  
team, and it shows -- even in their offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Their current 1-2 scorers in the playoffs are defensemen Jason  
Woolley and Alexei Zhitnik. No Stanley Cup finalist has finished 
the playoffs with defensemen as their top two scorers. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE POWER TO THEM:* If form holds true in Game 6 Saturday  
night in Buffalo, the Sabres shouldn't count too heavily on their 
power play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars are having great penalty-killing success on the road  
in the playoffs, having stopped 49 of 52 power plays by their 
opponents for a 94.2 per cent ratio. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two earlier Stanley Cup finals games at the Marine  
Midland Arena, the Stars stopped all 13 power plays by the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OFF AND WINGING IN BUFFALO:* The Sabres will have a better  
chance against the Stars in Saturday's game if they score first. 
They're 7-1 in the playoffs when scoring first at home. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MUTUAL ADMIRATION:* Mike Modano is one of Ken Hitchcock's  
favorite players. The feeling is mutual for Modano, who likes 
Hitchcock as a coach and all-around person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have spent a lot of time together and I am able to say some  
things candidly only to him that maybe I can't say to other 
players,'' Hitchcock says. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano says their relationship ``has gotten a lot better. Our  
communication line is very open and he has a lot of great thoughts 
and opinions on things, not just hockey.''

<HEADLINE> Reclusive Actress Sues Winemaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Reclusive actress Hedy Lamarr has sued  
winemaker E&AMP;J Gallo, claiming it used unauthorized footage of her 
in a television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamarr, 85, filed the lawsuit here Wednesday in federal court.  
She is seeking unspecified damages and an order to stop the company 
from further use of her image. 
</P>
<P>
	The sultry star of such hits as the 1949 film ``Samson and  
Delilah'' said the advertisement for the company's Gossamer Bay 
Wines violates her privacy and deceives the public about her 
connection to the winery. 
</P>
<P>
	Several friends and family members alerted Lamarr to the  
commercial in May, said her attorney, Michael McDonnell. 
</P>
<P>
	In the commercial, a young couple is fighting over the  
television remote control. The man wants to watch a Western or 
sports program and the woman wants to watch a movie starring 
Lamarr. They compromise by turning off the television and drinking 
some wine, McDonnell said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallo spokeswoman Kimberly Charles said company officials were  
taken aback by the lawsuit since they hadn't received any 
complaints or demands to stop the commercial from Lamarr. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time a company using Lamarr's beautiful face  
has heard from her. Last year, she sued a Canadian company that 
used her image on its Internet site for graphic design software. 
The two sides eventually reached an out-of-court settlement.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The New York Knicks' momentous injury woes  
took on an air that was almost surreal before Game 2 of the NBA 
Finals on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	While center Chris Dudley was on the court testing his  
hyperextended elbow, Latrell Sprewell was besieged by reporters who 
had heard rumors that he had jammed a finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fine,'' a puzzled Sprewell said. ``There's nothing wrong  
with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Equally puzzled, but satisfied for the moment, reporters stepped  
back and let Sprewell walk to the court for the pregame 
shoot-around. As Sprewell reached the doorway, reserve Rick Brunson 
joked, ``Hey Spree, how's your jammed finger?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour earlier, Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said in  
the hallway of the Alamodome that he was not optimistic that Dudley 
would be able to start. Dudley, for those keeping track of the 
Knicks' M-A-S-H unit, is the 6-foot-11 backup who's in the lineup 
because Patrick Ewing is lost for the year with a torn Achilles' 
tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley appeared to be shooting fine. When he returned to the  
locker room, he said, ``It's a lot better than it was this morning. 
I'm going to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, this did not change the fact that Dudley was holding  
his right elbow -- the one on his shooting arm -- at nearly a 
90-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
	Have you heard? The Knicks are banged up.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Dudley and Larry Johnson, who is playing with a  
sprained knee, Marcus Camby has a sore knee from banging it against 
one of the Spurs in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' petition to the NBA's board of governors to add  
6-foot-8 forward Ben Davis to the playoff roster due to injury 
hardships was rejected 15-11 on Wednesday. There were two 
abstentions, and the Knicks didn't have a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest bumps and bruises made the vote even more  
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just unfortunate,'' Van Gundy said. ``But there's nothing  
we can do about it. The thing is, we still have to get the job 
done. We feel we can win. Every injury you have, it makes our 
margin of error -- and we didn't have much -- goes down. We just have 
to play better. That's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ICEMAN'S ARRIVAL:* About an hour before the game, George Gervin  
arrived at the Alamodome to his usual warm reception. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, hey, hey!'' the Hall of Famer shouted to his adoring fans  
as he walked into the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``This means everything,'' Gervin said. ``I've been around this  
community a long time, and they've supported this San Antonio 
franchise dearly, man. And to have this opportunity, to be in this 
big old dome at this time to generate enough room for 39,000 of our 
fans come see the guys make a run for the world championship, it's 
real exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gervin, who led the Spurs from the ABA to the NBA and won three  
straight scoring titles in the 1980s, briefly addressed the team's 
desire for a new arena. The Spurs say they need a new arena in 
order to remain profitable. San Antonio politicians have been 
reluctant to push for a new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we as the Spurs, we need to explain ourselves and let  
the people know what this is going to do and educate the people,'' 
said Gervin, who works in the team's community relations 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you like this. We've got a big venue like this and  
we only have 8,500 season ticket-holders. Everywhere else you go, 
they've got 17,000 season ticket-holders. It puts us in a bad 
spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOWDY, SPIKE:* Knicks fan Spike Lee made a grand entrance -- to  
tremendous boos -- shortly before game time. Lee, the film maker 
who's had a courtside seat at Madison Square Garden for the better 
part of a decade, had an even more interesting entrance shortly 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lee and his orange-clad entourage walked toward the private  
entrance to the Alamodome, they were chased by several fans yelling 
his name. A security guard rushed to block the onrushers and escort 
Lee into the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush also attended the game. Bruce Hornsby  
performed the national anthem on piano -- but without his partner, 
Branford Marsalis. The two won an Emmy Award in 1995 for their 
rendition of the ``Star Spangled Banner.''

<HEADLINE> Daly Back in Hunt in Another Major  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- This was a good day for John Daly.  
</P>
<P>
	The hero of the everyman strolled up the 18th fairway with his  
shaggy blonde hair, orange-tinted sunglasses, expansive belly and 
cigarette dangling from his lips, soaking up the cheers of the 
gallery at Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows if the adulation will last another day. Not even  
Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many times, he's fallen off the wagon of sobriety. Too many  
times, he's stumbled into an abyss of gambling debts and other 
personal woes. Too many times, he's staggered off the golf course, 
uncertain if this bedeviling game is really worth all the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who is going to show up tomorrow,'' Daly said  
after shooting a 2-under-par 68 Thursday in the first round of the 
U.S. Open, putting him only shot behind four players tied for the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of scary, but I want to soak this day in and pat  
myself on the back for a round that I very much needed for myself 
and my self-esteem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly is a baffling, complex man, capable of pushing aside his  
demons every so often to demonstrate considerable skills with a 
club in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Daly won the PGA Championship. In 1995, he captured the  
British Open. The calendar says it's time for another major title. 
</P>
<P>
	``John can play that well at any time,'' said Tigers Woods, tied  
with Daly heading into today's second round. ``He's got so much 
talent. Yeah, he hits it a long way, but he's also got a wonderful 
short game. People overlook his touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who has only four PGA Tour victories in his career,  
provided scant signs in recent weeks that he was ready to contend. 
He had missed the cut or withdrawn from eight of 16 events this 
season, including a meltdown at the Memorial two weeks ago. He 
dropped out after six-putting on the 18th green to cap a 
first-round 82. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am about as much in shock as everybody else,'' said Daly,  
who started the Open with three straight birdies. ``I got off to a 
great start, and that's something I haven't done in a long time. To 
birdie the first three holes in the U.S. Open just doesn't happen 
too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And to think, Daly considered skipping the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he was one of nine players to shoot under par in the  
first round at The Olympic Club in San Francisco, only to finish 
with rounds of 75, 75 and 78. He was tired of Opens with narrow 
fairways and 5-inch rough taking the driver out of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daly decided to come to North Carolina after hearing of the  
wide, flat fairways where he could whale away with his big stick. 
He did just that Thursday, using only one iron off the tee on a 
par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, Daly appeals to those fans who ``ooh'' and ``aah'' a  
booming drive -- no matter where it lands -- and serenade golfers 
with a chorus of ``You da man!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a major championship should be played to where you've  
got to play golf and not having to hit the 4-, 5- and 3-irons off 
the tees,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With typical candor, Daly discussed his ongoing battle with  
alcoholism that still seems capable of destroying his career at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are days when I get down on sobriety,'' said Daly, who  
has been seeing a sports psychologist the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, he revealed to the News &AMP; Record of Greensboro, N.C.,  
that he gambled away $9 million during the mid-1990s, sometimes 
wagering more than $200,000 on a single hand of blackjack. He 
managed to pay off most of the gambling debts but is struggling to 
cope with dwindling earnings on the PGA Tour -- less than $22,000 in 
the last three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``John is coming around,'' Payne Stewart insisted. ``I think he  
is in control of his life and he has thought of a way to play this 
golf course and he's doing a good job of it. More power to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was a model of consistency on his first trip around  
Pinehurst, except for an errant drive on No. 18 that cost him a 
bogey and a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. Upon receiving a boisterous welcome from fans  
surrounding the final green, Daly broke into a wide smile and 
waved. Afterwards, he gobbled down six cheeseburgers and a bag of 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans were awesome,'' Daly said. ``They've been that way  
throughout my career, through all the ups and downs. It was nice to 
show them the old John Daly. I'm not saying it's going to happen 
every day. But I owe it to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe it to myself.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Begin Work on New Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers started construction  
of their $233 million stadium Friday amid memories of Super Bowls 
past and high expectations for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Dan Rooney and his son, Art Rooney II, Gov. Tom  
Ridge, Mayor Tom Murphy, coach Bill Cowher and other politicians 
used shovels in the dirt on the riverfront site in a symbolic 
beginning of stadium construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought we would get here,'' said the younger Rooney,  
the team vice president. ``But there were days with a lot of dark 
clouds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1997, voters in 11 southwestern Pennsylvania  
counties overwhelmingly rejected a sales tax to raise funds for new 
stadiums for the Steelers and Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' need for a new home wasn't as urgent as that of  
the Pirates, but Dan Rooney said they couldn't afford to fall 
behind in a division in which four rivals would have new stadiums 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	So city and county leaders went for so-called Plan B, finding  
the money for new stadiums and an expanded Lawrence Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The money came from sales taxes, the state, a tax on hotel rooms  
and contributions from the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said political wrangling and skepticism from taxpayers  
and lawmakers showed how ``there are 100 people telling you why you 
can't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here today because we believed in ourselves,'' Murphy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new stadiums are the centerpiece of the most dramatic  
facelift in Pittsburgh's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention center will triple in size and two downtown city  
blocks will be rebuilt with new stores and restaurants. Several new 
hotels also are expected. A trolley line will be extended to the 
North Side to shuttle fans to the stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates broke ground on the $228 million, 38,000-seat PNC  
Park in April. It and the Steelers' 65,000-seat stadium will be on 
opposite sides of Three Rivers Stadium, which will be torn down 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Steelers defensive tackle ``Mean'' Joe Greene, a catalyst  
in four Super Bowl wins and now defensive line coach for the 
Arizona Cardinals, attended Friday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared to be more like the softie who gave his jersey to a  
young Henry Thomas in a famous Coca-Cola commercial than the man 
who inspired fear in offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steeler fans do set the standard,'' he said to approving hoots  
and cheers. ``I miss you guys. Being such great fans, you do 
deserve a stadium that brings you into the millennium. Three Rivers 
has served its purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steelers players and coaches of past and present -- Franco  
Harris, Paul Brown, Chuck Noll, Kordell Stewart and Cowher -- sat on 
a makeshift stage close to where the scoreboard will be. The open 
south end will highlight Pittsburgh's skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	A park on the south end likely will be named for team founder  
Art Rooney, whose statue will be moved from Three Rivers. The park 
will have docks for the riverboats of Pittsburgh and will be the 
northernmost home of the Delta Queen travel boat. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans also call for a football museum and sidewalks bearing the  
names and numbers of Steelers greats such as Harris and Terry 
Bradshaw. The nearby street will be Steeler Way.

<HEADLINE> Women Will Also Officiate in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the first time at the Women's World Cup, all the officials  
will be women. 
</P>
<P>
	``If women are playing, women should referee them,'' said FIFA  
spokesman Keith Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Sonia Denoncourt will referee the opening match between  
the United States and Denmark in Giants Stadium Saturday. Cooper 
said Denoncourt was chosen because she was ``the most experienced 
referee in the group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is one problem with the all-women policy: It's very  
difficult to get experienced female referees. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these girls are unknown quantities,'' he said.  
``We'll try the girls out and see how they go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's tests for the referees, FIFA emphasized ``the  
human touch'' more than the laws of the game. ``We concentrated on 
building the confidence of referees and the assistants who have 
never had the experience of refereeing in front of huge crowds,'' 
Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening game is expected to fill Giants Stadium with about  
80,000 people. Denoncourt probably has not seen a crowd like that 
before but refereeing an opening game for the Women's World Cup is 
not new to her. She called the first match in Sweden for the 1995 
Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL-STAR FIRST:* For the first time, an all-star team will be  
selected at the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The MasterCard All-Star team, sanctioned by FIFA, the world  
governing body for soccer, will support FIFA's official charity, 
SOS Children's Villages. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 16 players will be selected by the FIFA Technical  
Study Group, a panel comprised of seven FIFA technical committee 
members. The group is coordinated by Tatjana Haenni and includes 
Sylvie Beliveau of Canada, Futaba Kioka of Japan, Elisabeth Loisel 
of France, Gunilla Paijkull of Sweden, Vera Pauw of the 
Netherlands, and Chief A. Onigbinde of Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the quarterfinals, finalists will be selected and the  
team will be chosen after the semifinals on July 4. The team will 
be revealed in Los Angeles on July 8, two days before the final at 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	On behalf of the 16 players selected, MasterCard will donate  
$16,000 to the SOS Children's Villages, which provide homes for 
disadvantaged children. MasterCard also selected all-star teams at 
six previous FIFA championships, including the last two men's World 
Cups, leading to donations of more than $1 million to international 
charities on behalf of soccer players worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO SMOKING:* FIFA has asked coaches and officials of all 16  
teams not to smoke on the bench during the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA made the same request at the 1998 men's World Cup in France  
but coaches didn't complying. Daniel Passarella the coach for 
Argentina and Austria's coach Herbert Prohaska could be seen 
lighting up during matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done all we could to try to get the coaches not to  
smoke, or at least not to smoke when the TV cameras are on them,'' 
federation spokesman Keith Cooper said then. ``But it's the freedom 
of the individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year things will be different.  
</P>
<P>
	In accordance with local antismoking laws, all stadiums for the  
Women's World Cup this year are non-smoking areas. The Organizing 
Committee is working together with the US Department of Human 
Services and Health to support an anti-smoking campaign. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OFFICIAL DEFIBRILLATOR:* The Women's World Cup has an official  
defibrillator for use in players urgent care centers at various 
match venues. 
</P>
<P>
	The HP Heartstream ForeRunner automated external defibrillator  
(AED) is portable which enables medical personnel to get to victims 
of sudden cardiac arrest fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having AEDs available at sporting events such as the Women's  
World Cup is essential to providing the speed and efficacy needed 
to save lives,'' said Dr. Bert Mandelbaum, the medical director at 
the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The HP ForeRunner AED is a popular defibrillator in sports. It's  
also used by the Unites States Golf Association and the National 
Ski Patrol and several NFL and NBA teams.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Marginally Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed marginally higher today as  
investor optimism about interest rates overcame profit concerns 
about Intel and Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
was up 13.93 at 10,855.56. The Dow gained 365.05 this week, having 
risen each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 was up 1.69 to 1,341.59 and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 16.17 to 2,560.32, according to preliminary calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's No. 1 maker of chips for personal computers,  
fell after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. cuts its rating on the 
stock because of delays in launching a new chip for laptop 
computers. But other computer and semiconductor shares held their 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``This seems to be a company-specific not industry-specific  
issue,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, Gillette fell after the razor  
and blade maker warned second-quarter profits will miss analysts' 
forecasts for the rest of this year because of weak sales in 
Brazil, Russia and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dampened earnings outlook for the two big companies came a  
day after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that 
only a modest interest rate hike may be needed to keep inflation 
well-tamed. His comments had a generally soothing effect on the 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the news on Gillette and Intel, market watchers remain  
optmistic about second-quarter earnings, which will be released 
next month. ``We are going to see some pleasant surprises and that 
will be the norm, not the exception,'' Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan expects earnings to propel the Dow back over 11,000, which  
it last reached on May 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, there was still caution on Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are still not in the most frendliest interest rate  
environment and with bond yields still in the 6 percent area the 
trading has become choppy,'' said Steven Goldman, market strategist 
at Weeden &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the NYSE, with 1,557 up, 1,404 down and 604 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 902.30 million shares as of 4 p.m., up from  
694.63 million in Thursday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.48 to 636.55, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.12 to 768.57 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.07 to 445.45.

<HEADLINE> Judge Ruling on Drugs For Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russell Weston Jr.'s long history of skipping  
medication to treat his mental illness could end today, The 
Washington Times reports. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan is scheduled to rule  
during a hearing this morning on whether Weston should be forced to 
take drugs to control schizophrenia so he can stand trial in the 
killings of two Capitol Police officers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan committed Weston, 42, to the Federal Corrections Center  
in Butner, N.C., on May 5 for treatment after determining he was 
incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston has refused medication and it's not clear how drugs might  
be administered if he still refuses to be medicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston had not been taking medicine for years before he was  
arrested in the July 24 killings of officers Jacob J. Chestnut, 58, 
and John M. Gibson, 42. 
</P>
<P>
	``The diagnosis is he's a chronic schizophrenic. He has had the  
disease for over 20 years,'' said Barry Boss, an assistant federal 
public defender representing Weston. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Weston knew what he was doing when he shot  
the officers. Investigators believe Weston was planning an attack 
on the federal government for at least five days before the 
murders.

<HEADLINE> Iomega Cuts 450 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega Corp. is cutting 450 jobs, or 10 percent  
of its workforce, as it struggles to recover from sluggish sales of 
its computer storage products and the loss of top managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega said Friday it will lose 5 cents to 10 cents a share in  
the current financial quarter, excluding a restructuring charge, 
compared to analysts' expectations of zero profits. A year earlier, 
the company lost 13 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock plunged nearly 16 percent in early trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange. It closed down 56 1/4 cents a share, 
or by almost 13 percent, at $3.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to take a second-quarter charge of $45 million  
to pay for restructuring its operations, which includes shutting 
plants in San Jose and San Diego, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost-cutting is expected to save $40 million a year.  
</P>
<P>
	Iomega tied its disappointing results to weak sales of its Jaz  
drive and disks, a delay in shipping its Clik! PC Card drive and 
parts shortages resulting in slow sales of Zip drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega disclosed Wednesday that it was losing three top  
executives and two other key company officials.

<HEADLINE> Stars Now One Away From Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Darryl Sydor and Pat Verbeek came out of hiding,  
and the Dallas Stars are now one victory away from their first 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor and Verbeek didn't have a point in the first four games of  
the finals, but they each scored a goal Thursday night as the Stars 
beat the Buffalo Sabres 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have a 3-2 lead and can wrap up the best-of-7 series  
with a victory in Game 6 Saturday night in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't done much offensively, I guess,'' said Sydor, who  
had two goals and nine assists in 17 previous playoffs games. ``But 
that is one thing that I have learned, not to get down or force 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just try and relax and have fun and work hard. That is all  
you can ask yourself, and usually good things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say the same thing for Verbeek after a tough season that  
featured only 17 goals and a knee injury near the end of the year 
that kept him out of the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was injured with three games left in the season, I was  
depressed,'' Verbeek said. ``I didn't think I was going to get to 
play in the playoffs, and I didn't know how long the injury would 
take (to heal). 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got my chance in the next round with St. Louis, I felt  
very comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeek accumulated two goals and four assists before the  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The goals by Sydor and Verbeek were typical of the Stars, who  
like to spread the scoring around. Eight players have scored goals 
in the first five games of the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team all year has been a team where somebody different  
steps up, and we don't force things,'' Sydor said. ``Sure, we have 
some key players in Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk and Brett Hull, but 
we don't really rely on one guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Thursday night's game was a close one between these  
two closely matched teams. It was a one-goal game until Verbeek 
scored with 4:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars and Sabres have been either tied or one goal apart for  
all but 5:05 in their five games, including one in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we worked extremely hard,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff  
said. ``Even in the third period, we let it all hang out. We had 
the pressure on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games are so tight, a team that gets the break or scores  
the power-play goal obviously gets the upper hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff had to be thinking about Sydor's goal. Sydor gave the Stars  
a 1-0 lead with a power-play goal at 2:23 of the second period, his 
third goal of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano set up Sydor with a great cross-ice pass. Sydor gathered  
in the puck, skated in a few feet and beat Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could feel it, maybe half an inch; just barely touched it,''  
Hasek said. ``If it was a half an inch closer to me, I would have 
made the save. But he found that spot in the top corner of the 
net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was still plenty of drama left.  
</P>
<P>
	``They did a very good job of not making many mistakes,''  
Buffalo's Dixon Ward said, ``and we didn't make many, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Verbeek made it 2-0 late in the game when he took a  
pass from Richard Matvichuk, faked Hasek of position and put a 
backhander behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a mistake that Hasek couldn't afford to make, considering  
the way Ed Belfour was playing goal for the Stars. He made 23 saves 
as he recorded the first shutout in the finals since Colorado's 
Patrick Roy blanked Florida 1-0 in triple overtime of Game 4 in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie had a very good game, especially in the third period  
when he made a couple of really good saves,'' said Hasek, who 
stopped 19 shots himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Stars have two cracks to win their first Cup. If they  
don't win in Buffalo, there's always a Game 7 back in Dallas on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An ominous note for Buffalo: No team has rallied from a 3-2  
deficit after losing Game 5 to win the Stanley Cup since Montreal 
in 1971, and only three of 15 teams overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so intense, the only confidence we have is we're up  
3-2,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``There's no dominant 
player, no dominant area. It is absolutely a shift-by-shift battle. 
There's just no read on the series.''

<HEADLINE> Drugmaker Ads Can Backfire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The advent of advertising prescription  
medications directly to consumers has been a bonanza for the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ads can sometimes produce their own unwanted side  
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, it is not unusual for a patient to visit their  
doctor to get a drug they saw on television, but end up getting a 
rival drug because the physician preferred a different product, a 
health industry researcher said at a drug advertising conference in 
New York on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	This highlights one of the inherent risks to promoting  
prescription drugs directly to consumers: Unlike any other product 
promotion, no matter how well an ad persuades consumers to ask for 
a drug, they still need a physician's permission to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	A study unveiled at the conference found that about a third of  
the consumers who saw a drug ad have talked to a doctor about it. 
Of those inspired to request a particular drug because of an ad, 
about one in four received a prescription from their doctor, but 
not necessarily for the drug they requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 1,000 adults was commissioned by both Time and  
Health magazines and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 
percentage points. The magazines are among those to have profited 
from the rise in pharmaceutical advertising directed at consumers, 
which took off in 1997 when the Food and Drug Administration 
relaxed rules governing disclosure of risks and side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical companies spent $1.35 billion on  
direct-to-consumer advertising in 1998, a 24 percent increase over 
1997 and three times the 1995 amount, according to market research 
firm IMS Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise of consumer advertising is a major factor behind the  
recent surge in pharmaceutical sales, experts say. Prescription 
drug sales totaled $94 billion in 1998, a 16 percent increase from 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending big dollars on consumer targeted drug campaign can pay  
big dividends. For example, Schering-Plough spent $136 million 
advertising allergy drug Claritin last year and generated $1.9 
billion in U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But such consumer marketing campaigns can also backfire.  
</P>
<P>
	``The highest spending does not equate to generate the most  
prescriptions. A lot of money is spent on new products but doctors 
write prescriptions for competitive products,'' said Suzanne 
Ramspacher, an official with market research firm IMS Health of 
Plymouth Meeting, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Merck spent $41 million on consumer advertising for  
its cholesterol-lowering drug Zocor last year, six times the amount 
its competitor Warner-Lambert spent promoting its drug, Lipitor, 
according to Competitive Media Reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck may have inadvertently helped Lipitor with its campaign,  
said Ramspacher. That's because Merck's heavy advertising drove 
consumers to doctors for the medication, but physicians 
increasingly have prescribed Lipitor. In the last two years, 
Lipitor has dominated the U.S. cholesterol-lowering market, and now 
outsells its nearest competitor, Zocor, almost 2-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers Squibb's cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol has  
met a similar fate as Zocor. Bristol Myers spent a total of $126 
million advertising Pravachol in 1997 and 1998, only to lose market 
share to Zocor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the risk they take going out there,'' said Julie Kline,  
marketing analyst with Scott-Levin, a drug industry consulting firm 
in Newtown, Pa. ``Bristol unintentionally helped Warner-Lambert ... 
and that's not what you want to happen when you spend $67 
million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers has since discontinued its consumer advertising of  
Pravachol.

<HEADLINE> Clemson Holds Up Hiring of Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Clemson University is holding up the hiring  
of a new women's head track coach after protests from the college's 
President's Commission on the Status of Women. 
</P>
<P>
	The university said Monday that Ralph White, currently an  
assistant coach with the men's track team, would take the job and 
replace Ron Garner, who resigned June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	That is now on hold in response ``to campus concerns that no  
women or minority candidates were interviewed or given 
consideration,'' Clemson President Constantine ``Deno'' Curris said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Curris, who was traveling Friday, couldn't be reached for  
comment. Clemson athletic director Bobby Robinson also was 
traveling and couldn't be reached. White did not respond 
immediately to two messages left at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, Curris said he plans to meet with Robinson to  
discuss White's appointment next week and that he has asked the 
university's Office of Access and Equity to review White's 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from Brenda Vander Mey, a sociology professor and  
chairwoman of the Status of Women commission, prompted Curris to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary issue is hiring for a job without a competitive  
process, Vander Mey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if one conducts an internal search, that search should be  
... made public. I didn't see an announcement that there was 
internal search,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, for Clemson, we should have a broad-based external  
search as well. ... We want to be as competitive as we can be,'' 
Vander Mey said.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Thrashers Sign First Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers, still without a coach or a  
completed arena, signed their first player on Friday, Ottawa 
Senators goalie Damian Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's 28th team, which makes its debut in September, traded  
Friday for the 30-year-old Rhodes, who shared goaltending duties 
this season with Ron Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes was acquired in exchange for future considerations,  
Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said. He said Rhodes, a 
restricted free agent, agreed to a four-year contract, the details 
of which weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes made $1.6 million last season.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely excited to name Damian as the first player in  
the history of the organization,'' Waddell said. ``Goaltending is 
the cornerstone of this franchise, and we are thrilled to add such 
a proven netminder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes had a 22-13-7 record and a 2.44 goals-against average in  
45 games this season. Ottawa, which finished second in the Eastern 
Conference with a 44-23-15 record, was eliminated in the first 
round of the playoffs by Buffalo in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very positive about this,'' Rhodes said from Los  
Angeles during a conference call. ``I wasn't getting the playing 
time I wanted in Ottawa, but I didn't say anything because I didn't 
want to rock the boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell said the future considerations would involve the  
expansion draft, which will be held next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes said the toughest change will be going from a contending  
club to a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the way I look at it, I'll get some more work,'' Rhodes  
said. ``I feel that I'm a better goalie when I get a lot of shots. 
Who knows, maybe we can grab some excitement the first year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 190-pound Rhodes, a native of St. Paul, Minn., was  
drafted by Toronto in the sixth round in 1987. He is 85-92-37 in 
228 games in a seven-year NHL career with Toronto and Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> Hearn Leads Provisional CART Grid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The top of the provisional lineup for  
Sunday's Budweiser-G.I. Joe's 200 looked a little unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
	There on the tentative pole was Richie Hearn, whose best start  
in the first six races this season has been 18th. Alongside on the 
front row was Patrick Carpentier, with Robby Gordon close behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Way down the 28-car grid were the names everybody expects to be  
on top -- Juan Montoya, Dario Franchitti, Greg Moore, Michael 
Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, you can't control the weather,'' said Andretti, who was  
among the drivers caught by a heavy downpour in the first of two 
qualifying sessions on Friday at Portland International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first of two days of time trials on a road course, the  
fastest drivers from the last road race on the schedule go out 
first, followed by the slower drivers from the previous event and 
any newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, it worked to the advantage of the also-rans as the  
1.969-mile, nine-turn circuit became considerably drier late in 
their session, allowing most of the drivers to switch from grooved 
rain tires to slicks for at least a few laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the guy that got the last full, clean lap without  
getting caught up in traffic was going to be on the pole,'' Gordon 
said. ``Everybody was really going for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hearn's fast lap was 117.369 mph, followed by Carpentier at  
117.017 and Gordon at 115.941. In contrast, Franchitti, who was the 
fastest driver in the wet opening session, had a fast lap of 
99.641. 
</P>
<P>
	The top spot changed at least 10 times in the last 15 minutes of  
the 30-minute session, with Hearn's Reynard-Toyota winding up on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous boost for our team,'' said Hearn, who  
drives for John Della-Penna. ``Our qualifying has really stunk. No 
matter what happens the rest of the weekend, this feels real good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be praying for rain tomorrow.''  
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Hearn and the rest of the drivers at the top  
of the provisional grid, the forecast for Saturday's final round of 
qualifying called for sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time that a Toyota-powered car has won a  
provisional pole, both on rainy days when the slower drivers got 
the benefit of the faster session. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Papis, then driving for Arciero-Wells Racing, was the  
provisional pole winner last June in Detroit. He slipped back to 
19th on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who slid into a tire barrier early in his session,  
shrugged off the virtually lost opening qualifying, which was 
red-flagged to a halt twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team fixed the car right away, but we had to sit on pit  
lane and serve an eight-minute penalty for causing a red flag,'' 
the Scotsman said. ``We didn't get back out onto the track until 4 1/2 
minutes left in the session. Then it was really just a matter of 
hanging on, seeing where the puddles were and trying to go as fast 
as we could. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty tricky, especially with the spray. You couldn't  
really see that much. But we're ready for whatever tomorrow 
brings.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Steel, Oil, Gas Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate offered relief today for U.S.  
steel, oil and natural gas producers hurt by fallen prices, passing 
legislation that would let them borrow up to $1.5 billion to help 
tide themselves over. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-34 vote came one day after supporters made changes to  
ensure that taxpayer funding needed to back the loans would not 
come from Social Security reserves. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., has promised to let the House vote on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``A vote for this bill is a `Buy American' vote, a vote of  
confidence in American steel, American workers and American 
families,'' Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said before passage. ``A 
vote against the bill sends a very different message. It says, `Buy 
Russia. Buy Japanese. Buy South Korean.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., called the program a  
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I don't want to help the steel industry or help  
the oil and gas industries,'' he said today. ``I don't think giving 
government-guaranteed loans is the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loan measure was the first of several steel-related bills to  
reach the Senate floor. The full Senate is expected to consider on 
Tuesday a bill that would establish comprehensive quotas on foreign 
steel shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has sought relief from low-priced imports  
that reached record levels in 1998 because of the Asian economic 
crisis. Oil and gas provisions were added to the loan bill at the 
insistence of Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative senators criticized the $270 million in taxpayer  
spending needed to back the new loans, saying the money would come 
directly from Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	To address that criticism, the bill's backers agreed to remove  
the measure's ``emergency'' designation. By doing so, they 
guaranteed that lawmakers would have to cut other programs before 
they could pay for the loans. Supporters have targeted cuts in 
administrative travel expenses to pay for the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some critics were not swayed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is always easy and always tempting to say if anyone in  
America loses their job for any reason, then the government should 
be doing something about it,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators also agreed to other changes aimed at removing politics  
from the loan-approval process and requiring private lenders to 
share in at least 15 percent of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the loans would help domestic steel producers  
unable to compete with low-priced imports and U.S. oil and natural 
gas industries struggling because of sagging prices. Officials say 
the three industries have suffered tens of thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1 billion in steel loans, with companies  
eligible to borrow up to $250 million at market interest rates. 
U.S. oil and gas producers and service companies would be able to 
borrow up to $10 million each from a $500 million fund. As part of 
the agreement, supporters dropped provisions setting minimum loan 
amounts.

<HEADLINE> Russian Figure Skater on Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Two-time world champion Alexei Yagudin was put on  
probation for one year by the Russian Figure Skating Federation for 
improper behavior during a tour last month. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be allowed to compete, however, but with the warning  
that any further indiscreet behavior would result in a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, 19, was bounced from the John Hancock Champions on Ice  
tour after a show in Denver on May 27. He returned to Russia and 
was examined by doctors, who reportedly found nothing to support 
speculation that the skater's behavior was due to heavy drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Russian federation, Valentin Piseyev, said  
Yagudin was sorry for his behavior and promised not to repeat it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made a harsh decision, but the probation will allow  
Yagudin to continue taking part in competitions,'' Piseyev was 
quoted today as saying of the probation in the daily newspaper 
Segodnya. ``However, the very first violation of discipline on his 
part would block him from that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Alexei has learned a serious lesson and is very upset  
over this whole story.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Releases Hold on Denmark Pork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pork from Denmark will be allowed to enter the  
United States after being deemed safe from a dioxin food scare that 
has wracked Europe, U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Danish government has provided . . . sufficient  
information to demonstrate that Danish pork is safe for 
consumers,'' said Thomas Billy, administrator of the Agriculture 
Department's food safety and inspection service. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and poultry products produced in European Union member  
states have been on hold at U.S. ports-of-entry since June 3 
because feed contaminated with the cancer-causing chemical dioxin 
had been fed to animals in Belgium, France and The Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries, including Jordan and China, have implemented  
similar bans since the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 75 million pounds of pork product shipped to the U.S.  
from the European Union between January and May, nearly 55 million 
pounds of pork came from Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hold was necessary because of concerns that open trading  
among EU member states may have spread contamination beyond its 
original boundaries,'' Billy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy said all other European countries that have shipped pork  
or poultry to the United States during 1999 must provide 
satisfactory written assurances before their products will be 
released from hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional testing and surveillance measures will also be  
implemented to protect consumers.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Corn Race Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and corn futures raced higher Friday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as private weather reports forecast hot, 
dry weather next week in key growing states. Wheat futures 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the gains as some private weather models predicted  
the ridge would form next week and linger over Iowa, one of the 
nation's largest corn- and soybean-growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather could scorch recently sprouted crops and lower  
yields, helping boost prices that have been in the doldrums amid 
excellent growing weather and expectations for another bumper 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	While National Weather Service models call for normal  
temperatures across the Midwest over the next 30 days, investors 
were betting updated forecasts would incorporate the potential over 
the short-term for the high-pressure ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated amid expectations hot, dry weather would  
speed harvesting of winter wheat. Farmers have experienced repeated 
delays in harvesting in some parts of the Plains because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1/4 cent to $2.54 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1/2 cent to 
$1.17 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans rose 11 3/4 cents to $4.74 3/4 a bushel.

	Meat and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange.

feeder cattle fell 0.20 cent to 77.12 cents a pound; July lean hogs

	Russia, U.S. Resume Kosovo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- U.S. and Russian negotiators opened a  
third day of talks today on Kosovo peacekeeping, searching to end a 
deadlock over Russia's demand that it play an equal role with NATO 
countries. The negotiations, which broke off yesterday, resumed 
this morning for an apparent final attempt to reach an agreement. 
Russia's insistence on an equal footing with NATO is frustrating 
U.S. efforts to draw Moscow into the Western alliance's plans for 
pacifying the province and returning its ethnic Albanian refugees.

	Revenge Against Serbs Feared

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers are trying to  
prevent ethnic Albanians from taking out their rage on Serbs and 
their Christian holy sites. Fears are growing that ethnic Albanian 
rebels may seek violent revenge for what's emerging as a frenzy of 
torture and killing by Serb forces in Kosovo during NATO's 78-day 
bombardment of Yugoslavia. To ward off retaliatory attacks from 
ethnic Albanian rebels, NATO stationed a tank to block the winding 
road leading to the Decane monastery in western Kosovo and another 
blocking the Serbian Orthodox monastery's gates.

Philip Duran, 22, is accused of providing a gun to a minor, a 
charge that carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison. He is

carries up to three years in prison. Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan

	Tests: SUV Bumpers Crumple Easily  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Sport utility vehicles have a tough image, but  
their bumpers are meek when it comes to a crash, a new study found. 
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety recently tested six 1999 
model midsize sport utility vehicles. Four of the six racked up a

	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars are one victory away from Stanley  
Cup silver after defeating the Buffalo Sabres 2-0 in Game 5 of the 
Stanley Cup Finals. Darryl Sydor scored a power-play goal in the 
second period and the Stars, the oldest team in the playoffs, held 
off the Sabres in yet another tightly played game last night for a 
3-2 series lead. With the Stars' Ed Belfour matching the 
better-known Dominik Hasek save for save in the closest finals in 
years, the Stars can hoist their first cup by winning Game 6 
Saturday in Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> Cavs Take Boston's First Round Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers said Friday they are  
going to exercise their option to use Boston's first round pick -- 
the eighth overall -- in this year's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavaliers acquired the selection in the March 11 trade with  
the Celtics that sent Vitaly Potapenko to Boston for Andrew 
DeClercq. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs had the right to use Boston's first round pick in the  
June 30 draft, as long as it wasn't one of the top three, or an 
unprotected Celtics draft choice in 2000 or 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland now has three draft picks -- the eighth and 11th in the  
first round, and one in the second round that will be the 39th 
overall.

<HEADLINE> Flaws Found in Web-Sold AIDS Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who have tested themselves at home  
for the AIDS virus may want to get an official test, the government 
warned Friday after buying some HIV kits sold on the Internet -- and 
discovering they gave false results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Using one of these kits could give a person who might be  
infected with HIV the false impression that he or she is not 
infected,'' the Federal Trade Commission warned in a consumer 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC recently tested at-home HIV test kits sold over the  
Internet by using a known HIV-infected sample -- so the tests should 
have signaled that the ``user'' was infected. Instead, in every 
case the kits signaled that the user was healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet ads falsely state or imply that the kits were approved  
by the World Health Organization, the Food and Drug Administration 
or another well-known health organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the FDA has approved just one at-home test kit for the  
AIDS virus -- Home Access Health Corp.'s Home Access Express HIV-1 
Test System. It does not give instant results. Instead, people mail 
a drop of blood on a special card to a laboratory and later call a 
hot line to learn the results from a trained counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Health Organization does not approve or license HIV  
tests, the consumer alert warned. 
</P>
<P>
	A Food and Drug Administration investigation of one fraudulent  
Internet-sold HIV test recently landed a California man in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA warned in 1997 against using ``Lei-Home Access HIV  
tests.'' A company Internet site claimed over 100,000 tests were 
sold, but a judge found that the tests were bogus and no customer 
received accurate results. In February, company owner Larry Greene, 
51, of Los Banos, Calif., was sentenced to over five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA says illegal sales of useless HIV tests are a growing  
problem, and it is investigating people involved in the sale and 
manufacture of other fraudulent HIV kits. No one could say how many 
are under investigation, although a quick Internet search turned up 
ads for several unapproved kits. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC would neither confirm nor deny whether it was  
investigating sellers of the useless HIV tests that it recently 
tested, nor would it name the products.

<HEADLINE> Six Cities Vie for 2006 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- With films, celebrities and  
impassioned entreaties, six European cities took their best shots 
today at winning the 2006 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will be selected Saturday by secret ballot among  
International Olympic Committee members after a 15-member committee 
narrows the bidders down to two finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first site selection since the Salt Lake City  
vote-buying scandal broke six months ago, plunging the IOC into the 
worst crisis of its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City won the 2002 Games in a landslide in 1995, but it  
has been disclosed that the bid committee spent more than $1 
million in cash, gifts and other inducements for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	After that came to light, 10 IOC members were expelled or  
resigned, the two top officials of the Salt Lake organizing 
committee were ousted, and state and federal agencies began an 
ongoing investigation of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal also brought a change in IOC rules that prevented  
members from visiting or having virtually any contact with the 
would-be host cities -- Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; 
Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Turin, Italy; Sion, Switzerland; and 
Zakopane, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	That might give an edge to Sion, which played host to more than  
60 IOC members in an unsuccessful attempt to win the 2002 games. 
Sion backers say they have improved their bid this time. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sion might also have a handicap -- resentment by some IOC  
members over the role of Switzerland's Marc Hodler in blowing the 
whistle on Olympic corruption last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalized by the rules change in January that prevented visits  
by IOC members, the cities resorted instead to mailing brochures 
and video cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, they each made one final pitch in hour-long presentations  
to the 89 members attending the 109th general assembly of the IOC 
in South Korea's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt opened with a challenge to the IOC to ``make  
history'' by holding the 2002 games in three nations that were 
traditional enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt would conduct the games at venues in Austria,  
Slovenia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The election of Klagenfurt will do more than open a new  
chapter in Olympic history, it will demonstrate the ideals of the 
Olympic camp -- three countries united through peace in sport,'' 
said the city's mayor, Harald Scheucher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to show the world that former enemies have become  
friends forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zakopane introduced a touch of humor. Its presentation featured  
a performer who used putty, a sock, bread rolls and a hot water 
bottle to turn himself into a caricature of IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly didn't know how to react, but broke into laughs  
when the performer used a makeup sponge, a stocking and pantyhose 
to turn himself into a likeness of former Polish sprinter Irena 
Szewinska, one of Zakopane's delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Szewinska took the lectern and told the delegates: ``We  
Poles, we like to make jokes, but our bid is absolutely serious, as 
serious as our sport achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki, which lacks mountains high enough for Alpine events  
and proposes to share the games with Lillehammer, Norway, was 
making its sixth bid for the winter games. Its organizing chief, 
Martin Saarikangas, pleaded with the delegates to finally reward 
the Finnish city. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions have been raised about the three-hour travel time by  
air and rail between Helsinki and Lillehammer, but Saarikangas said 
the ``distance is great only if you intend to walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sion, Poprad-Tatry and Turin, seen by many as the No. 2 choice  
behind Sion, were to make their final presentations later today, 
then join delegates from the other three cities in waiting for 
Saturday's decision.

<HEADLINE> Rev. Lyons Ordered To Pay $5.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons, former president of one  
of the nation's largest black church organizations, was ordered to 
repay $5.2 million Friday for bank fraud and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, already serving 5 1/2 years in state prison for bilking  
companies and stealing from charities, also was sentenced by a 
federal judge to four years and three months behind bars. But the 
federal sentence will be served concurrently with the state 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do ask for mercy today,'' Lyons told U.S. District Judge  
Henry Lee Adams Jr. ``I'm 57. I don't have a lot of time to right 
all the wrong I have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons pleaded guilty March 17 to federal charges related to his  
business dealings as head of the National Baptist Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted failing to pay taxes on $1.3 million in income,  
defrauding a bank and making false statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was also convicted in state court in February of bilking  
nearly $4 million from corporations seeking business with his group 
and stealing nearly $250,000 donated to rebuild black churches in 
the South.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Firm Buys S.Korea Hilton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- General Mediterranean Holding Co., an  
investment firm based in Luxembourg, agreed Friday to buy the 
Hilton Hotel in Seoul for $215 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel is currently owned by South Korea's Daewoo Group,  
which is trying to sell assets to improve its financial position. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung is urging the nation's top five  
conglomerates -- Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung, LG and SK -- to unload 
subsidiaries to improve efficiency and boost foreign investors' 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The conglomerates each control 40 to 60 subsidiaries. Their  
debt-financed expansion was often blamed for the economic crisis 
which forced South Korea to accept a $58 billion bailout from the 
International Monetary Fund in late 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Timorese Factions Sign Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a bid to salvage an independence  
referendum, East Timor's bitterly opposed factions agreed Friday to 
lay down their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace deal follows stern warnings from the United Nations  
and the international community that continuing violence in the 
troubled territory could stymie the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation that the U.N.-sponsored ballot could  
be delayed to ensure that people can vote safely and without 
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting in the former Portuguese colony, which was invaded by  
Indonesia in 1975, has increased with the approach of the Aug. 8 
ballot that will let East Timorese choose between independence and 
autonomy within Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The autonomy and independence factions are scheduled to give up  
their guns and sharp weapons by July 5. An April peace pact that 
did not address the thorny issue fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at a news conference about guarantees the factions would  
disarm, Indonesian military Chief Gen. Wiranto said: ``It is a 
moral responsibility by all sides, because they have agreed and 
signed the agreement.'' Wiranto, like many Indonesians, uses only 
one name. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was signed by jailed East Timorese guerrilla leader  
Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao; Leandro Isaac, leader of a 
pro-independence umbrella group; Joao Tavares, head of an 
anti-independence militia; and Domingos Soares, a local government 
leader who opposes independence. 
</P>
<P>
	It calls for stopping any activity that could lead to  
disturbances ahead of the ballot, including ``every form of hatred, 
intimidation, violence, terrorism and acts of disinformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Politically, we want to create a situation where the East  
Timorese people can accept the result,'' Gusmao said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was ready to accept the result, Tavares said, ``Just  
like gambling or a soccer match, there will be a winner and a 
loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence under house arrest in  
Jakarta, said that if the pro-autonomy forces win the referendum, 
``I will become a farmer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian government has said it will free Gusmao after the  
balloting and many see him as a potential leader of an independent 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ian Martin, head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in  
East Timor, said that Indonesian soldiers were seen helping 
militiamen attack pro-independence rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst quoted Martin as saying that a  
U.N. team saw militias ``accompanied and directed'' by the 
Indonesian military. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from Dili, East Timor's capital, Wimhurst said the  
militiamen and soldiers were seen burning houses and assaulting an 
old man Tuesday in Leotela, a village in Liquica district about 25 
miles west of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Local military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman denied any  
involvement by Indonesian soldiers in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin claimed the militiamen also have ambushed teams from the  
United Nations, International Red Cross and local officials 
involved in negotiations for their release. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no active Indonesian soldiers, but retired ones who  
joined'' a local civilian defense force, Suratman said. ``They did 
not ambush the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He neither confirmed nor denied the looting and arson.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Soccer Opens Sat. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Not since the gold medal at the  
Atlanta Olympics has the U.S. women's soccer team gotten so much 
attention and so much acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a probable sellout at Giants Stadium for the opener  
of the Women's World Cup should bring back memories of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope at the end of it, we're walking off with the same  
feeling,'' U.S. star Mia Hamm said. ``And with that trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are favored to do just that. As hosts, they should  
get a huge boost from the crowds, beginning with a sellout in 
excess of 78,000 for the opening game against Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a packed house and everyone pro-U.S. and shouting  
`U-S-A,' it will be awesome,'' Shannon MacMillan said. ``We'll get 
that extra edge and little push from the home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they asked us if we thought the World Cup should be in  
big stadiums or smaller ones, we said, `We'll pack the large ones.' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were practicing in Orlando, they'd pipe crowd noise  
into the Citrus Bowl to give us a feel for playing in front of huge 
crowds. But it's hard for anyone to understand what it is like, 
even after the Olympics. We're so fired up for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Danes. And the Brazilians and Mexicans, who meet in  
the second game of the doubleheader as the 16-team, three-week 
event gets rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Saturday, China, considered a co-favorite to win the  
third Women's World Cup tournament, plays Sweden, and Japan faces 
Canada at San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, the United States opened against Denmark in the 1995  
World Cup and the '96 Olympics. Facing the Americans in what could 
be an intimidating stadium doesn't seem to faze the Danes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us have played in front of 75,000,'' said  
Mikka Hansen, an American native playing for Denmark -- her father 
is Danish. ``Maybe it will be to the U.S. advantage, but there also 
is a lot of pressure attached for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players concede there might be some nervousness early  
in Saturday's game, which will be televised by ABC. But they 
believe there is enough veteran leadership on the team to ensure a 
quick start. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, no other nation has as experienced a core as the United  
States. Players such as Hamm, Michelle Akers, Brandi Chastain, 
Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, Joy Fawcett and Carla Overbeck were 
regulars in 1991, when the Americans took the inaugural World Cup 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of our vets,'' said MacMillan, a star in the Olympics  
who will be making her World Cup debut, ``they know how to keep 
things in check. They can relax the others and settle the team 
down. We're no stranger to big games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last week could have been the most difficult for the  
Americans, even though coach Tony DiCicco eased up on the practice 
routine as the opener got closer. That didn't help much, however, 
in dealing with the anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	But the players' camaraderie and closeness made the final  
buildup easier to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Sunday, we've been here in Jersey and we've been ready  
for it to start,'' MacMillan said. ``The other night, I said to 
Julie, who was my roommate this week, `I can't believe it's only 
Wednesday.' I think we'll be ready to explode when we get on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have to worry about peaking too soon. It's  
actually been really relaxing the last couple of days. We went to 
see `Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' and we've all been 
repeating the lines all through practice. It's been a fun 
environment, sort of like dorm life. We're all like sisters on this 
team. We mesh and flow along together.''

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Robahush closed from third on the back  
side and caught Sense Of Duty in the final sixteenth of a mile to 
win by a neck Friday in the featured $45,000 allowance race for 
3-year-olds at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	With jockey Pat Day aboard, Robahush covered 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:17  
3-5 and paid $7.40, $3.40 and $2.60. It was the second straight 
victory for the son of Alwuhush. 
</P>
<P>
	Sense Of Duty, with Joe Johnson in the saddle, took the lead at  
the eighth pole before being caught in the final strides. Sense Of 
Duty paid $3.40 and $3.40. Humberto, with Scott Miller aboard, 
finished another 5 1/2 lengths back in third and paid $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by David Garvin and trained by David Carroll, Robahush  
earned $28,170 to increase his lifetime earnings to $84,535. The 
victory was his third in six lifetime starts and second in three 
tries at Churchill.

<HEADLINE> Hitler Quote Sparks Outcry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The use of a quotation from Adolf Hitler's  
``Mein Kampf'' for a high school senior's yearbook statement has 
led to an outcry from parents and an apology from the student. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Scuderi, an art major at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High  
School, chose the following quote for her yearbook, 550 of which 
were distributed last week: 
</P>
<P>
	``The very first essential for success is a perpetually constant  
and regular employment of violence. -- Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents reacted quickly to the quote, including Ronny Bassan,  
whose son attends the performing arts school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Need I elaborate what these kinds of hate statements can lead  
to, e.g., Columbine, Paducah, Jonesboro, etc.,'' she wrote in a 
letter to the school's principal, Paul Saronson, referring to 
recent sprees of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Saronson said Ms. Scuderi, whom he described as an honor student  
incapable of violence, told him she had used the quote as ``an 
antithesis of everything she was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scuderi wrote a letter of apology, which was distributed to  
classmates last week.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Corn Futures Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Prices of soybean and corn futures contracts raced higher Friday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as private forecasts predicted hot, 
dry weather next week in key growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated. On other markets, sugar futures  
extended a rally and cocoa also rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the gains as some private weather models predicted  
a ridge of hot, dry air would form next week and linger over Iowa, 
one of the nation's largest corn- and soybean-growing states. 
Temperatures also were expected to be above-normal in Illinois, 
Indiana, Nebraska and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	A heat wave could scorch recently sprouted crops and lower  
yields, helping boost prices that have been in the doldrums amid 
excellent growing weather and expectations for another bumper 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	While National Weather Service models call for normal  
temperatures across the Midwest over the next 30 days, but after 
trading had ended the agency did predict above-normal temperatures 
and below-average precipitation in parts of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated amid expectations hot, dry weather would  
speed harvesting of winter wheat. Farmers have experienced repeated 
delays in harvesting in some parts of the Plains because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for July delivery jumped 11 3/4 cents to $4.47 3/4 a bushel;  
July wheat fell 1/4 cent to $2.54 3/4 a bushel; July corn rose 3 1/2 cents 
to $2.20 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures rose sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York in continued heavy buying tied to a shortage of refined 
white sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian importers in recent weeks have been snapping up  
available supplies, hoping to take delivery before an Aug. 1 
increase on tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the world's largest sugar importer, but recently moved  
to boost tariffs to protect farmers in its domestic sugar-beet 
market. That, however, leaves importers vulnerable to paying 
sharply higher rates later this year, should domestic production 
fail to live up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brazil this year is harvesting a bumper crop. That means  
the rally is likely to be limited, said analyst Arthur Stevenson at 
Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's impressed by the level of Russian buying, and  
discounting the well-known negative fundamentals,'' Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	October sugar rose 0.36 cent to 6.20 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures prices jumped on the New York Board of Trade in  
panic buying that came as large fund houses stepped in to lock in 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures have seesawed in previous sessions as speculators  
try to determine how much supply is available and whether chocolate 
makers will increase their consumption in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	September cocoa rose $48 to $1,123 a ton.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Have Their Backs to the Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres went on the offensive  
Friday -- something they're not doing on the ice -- by accusing the 
Dallas Stars of playing dirty while seizing the lead in the Stanley 
Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' reaction: This is hockey, it's a physical sport, quit  
whining and give us your best shot in Game 6 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Lindy Ruff, vowing the Sabres won't be eliminated on home  
ice, said the Stars stepped over the line during their 2-0 victory 
Thursday by swinging their sticks like baseball bats. Dallas took 
the series lead 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Sabres didn't directly accuse the Stars of trying to injure  
them, but suggested Dallas uses two kinds of sticks: Soft on 
offense but much harder blades on defense, ones that can do much 
more damage physically. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is vicious out there sometimes,'' Ruff said. ``If you look  
at the tape, you probably see between five and 10 really good 
two-handers, baseball swings, where guys are turning their sticks 
over while back checking. It is not a friendly game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Ruff's comments were clearly  
aimed at influencing the officials. The coaches exchanged words at 
the end of Game 5, when Sabres defenseman Rhett Warrener broke an 
ankle during a scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can show you the video where some cheap shots were taken at  
us,'' Hitchcock said. ``That's the type of game it is. ... What he 
is hoping for is the referees read the paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock proposed that Ruff sent out Warrener for the final  
shift with the intent of making his presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out and went after (Derian) Hatcher,'' Hitchcock said.  
``We both know as coaches what the message was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Stars' Pat Verbeek said, ``I don't think it's a very  
dirty series at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars center Guy Carbonneau broke out laughing upon learning of  
Ruff's remarks, saying, ``We don't think we need to hurt anybody. 
But we will do anything to win the game. We're here for one thing, 
to win the Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars can do that Saturday, although Buffalo is 8-1 at home  
in the playoffs and Ruff said of the Stars' possible clincher, ``We 
won't want to let it happen in our building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's verbal byplay added to what already is the most  
competitive Stanley Cup finals since 1994 and the lowest-scoring 
and most defense-driven in nearly a half-century. Goaltenders Ed 
Belfour of Dallas and Dominik Hasek of Buffalo both have 
goals-against averages of 2.00, the first time that's happened in a 
finals since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	But, unless the Sabres can score on the power play -- they are  
0-for-17 since late in Game 3 -- the Stars may soon relocate the 
Stanley Cup to the Sun Belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes 16 games to win the Stanley Cup, and we've got 15,''  
Stars center Mike Modano said. ``The anticipation of the night is 
overwhelming and what a great game it could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More bad news for Buffalo, which still hasn't recovered from the  
Bills' four consecutive Super Bowl losses: No team since Montreal 
in 1971 has rallied from a 3-2 deficit to win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, absolutely, we expect to win,'' Sabres forward Dixon Ward  
said. ``I'm not going to guarantee anything, but we are going to go 
out with full intention. We are going to give everything we've got 
to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Stars said they want to end this now and prevent a Game  
7 Tuesday in Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we know is we have to win one, and they have to win two,''  
Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Sabres' problems is they still haven't gotten one  
goal in the finals from 40-goal scorer Miroslav Satan. And the one 
edge that Buffalo usually counts upon, Hasek, isn't an advantage 
because Belfour is playing as well as he is. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, teams historically seem to play better the closer they get  
to winning the cup. The last four teams that won Game 5 to take a 
3-2 edge won the cup in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to lose it regardless of where we are,'' the  
Sabres' Michael Peca said. ``We certainly don't want to give them 
the opportunity to win it here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's another intangible: Dallas' steel-edged will to win, one  
that borders on obsession. Several Stars, including Modano (wrist), 
Benoit Hogue (knee) and Brett Hull (groin and, possibly, ribs) are 
playing hurt. Really hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano may or may not have a fractured wrist. Hogue needs  
reconstructive knee surgery and is risking the rest of his career 
by playing. Hull wore a flak jacket in Game 5, creating suspicion 
his groin injury may have shifted a little to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what you wait for your whole life, to play in the  
Stanley Cup finals, '' Hogue said. ``I wouldn't miss this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One more loss, and the Sabres will.  
</P>
<P>
	``In this locker room, we know we need to win the next two games  
and we've done it many times during the regular season,'' Hasek 
said.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Passengers Unite in Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Thousands of passengers who were stuck on  
stationary Northwest Airlines flights during a snowstorm can be 
included in four lawsuits filed against the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge on Friday granted class-action status to the lawsuits,  
filed after a January snowstorm stranded passengers at Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Nemecek, who said he was trapped on the tarmac for 9 1/2 hours  
while trying to return to his home in Kansas City, Mo., called the 
ruling ``great news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the class action, we don't really expect to ever see  
anything, but at least the airlines know they can't do whatever 
they please,'' said Nemecek. ``They lost me as a paying customer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen planes were left stranded on runways during  
the Jan. 3 storm that dumped nearly 2 feet of snow because Wayne 
County plows couldn't clear the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest attorneys argued that there were so many different  
situations among the passengers that the lawsuits didn't warrant 
class-action status. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wayne County Circuit Judge Daphne Means Curtis ruled that  
each passenger's situation was similar enough to warrant a 
class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it matters that on some flights toilets may have  
overflowed or some stock of food and beverage were low on different 
flights,'' she said. Even though ``there may be differences in 
terms of injuries or allegations of some class members in this 
case, there are common questions that predominate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs also wanted to sue the county, but Curtis ruled  
Friday that it be dropped as a defendant because passengers were 
not a party to the county's contract with Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said by phone from Minneapolis  
that the class-action ruling was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a procedural type of motion,'' he said. ``Certainly,  
it doesn't go to the merits of the case. It doesn't change our 
expectations at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court determined as many as 8,000 passengers will be  
eligible to join the lawsuit based on the number of apology letters 
and free flight coupons that Northwest sent out after the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Department of Transportation report released earlier this  
month found that Northwest did not violate any federal regulations 
but that conditions were ``severe enough to have jeopardized 
passengers' well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline reviewed its operations after the incident and said  
it made changes to emergency procedures.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Flaw Can Be Exploited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Microsoft program used to run 1.4 million Web  
sites has a major security flaw that can be exploited with a tool 
being given away by the small software company that discovered the 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has released a temporary patch to stop hackers from  
attacking Web sites and possibly stealing credit card numbers and 
other personal information, but critics say it's already taken too 
long for the company to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	eEye, a little known maker of security software that reported  
the defect to Microsoft late last week, said it decided to go 
public and post its hacking tool on the Internet to force Micrsoft 
to act more responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft and many people discussing the controversy on the  
Internet Thursday decried the tactic as a dangerous publicity 
stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the security problem was deemed important enough to  
prompt a warning on the Internet Wednesday by the Computer 
Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, the same 
government-sponsored group that battles computer viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This software is widely deployed, and that makes this a  
serious problem,'' said Shawn Hernan, a member of the Carnegie 
Mellon team. ``If someone is running a vulnerable version of (the 
program), it's possible that any transaction taking place over the 
Web could be observed by an intruder, altered by intruder, or 
denied by intruder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, noting that software security flaws are fairly common,  
Hernan added that, ``This one has gotten a lot of attention because 
of the way it was released and because it affected Microsoft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Windows NT Internet Information Server runs Web  
sites by Disney, barnesandnoble.com, the Nasdaq Stock Market and 
many others. It is one of three major programs, along with rival 
products from Netscape and Apache, that are used on the vast 
majority of Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said Thursday a permanent repair for the program was  
``imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flaw involves a mechanism that allows people to change their  
passwords for using Web sites, and could be exploited by computer 
hackers with only basic programming ability to take control over or 
crash a site. 
</P>
<P>
	No such intrusions, however, have been reported to either  
Microsoft or the Pittsburgh-based Computer Emergency Response Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers have only recently grown comfortable giving credit  
card numbers over the Internet following assurances by Web 
merchants that they are safe. As a result, online shopping has been 
booming since the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts noted Thursday that confidential data gathered by many  
Web site operators is usually scrambled and stored on a different 
computer than the one that runs a site. 
</P>
<P>
	eEye said on its Web site that ``This is a very serious hole and  
needs to be given the attention it deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending its decision to go public and release the hacking  
tool, the company said, ``If our team starts hiding the facts, 
we'll be no better than a software vendor that rushes insecure 
products to market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft expressed dismay at eEye's moves, saying it was  
standard protocol in the software industry to wait until a full 
remedy is ready for distribution before making a security risk 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know why they did that. All it does is put an  
extraordinary number of people at risk,'' said Jason Garms, the 
lead product manager for Windows NT security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I vehemently reject the notion that we were dragging our heels  
on this. The absolute minimum expected to fix these things is two 
weeks,'' said Garms. The eEye tool ``enabled even nontechnical 
person to attack any Web site running this software.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Internet Users Climb to 92M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people over 16 years old in the  
United States and Canada using the Internet has climbed to 92 
million, and the number of women making purchases online is rising 
dramatically, a survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular items for women to buy on the Web were books,  
CDs and videos, with 9.6 million purchases of those items made 
during the last nine months. But in a twist, the number of women 
buying computers over the Internet climbed fastest, up 160 percent 
to 1.3 million over the previous nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by Nielsen Media Research and CommerceNet shows  
increases in the number of women who made at least a single 
purchase using the Internet rose 80 percent during the time period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the types of products you can purchase online are so  
much more diverse than in years past,'' Jerome Samson, one of the 
study's coordinators, said Thursday. ``The only thing you could 
purchase online were hardware, software, things that mainly 
appealed to a male audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men also bought mostly books, CDs and videos but also bought far  
more computers than women. 
</P>
<P>
	Among both men and women, online purchases of software remained  
flat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly half of North America uses the Internet,'' said Mark  
Resch, executive vice president at CommerceNet. ``We use it to 
communicate, to learn, to shop and to buy. It is as integral a part 
of our lives as the telephone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, based on interviews with more than 7,200 people in  
North America, said 54 percent of people on the Internet are men, 
although men still represent a higher proportion, 62 percent, of 
all online buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study distinguished online buyers from online shoppers, who  
merely research and compare prices and features among products and 
services, even if they don't ultimately make a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that among shoppers, men most typically look at  
information about cars and car parts while women most often look 
for details about clothing and books. 
</P>
<P>
	The same study last August showed 79 million people over 16 on  
the Internet in North America -- with 43 percent of them women. The 
study in September 1997 counted 58 million, also with 43 percent 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year's study also showed that more than 71 percent of  
Internet purchasers were men. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study also said 72 million people use the Internet  
from home, while 46 million use it from work and 28 million from 
school. The rest use it from other locations, such as a library or 
a friend's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen and CommerceNet said the results of its latest study  
were statistically representative of North America's population of 
225 million people over the age 16.

<HEADLINE> Olazabal Breaks Hand, Leaves Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal  
withdrew from the U.S. Open today after he hit his hand against a 
wall and broke a bone. 
</P>
<P>
	He pulled out before the second round. The circumstances  
surrounding his broken hand were not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who shot 75 on Thursday, had been scheduled to play at  
noon with Tom Lehman and Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
	He issued a statement saying he broke the fifth metacarpal on  
his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit a wall (on Thursday); it was my fault,'' Olazabal said.  
``The doctor said I would be out three to four weeks. Fortunately, 
it is a clean fracture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal ended any chance the Spaniard had of becoming the  
first golfer since Jack Nicklaus in 1972 to win both the Masters 
and U.S. Open in the same year.

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Suspect Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A second man has been arrested and charged with  
helping two Columbine High School students obtain a semiautomatic 
gun used in the April rampage that left 15 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Duran, 22, who worked with gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan  
Klebold at a pizza shop, is accused of introducing them to a friend 
who sold them a TEC-DC9 gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, stormed Columbine on April 20,  
killing 13 people and wounding 23 students before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A TEC DC-9 purchased nearly four months earlier from Mark Manes  
was one of the four guns used. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, a 22-year-old computer programmer, told investigators  
that Duran introduced him to the two students at a Jan. 23 gun show 
in Denver. He agreed to sell Klebold the TEC DC-9 for $500, an 
arrest warrant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold gave Manes a $300 down payment and Duran delivered the  
balance two weeks later, collecting $125 from Harris and Klebold 
for his trouble, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran is charged with providing a gun to a minor, which brings  
up to six years in prison and $500,000 in fines. He also is accused 
of possessing a dangerous or illegal weapon, for which he could get 
three years in prison and a $3,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran was released on $15,000 bond Thursday. His lawyer, Matt  
DePetro, did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes is also charged with providing a weapon to a minor. His  
attorney has said Manes did not know why the students wanted the 
gun.

<HEADLINE> Texas Politician Bullock Dies at 69 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Bob Bullock, an often gruff and always  
imposing figure in Texas politics for 40 years, culminating in two 
terms in the powerful post of lieutenant governor, died today. He 
was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, who had suffered various health problems over the  
years, most recently was hospitalized for congestive heart failure. 
He died at his Austin home about 7 a.m., according to aide Tony 
Proffitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Bullock was one of the strongest leaders this state ever  
had. He never saw a challenge he didn't meet, and there was never a 
mountain he failed to climb,'' said political consultant George 
Christian, who served as press secretary to President Johnson. 
``His leadership was old-fashioned but effective. He simply worked 
harder than anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Bullock, a Democrat, was elected lieutenant governor --  
a powerful job in a state that sharply limits the governor's 
authority. Bullock presided over the Texas Senate, made committee 
appointments, sat on key government boards and controlled the flow 
of legislation in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure, the state ended a court-ordered school  
funding crisis, saw a once shaky budget balloon to a $6 billion 
surplus, and overhauled the civil justice system to impose limits 
on lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no agenda but what's good for Texas. And I have no love  
but Texas,'' Bullock said. He invariably ended his speeches with 
``God bless Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, he served four terms as state comptroller, the state's  
chief tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, while he was in his third term as comptroller, Bullock  
suffered a major setback -- abandoning a lifelong quest for 
governor. He commented wryly: ``Frankly, there has been no great 
public clamor for my services as governor. I've had about 100 
expressions of support and one $5 contribution from a Mr. Lan 
Nelson of Walker County, which I am returning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After deciding in 1997 not to seek a third term as lieutenant  
governor, Bullock announced plans to give away his 
multimillion-dollar campaign bank account, donating much of it to 
Texas colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Hillsboro in 1929, Bullock won a state House seat while  
still a Baylor Law School student in 1956. Among other posts he 
held was assistant attorney general, aide to the governor and 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was sworn in as lieutenant governor in 1991, Bullock  
described himself as ``a person rich in human frailties.'' He was 
married five times, constantly tried to quit smoking and underwent 
treatment for alcoholism in 1981. Over the years, he also battled 
heart and lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Once when asked about his health, Bullock said, ``I'm so busy I  
ain't got time to die.''

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Counselor Fired in Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A key figure in the academic fraud  
investigation of the Minnesota men's basketball team was fired 
Friday for not helping with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Alonzo Newby, the team's academic counselor, has steadfastly  
refused to talk to investigators, invoking his Fifth Amendment 
right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired for ``refusing to cooperate with independent  
investigators ... and for participating in violation of NCAA 
rules,'' the university said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It did not specify which NCAA rules were violated, and Mark  
Rotenberg, the school's general counsel, said investigators were 
only examining Newby's role in possible rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are allegations ... and again, Mr. Newby made a choice  
not to answer even the most basic questions about these 
allegations,'' Rotenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby's testimony could have clarified what role coach Clem  
Haskins had in alleged improprieties in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby allegedly gave $3,000 in cash to Jan Gangelhoff, the  
former academic counseling office manager from Danbury, Wis., who 
said she wrote more than 400 papers for players from 1993 to 1998. 
Gangelhoff has said the money was from Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff has described Newby's job as doing ``whatever it took  
to keep kids eligible.'' She also said Newby edited some of the 
first papers she wrote for players. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby, academic counselor since 1992, went on medical leave in  
April. He will remain on paid leave until Monday, his final day of 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Gardebring, the university's vice president for  
institutional relations, said Newby would have been entitled to 
around $30,000 in severance pay if he cooperated with the 
investigation and his year-to-year contract was not renewed. She 
called the package standard for an employee of Newby's position and 
seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	But because Newby was terminated with cause, he will receive no  
severance pay, Rotenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby's lawyer, Ron Rosenbaum, said his client has no plans to  
reveal what he knows, and he's not considering a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby was expecting the firing, but still was disappointed and  
feels ``isolated, alienated, lonely and abandoned,'' Rosenbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the people he spent a lot of years with, people in  
the athletic department, and he's taken the fall,'' the lawyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotenberg said officials still hope to persuade Newby to meet  
with investigators, but the inquiry will continue with or without 
Newby's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have over 100 witnesses to talk to. No single person will  
be able to stop the truth from coming out,'' Rotenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university has been negotiating with Haskins' attorney to  
buy out the coach's contract. Rotenberg said those negotiations are 
continuing ``in a businesslike manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coach's contract contains an unusual clause that allows him  
to receive $423,000 in deferred compensation even if he is 
terminated with just cause. If just cause cannot be shown, Haskins 
would be entitled to almost $1.2 million, plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has maintained his innocence and said he hopes to return  
as coach next season. He is expected to talk with investigators 
next week.

<HEADLINE> A Cyclical World for Mutual Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --Until they became the stars of the stock market  
in the second half of the 1990s, blue-chip growth stocks and the 
mutual funds that invest in them suffered from a stodgy image. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, these stocks represented top-quality companies -- General  
Electric, Coca-Cola, Merck, and so forth -- but investors already 
knew everything about them that mattered, and they were too big to 
grow as fast as they once did. 
</P>
<P>
	As Peter Lynch, vice chairman of Fidelity Management &AMP; Research  
in Boston, put it at a recent Investment Company Institute 
conference: ``Small companies usually have big moves, and big 
companies usually have small moves. It's very hard for large 
companies to accelerate their growth rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it's a remarkable thing that an index of big growth stocks  
outperformed all other categories of stocks for four straight years 
from 1995 through 1998. Imagine a gang of 50-year-olds suddenly 
becoming pro basketball all-stars or sweeping the MTV Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	As this story has developed, so has a widely accepted  
explanation for how it came to pass. With capitalism taking root in 
many new places around the world, creating an increasingly global 
environment, the blue-chip companies had the size and the strength 
to prosper most. 
</P>
<P>
	Big multinationals could spend the money necessary to conquer  
new markets in distant places, while smaller companies lacked the 
capital, the expertise or the contacts to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large-cap growth companies are glamorous for a reason,'' said  
Tim Ghriskey, senior equity portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corp. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	To some students of financial history, though, the new-economy  
story provides no assurance whatever that blue-chip growth stocks 
will stay on top. Stock performance has always gone in cycles, and 
the blue chips have already enjoyed a longer time in the limelight 
than any other category of stocks in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Over that stretch, small growth stocks, small value stocks,  
foreign stocks and bonds have each taken a turn or two leading the 
performance parade. If the big blue chips are to keep their hold on 
the top spot, they will have to break a long-standing pattern of 
rotation and change. 
</P>
<P>
	``All markets tend to revert to the mean,'' said Richard Weiss,  
portfolio manager of the Strong Common Stock and Strong Opportunity 
funds in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	When the financial consulting firm of Callan Associates Inc.  
studied the record of seven indexes measuring different sectors of 
the markets over the past 20 years, it found that large growth 
stocks (represented by the S&AMP;P-Barra 500 Growth Index) occupied the 
No. 1 spot only once, in 1989, before they embarked on their recent 
four-year winning streak. That index finished next-to-last and 
last, respectively, in 1992 and 1993 before climbing to No. 2 in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Indexes of small-company growth and value stocks took top honors  
in four of the six years between 1979 and 1984, with the Lehman 
Brothers aggregate bond index leading the pack in 1982 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it became international stocks' turn to shine. Morgan  
Stanley Capital International's Europe, Australasia and Far East 
Index, or EAFE, ranked first in 1985, '86 and '87, and again in 
1993 and '94. Small value stocks set the pace in 1988 and '92; 
small growth stocks in 1991, and bonds in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Kloepfer, Callan's director of capital markets research,  
noted that the strength of growth blue chips since 1995 ``has left 
many investors and money managers questioning the value of 
diversification. Many investors have begun to lose patience with 
underperforming asset classes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after a look at the 20-year record, Kloepfer says,  
``persistence seems unlikely. No single asset class has 
historically persisted at one relative ranking longer than four 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He concluded, ``The case for diversification, across investment  
styles (growth vs. value), capitalization (large vs. small), and 
equity markets (U.S. vs. international), is strong.''

<HEADLINE>  NATO Disarms Kosovo Rebels, Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With terrified Serb civilians  
fleeing Kosovo and ethnic Albanian refugees returning to mined 
villages without water, power or food, NATO peacekeepers today 
disarmed rebels and Serbs alike and started restoring basic 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies, meanwhile, said three-quarters of the Serb forces in  
Kosovo have now left, nearing completion of a peace deal that ended 
the 78-day NATO air campaign and mandates all 40,000 troops leave 
the province by Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian and U.S. negotiators were reported close to reaching  
agreement today on Russia's role in the Kosovo peacekeeping mission 
and the impasse over 200-300 of its troops that have controlled 
Pristina's airport since Saturday. Negotiators met for the third 
day in Helsinki, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, France, Britain, Germany and Italy have  
divided Kosovo into five sectors for peacekeeping that Russia wants 
to be part of. The issue is a sticky one because its envoy, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, played a big role in persuading Slobodan Milosevic to 
accept NATO's peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops in Kosovo will take an active role in bringing  
suspected war criminals to justice under an agreement worked out 
today by allied nations and the international tribunal for 
Yugoslavia. Milosevic and four top aides were indicted last month 
on war crime charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied troops will take a ``considerably more proactive stance  
in supporting the efforts of the tribunal, including if need be on 
apprehension issues,'' chief prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada 
told a news conference at NATO headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the allies' role in dealing with suspected war  
criminals will be ``considerably different'' to that of the 
NATO-led force in Bosnia that has been criticized for not detaining 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and others indicted for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO forces have called in more military police to try to  
restore order and to persuade Serbs that they will protect them 
from revenge attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	British Maj. Gen Richard Dannatt said the officers would fill a  
``vacuum'' left by the departure of the only police Kosovo had. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing you notice going around Pristina is the complete  
lack of policemen. It's a large, bustling city that's coming back 
to life, but there are no policemen on the street corners,'' 
Dannatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Royal Irish regiment took 50 weapons from a group of Kosovo  
rebels Thursday south of Pristina, he said. ``We are not going to 
tolerate the waving around, brandishing of weapons, by any faction 
here at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Rear Adm. Simon Moore said troops were making a priority  
of helping get water and electricity running again across Kosovo, 
where 860,000 ethnic Albanians in the 2.1 million populace fled 
from Serb forces beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of refugees have streamed home from Albania  
and Macedonia following the peace deal, finding not only their 
houses destroyed but water and power cut off as well. Those 
services were heavily damaged by NATO's bombs and by a frenzy of 
Serb violence. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's humanitarian effort ``is currently focused on providing  
security for the repair of essential facilties in Pristina. Over 
the next few days priorities will include water, power supplies and 
other key elements for the infrastructure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers also were trying to prevent thousands of Serb  
civilians from fleeing out of fear of ethnic Albanian revenge 
attacks. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said today that 33,000 Serb 
civilians, of a population of roughly 150,000, had fled. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church traveled to Kosovo to  
join the peacekeepers in persuading his flock to stand their ground 
in what they consider the cradle of their culture. 
</P>
<P>
	But the German forces responsible for southwestern Kosovo said  
that in Orahovac, 30 miles southwest of Pristina, a delegation led 
by Lt. Col. Gen. Obrad Stevanovic of the Serbian special police was 
urging the last 3,000 Serbs in town to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	German peacekeepers at the Albanian border had let ethnic  
Albanian rebels cross back with their weapons on Thursday, but Col. 
Rolf Bescht said all rebels would be barred from carrying weapons 
in public as of midnight today. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said German troops would take over the police stations  
in the southwestern Kosovo town of Prizren, which the rebels have 
held in recent days, ``to make it crystal clear that we are the 
only force in town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ward off retaliatory attacks from ethnic Albanian rebels,  
NATO stationed a tank to block the winding road leading to the 
monastery in Decane in western Kosovo and another blocking the 
Serbian Orthodox monastery's gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside were huddled 20 monks and a few elderly Serbs who hadn't  
fled. Ethnic Albanian villagers, who said the monastery protected 
them during the Serb rampage, pledged to defend the monks with 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO was too late in Devic, another monastery in the hills of  
central Kosovo. TV images showed shattered icons and bullet shells. 
</P>
<P>
	``UCK'' -- the Albanian initials for the separatist Kosovo  
Liberation Army -- was scratched into a pane of glass over an icon. 
CNN reported that rebels terrorized the monastery's inhabitants, 
firing guns next to monk's heads and stripping a nun naked. 
</P>
<P>
	The private Beta news agency in Belgrade said the last two Serbs  
in the central village of Sofajlija -- a couple in their 60s -- were 
found dead Thursday on the doorstep of their home. 
</P>
<P>
	And the independent Montenegro news agency Montena-fax said a  
16-year-old Serb was ambushed by rebels and killed on a country 
road Thursday near the western Kosovo town of Pec. 
</P>
<P>
	So far there are 16,100 NATO troops deployed in the province. A  
further 10,800 are stationed in neighboring Macedonia, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said over 30,000 Serb forces had left Kosovo and that if  
the present rate of withdrawal continues, the Serbs will be out by 
Sunday night in accordance with a deadline imposed in a military 
agreement signed by NATO and Yugoslav commanders.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Gun Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun control legislation fell in a House  
crossfire on Friday, leaving the fate of the issue uncertain in 
Congress two months after a horrifying outbreak of violence at a 
Colorado high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The 280-147 rejection came as many Democrats rebelled against  
National Rifle Association-backed provisions in the bill to loosen 
some existing gun controls, while dozens of conservative 
Republicans objected to the imposition of new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people will not stand for this,'' President  
Clinton said in a statement issued in Europe. ``Our nation is 
waiting for Washington to pass a real law that keeps guns away from 
children and out of the hands of criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate had passed a gun control bill earlier, and despite  
the defeat of the House bill, negotiations between the two houses 
are expected this summer on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the vote, the leaders of the two parties  
searched for political gains in the bill's ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let there be no mistake,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., in a written statement. ``The vast majority of the Democrat 
caucus walked away when they had the chance to walk forward for the 
good of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan countered bluntly:  
``the main obstacle here has been primarily the Republican 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the political squabbling, though, the vote left an  
uncertain road map for lawmakers looking ahead to House-Senate 
compromise talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to handicap,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, a  
Georgia Republican who opposes gun control legislation. ``But I 
think something will come out'' of the negotiations, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said that  
given public opinion on the issue, ``I don't think you can 
forecast'' the outcome. Public opinion strongly supports increased 
gun control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate-passed measure would extend required background  
checks to all sales at gun shows, including those conducted by 
non-licensed firearms dealers. In addition, it would require 
dealers to provide safety devices with all handguns; ban the 
importation of certain high capacity firearms clips and impose a 
lifetime prohibition of gun ownership by anyone convicted as a 
juvenile of a serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
	The defeated House bill included the safety device provision.  
And while it would have required non-licensed dealers to conduct 
background checks on their firearms customers at gun shows, it 
would have reduced the amount of time allowed for such gun show 
checks from three business days to 24 hours, including weekends. In 
addition, it would have defined gun shows in a way that would have 
excluded some events. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue rocketed to the top of the political agenda in the  
wake of the April shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, 
in which two students killed 12 fellow pupils and a teacher before 
ending their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in particular, said the answer to youth violence  
lay in measures other than gun control, and both houses approved 
bills in recent weeks to toughen enforcement of juvenile crime. The 
House-passed bill also permits states to allow the posting of the 
Ten Commandments in schools and state owned or administered 
facilities. That provision is not part of the Senate bill, and it, 
too, will have to be resolved in compromise talks. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the focus of the congressional debate -- and a great  
deal of the political maneuvering -- was directed at the politically 
volatile gun issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton Heston, the actor who is president of the NRA,  
telephoned at least one lawmaker on Thursday urging support for the 
gun show provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican officials said that after the House had  
agreed to NRA-backed gun show provision late Thursday night, 
Hastert convened a leadership meeting, including the powerful whip, 
Rep. Tom DeLay, to emphasize the urgency of passing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	These sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hastert  
said the House would be better off if it went into negotiations 
with the Senate with legislation of its own. But in addition, he 
said, failure to pass the bill would lead to constant Democrats 
attempts to resurrect the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups of moderate and conservative lawmakers were invited to  
separate meetings to hear an appeal for support, and the NRA, which 
had been neutral on the final vote, dispatched a letter to 
lawmakers encouraging a vote for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the White House was urging Democrats to oppose  
the measure, and Gephardt's office circulated legislation that 
stressed that the bill ``weakens current gun safety law'' at 
several important points. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill drew the support of 137 Republicans and 10 Democrats on  
final passage. Opposed were 82 Republicans, one independent and 197 
Democrats. Among the Democrats was Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, 
sponsor of the NRA-backed gun show amendment that passed Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after the vote, Gephardt told reporters  
that Hastert was correct on one point -- Democrats would seek a 
series of parliamentary votes in the coming weeks to try and force 
Republicans to adopt a strong gun control measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the final vote, the House, which had been in session well  
after midnight on the last two nights, marched through a series of 
volatile amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	One, which would have repealed a District of Columbia handgun  
ban, produced some of the most heated rhetoric of the entire 
three-day debate before ultimately failing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Virgil Goode, D-Va., the sponsor, said support was  
indicated ``if you believe the Second Amendment protects your right 
to protect yourself and your business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting representative of  
the District of Columbia, said the proposal was an intrusion on 
local control that would turn the nation's capital into ``the most 
lenient gun jurisdiction'' in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gentleman has some nerve,'' she said to fellow Democrat  
Goode. ``Get off my back, get out of my business.''

<HEADLINE> Ocean Spray Chief To Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKEVILLE, Mass. (AP) -- Ocean Spray Cranberries President and  
Chief Executive Thomas E. Bullock will step down next year after 
three years on the job, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, 53, has overseen the elimination of 500 jobs -- about 20  
percent of the company's work force -- as the industry continues to 
suffer from overproduction and falling prices. About 300 of the job 
cuts were in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, some growers got as much as $85 for a 100 pound barrel  
of cranberries, but Ocean Spray said berries harvested next fall 
may sell for just $42 to $48 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	As d a result, the company suspended payments to former co-op  
growers who were required to buy shares in the company. The shares 
are redeemed over a six-year period when the grower leaves the 
co-op. 
</P>
<P>
	But some outside analysts said the company under Bullock's  
leadership has suffered for strategic reasons that have nothing to 
do with the cranberry glut. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the company never recovered from losing its monopoly in  
the 1990s amid competition from companies like Northland 
Cranberries of Wisconsin and Tropicana. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't know how to deal with competition,'' George S.  
Dahlman, an industry analyst, told The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	When Northland began marketing a premium line of 100 percent  
cranberry juice, Ocean Spray started a price war that hurt it more 
than Northland, Dahlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean Spray had contracted with PepsiCo Inc. to distribute its  
beverages to convenience stores, but last year Pepsi announced 
plans to buy and distribute Tropicana instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the company's troubles, Ocean Spray reported sales of  
$1.48 billion for its last fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 3 percent 
more than the previous year. It also reported profits of $280 
million, up from $273 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts grows more cranberries than any state except  
Wisconsin. Ocean Spray controls about 70 percent of the U.S. crop.

<HEADLINE> Miami Focusing on Fundamentals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Miami got back to the basics. That's what got  
the Hurricanes back to Omaha -- and a step further. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (48-13) practiced and waited Friday for the championship  
game of the College World Series. They'll play for the title 
Saturday against Florida State, which beat Stanford 14-11 in 13 
innings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in time for a year of aluminum bat restrictions, Miami is a  
team without the home run hitters of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most notably, the Hurricanes lost slugger Pat Burrell, taken  
with the first pick of the 1998 draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. 
This year, the Hurricanes are focusing on fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a big-inning team,'' coach Jim Morris said.  
``This team is more of a small-hit club. We've laid down a lot more 
bunts, tried to get more timely hits and taken it one inning at a 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Hurricanes are in the championship game for the  
second time in six years under Morris, and they're well rested. 
Morris' toughest decision for Saturday was which of his top two 
pitchers will start -- Alex Santos (12-3, 3.00 ERA) or David Gil 
(12-0, 3.19). 
</P>
<P>
	``You can choose either of them and not be wrong,'' Morris said.  
</P>
<P>
	After Florida State's victory, he tabbed Santos to start the  
title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Hurricanes powered their way to Omaha behind a  
school-record 139 home runs. Miami was averaging almost 11 runs per 
game coming to the College World Series but scored eight runs in 
three games, losing two. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Greg Lovelady said the 1999 Miami team bunts,  
hits-and-runs, steals bases, draws walks and chips away at its 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was one of the most talented teams,'' he said. ``But  
we were so used to beating teams by more than 10 runs that I don't 
think we were well-suited for the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Omaha, in order to win, you have to score when you have  
guys on base,'' Lovelady said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes also have the luxury of time off. Stanford and  
Florida State, meanwhile, battled each other two days in a row. 
Miami kicked back after practice Friday and benefited from a rain 
day earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're relaxed and playing well,'' shortstop Bobby Hill said.  
``We're doing the little things right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lovelady said the relaxed, back-to-basics Hurricanes might have  
a better shot at a national title than the big-name, big-swing 
teams of previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take scrappiness over talent any day,'' Hill said.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine-Refusing Marine Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first of five Marines to be  
court-martialed for refusing to take the anthrax vaccine was 
convicted by a military judge of disobeying a lawful order. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Cpl. Jared Schwartz, 20, of Henderson, Ky., was sentenced  
Thursday to 30 days in the brig and given a bad conduct discharge. 
He plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is bigger than just myself,'' Schwartz said in a  
statement he read in court at the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air 
Ground Combat Center. ``I stand here today representing every 
member of the service who wishes to challenge the anthrax vaccine 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of service personnel have refused the vaccine due to  
questions about side effects including sterility. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Mark S. Zaid wanted to call medical witnesses  
to question the vaccine's safety and necessity. But he was rebuffed 
by the military judge, Lt. Col. Ken Martin, and ultimately called 
no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	From the start, the Marine Corps saw the case as a matter of  
military discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's ruling reinforces the fact that the order was lawful,  
the vaccine is safe and there is a real threat out there,'' said 
Lt. Vincent Bosquez, public affairs officer for the base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon says more than 220,000 members of the military have  
been immunized and about 200 have refused, including four more 
Marines who face military trials at Twentynine Palms. The next case 
starts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-two of those who had the drug reported adverse effects,  
and seven had to hospitalized or take a sick day. All recovered 
from complaints including soreness, rashes, headaches and fevers.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Blocks Share Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- The government objected to Portuguese  
financier Antonio Champalimaud's proposed exchange of a stake in 
his holding company for shares in Spain's Banco Santander Central 
Hispano. 
</P>
<P>
	Champalimaud, who holds the nation's second-largest financial  
group that includes the insurer Mundial Confianca and three banks, 
said Friday that he plans to proceed with the alliance, saying it 
was ``in strict compliance with the applicable national and 
European Community laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The share swap agreement with Banco Santander was announced 10  
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Champalimaud would trade a 40 percent stake in  
his holding company for a 1.6 percent stake in Banco Santander. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco told reporters the deal  
would have violated laws related to purchases of stakes in 
insurance companies and said the deal lacked conditions for 
``healthy and prudent management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finance minister denied the government's decision was made  
because Banco Santander is Spanish, but admitted the government was 
``naturally concerned with the national element of the financial 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, leading private bank Banco Comercial Portugues  
announced it was planning to make a bid of an unspecified amount of 
stock for the insurer Mundial Confianca. Mundial Confianca was 
valued at about $1.46 billion at Thursday's closing prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the approach ``hostile,'' official sources at the  
Champalimaud group said they would try to resist it. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came a month to the day after Banco Comercial  
dissolved a six-year partnership with Banco Santander because of a 
disagreement over competition in domestic markets.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Hearings Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats are criticizing new campaign  
finance hearings as a stalling tactic, but Republicans counter that 
the sessions are a necessary part of the deliberative process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The free and open examination of ideas on campaign reform is  
key to implementing meaningful changes to our campaign system,'' 
Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, vice chairman of the House 
Administration Committee, said Thursday at the first of what will 
be a series of hearings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may require rethinking old ideas, not just rehashing  
strategies that have led to stalemate in the past,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats branded the hearings a delaying tactic.  
</P>
<P>
	``What are we doing? Why are we here?'' asked Rep. Steny Hoyer,  
D-Md., the panel's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a campaign finance bill last August after  
numerous hearings and more than 50 hours of floor debate, Hoyer 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	He said additional hearings, planned into July, will waste time.  
``It is time for us to move on and not to further delay addressing 
this critical issue,'' Hoyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised a vote on the issue  
in September. But supporters of a proposal passed last year by the 
House fear that it won't leave the Senate enough time to act before 
Congress retires for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also are rounding up support for a petition to bypass  
the committee and force the issue to the floor for a vote. The 
effort, which requires signatures from 218 members, has been signed 
by 202, including six moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen reform proposals are pending.  
</P>
<P>
	Last August, the House voted 252-179 in favor of a bill that,  
among other changes, would eliminate what is known as ``soft 
money'' -- unlimited and unregulated donations that the political 
parties solicit to finance political activities. The bill also 
would have regulated issue advertising and expanded disclosure 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on that bill, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays,  
R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., came only after a similar 
petition neared the 218 signature mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, however, failed to reach a final vote in the  
Senate.

<HEADLINE> Master O Foxhounds Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Master O Foxhounds pulled away from Baltimore  
Gray in the final yards Friday for a three-quarter length victory 
in Belmont Park's feature, a $59,000 sprint handicap for older 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore Gray, who led into the stretch, held on gamely for  
second in the field of seven, 2 1/4 lengths ahead of Flashing Tammany. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the third in 11 starts this year for the 4-year-old  
gelding by Deputy Minister from the Mr. Prospector mare, Watch Out.

	Ridden by Jorge Chavez, Master O Foxhounds carried 114 pounds  
and covered 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:15:4 on a fast track. He earned 
$35,400 for Robert and Beverly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $9.10, $4.30 and $3.20. Baltimore Gray paid

<HEADLINE> House OKs Posting of 10 Commandments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Searching for a way to curb youth violence,  
the House approved legislation Thursday night permitting the Ten 
Commandments to be posted in schools and other state and local 
facilities and moved toward a showdown over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 287-139 for the anti-violence measure, which  
includes a variety of get-tough provisions related to juvenile 
crime as well as the declaration permitting states to display the 
Biblical commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said that measure was unconstitutional, but its sponsor,  
Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., countered that it would ``promote 
morality and work toward an end of children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a second victory for the entertainment industry in  
as many days, the House rejected a proposal to require labeling of 
violent content in entertainment products such as video games. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second night in a row, lawmakers worked late into the  
evening fashioning their response to shootings at a Colorado high 
school and elsewhere. Repeatedly, lawmakers in both parties 
lamented cases of ``children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions in the bill would toughen penalties for  
juvenile offenders, make it easier to try some juveniles as adults 
and require federal prosecutors to devote increased time and money 
to pursuing gun-related crimes. The legislation envisions the 
federal government spending $1.5 billion over the next three years 
in grants to states to help combat juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure explicitly permits religious symbols to  
be included in the design of a memorial on any public school campus 
to commemorate anyone slain there. That provision was offered by 
Rep. Thomas Tancredo, a Colorado Republican who represents the area 
where this spring's shootings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage led immediately to debate of a companion bill on gun  
control, the focus of a pitched political battle between the forces 
of the White House and gun control on one side and the National 
Rifle Association on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost more kids yesterday because of school violence than we  
lost in Kosovo and Bosnia put together the last three years,'' said 
Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, citing statistics that 
show 13 children die each day because of youth violence. Earlier, 
Gephardt paid grudging respect to the work of the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in admiration of what they're able to do,'' he said at a  
news conference, referring to an organization that has poured an 
estimated $14 million into political campaigns in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got members (of Congress) who are looking at a big  
independent expenditure that can be run against them, at votes that 
can be implemented against them'' if they defy the organization's 
wishes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the NRA issued a letter to members of the House  
detailing its position on a variety of proposed amendments. It said 
it ``very strongly supports'' a provision advanced by Rep. John 
Dingell, D-Mich., which it said ``does not include any gun control 
provisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell's proposal would curtail existing requirements for sales  
at gun shows, partly by redefining a gun show, and partly by giving 
the government only 24 hours to complete a background check, rather 
than the current three business days. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative, backed by the White House, would retain the  
provisions approved by the Senate last month. They would require 
mandatory background checks for all purchases at gun shows, closing 
what supporters said was a loophole left in the 1993 Brady Bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, votes were expected on proposals to require that a  
safety device be sold with all handguns, to raise the minimum age 
for purchase of a handgun from 18 to 21 and to ban the importation 
of high capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and aides in both parties agreed the outcome was  
virtually impossible to predict, and that in the end, it was 
possible that nothing would command a majority on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	As an indication of the uncertainty, Dingell told reporters that  
even if his NRA-backed gun show proposal passed, he would probably 
oppose final passage of the measure if it contained any other gun 
control provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if those additional provisions fail in the House, he said  
``I might'' vote against his own bill on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the Ten Commandments was largely along party lines,  
with 203 Republicans and 45 Democrats in favor and 164 Democrats, 
one independent and 15 Republicans against. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt said the commandments ``represent the very cornerstone  
of Western civilization and the basis of our legal system here in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., countered that the proposal sought  
``to elevate one particular religion over all others,'' an effort 
that he said was ``blatantly unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky state law that required  
posting the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom, 
ruling that the postings would violate the constitutionally 
required separation of government and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt's amendment gives states permission to decide whether  
the commandments can be displayed in public facilities. It comes 
several years after a celebrated case in Alabama in which a local 
judge tried to hang the commandments in his courtroom but was 
ordered to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for labeling video games and other forms of  
entertainment was advanced by Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., and Bart 
Stupak, D-Mich., both of whom argued that the government requires 
labeling on food, and should do likewise on sources of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are killing children,'' Wamp said. ``I've had enough  
of it. I'm going to side with parents today. I'm going to side with 
children today, not some big special interest with a bunch of 
money,'' he said in a reference to the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote against the labeling proposal was 266-161.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the entertainment industry successfully turned  
back a proposal by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to curtail access of 
youth to explicit sexual or violent material in books, movies and 
other forms of modern-day culture.

<HEADLINE> Can the Spurs Be Stopped? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy must have felt like the object  
of a late-night shakedown in a smoke-filled room, only there was no 
Fifth Amendment to invoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks coach was bombarded by questions on all  
fronts Thursday, a rigorous inquest that basically boiled down to 
this: How do you stop the juggernaut that is the San Antonio Spurs? 
</P>
<P>
	Time and again, Van Gundy listened carefully and talked himself  
down a path that led to the same grim conclusion: There is no easy 
answer, just theories and hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have to adjust. They've won 11 in a row,'' Van  
Gundy said. ``There's nothing they have to adjust to. They've just 
got to try to keep doing what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``For ourselves, even coming in we knew we'd have to try to do  
some things a little differently because of our situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' situation is this: down 1-0 to the Spurs in the NBA  
Finals, limited to nine players because of injuries, lacking 
concrete answers to the Spurs' powerful inside-outside threats. 
</P>
<P>
	A billboard alongside a highway leading to the Alamo City said  
it all on Thursday: Spurs 1, Knicks 0. Workers were on standby to 
raise the next one after Game 2 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone's tense at all,'' said David Robinson,  
who had 13 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in the Spurs' 
89-77 victory in Game 1 Wednesday night. ``I think we're thinking 
about the job that we need to do, that we're still a long ways from 
finishing this job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York is the team with the worries. The Knicks are depleted  
by the absence of injured center Patrick Ewing and hampered by 
Larry Johnson's balky knee. Van Gundy's task is to find a way to 
keep Tim Duncan under control without letting the Spurs' outside 
shooters -- like Jaren Jackson -- send them back to New York facing a 
2-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan had 33 points and 16 rebounds in Game 1, taking full  
advantage of the Knicks' strategy not to double-team him until he 
made a move toward the basket. By that time, it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Duncan did get tied up, Jackson was there to throttle  
the Knicks with one of his five 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way Duncan is playing right now, there isn't a man on the  
planet that can stop him,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy maintains that it is not Duncan who can hurt the  
Knicks most, but foul trouble and the shooting of outside assassins 
like Sean Elliott and Jackson, who had 17 points Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who at 6-foot-5 had to guard the 7-foot-1 Robinson,  
picked up two quick fouls in the first quarter and finished with 
five points and five fouls. Marcus Camby also committed five fouls, 
while Kurt Thomas and Chris Childs each had four. 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters more bleak for the Knicks were an assortment of  
new injury worries. Johnson said his knee was very sore after his 
surprise start, Camby also has a sore leg and Chris Dudley 
hyperextended his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is already playing without Ewing, who has a torn  
Achilles' tendon. Containing Duncan might very well be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure there is a good way right now,'' Van Gundy said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has fewer concerns, he took a  
pre-emptive strike against complacency in a contentious film 
session on Thursday. He told his team not to forget how the Knicks 
outrebounded them in the first game, outworked them in the first 
half and put a scare in the air at the Alamodome with their 
physical play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, seeking an NBA-record 12th straight victory in one  
postseason, are trying to shake their Game 2 blahs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we knew the reasons for why we played the way we did in  
these Game 2s, it wouldn't be a problem,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio's only loss in the playoffs came in Game 2 of their  
first-round series against Minnesota. They needed two late missed 
free throws by Kobe Bryant to beat the Los Angeles Lakers in the 
second game of that series, then got Elliott's miraculous 3-pointer 
in the final seconds to win Game 2 against Portland in the Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we paid too much attention to the TV, got too caught  
up in the hype, too full of ourselves,'' point guard Avery Johnson 
said. ``I told the team in practice today, until we win the 
championship, we still have a lot to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have any resemblance of the type of Game 2 we played in  
the previous three series, we're going to lose.''

<HEADLINE> Thailand Opens Bankruptcy Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand inaugurated a new bankruptcy  
court Friday created to handle an unusually larger number of cases 
resulting from the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bankruptcy court will serve not only bankruptcy cases, but  
also complicated business rehabilitation cases which involve major 
traders,'' Justice Minister Sutasn Ngernmune said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court was founded to modernize antiquated bankruptcy and  
foreclosure procedures. Under the old system, a bankruptcy case 
could drag on for years, partly because a case could be delayed 
indefinitely if a defendant did not show up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, parliament passed an act establishing the court and  
streamlined court procedures in bankruptcy cases. The bills were 
enacted May 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The court is expected to help work out cases on problem loans in  
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	About 47 percent, or $75 billion, of the financial system's  
outstanding loans are classified as nonperforming, meaning that the 
borrowers haven't paid interest or principal for three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The court is expected to process about 3,500 cases a year.

<HEADLINE> Court Ruling Helps Va. Juveniles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A death row inmate has avoided execution --  
at least temporarily -- by invoking a new state Supreme Court ruling 
that authorities must make a reasonable effort to notify both 
parents when a juvenile is arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Now lawyers for three other condemned men who were under 18 when  
they committed their crimes are weighing whether the ruling can be 
used to challenge those convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The execution of Douglas Christopher Thomas was halted  
Wednesday, hours before he was to die by injection. Thomas was 
convicted of capital murder in the 1990 shooting deaths of his 
girlfriend's parents. Only his mother was told of his arrest. He 
was 17 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas became the first death row inmate in Virginia to take  
advantage of the June 11 ruling, which prosecutors say could open 
thousands of cases to challenge. The ruling applies to convictions 
as far back as 1991, the year Thomas' case went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The reprieve doesn't mean Thomas will necessarily get a new  
trial. The Supreme Court is expected to consider the case during 
its September session. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court last week ordered a new trial for Jeramie Baker,  
who was convicted at 17 of trying to rob a convenience store and 
stabbing a clerk. Only his mother was notified of his arrest, 
despite a state law that requires summonses go ``to the parents'' 
of the juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court said the use of the plural ``parents'' means  
both the mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of all juveniles sentenced in criminal cases in  
Virginia come from single-parent homes or families headed by 
someone other than their biological parents. And for years, it was 
common practice for Virginia prosecutors to notify only one parent. 
</P>
<P>
	David Botkins, a spokesman for state Attorney General Mark L.  
Earley, said every claim of improper notification will have to be 
raised individually. 
</P>
<P>
	Jailed youths who seek release would have to go through another  
trial and risk a stiffer sentence, he said.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Want One More Trip to Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals will be the last  
time the Buffalo Sabres play in Marine Midland Arena this season. 
If they lose, it'll be their last game of the season, period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres arrived home today facing elimination for the first  
time this postseason. They must beat the Dallas Stars on Saturday 
night to send the series back to Reunion Arena for Game 7 on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lay it all on the line, then come back here for  
Game 7,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca said following a 2-0 loss 
Thursday night that put Buffalo into a win-or-else mode. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Brian Holzinger pointed out that the Sabres won Game 4  
after falling behind in the series 2-1. They also won Game 2 of 
their second-round series against Boston after losing the opener; 
that was the only other time they've trailed this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We responded once before and we'll respond once more,''  
Holzinger said. ``I think we're upbeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of 15 teams that have lost Game 5 of a 2-2 finals  
rebounded to win the championship. It hasn't happened since the 
Montreal Canadiens did it in 1971. None of the last four teams even 
stretched the series to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Buffalo has going for it is an 8-1 record on home ice  
this postseason. The Sabres have won 14 of their last 16 there, 
counting the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident team in our building,'' Ruff said. ``Our  
players believe they'll be back here for Game 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo never led Game 5, but the Sabres were within a shot of  
tying until the final 4:39. They've either been ahead, tied or down 
by one for all but 5:05 of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out really good in the first period, they took it to  
us for a while in the second, and in the third they must've iced it 
10-12 times to relieve pressure,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominik Hasek kept the Sabres in the game with terrific  
goaltending, but he was beaten by Darryl Sydor on a second-period 
power play and by Pat Verbeek in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Belfour, Dallas' less-heralded goalie, didn't have to make as  
many tough saves, but nonetheless stopped every shot he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught bullets from Jay McKee and Geoff Sanderson, got lucky  
when a shot deflected just wide of the post, then went behind the 
net to make a save when the puck came off the boards. Shortly 
thereafter, Belfour let a rebound squirt away, but dived on it 
before any Sabres arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the third period, we let it all hang out,'' Ruff said. ``We  
weren't generating a lot of quality chances, but we did have a 
couple of truly good ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotions of the game -- and series -- spilled over several  
times in the final minutes, beginning when a fan threw a foil 
Stanley Cup into the Sabres bench following Verbeek's goal with 
4:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Ruff and Stars coach Ken Hitchcock shouted at each  
other, and the game ended with Buffalo's Rhett Warrener and Dallas' 
Derian Hatcher tangling on the ice as time expired. Each was 
assessed a roughing penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener had his right ankle put in a cast for precautionary  
reasons. He was to be re-examined in Buffalo today.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Close to Debt-Forgiveness Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton today decried evidence  
of ``wholesale slaughter'' by Serb forces in Kosovo as world 
leaders gathered for a summit dominated by the massive task of 
rebuilding the Balkans. ``It is a worse truth than we dared dream 
of,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the summit began, U.S. and British officials announced that  
agreement was close on a plan to forgive billions of dollars in 
debt for the world's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the opening  
session that debt relief ``is not just a moral issue. It is an 
issue which is in our self interest to release the poorest 
countries from the chains of debt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British officials said the proposal will allow a total of $100  
billion, or two-thirds of the debt of more than 30 of the world's 
poorest nations, to be written off over a period of years. U.S. 
officials said the new initiative will triple the amount of debt 
relief now available to these nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the world's seven richest nations opened their summit  
today in a medieval banquet hall near Cologne's famous cathedral. 
Blair, French President Jacques Chirac and Canadian Prime Minister 
Jean Chretien shunned the normal limousine motorcade to walk to the 
meeting site, waving to crowds lining the narrow cobblestone 
streets and people leaning out of windows along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Blair met to discuss Kosovo before the formal  
opening of the summit of seven industrial nations and Russia with 
both expressing horror at reports that more than 10,000 ethnic 
Albanians had been killed in Serb massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we see the full horror of what went on in Kosovo, I think  
we can see how important it is that we took the action we did,'' 
Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is we reversed the ethnic cleansing,'' Clinton  
said with Blair at his side. ``We'll have to give a lot of care to 
the emotional and psychological scars of Kosovars, especially the 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the leaders of Japan, Germany, France, Britain,  
Italy and Canada are focusing three days of meetings on the 
reconstruction effort and a host of economic issues, including 
efforts to overhaul the global financial system so that it can 
better withstand future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	But the focus of much of the talk will be on a figure who is not  
here, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, indicted as a war 
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in an earlier meeting with Japanese Prime Minister  
Keizo Obuchi, said NATO peacekeeping troops, who began moving into 
Kosovo six days ago, are learning ``about the dimensions of the 
wholesale slaughter that went on there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not make any decisions which will in any way, shape or  
form undermine the ability of the Kosovars or the willingness of 
the Kosovars to come home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised Obuchi for a surprising spurt in the Japanese  
economy during the first three months of the year. The president 
said it was a tribute to ``the steadfast economic reform program'' 
Obuchi has put in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton met separately with German Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder at the Guerzenich, a medieval banquet hall. Security was 
tight, with sharpshooters posted in the building's turrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven leaders began their talks without Russian President  
Boris Yeltsin, who at last year's gathering in Birmingham, England, 
was formally admitted to what is now called the Group of Eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, however, has delayed his arrival until the summit's  
last day on Sunday, when the United States and Russia hope for a 
deal on the awkward question of how to fit Russian troops into 
NATO's huge peacekeeping operation in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday in Paris, Clinton acknowledged that Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic remained outside NATO's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that the NATO allies can invade Belgrade to  
try to deliver the indictment,'' Clinton said after meeting French 
President Jacques Chirac in Paris. ``Sometimes these things take a 
good while to bear fruit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The background to Cologne summit is a 78-day bombing campaign  
that forced Milosevic to withdraw from Kosovo and that also boosted 
the popularity ratings of the Western leaders. But Obuchi's main 
concern was to convince the others that his government finally has 
gotten control of the economic problems that have plagued the 
world's second largest economy for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan also was taking a leading role in the discussion of debt  
relief, determined as the biggest lender not to be left with the 
largest part of any debt write-off. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, the leaders hoped to get the best estimate yet of how  
much it will cost to reconstruct the Balkans. Aides said all were 
agreed, however, that Serbia should not be part of the package 
until Milosevic is removed from power. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders were expected to endorse a package of reforms put  
together by their finance ministers that aim to prevent or at least 
better handle future currency crises like the one that erupted in 
Asia two years ago and pushed one-third of the globe into 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals include requiring developing countries to publish  
more accurate information on their financial status, to increase 
regulation of banks and pursue ways to ensure that wealthy 
investors do not reap the benefits from multibillion-dollar rescue 
packages for countries in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	German officials said the aim was ``accepting the challenges of  
globalization and cushioning its risk better.''

<HEADLINE>  Women's World Cup Soccer Opens Sat. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Not since the gold medal at the  
Atlanta Olympics has the U.S. women's soccer team gotten so much 
attention and so much acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, a probable sellout at Giants Stadium for the opener  
of the Women's World Cup should bring back memories of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope at the end of it, we're walking off with the same  
feeling,'' U.S. star Mia Hamm said. ``And with that trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are favored to do just that. As hosts, they should  
get a huge boost from the crowds, beginning with a sellout in 
excess of 78,000 for the opening game against Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a packed house and everyone pro-U.S. and shouting  
`U-S-A,' it will be awesome,'' Shannon MacMillan said. ``We'll get 
that extra edge and little push from the home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they asked us if we thought the World Cup should be in  
big stadiums or smaller ones, we said, `We'll pack the large ones.' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we were practicing in Orlando, they'd pipe crowd noise  
into the Citrus Bowl to give us a feel for playing in front of huge 
crowds. But it's hard for anyone to understand what it is like, 
even after the Olympics. We're so fired up for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Danes. And the Brazilians and Mexicans, who meet in  
the second game of the doubleheader as the 16-team, three-week 
event gets rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Saturday, China, considered a co-favorite to win the  
third Women's World Cup tournament, plays Sweden, and Japan faces 
Canada at San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, the United States opened against Denmark in the 1995  
World Cup and the '96 Olympics. Facing the Americans in what could 
be an intimidating stadium doesn't seem to faze the Danes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us have played in front of 75,000,'' said  
Mikka Hansen, an American native playing for Denmark -- her father 
is Danish. ``Maybe it will be to the U.S. advantage, but there also 
is a lot of pressure attached for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players concede there might be some nervousness early  
in Saturday's game, which will be televised by ABC. But they 
believe there is enough veteran leadership on the team to ensure a 
quick start. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, no other nation has as experienced a core as the United  
States. Players such as Hamm, Michelle Akers, Brandi Chastain, 
Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, Joy Fawcett and Carla Overbeck were 
regulars in 1991, when the Americans took the inaugural World Cup 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of our vets,'' said MacMillan, a star in the Olympics  
who will be making her World Cup debut, ``they know how to keep 
things in check. They can relax the others and settle the team 
down. We're no stranger to big games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last week could have been the most difficult for the  
Americans, even though coach Tony DiCicco eased up on the practice 
routine as the opener got closer. That didn't help much, however, 
in dealing with the anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	But the players' camaraderie and closeness made the final  
buildup easier to handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Sunday, we've been here in Jersey and we've been ready  
for it to start,'' MacMillan said. ``The other night, I said to 
Julie, who was my roommate this week, `I can't believe it's only 
Wednesday.' I think we'll be ready to explode when we get on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have to worry about peaking too soon. It's  
actually been really relaxing the last couple of days. We went to 
see `Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' and we've all been 
repeating the lines all through practice. It's been a fun 
environment, sort of like dorm life. We're all like sisters on this 
team. We mesh and flow along together.''

environment, sort of like dorm life. We're all like sisters on this 
team. We mesh and flow along together.''

<HEADLINE>  Stars Want One More Trip to Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals will be the last  
time the Buffalo Sabres play in Marine Midland Arena this season. 
If they lose, it'll be their last game of the season, period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres arrived home today facing elimination for the first  
time this postseason. They must beat the Dallas Stars on Saturday 
night to send the series back to Reunion Arena for Game 7 on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lay it all on the line, then come back here for  
Game 7,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca said following a 2-0 loss 
Thursday night that put Buffalo into a win-or-else mode. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Brian Holzinger pointed out that the Sabres won Game 4  
after falling behind in the series 2-1. They also won Game 2 of 
their second-round series against Boston after losing the opener; 
that was the only other time they've trailed this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We responded once before and we'll respond once more,''  
Holzinger said. ``I think we're upbeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of 15 teams that have lost Game 5 of a 2-2 finals  
rebounded to win the championship. It hasn't happened since the 
Montreal Canadiens did it in 1971. None of the last four teams even 
stretched the series to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Buffalo has going for it is an 8-1 record on home ice  
this postseason. The Sabres have won 14 of their last 16 there, 
counting the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident team in our building,'' Ruff said. ``Our  
players believe they'll be back here for Game 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo never led Game 5, but the Sabres were within a shot of  
tying until the final 4:39. They've either been ahead, tied or down 
by one for all but 5:05 of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out really good in the first period, they took it to  
us for a while in the second, and in the third they must've iced it 
10-12 times to relieve pressure,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominik Hasek kept the Sabres in the game with terrific  
goaltending, but he was beaten by Darryl Sydor on a second-period 
power play and by Pat Verbeek in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Belfour, Dallas' less-heralded goalie, didn't have to make as  
many tough saves, but nonetheless stopped every shot he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught bullets from Jay McKee and Geoff Sanderson, got lucky  
when a shot deflected just wide of the post, then went behind the 
net to make a save when the puck came off the boards. Shortly 
thereafter, Belfour let a rebound squirt away, but dived on it 
before any Sabres arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the third period, we let it all hang out,'' Ruff said. ``We  
weren't generating a lot of quality chances, but we did have a 
couple of truly good ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotions of the game -- and series -- spilled over several  
times in the final minutes, beginning when a fan threw a foil 
Stanley Cup into the Sabres bench following Verbeek's goal with 
4:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Ruff and Stars coach Ken Hitchcock shouted at each  
other, and the game ended with Buffalo's Rhett Warrener and Dallas' 
Derian Hatcher tangling on the ice as time expired. Each was 
assessed a roughing penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener had his right ankle put in a cast for precautionary  
reasons. He was to be re-examined in Buffalo today.

<HEADLINE> Indian Funds Head Petitions Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's top-ranking  
American Indian appealed to a federal judge Friday to leave the 
government in control of $500 million in Indian trust funds that 
have been mismanaged for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who has run the Bureau of Indian Affairs  
for a year and a half, said it would destroy his agency -- and by 
extension the government's special relationship with tribes -- to 
lose control of the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deeply believe that not only is the bureau the right  
organization to do this, but it is the only organization that can 
do it,'' he told U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth. 
</P>
<P>
	The BIA is responsible for 300,000 accounts that handle rent,  
royalties and other income from 11 million acres of land owned by 
individual Indians, many of them very poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Lamberth held Gover, Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt for their 
failure to turn over records sought in a class-action lawsuit that 
seeks to reform the trust system and reconcile the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gover, a lawyer and Princeton graduate who is Interior's  
assistant secretary for Indian affairs, apologized ``for the 
failure of my agency to do what it was told to do.'' He was the 
government's leadoff witness in a trial of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began June 10, starting with testimony on behalf of  
the plaintiffs, the individual Indian account holders who brought 
the class-action lawsuit over the $500 million. The BIA controls an 
additional $2.5 billion in trust funds that belong to tribes and 
are not covered by the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	BIA has already lost much of its role in everyday Indian affairs  
now that many tribes have taken over programs the BIA once managed 
for them. Taking away the trust funds would be the next step toward 
eliminating the agency altogether, Gover said. 
</P>
<P>
	While tribal leaders are often the BIA's harshest critics, many  
of them share Gover's concern that the government would phase out 
its support for tribes if the agency didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BIA, for all its warts, is the icon, it is the symbol, of  
the commitment of the United States to the tribes,'' Gover said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust system has vexed a series of administrations, but  
Gover insisted the BIA is committed to cleaning it up. Next week, 
the agency will start testing a new computer system for managing 
the trust accounts and records. 
</P>
<P>
	The records are scattered in more than 100 BIA offices, and many  
of the accounts are quite small -- Gover said his own account 
contains just 7 cents -- because of the way ownership of Indian land 
has splintered through inheritances. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the plaintiffs scoffed at Gover's concerns for the  
future of the BIA, which they contend is incapable of managing the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross examination, Gover could not say whether the  
officials he's put in charge of the accounts have any previous 
experience in managing trusts. Lawyers for the account holders who 
filed the lawsuit also say the records are in such poor condition 
that the new accounting system can't be reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, is the BIA here to support the trust, or is  
the trust here to support the BIA?'' attorney Dennis Gingold said 
in an interview.

<HEADLINE> Padres Activate Reggie Sanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The veterans are slowly reclaiming their spots  
in the San Diego Padres' lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Reggie Sanders was activated from the 15-day  
disabled list Friday and rookie outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. was 
optioned back to Triple-A Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders follows Tony Gwynn back to active status. Gwynn was  
activated last Saturday after missing 19 games with a strained left 
calf. First baseman Wally Joyner, out since May 17 with a chip 
fracture in his left shoulder, began a rehabilitation assignment 
Friday at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to get the people that are supposed to be in  
there, one day at a time,'' said Sanders, who missed 13 games with 
a strained muscle in his right rib cage. ``We got Tony back, now 
I'm back and Wally's coming back next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to start rolling here in a minute,'' Sanders said  
with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres still haven't had their opening day lineup together  
since getting ripped by Colorado on April 4 in Monterrey, Mexico. 
Manager Bruce Bochy on Friday used his 61st different lineup in 65 
games. That total includes Sunday's game at Houston that was 
suspended when Astros manager Larry Dierker had a seizure in the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would like to have the team out there day in and day out  
that we had in spring training,'' said Sanders, who came over from 
Cincinnati in the Greg Vaughn trade. ``It's sad the way things have 
happened, but it happened and we've got to move on and just try to 
get everybody back to where they needed to be and let's go from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being banged up, the Padres have been brutal  
offensively. They're hitting just .227 in their last 12 games and 
have been held to three or fewer runs 34 times in 63 games, 
including 16 times in their last 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was leading the club in homers with nine when he went on  
the DL. Ruben Rivera matched that total with a solo shot in the 
second inning Friday night. Damian Jackson eclipsed Sanders to take 
the lead in stolen bases, 14 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was batting .267 with 16 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, 24, showed poise and maturity in his first big league  
stint. His father played 16 years in the big leagues and is the 
batting coach of the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are always asking, did I ever feel pressure being my  
father's son, and I always say the easy part is between the 
lines,'' Matthews said. ``It was no different when I came up here 
for the first time. Playing was the easy part. Sitting around 
before the game and sitting on the plane on the way up here was the 
time I was most nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned a lot while I was here. It was great to get my feet  
wet. I hope to be back soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, a switch-hitter, went 3-for-14 (.214) with one RBI and  
one stolen base in 11 games. He also walked eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did well,'' Bochy said. ``I think all these kids did well.  
He seemed comfortable the way he played. He really handled himself 
very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, ace Andy Ashby, on the DL with a strained lower  
back, had a brief bullpen session and said he felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went great,'' said Ashby (6-4, 3.65 ERA). ``I didn't feel  
anything. I actually thought I was overthrowing. Every day I'm 
feeling that much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is eligible to be activated on Tuesday, but isn't  
scheduled to start until Thursday at Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Surge / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices surged early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid concerns that hot weather 
was coming to parts of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather could scorch crops and lower yields, helping  
boost prices that have been in the doldrums amid excellent growing 
weather and expectations for another bumper harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the gains as some private weather models predicted  
a high-pressure ridge would form next week and linger over Iowa, 
one of the nation's largest corn- and soybean-growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose in step with corn and soybeans.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 2 cents to $2.57 a bushel; July  
corn rose 2 3/4 cents to $2.20 a bushel; July oats rose 1 1/2 cents to 
$1.18 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans rose 7 3/4 cents to $4.70 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and lean hogs were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. Feeder cattle retreated, while pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .07 cent to 64.07 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .37 cent to 76.95 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
rose .80 cent to 50.47 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .85 
cent to 44.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Compromise Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Much heavy lifting remains, but Republicans  
and Democrats on a key House committee are at least talking with 
Clinton administration officials about reaching a compromise Social 
Security rescue plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there is goodwill on all sides and a genuine desire  
to solve this problem,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman 
of the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 members of the panel met behind closed doors Thursday  
and heard from House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who told reporters 
afterward the bipartisan session was a signal that Social Security 
reform is still possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've encouraged them to keep at it,'' said Hastert, R-Ill.  
``Starting to work on a bipartisan basis is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no decisions were made, the fact that Republicans and  
Democrats were privately talking compromise together -- even 
inviting Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel to participate 
-- was itself unusual on such a politically charged issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said all sides agreed to ``expend every effort'' at  
achieving reform for the retirement program, which faces insolvency 
by 2034 as the big baby boom generation collects benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the process of determining how we begin to move this  
forward ... with the cooperation of the administration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer spoke to reporters standing shoulder-to-shoulder with  
Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways 
and Means Committee. Rangel said Hastert and House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., have asked the committee ``to try to work 
together to come up with a bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel said that although major differences remain on the  
approaches to saving Social Security, ``there are no differences in 
us recognizing we have to come up with something that we can sell 
to the House Republicans and the House Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that were successful, Archer added, there would be enough  
political momentum ``that the Senate would be put in a position 
where they would have to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several rank-and-file lawmakers echoed the positive nature of  
Thursday's session, but many cautioned that the panel is not yet 
ready to begin the tough job of hashing out an actual compromise 
bill. Decisions would have to be made on complex issues such as 
whether proposed retirement accounts would be under government or 
individual control and whether they could fit within the existing 
program's structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not yet at the point where we're ready to sit down and  
hammer out differences,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich. ``We have 
a considerable ways to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Apfel said there appears to be some agreement in broad  
terms between the White House and both parties in Congress 
regarding the need for more retirement savings, that projected 
budget surpluses should be used for Social Security and that 
investment in stocks or other equities are needed to boost the rate 
of return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look very much forward to continuing active three-way  
discussions,'' Apfel said. ``It's an optimistic start.''

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Florida State coach Mike Martin worked damage  
control Thursday after the morning newspaper disclosed the weekend 
arrest of a Seminoles player at a casino across the Missouri River 
in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Chris Jared Hart, a 20-year-old reserve  
catcher, was cited Saturday night for trespassing after being 
rebuffed by security guards who were checking for identification at 
two entrances to Bluffs Run Casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa law requires anyone entering a casino to be 21.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was told time and again that he couldn't get in,''  
Pottawattamie County sheriff's deputy Lee Bennett told the Omaha 
World-Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor complaint will be dropped if Hart performs 20  
hours of community service, the newspaper reported. Hart is the 
nephew of Florida State athletic director Dave Hart Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said Hart wasn't available for interviews before Florida  
State's game against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was so minor, it's hard to believe we're talking about  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said Hart opened a door, away from where the security  
guards were checking IDs, to look inside for relatives. Martin said 
Hart told him he didn't gamble, and no disciplinary action was 
taken.

	 *SEMINOLES LOOK-ALIKE:* Ron Johnson has been talking a lot of  
football this week for a guy who says he's just a normal Florida 
State fan. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems wherever Johnson goes in Omaha, people recognize his  
resemblance to Florida State football coach Bobby Bowden. It must 
be the graying hair, rounded belly and sloping nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them I'm Billy Bob Bowden, Bobby's brother,'' said  
Johnson, who drove up from Greenville, S.C., to watch the College 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who is retired, was sipping ginger ale in the parking  
lot with five others. They all laughed after hearing yet again that 
Johnson looks like Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard it every day since I've been here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he usually is approached in restaurants. Most folks  
ask him about Florida State's 18-16 victory in the 1994 Orange 
Bowl, when Nebraska kicker Byron Bennett's 45-yard field goal 
attempt was wide left on the last play. 
</P>
<P>
	At 57, Johnson is younger than the 69-year-old Bowden. Johnson  
said he has met Bowden once, when the coach signed a football for 
him.

	 *IN-SEASON ILLNESS:* Stanford center fielder Edmund Muth missed  
five weeks this season after being diagnosed with viral meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting migraines for about two weeks, so went to a  
clinic and they were treating me there,'' Muth said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, I went to a hospital where they did a spinal tap.  
That wasn't fun. Then they told me it was viral meningitis,'' he 
said. ``I had never heard of it. They told me, `It's attacking your 
brain.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Muth said he was treated with drugs and slowly recovered. He's  
showing no signs of sickness in Omaha, hitting .375 with a .583 
on-base percentage going into the game against Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a while to find my stroke again,'' Muth said. ``I  
guess I'm doing OK now.''

	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- As if Christian Fittipaldi didn't have  
enough going on these days with a race just about every weekend, 
the 28-year-old Brazilian will take on an additional chore next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittpaldi, who adheres to a strict fitness regiment and takes  
part in occasional marathons, plans to travel to Boulder, Colo., on 
Monday to participate in the Ironman Training Camp. He will be 
personally trained in the areas of cycling, swimming and running by 
former Ironman champions for two days. 
</P>
<P>
	That's after racing in Sunday's Budweiser-G.I. Joe's 200 at  
Portland International Raceway and before beginning practice on 
Friday for next week's Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Triathlete Magazine has scheduled Fittipaldi to appear on the  
cover of its September issue, but his two-day visit to the Ironman 
camp is not just a photo shoot. Fittipaldi says he plans to train 
and compete in the Ironman -- an annual competition in Hawaii -- 
after he retires from racing. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp opens for actual Ironman participants on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT READY:* Mark Blundell, who suffered a small cervical  
vertebrae fracture in a crash during testing on May 4 in Madison, 
Ill., was hoping to be back in the cockpit in time for Sunday's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Roberto Moreno, who has driven the PacWest  
Reynard-Mercedes for the last three races, will remain in the 
cockpit at least through next week's race in Cleveland. Blundell 
now hopes to be back in the car for the race in Elkhart Lake, Wis., 
on July 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Since replacing Blundell, Moreno has scored points in every  
race, finishing 11th in Brazil, fourth in Madison and 12th in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SAMBA BEAT:* That sound you hear above the roar of the  
turbocharged Indy-car engines could be a Brazilian beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 28 drivers entered in Sunday's race, 10 are from Brazil.  
</P>
<P>
	That includes Fittipaldi, Moreno, Gil de Ferran, Helio  
Castro-Neves, Tony Kanaan, Mauricio Gugelmin, Gualter Salles and 
rookies Tarso Marques, Cristiano da Matta and Luiz Garcia Jr. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONSTER RETIRED:* Patrick Racing driver Adrian Fernandez  
debuted a 1999 Reynard-Ford on Friday, retiring the car his team 
dubbed Frankenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The car he has been using since the beginning of the season was  
a hybrid Reynard chassis, a 1998 with a 1999 update kit. The 
Mexican driver won in Japan and had four top-five finishes in 
Frankenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Pat Patrick had planned to start the season with new  
Swift chassis, but was unhappy with test results and made the 
switch to Reynard just days before the Homestead, Fla., opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez began the Portland event in his new car -- which the  
team calls The Bride of Frankenstein -- sixth in the driver 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LONGER COURSE:* Widening the first of nine turns at Portland  
International Raceway means the course distance has changed just 
enough that everything will be a record this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Omega, the official timing and scoring system of CART, measures  
each track from the center line. With the widening of turn one, the 
official distance changed from 1.967 to 1.969 miles.

	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- The Masters proved that Greg Norman's  
shoulder is strong enough for him to compete with the best golfers 
in the world. The U.S. Open showed his head still needs some work. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoroughly uninspired by the majestic beauty of Pinehurst No. 2,  
Norman failed to make the cut Friday after shooting an 8-over 78 in 
the second round, leaving him with an 11-over 151 total. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Shark had played sparingly since his third-place  
finish at the Masters, his level of play during two days in North 
Carolina was shockingly inept. He started off with a 73 and hit 
just two of 18 greens in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was ugly today,'' Norman said after cleaning out his  
locker. ``It's a bit of a horror story for me right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other notables who will get to watch the final two  
rounds of the tournament on television are Masters champion Jose 
Maria Olazabal, two-time Open champion Ernie Els, Fred Couples, 
Mark O'Meara, Nick Faldo and Jack Nicklaus, making his 43rd 
consecutive Open appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman, who played only three tournaments in 1988 before  
undergoing shoulder surgery, came through with a stirring 
performance at Augusta National in early April. He was tied for the 
lead with five holes remaining before fading to three shots behind 
Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian had played only three tournaments since the  
Masters for a top finish of 68th. It was hardly the kind of 
preparation he needed for the challenging conditions at Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really a physical thing for me,'' said Norman, a  
cumulative 25 over in his last four Open rounds, also missing the 
cut in 1997. ``I guess I'd like to work on my head a little bit. I 
need to get fired up about playing again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most painful departures belonged to Olazabal, Els, Faldo and  
Scott Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard angrily punched a hotel wall Thursday night after  
an opening-round 75, breaking a bone in his right hand. He was 
forced to withdraw and will be sidelined up to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did something I should not have,'' said Olazabal, who could  
miss the British Open in July. ``Now, I'm paying the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Els, who won the Open in 1994 and '97, made two double-bogeys  
during a round of 76, but still would have made the cut with a 
birdie on one of the last four holes. He missed a 25-foot putt at 
16, an 18-footer at 17 and a 10-footer at 18 after a sparkling 
second shot, his knees buckling as the ball slid by the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how disappointed he was, Els replied, ``I can't even  
explain it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, a six-time major champion trapped in the worst slump of  
his career, has now missed the cut in six of his last 10 majors 
after consecutive rounds of 74 left him one shot short. The 
Englishman was 5 over with four holes remaining before three 
straight bogeys knocked him below the line that separates those who 
play and those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoch had an 8-foot par putt on the final hole, needing to make  
it to remain at 7 over and ensure his return Saturday. The ball 
lipped the right side of the cup, spun entirely around the edge and 
came to rest about an inch away. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoch tapped in for bogey and went home.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, who won the Masters and British Open last year, missed  
the cut in the U.S. Open for the first time in four years with a 
10-over 150, though this is hardly one of his favorite tournaments. 
He hasn't finished in the top 10 since tying for third in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old Nicklaus had rounds of 78 and 75 for a 13-over  
total, equaling the worst two-round score on his extensive Open 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Open champion Lee Janzen, who struggled to rounds of  
74 and 73, narrowly made the cut because he is within 10 shots of 
leaders Payne Stewart, David Duval and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a great effort tomorrow to get back in the  
hunt, and another one on Sunday,'' Janzen said. ``But if you make 
the cut, it's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No such comeback is possible for players like Lee Westwood, who  
finished sixth at the Masters but slumped to a 9-over 149 in the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking relieved when it was over, he was asked to name the  
toughest holes on the Donald Ross-designed course. 
</P>
<P>
	``All 18 of them,'' he said with a sigh.

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Florida State coach Mike Martin worked damage  
control Thursday after the morning newspaper disclosed the weekend 
arrest of a Seminoles player at a casino across the Missouri River 
in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Chris Jared Hart, a 20-year-old reserve  
catcher, was cited Saturday night for trespassing after being 
rebuffed by security guards who were checking for identification at 
two entrances to Bluffs Run Casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa law requires anyone entering a casino to be 21.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was told time and again that he couldn't get in,''  
Pottawattamie County sheriff's deputy Lee Bennett told the Omaha 
World-Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor complaint will be dropped if Hart performs 20  
hours of community service, the newspaper reported. Hart is the 
nephew of Florida State athletic director Dave Hart Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said Hart wasn't available for interviews before Florida  
State's game against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was so minor, it's hard to believe we're talking about  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said Hart opened a door, away from where the security  
guards were checking IDs, to look inside for relatives. Martin said 
Hart told him he didn't gamble, and no disciplinary action was 
taken.

	 *SEMINOLES LOOK-ALIKE:* Ron Johnson has been talking a lot of  
football this week for a guy who says he's just a normal Florida 
State fan. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems wherever Johnson goes in Omaha, people recognize his  
resemblance to Florida State football coach Bobby Bowden. It must 
be the graying hair, rounded belly and sloping nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them I'm Billy Bob Bowden, Bobby's brother,'' said  
Johnson, who drove up from Greenville, S.C., to watch the College 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who is retired, was sipping ginger ale in the parking  
lot with five others. They all laughed after hearing yet again that 
Johnson looks like Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard it every day since I've been here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he usually is approached in restaurants. Most folks  
ask him about Florida State's 18-16 victory in the 1994 Orange 
Bowl, when Nebraska kicker Byron Bennett's 45-yard field goal 
attempt was wide left on the last play. 
</P>
<P>
	At 57, Johnson is younger than the 69-year-old Bowden. Johnson  
said he has met Bowden once, when the coach signed a football for 
him. 
</P>

	 *IN-SEASON ILLNESS:* Stanford center fielder Edmund Muth missed  
five weeks this season after being diagnosed with viral meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting migraines for about two weeks, so went to a  
clinic and they were treating me there,'' Muth said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, I went to a hospital where they did a spinal tap.  
That wasn't fun. Then they told me it was viral meningitis,'' he 
said. ``I had never heard of it. They told me, `It's attacking your 
brain.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Muth said he was treated with drugs and slowly recovered. He's  
showing no signs of sickness in Omaha, hitting .375 with a .583 
on-base percentage going into the game against Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a while to find my stroke again,'' Muth said. ``I  
guess I'm doing OK now.''

	Russia, U.S. Still Discuss Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- U.S. and Russian negotiators continued  
to search today for an agreement on Russia's role in Kosovo 
peacekeeping. It was not clear, however, how the high-level talks 
would break a deadlock over Russia's demand that it play an equal 
role with NATO countries. Defense Secretary William Cohen said he 
was hopeful a deal could be completed, although both sides were 
``prepared to leave without a final agreement.'' Russian Defense 
Minister Marshall Igor Sergeyev raised the possibility that the 
issue might have to be resolved by President Clinton and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin, who will meet Sunday at an economic summit 
in Cologne, Germany. 

</P>
<P>
	G-8 Close to Debt-Forgiveness Deal  
</P>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton today decried evidence  
of ``wholesale slaughter'' by Serb forces in Kosovo as world 
leaders gathered for a summit dominated by the massive task of 
rebuilding the Balkans. ``It is a worse truth than we dared dream 
of,'' Clinton said. As the summit began, U.S. and British officials 
announced that agreement was close on a plan to forgive billions of 
dollars in debt for the world's poorest countries. Aides said 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the opening session that 
debt relief ``is not just a moral issue. It is an issue which is in 
our self interest to release the poorest countries from the chains 
of debt.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Serbs Continue Flight from Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As terrified Serb civilians flee  
Kosovo and ethnic Albanian refugees return, the United States, 
France, Britain, Germany and Italy have divided Kosovo into five 
sectors for peacekeeping that Russia wants to be part of. NATO 
troops in Kosovo will take an active role in bringing suspected war 
criminals to justice under an agreement worked out today by allied 
nations and the international tribunal for Yugoslavia. President 
Slobodan Milosevic and four top aides were indicted last month on 
war crime charges.

	Clinton: NRA Wins in House Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says the vote by the House  
to loosen restrictions on is a victory for the National Rifle 
Association. And Attorney General Janet Reno concurred, saying the 
vote is ``a very big step backwards,'' and ``incomprehensible.'' 
The White House already was talking about a veto, should the 
provision remain in the final compromise bill passed by Congress. A 
White House spokesman said the fight against the House action will 
begin tomorrow in the president's radio address.

	Arson Caused Calif. Synagogue Fires  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Three synagogues were hit by  
coordinated arson attacks today, and hate literature blaming the 
``Jewish media'' for the war in Kosovo was found at one of the 
buildings. The fires caused moderate damage to two synagogues and 
gutted a third temple's library. Federal officials were at the 
scenes, investigating the fires as hate crimes. Authorities took 
one youth into custody and were seeking several others who were 
seen near Congregation B'nai Israel. Because of the timing and 
spacing of the synagogues, one person could not have set all three 
fires, authorities said.

	Turkey Removes Ocalan Case Judge  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Responding to European pressure, the  
Turkish parliament voted today to remove the military judge from 
the panel hearing the treason trial of Kurdish rebel leader 
Abdullah Ocalan. The move, which amended two articles of the 
constitution to exclude military judges from State Security Courts, 
was approved by a vote of 423 to 40. Constitutional reforms require 
a two-thirds majority in Turkey. European states and human rights 
organizations have sharply criticized the courts, saying the 
presence of a military judge on the three-member tribunals calls 
into question their decisions.

	Woods Three Back After Two Rounds  
</P>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Tiger Woods recovered from knocking a  
ball into a tree and a bunker with back-to-back birdies today and 
is three strokes back after two rounds of the U.S. Open golf 
tournament. David Duval is the leader at 4-under-par through three 
holes today, with Payne Stewart and Phil Mickelson one shot behind. 
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal withdrew before the second 
round after hitting a wall with his hand and breaking a bone. 
Olazabal, who shot 75 in the first round, had been trying to become 
the first golfer since Jack Nicklaus in 1972 to win the Masters and 
the Open in one year.

<HEADLINE> Burned Dog Pound Stirs Mass. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLAND, Mass. (AP) -- Residents tired of hearing animal rights  
activist Patricia Mumper complain about conditions at the town's 
dog pound aren't hearing anything from her these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumper is accused of burning down the pound, and her lawyer has  
told her to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old animal rights activist has pleaded innocent to  
arson, which carries up to 10 years in prison. But hours before the 
fire on June 1, she warned a Holland selectman she would ``do 
something to embarrass the town,'' and a prosecutor says she was 
seen near the pound around the time of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	No animals were there, and no one was hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	The pound, which is now a charred ruin, was a simple  
25-by-25-foot wooden shed with four separate runs, each with a dog 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Petersen, Holland's dog catcher, told town leaders in  
May that the pound was in ``deplorable condition.'' Even so, he 
said, whoever set the fire left the animals with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	For Stephen Dean, head of the Springfield-based Dog Adoption  
Network, the burning of Holland's dog pound was an act of civil 
disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	``This burning of the dog shelter was a symbol of total  
frustration in the minds of people who felt that the animals were 
incarcerated there,'' he said. ``The only thing worse than being a 
lost dog in Holland was being a found dog -- and being put there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dean came to know Ms. Mumper several years ago, when both were  
newly arrived summer residents in this central Massachusetts town 
of 2,300 people on the Connecticut line. 
</P>
<P>
	They joined to help form a local group that tried to get town  
leaders to replace the shed where stray dogs are kept to await 
their owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mumper, a married administrative assistant at an insurance  
company, began living in town full-time within the past year. She 
was a fixture at local meetings, where she held forth at length on 
the pound: disgraceful, not fit for a dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Some even agreed more or less, but many eventually rolled their  
eyes. They had heard it all before from her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see her as a threat -- a nuisance, yes, but never a  
threat. She'd never let you forget,'' said Paul Gillis, a selectman 
who retired this month. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Mumper warned Gillis she would ``do something to  
embarrass the town,'' Gillis expected a lawsuit. Instead, the pound 
went up in flames that evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog catcher said he might bring dogs to a veterinarian in a  
nearby town and pay for temporary shelter. But he said that in the 
meantime, the town may need to set up some kind of temporary pound, 
probably with worse conditions than in the old one.

<HEADLINE> Pac-10 OKs Washington's Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Pacific-10 on Friday agreed to accept  
Washington's self-imposed penalties for football recruiting 
violations since Rick Neuheisel took over as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue were ``quiet period'' violations, contacts between  
Washington coaches and student athletes at another school without a 
written release and violation of the tryout rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Barbara Hedges said she was pleased with the  
Pac-10 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference commended the school for its ``meaningful and  
appropriate penalties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five coaches conducted in-person, off-campus recruiting visits  
with eight prospective students athletes during a ``quiet period'' 
on Jan. 31 when such contacts are barred. 
</P>
<P>
	The five athletes visited who signed with Washington were  
declared ineligible by the school. The school then petitioned the 
NCAA, which restored their eligibility. The five coaches each were 
withheld from two weeks of off-campus recuiting in May and will be 
withheld from two weeks of recuiting in the December-January 
contact period. Neuheisel and the five assistants will receive 
letters of reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Neuheisel and two assistant coaches directly contacted two  
students at their former team at Colorado without permission from 
that school's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel will be limited to nine evaluation days, rather than  
the usual 29, during the 1999-2000 spring and fall evaluation 
periods. Washington will reduced the permissible number of football 
visits by six next year. No Colorado football player enrolled as of 
Jan. 11 will be permitted to transfer to Washington and compete on 
the school football team.

<HEADLINE> Air Guard Jet Crashes in Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An Air National Guard F-16 crashed this morning  
during a training mission on the Goldwater bombing range south of 
Gila Bend. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the single-seat aircraft ejected safely, said guard  
spokesman Maj. Charles Roque. No other details about the 9:20 a.m. 
crash were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was part of the Tucson-based 162nd Fighter wing.  
</P>
<P>
	The Air National Guard just checked its fleet of F-16s after  
inspectors found a number of hairline cracks in the engines of 
F-16s at Luke Air Force Base in Glendale. Three of the 81 air guard 
engines checked were cracked. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar cracks caused at least two F-16 crashes at Luke Air  
Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of Luke's F-16s, which cost $20 million apiece, have crashed  
since October. There have been no deaths or serious injuries.

<HEADLINE> Critics Worry About Child Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The crime was horrific: Two young boys aged 10  
and 11 dangled a 5-year-old playmate from a 14th-floor window when 
he wouldn't steal candy for them, then calmly dropped the screaming 
child to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 slaying brought an emotional warning from President  
Clinton about kids whose ``hearts can be turned to stone by the 
time they are 10 or 11 years old.'' It also presented the nation 
with a dilemma: how to punish the perpetrators without helping to 
harden those hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, the older boy is headed for adult prison for  
attacking a fellow inmate in a youth lockup. His defenders say 
Jessie Rankins, now 15, never got a fair chance to turn his life 
around with the psychiatric care he desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to say that this proves the point that he's  
beyond help,'' said Hershella Conyers, a lawyer for Rankins' 
younger co-defendant. ``But I look at it with my own biases and say 
that this kid should have been treated differently. I think that we 
failed Jessie Rankins all along the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Rankins used a toothbrush to sexually assault a  
13-year-old inmate at the state's Warrenville youth prison in 1996. 
He pleaded guilty Monday as an adult to criminal sexual assault and 
could get up to 30 years in prison when he is sentenced July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was not so clear-cut four years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	From the start, disagreement raged over how to handle Rankins  
and his co-defendant, who prosecutors said dropped Eric Morse to 
his death because he refused to steal for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Both boys were declared delinquent, but the Illinois Department  
of Children and Family Services rejected defense requests to have 
them placed in psychiatric clinics for intensive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	With the agency's urging, Circuit Judge Carol Kelly placed the  
two in the juvenile division of the state prison system. Jeannette 
Tamayo, the agency's deputy chief counsel, said the department's 
capacity to help was overmatched by the level of the boys' crime. 
</P>
<P>
	When lawmakers gave the agency authority over delinquents, they  
were thinking ``more along the lines of shoplifting than murder,'' 
Tamayo said. ``The department is equipped to meet the needs of 
children who have been the victims of abuse and neglect but not 
really equipped for people who have been the perpetrators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials decided they had no way to protect other children in  
their care from the boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Rankins was sent to Warrenville, where wire mesh is embedded in  
the windows rather than bars. Officials say boys sent there tend to 
be the youngest, smallest and least experienced in the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say it's still a tough place to live.  
</P>
<P>
	``In this day and age, it's only the roughest kids who get sent  
to prison, so he was in with a lot of pretty rough customers,'' 
said Patrick Murphy, the Cook County public guardian. 
</P>
<P>
	Rankins, like his co-defendant, had ``a terrible, terrible  
upbringing,'' and Murphy wasn't surprised when there was trouble. 
He said it was still hard to know just what the state should have 
done with Rankins. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it would have to be an extraordinary case to send a kid  
who was 10 years old to prison,'' said Murphy. ``Even if you felt 
incarceration were necessary, I think you'd want him to spend at 
least a couple of years somewhere else where he could get some 
psychiatric treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections spokesman Brian Fairchild said Warrenville inmates  
get psychiatric treatment, but was unable to give details. 
</P>
<P>
	Rankins is no longer at Warrenville. He is now at the state's  
maximum security youth prison at Joliet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the programs they have are adequate for most  
children, let alone children with special needs and special 
problems,'' said his lawyer, John Elias. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to hear a lot about that at a future court  
date.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Harcourt General Inc. CEO Richard A. Smith  
will step down Nov. 1., though he will stay on as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 74, held the CEO post at the educational publishing  
company from 1961 to 1991 and from 1997 to the present. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith will also stay on as chairman of The Neiman Marcus Group,  
Harcourt General's retailing subsidiary, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's son and son-in-law, Robert A. Smith, 40, and Brian J.  
Knez, 41, have been elected co-chief executive officers. The two 
have served together as presidents and co-chief operating officers 
of the company since January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to maintain a very active role as chairman in  
charting the future course of both Harcourt General and The Neiman 
Marcus Group,'' Smith said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no immediate changes in the way the companies are  
run, said the elder Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Harcourt General is an international multimedia publisher of  
educational and professional materials. The company has a 54 
percent controlling interest in The Neiman Marcus Group.

	MANDAN, N.D. (AP) -- Slapping a tariff on imported wheat would  
help deter foreign sales in the United States at a time when 
American farmers are not covering their own costs, Republican 
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He advocates a tariff on imported farm commodities to equalize  
the price with U.S. production costs. The revenue could be used to 
cut taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the price of wheat falls below the cost of production,  
why are you importing wheat? That simply kills your family farms,'' 
Buchanan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan was making his second campaign trip in four months to  
North Dakota, where Republicans are holding an early statewide 
presidential caucus on Feb. 29. The newspaper columnist and 
television commentator was opening his state headquarters in 
Bismarck during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1996, the state's presidential primary election was  
won by Bob Dole, the eventual GOP nominee. Buchanan finished third 
among eight candidates, behind Dole and publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in both parties, as well as wheat farmers and  
agricultural groups, often complain about Canadian wheat imports 
into the United States, claiming the wheat is being sold below its 
cost of production. Buchanan said agricultural interests are given 
short shrift in trade negotiations. 
</P>

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- He has little money, he's late entering an  
already crowded race and he's seen as a straight-laced Mormon. The 
combination makes Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, by his own account, the 
``longest of the long shots'' for the Republican presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Hatch appears poised to enter the race within  
weeks, several GOP sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-term senator and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman  
is searching for a campaign staff and is using the California-based 
Russo Marsh &AMP; Rogers consulting firm. But Hatch has not made a 
final decision on running, aides in Washington and Salt Lake City 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking at the curtains in the White House yet,''  
consultant Sal Russo said. ``We're looking at the next 30 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Hatch told The Associated Press: ``I've had  
people come to me, and I'm certainly courteously listening. I'm not 
pushing them away. I'm just listening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's senior senator doesn't underestimate the challenges of  
running for president from a state with five electoral votes and 
facing Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the popular front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be the longest of the long shots, I know that,'' Hatch,  
65, said at a state GOP convention two weeks ago. ``Everyone knows 
... it's very late in the game. It'll be very, very tough to raise 
the money.'' 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative activist and radio talk show host  
Alan Keyes, who failed in a 1996 bid for the Oval Office, has 
formed a presidential exploratory committee for the 2000 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes, who twice ran for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, has also  
worked as a State Department official. He is now the host of a talk 
show popular with many conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes argues that abortion and a decline in religion are behind  
the nation's woes. He spares neither Democrats nor Republicans and 
has criticized ``a political elite so utterly estranged from any 
connection to the people,'' as he said in Iowa last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Keyes, who formed his committee Thursday, has gotten  
little attention, he has the potential to split the votes of social 
conservatives who like his message, even though his chances of 
winning seem remote. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Dan Schnur of San Francisco, a veteran  
Republican media strategist, has been named communications director 
of Sen. John McCain's GOP presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnur has political ties to two McCain rivals, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush and former Vice President Dan Quayle, but said 
McCain's policy stands and personal background drew him to the 
Arizona senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``After eight years of Clinton, voters are ready for someone who  
talks to them straight, and who's got the personal credibility to 
make it stick,'' Schnur said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain called Schnur ``one of America's best political  
communicators,'' and cited his experience in California politics as 
a key reason for his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	California is holding its earliest-ever primary in March, and  
McCain has said he is making the state a key target of his 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> 1 Nabbed in Calif. Synagogue Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Fires damaged three synagogues in the  
Sacramento area today, and arson was suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	An incendiary device was found at Temple Beth Shalom in nearby  
Carmichael, along with hate literature, authorities said. One 
person was in custody, and at least three others were being sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said that because of the timing and spacing of the  
synagogues, one person could not have set all three fires. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the fires, the first of which was reported at 3:25 a.m.,  
were quickly brought under control, and arson investigators were 
called in, said Matt Shank at the city's Emergency Regional 
Communications Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two synagogues were identified as Temple B'Nai Israel  
and the Knesset Israel Torah Center, both in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst damage was at B'Nai Israel, where a library used by a  
nonreligious private school was destroyed and offices were damaged, 
said fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire at the Torah Center was contained to the first floor  
and caused moderage damage, fire officials said. At Beth Shalom, 
the fire damaged the sanctuary, but sprinklers put it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're dealing with a sick mind,'' a distraught Rabbi Joseph  
Melamed of Beth Shalom said. ``There's no question about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our congregations have been badly damaged,'' said Beryl  
Michaels, executive director of the Jewish Federation of the 
Sacramento Region. ``Library books will need to be replaced. We do 
not know yet whether any of the Torah scrolls have been damaged. 
This is the most important thing.'' Torah scrolls are considered so 
holy that simply dropping one is a serious matter and when one is 
significantly damaged, it is given a burial ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosel Zarit, president of the congregation at Beth Shalom, said  
the fires will be used as a learning experience, especially for the 
temple's children. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't let the anger of other people get you angry too,  
because it doesn't accomplish anything,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members reported finding inflammatory literature at Temple  
Beth Shalom several months ago. It was not the same material as 
that found today, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacramento County sheriff's deputies were dispatched to all  
synagogues in the area.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Stabilizes, Still Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's eating, he's been outside and active, but  
there's no way of knowing how long giant panda Hsing-Hsing's 
improved health will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have no idea,'' National Zoo spokesperson Bob Hoage  
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsing-Hsing suffers from progressing kidney failure and  
arthritis, and is being treated with various medications. He's 
eating a gruel of cottage cheese, honey, vitamins, rice and 
minerals, which, along with the usual panda diet of bamboo, has 
given Hsing-Hsing some of his old energy back, zoo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's stabilized, he's certainly doing better,'' Hoage said.  
``Giant pandas are pretty resilient creatures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no telling how long Hsing-Hsing will be up and  
about. He may decline again, and the Zoo is taking a ``wait and 
see'' approach, Hoage added. 
</P>
<P>
	``The veterinarian chapter is just being written'' on panda  
health and longevity, said Hoage. ``We can compare with bears and 
dogs, but there's really no way to know. '' 
</P>
<P>
	There are only a handful older giant pandas left in the world  
and none outside China, except Hsing-Hsing himself. He's 
28-years-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsing-Hsing, along with his female mate, Ling-Ling, arrived in  
Washington in 1972 as a gift from the People's Republic of China 
following President Nixon's trip to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ling-Ling died of heart failure in 1992. None of the cubs that  
the pair produced survived more than a few days.

<HEADLINE> Grandmother To Meet Tony Fernandez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- A 92 year-old grandmother, who calls herself  
Canada's biggest Toronto Blue Jays fan, got to meet Tony Fernandez, 
her idol, before Friday night's game against the Kansas City 
Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Frances Elliot, who has a total of 50 children,  
grandchildren and great grandchildren, raised enough money for her 
to fly to Toronto from her home in Winnipeg, Manitoba, so she could 
attend her first Blue Jays game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always wanted to see them play, but it never seemed  
feasible,'' said Elliott, who was told about the trip on Mother's 
Day. ``Anytime they needed `Grammom' I was there, and now I've seen 
that it's paid off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, ``Grammom'' chatted with Fernandez for 15  
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to be real friends, he called me `Grammom' and signed  
my ball,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Report Submitted to Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legalized gambling has delivered jobs to  
thousands of Americans but troubling consequences to millions more, 
the chairman of a federal study said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm deeply disturbed by the impact of gambling on individuals,  
on families and on communities, '' said Kay James who guided the 
National Gambling Impact Study Commission through two years of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission submitted a massive report on the costs and  
benefits of legalized betting to Congress, the White House, 
governors and tribal governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends a nationwide minimum age of 21 to place  
bets, a ban on betting on collegiate sports, restriction on 
campaign donations by the gambling industry, removal of cash 
machines from casino floors and a reduction of state lottery 
adverting. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most disputed finding, the commission also urges  
governments to consider imposing a moratorium on further expansion 
of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	But history suggests there are steep odds against any real  
change. Another federal commission more than 20 years ago also had 
a swarm of ideas, but few ever were enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that some will use ... (the recommendations) as  
guidelines, but there will be no overwhelming endorsement and 
enactment of the proposals,'' said Drake University professor W. 
Scott Wood, who teaches a class on the psychology of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, gambling is extremely popular. Thirty-seven  
states and the District of Columbia now run lotteries; commercial 
casinos operate in 10 states, and Indian tribes have opened casinos 
in at least 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-gambling members of Congress already have vowed to fight any  
effort to impose new federal restrictions on state-approved 
gambling. ``Gambling is already well-regulated by the states,'' 
said Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., whose district includes Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	States, meanwhile, rely on revenue from legalized gambling and  
are unlikely to limit or roll it back, said Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	But gambling opponents said they hoped the report by the  
congressionally created commission may at least make legal gambling 
a front-burner issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two and a half years ago, we couldn't get a story on this  
issue if we tried,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., a gambling 
opponent who sponsored legislation creating the commission. Now, he 
said, ``I don't think this issue will ever, ever go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, approved by the commission two weeks ago, has  
attracted attention, even before it's been formally submitted. For 
example: 
</P>
<P>
	--The watchdog group Public Citizen asserted that campaign  
donations have turned Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
into the ``most powerful congressional friend'' of the casino 
industry. Lott denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Common Cause reported that gambling interests gave more than  
$6.3 million in campaign money to both parties in the two years 
since the commission was created. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Gallup poll showed that legal gambling enjoys broad public  
acceptance among Americans but has prompted concerns about 
addiction and the integrity of sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
	--Researchers at the University of Georgia and the University of  
Illinois reported that counties experience higher rates of property 
crime and violent crime after casinos open. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Cato Institute report urged the federal government to stay  
out of gambling, which ``for the vast majority of people is ... a 
voluntary and harmless pursuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said he plans to introduce bills to enact some of the  
commission's recommendations. He also might go beyond the 
commission's report to propose a federal tax on gambling revenues 
and elimination of a federal tax deduction for gambling losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to take this work and make sure it doesn't sit on a  
shelf in Washington and collect dust,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming  
Association, accused Wolf of unleashing a ``hysterical diatribe'' 
that ignored the report's findings that casinos have boosted 
failing local economies.

<HEADLINE> New Yorker Elie helps San Antonio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Mario Elie is playing beside mild-mannered  
big men in an easygoing Texas city. He hasn't lost his New York 
fervor. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie put his intensity to use Friday night and the San Antonio  
Spurs took advantage of his infectious spirit for an 80-67 victory 
over the Knicks in Game 2 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio went up 2-0 in the best-of-7 series, and Elie took  
another step toward winning his third NBA championship. He won 
titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie used a dramatic dunk and his customary theatrics to get the  
Alamodome crowd of 39,554 fired up late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After dunking, Elie looked around at the crowd and waved his  
arms upward to urge on the cheers. And the roar inside the 
cavernous building never seemed to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, who averaged 9.7 points in the regular season, finished  
with 15 Friday night on 4-for-10 shooting. His final four points 
came on free throws with less than a minute to play and ensured the 
Spurs stayed ahead by at least 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	On his last trip to the foul line, Elie was laughing. And his  
sometimes stoic teammates, including 7-foot stars David Robinson 
and Tim Duncan, followed his lead and celebrated as they were 
replaced by reserves for the game's final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sweep, sweep, sweep,'' the Alamodome crowd shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	The series moves to Madison Square Garden, where Elie is sure to  
feel almost at home. He grew up five minutes from the arena in 
Manhattan and said he's looking forward to his mother's home 
cooking as well as the sights, sounds and intensity of his native 
city.

<HEADLINE> Recent Rap Songs Target NYC Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani keeps getting mentioned  
in rap songs lately. But the rappers aren't singing his praises. 
</P>
<P>
	One song is titled ``Who Shot Rudy?''  
</P>
<P>
	The soon-to-be released song, by a group called Screwball,  
imagines Giuliani being gunned down at City Hall to the delight of 
the minority community: ``Nobody cried -- it was real like some Jews 
celebrating when the Pharaoh got killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the rap song ``Bucktown U.S.A.'' by Cocoa Brovaz  
objected to the mayor's so-called quality of life initiatives, 
which have targeted such people as jaywalkers and sex shop owners. 
The result, the song laments, is the relative absence of ``dice 
throwin''' and ``weed blowin.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other songs also ridicule the mayor, and one uses an  
expletive when his name is invoked. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs can be traced to the mayor's troubled relationship  
with the city's blacks and Hispanics. Tensions have been running 
especially high because of recent cases in which white police 
officers killed or brutalized minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Akiba Solomon, national affairs editor at the hip-hop magazine  
The Source, explained that rap music -- like folk and rock -- has a 
tradition of political commentary, including criticism of public 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hip-hop in general is how young, urban, mostly African  
American and Latino people feel,'' she said. ``Giuliani definitely 
fills a role. It's not necessarily him personally, but what he 
represents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, an opera aficionado, reacted to the latest song with  
some humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one about shooting me? I didn't like that one too much,''  
he said, smiling. ``I did not consider it one of the better songs 
of the year. The others I haven't heard.'' He added: ``I stopped 
worrying about threats and stuff like that a long time ago when I 
was U.S. attorney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said the violent lyrics of ``Who Shot Rudy?'' are  
troubling, particularly if children hear the song. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyron Jones, the 24-year-old who wrote ``Who Shot Rudy?,'' said  
the song arose from his own troubles with the law, including a 
stint in jail. He also said that a friend shot was by police on two 
occasions without being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the mayor, Jones said: ``I don't want anybody to go out  
and shoot him. I'm just voicing the thoughts of my people.''

<HEADLINE> Fewer Mortgage Holders Fall Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans behind on mortgage  
payments declined to the lowest level in four years during the 
first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Plentiful jobs and low interest rates have been helping  
consumers keep up with payments on new and refinanced loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delinquency situation has benefited from a sustained  
refinancing boom and record levels of home sales during the past 
year,'' said Paul Reid, executive vice president of the Mortgage 
Bankers Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgage delinquencies fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.13  
percent in the January-March quarter, down from 4.26 percent during 
the fourth quarter of 1998, the association said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the lowest delinquency rate since the first quarter of  
1995. The rate was 4.42 percent during the January-March period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the percentage of loans in foreclosure at the end of  
the first quarter of this year increased slightly to 1.16 percent 
from 1.11 percent at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Delinquencies declined in three regions and increased in one  
during the first quarter. They fell to 4.93 percent from 5.13 
percent in the South, to 3.61 from 3.75 in the West, and to 3.97 
from 4.04 in the Northeast. The delinquency rate in the Midwest 
rose to 3.72 from 3.65.

	A streak of unusually low mortgage rates -- below 7 percent --  
that began last summer persisted into the early months of this 
year, helping to fuel a record home-buying boom and encouraging 
those already owning homes to refinance their mortgages at lower 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	However, mortgage rates have begun to edge up since last month  
because of financial market concerns about hints from Federal 
Reserve officials of a possible interest rate hike later this 
summer that would be intended to help cool the economy to prevent 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the average rate on 30-year mortgages hi at two-year  
high of 7.65 percent, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company.

<HEADLINE> GoTo.com Shares Pushed Up 70 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Investors shrugged off a two-month slide  
in Internet stocks and pushed shares of Internet search engine 
GoTo.com up 70 percent in its first day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	GoTo.com sold 6 million shares at $15 per share, raising $90  
million for the company that emerged last year from idealabs!, the 
Pasadena, Calif., incubator founded by Bill Gross. 
</P>
<P>
	After beginning trading shortly before noon EDT, shares of  
GoTo.com were up $10.50 to $25.50 on the Nasdaq stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really gratified investors are interested in holding our  
stock,'' GoTo.com chief executive officer Jeffrey Brewer said from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	GoTo.com's initial success comes as a decline in Internet stocks  
since mid-April suggests investors have begun to look askance at 
sky-high valuations and are deciding that some stocks aren't a good 
bet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have become more discriminating in their choice of  
IPOs,'' said Youssef Squali, an analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I think the Internet companies that can still make it are  
companies that are relatively dominant in their niche market or 
companies that have strong backing from well-known venture 
capitalists or have a very strong management team,'' Squali said. 
``I think GoTo.com falls in the second category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Internet companies, GoTo.com has yet to turn a profit.  
In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company 
said it has lost $21 million since it was founded in 1997 and will 
continue to lose money for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues have grown, however, jumping in the first quarter of  
1999 to $1.4 million from $38,000 a year earlier, and GoTo.com's 
base of users and paying clients has risen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC rules prohibit company officials from commenting in the  
period before an IPO is launched. 
</P>
<P>
	IPOs have provided big initial returns for other companies that  
have yet to make money. Just last month, Santa Monica, Calif.-based 
eToys Inc. raised $166 million with an offering in which the share 
price jumped from $20 to $85 as investors snapped up the company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then eToys has fallen more than 50 percent from its  
high, trading Thursday at $40 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-profile Internet stocks, including Amazon.com Inc.  
and Priceline.com Inc. have taken a beating in recent weeks. 
National Discount Brokers Group, an online stock brokerage, on 
Tuesday canceled its plans to sell 2.6 million new shares because 
of market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks did get a bounce this week, sending the Dow  
Jones Internet Index up 22 percent on Wednesday. The market was up 
slightly in trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the jump, the index was down 36 percent since  
peaking on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're finding now is the Internet is starting to  
mature,'' said Jack Staff, chief economist at Zona Research. ``We 
have long said that as soon as some of the Internet companies start 
to make their first profits, there will be a softening in the 
Internet sector as a whole because Internet stocks will go from 
being stocks of possibility to stocks of reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are indications GoTo.com's pay-for-play business model is  
working. In GoTo.com's system, clients bid a price they are willing 
to pay for a high ranking on results pages. The name of the highest 
bidder appears at the top of the page, with others ranked in 
descending order according to their bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A note attached to each link on GoTo.com's results page tells  
users how much a company paid to be there. For example, a search 
for ``books'' turned up Best Buy at the top of the list; it paid 57 
cents for the placement. (Amazon.com was second -- it paid 56 
cents). 
</P>
<P>
	This system contrasts with most other search engines, which make  
money from selling ads that appear on their Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Users don't seem to mind. Between Jan. 1 and April 30, searches  
via GoTo.com increased 85 percent to more than 1 million per month, 
and the clientele of paying advertisers grew 150 percent to more 
than 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	During April, GoTo.com attracted 7.2 percent of all Web surfers,  
placing it 10th among search engines, according to Media Metrix.

</P>
<P>
	Harley Manning, a research director for Forrester Research, said  
called GoTo.com's public offering ``an all right IPO'' but didn't 
raise as much cash as its predecessors because of growing caution 
about volatile Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are asking themselves questions about the company and  
not just jumping into the Internet,'' Manning said. ``The Internet 
doesn't need another search engine.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore Air Buying 10 Boeing 777s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore Airlines is exercising its option to  
buy 10 Boeing B777 passenger jets worth $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Friday is part of the national airline's 1997  
order for 77 Boeing aircraft, 34 of which were firm orders and 43 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 planes will be delivered between 2001 and 2004, the  
airline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Airlines has 14 of the 777s in operation, with 26 more  
on order and 21 on option. The remaining planes in the 1995 order 
are for the airline's associate company, Singapore Aircraft 
Leasing. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore Airlines operates 89 aircraft and expects to have a  
fleet of around 120 by the end of the 2004-2005 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> NASA Discloses Space Station Blunder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A blunder by flight controllers  
prevented the new international space station from moving out of 
the way of dangerous space junk. The rocket debris ended up passing 
at a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said the sequence of computer commands sent up by flight  
controllers to fire the station's engines over the weekend failed 
because of human error. It disclosed the incident Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the U.S. military organization that tracks objects in  
space predicted the rocket chunk would pass within two-thirds of a 
mile of the space station on Sunday. It ended up coming no closer 
than 4 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The debris was Russian in origin and fairly large, although its  
exact dimensions were not immediately known. A collision could have 
destroyed the empty outpost, which has been in orbit for only seven 
months. The first residents are not due to arrive until next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	At last count, the U.S. Space Command in Colorado Springs,  
Colo., was tracking more than 8,700 manmade objects in orbit, most 
of that junk. With an orbital speed of 17,500 mph, any one of them 
could do serious damage to the space station, which consists of 
only two compartments so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures already have been taken to prevent this from happening  
again, said Frank Culbertson, NASA deputy program manager for space 
station operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very glad we learned what we learned at this point in the  
mission before we have more hardware up there and before we have 
people up there,'' Culbertson said. But he noted that if astronauts 
had been aboard, they could have maneuvered the space station more 
easily than ground controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering command, drawn up by both U.S. and Russian  
engineers, was sent from the Russian control center outside Moscow 
on Saturday night. But the command contained faulty instructions, 
and the space station's computers rejected it. The station was left 
without motion control for an entire orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight controllers may not have factored in the changes in the  
space station's mass and center of gravity since shuttle Discovery 
delivered 2 tons of gear earlier this month, or else the changes 
were entered incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
	Culbertson said it wasn't immediately clear whether Americans or  
Russians were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time flight controllers learned of their mistake, it was  
too late to send up a corrected command. ``But because the 
probability was low, we weren't too worried about it,'' Culbertson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, the Space Command soon revised the projected  
distance between the two objects from 0.6 miles to 4 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second time in less than three months that NASA has  
reported an erroneous station command. In late April, Russian 
flight controllers mistakenly ordered a motor to turn on and move 
the space station's solar wings; onboard computers detected the 
error and shut off power to the motor.

<HEADLINE> Bar Accused of Hiring Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Many Irish immigrants looking for work at the  
start of the century encountered signs in the city that read: 
``Irish Need Not Apply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Times have changed, say three waitresses who accused Hilton  
Hotels Corp. in a discrimination complaint of squeezing them out of 
their jobs so Irish natives can work in the hotel's planned Irish 
pub. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to push us out. And why? Because we don't speak  
with an Irish accent,'' said Gloria DiMartino, 55. ``It's 
discrimination, pure and simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past 30 years, DiMartino, Dorothy Webb, 61, and Jo  
Murray, 71, have worked at the Logan Airport Ramada, calming 
anxious travelers and being happy to entertain tourists with their 
``Bahstahn'' accents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how many people have come up to me again and  
again to hear me say `chowdah,''' said Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, the women say managers made it clear in a staff  
meeting that first preference for jobs in the new pub -- to be 
called Kitty O'Shea's -- would be given to those with Irish accents. 
The hotel, managed by Hilton since 1996, plans to open the saloon 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The waitresses said the hotel is violating a collective  
bargaining contract that states employees with seniority have first 
preference for jobs in the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't care if they hire students from Ireland,'' Murray  
said. ``But we should have first preference for those jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women filed the complaint with the Massachusetts Commission  
Against Discrimination, and plan to stage protests if the hotel 
doesn't give them first choice of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by Hilton on Thursday said the Beverly Hills,  
Calif.-based hotel chain ``has acted and will continue to act 
consistent with its collective bargaining agreement ... and 
applicable law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Managers at another Kitty O'Shea's pub -- unrelated to the  
planned airport bar -- say they hire qualified people, regardless of 
their speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise McCool, a spokeswoman for the Irish Immigration Center in  
Boston, said Irish restaurants would better serve their patrons by 
teaching them about Irish history rather than focus on the staff's 
accents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the accent that makes a culture,'' McCool said. ``I  
wonder how many people know who Kitty O'Shea was because if they 
did they would know that she didn't stand for exclusion or 
discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kitty O'Shea was a married woman whose relationship with Irish  
nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell led to a scandal that 
ended Parnell's career and divided Irish public opinion. Parnell 
married O'Shea after her divorce.

<HEADLINE> Labonte Improved on Flat Tracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Bobby Labonte, once considered a potential  
Winston Cup star, has arrived as a legitimate championship 
contender because he and his team managed to solve a big problem. 
</P>
<P>
	They were not strong on flat tracks such as Pocono International  
Raceway, where Labonte qualified third Friday for Sunday's Pocono 
500. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went to work a while back and really concentrated our  
efforts on the flatter tracks, and tried to come up with a 
different direction to go in,'' crew chief Jimmy Makar said. ``It 
seems like the combination of finding some new things, new ways to 
get the cars set up and Bobby's driving style, we've hit on some 
things that are very suitable for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte has been strong for some time on tracks banked at more  
than 18 degrees, but was rarely among the front-runners on the 
flatter surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	A test last July at Indianapolis Motor Speedway changed that,  
and the lesson was applied a few days later in the Pennsylvania 
500, the second of the summer races at Pocono. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte qualified fourth and finished fourth in the Joe Gibbs  
Racing Pontiac, his first top-five in 12 starts on the 2 1/2-mile 
triangular oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's made it much more exciting to go back to Pocono now  
because Pocono was one of the first races where we felt like we 
turned that corner and started running more consistently on the 
flat tracks,'' Makar said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, success on the flat tracks has been the key to  
Labonte's move to third this year in the driver standings. He has 
finished in the top five in four of five flat-track races. 
</P>
<P>
	After a fifth-place finish last Sunday at flat Michigan  
Speedway, where the banking in the turns is 18 degrees, Labonte had 
six straight top-fives overall. Among them was his first victory of 
the season, two weekends ago at high-banked Dover Downs 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DRIVING POCONO:* Sterling Marlin, who won the pole Friday for  
the Pocono 500, enjoys driving at Pocono International Raceway even 
though he's winless in 27 career starts. But he had his doubts the 
first time he saw the uniquely shaped layout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this somebody's idea of a practical joke?'' he asked as a  
rookie in 1983. ``Triangles were something the kids in the band 
played, not a place you went racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot of fond memories from your rookie season, but  
here, well, all I remember of the first time I saw the place is 
thinking, `What in the heck is this?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pocono has two extremely long straightaways and one short one.  
Its turns are banked at 14 degrees, 8 degrees and 6 degrees. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Northwest Class Action Suit Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Passengers who were stranded on the runway at  
Detroit Metropolitan Airport during a January snowstorm can join 
forces against Northwest Airlines in a class action lawsuit, a 
judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,000 passengers who were trapped on airplanes Jan. 3 for  
up to eight hours, when Wayne County work crews pushed snow piles 
in front of gates, are eligible to join the class action lawsuit, 
Wayne County Circuit Judge Daphne Means Curtis ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it matters that on some flights toilets may have  
overflowed or some stock of food and beverage were low on different 
flights,'' she said. Even though ``there may be differences in 
terms of injuries or allegations of some class members in this 
case, there are common questions that predominate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits have been filed against the airline and Wayne  
County, but Curtis dropped the county from the suit, saying 
passengers were not a party to the county's contract with 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest attorneys argued that there were so many different  
situations among the passengers that the lawsuits didn't warrant 
class action status, saying that each passenger suffered different 
emotional injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge determined that 8,000 passengers would be eligible to  
join the class based on the number of apology letters and free 
flight coupons that Northwest sent to passengers after the storm. 
That includes passengers who waited on the runway longer than 2 1/2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident sparked a congressional hearing and a federal  
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Department of Transportation report released earlier this  
month found that Northwest did not violate any federal regulations 
during the storm that dumped nearly 2 feet of snow at the airport. 
But it said conditions were ``severe enough to have jeopardized 
passengers' well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest criticized the report for suggesting that the airline  
does not care about its customers, and said changes were made to 
prevent future tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Northwest apologized for the delays and announced  
changes in how it handles snow emergencies. Northwest will send 
employees to Detroit when bad weather is likely, and improve 
employee communications. The company said weather-related costs 
totaled about $20 million in the first three months of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Aide: Foreman Not in Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Tyson's advisor says as far as he's  
concerned, talk about a Mike Tyson-George Foreman fight is just 
that -- talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelly Finkel also said Friday that Tyson probably will fight in  
September or October, and that two fighters being considered as an 
opponent were Axel Schulz of Germany and Brian Nielsen of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a Foreman fight being in Tyson's future, Finkel said, ``I  
asked Foreman to call me, and he never did. As far as I'm 
concerned, it's not real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who has not fought since January, was released from a  
Maryland jail on May 24 after serving 3 1/2 months for assaulting two 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, the former heavyweight champion, trailing on  
all three cards, knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round Jan.

<HEADLINE> Slumping Bonds Dispels Self-Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The sense of relief at having finally come  
through in the clutch was more than enough to compensate for the 
pain in Barry Bonds' left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' single drove in the winning run in the bottom of the  
ninth Thursday night as the San Francisco Giants defeated the 
Chicago Cubs 3-2, dispelling -- at least temporarily -- the 
self-doubt that had enveloped the three-time NL MVP for days. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds has struggled offensively since returning last week from  
elbow surgery, several weeks ahead of schedule. The slump had Bonds 
openly questioning whether he had hurt the Giants by coming back 
too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going through emotional things like, `Am I hurting the  
ballclub? What am I doing out here?''' Bonds said. 
</P>
<P>
	That sense of doubt became more intense as his elbow stiffened  
on a chilly Thursday night. He struck out looking in the first with 
a man on first, struck out looking in the sixth with a man on first 
and struck out swinging in the seventh with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things get bad, and you end up with a serious injury, you  
try to come back and it always seems like you're in tough 
situations. You feel like you want to dig a hole and hide inside 
because it's always you at that time,'' Bonds said. ``I come up 
with the bases loaded and I say, `Why are you doing this to me?''' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the ninth, with runners on first and second and one out,  
Bonds rolled a ball through the left side of the infield to drive 
in the winning run. It was far from a massive blast for one of the 
game's most dangerous pull hitters, but it was a huge confidence 
boost nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just looking to make contact. I was having enough  
trouble just doing that,'' he said. ``Offensively, I just haven't 
been able to really put it together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Bonds' fourth hit in 25 at-bats since coming off the  
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, in that situation, at that time of the game, that  
could be the biggest hit of the year so far for us,'' teammate Rich 
Aurilia said. ``Barry hasn't been quite on the ball yet. Maybe this 
is the confidence thing he needs. Maybe he'll come back tomorrow 
and get three or four hits and be the player we all know he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his struggles at the plate, Bonds helped the Giants stay  
in the game. He helped create San Francisco's first run by walking 
in the fourth, tagging up and moving to second on a fly to deep 
center and then scoring on Aurilia's single. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth, he leaped over the left-field fence to rob Mark  
Grace of a solo homer. Grace shook his head in disbelief as he 
walked slowly off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a perfect example of the ways to help a team win a  
ballgame. He did a little bit of everything,'' Cubs manager Jim 
Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ninth, Bonds finally got to celebrate. But even that came  
at a price. After rounding first base and jumping in the air as he 
watched the winning run score, Bonds was given an enthusiastic 
high-five by teammate F.P. Santangelo that left the eight-time 
All-Star wincing in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, Bonds sat at his locker and was able to  
grin for the first time all night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to take. You're dealing with pain,'' he said. ``But  
you're only human, and eventually it will go away.''

<HEADLINE> Hanging Around Not Enough For NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A team that shoots as poorly as the New York  
Knicks has a small margin for errors. And a couple of small errors 
cost them big in Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second game in a row, the Knicks shot poorly against the  
San Antonio Spurs, making just 27 of 82 shots, less than one of 
every three, in what became an 80-67 victory that left New York 
down 0-2 in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, except for two mistakes in a 2.5-second sequence at the  
end of the third quarter, the beat-up Knicks might have fared 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're down men, the margin for error is smaller,''  
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Ours is smaller to begin 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York fell behind by 11 points in the third quarter but  
whittled the Spurs' lead to a manageable 52-49 in the final minute 
of the period. 
</P>
<P>
	A shot clock violation and three straight misses by Marcus  
Camby, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston prevented New York from 
moving even closer. 
</P>
<P>
	It was typical.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I don't think we played well offensively,'' Van  
Gundy said. ``In stretches, we missed point-blank shots at the 
basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then came the fatal errors.  
</P>
<P>
	With time running out in the quarter, Sprewell let Sean Elliott  
get by on the baseline for a layup. Elliott was fouled on his way 
to the basket, setting up a possible three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
	When Elliott missed the foul shot, Camby found himself blocked  
away from the rebound by Tim Duncan, who grabbed the ball and put 
it back for a basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby said his arm was locked up on the play and he was also  
talking to an official. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball got shot,'' Camby said. ``He was able to sneak in  
there, grab it and put it back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 2.5 seconds, the Spurs had four points. Suddenly, the  
manageable three-point deficit was a more daunting seven-point 
problem. It was not the kind of end to the quarter that the Knicks 
needed and it proved decisive. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was big,'' Sprewell said. ``A four-point play at that  
time of the game was huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We missed a crucial rebound to take it from five to seven at  
the end of the third quarter,'' Van Gundy said. ``Those are tough 
to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So on a night when the Knicks outrebounded the Spurs for the  
second straight game, one missed rebound proved vital. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, which shot 38 percent (31-for-81) in Game 1, came  
unglued in the fourth quarter and the Spurs restored the 
double-digit lead and pulled away for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy credited the Spurs' defense, constructed around  
7-footers Duncan and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lead the league in field goal defense and we're second,''  
Van Gundy said. ``They make each shot in the paint difficult. 
Nothing comes easy with those two guys.''

<HEADLINE> Casero Leads Spain Cycling Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORTOSA, Spain (AP) -- Mario Cipollini sprinted to capture the  
first stage of the Tour of Catalunya in this northeastern town 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall lead, Spaniard Angel Casero of the Vitalicio  
Seguros team, retained the No. 1 spot with a time of 4 hours, 34 
minutes, 25 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's Abraham Olano finished with the lead group and with the  
same time as the winner, allowing him to remain third in the 
overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered primarily a sprinter, Cipollini, of the Saeco team,  
only needed 4 hours, 24 minutes, 13 seconds to complete the 
100-mile trek from Vila Seca to Tortosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Andrea Tafi broke away in a solo attack in the final  
miles, only to be caught as the race neared Tortosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's second leg is a 108-mile stretch between Tortosa and  
Vilanova. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Pantani of Italy, banned from this year's Giro d'Italia  
for failing a blood test, said Friday that he also had unusually 
high levels of red blood cells in 1995, following a three-week stay 
in high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	His blood had been monitored in a Turin hospital four years ago  
after breaking his leg in a bad spill during the Milan-to-Turin 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a logical explanation for the 1995 levels. ... Before  
the incident and the tests, I stayed for more than 21 days at 2,800 
meters (8,500 feet) of altitude in Colombia, in occasion of the 
world road championships,'' the Italian cyclist told reporters 
during a ceremony at Rimini, Italy organized by one of his 
commercial sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani's team, Marcatone Uno, claimed following Pantani's ban  
before the start of the next-to-last stage of the Giro, that the 
high count of red blood cells -- at 52 percent against an allowed 
UIC maximum of 50 -- was due to altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The high count can signal the use of the banned EPO, but also  
can occur naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani reaffirmed he had not yet decided when he might return  
to cycling but confirmed he wouldn't defend his Tour de France 
title.

<HEADLINE> Man Sues Hospital for Negligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The brother of a woman who died in Western  
State Hospital has sued the state for $6 million, alleging gross 
negligence by the mental hospital's doctors, nurses and 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Western State records obtained by The Associated Press last year  
show nothing was done for 41-year-old Maura K. Patten between July 
3, 1997, when her sister phoned and told the hospital Ms. Patten 
feared she was dying, and July 7, when she was found dead in her 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed that Ms. Patten died of coronary  
insufficiency, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood 
because of arterial blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to diagnose and treat Ms. Patten in a timely manner  
showed ``such indifference to her health and safety as to 
constitute an utter disregard of caution, amounting to ... gross 
negligence,'' said the lawsuit filed Thursday in Arlington County 
Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Western State ``let her rot,'' said Ms. Patten's brother, Ted  
Patten of Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider Western State to be more like a gulag than a  
hospital,'' he said in an interview. ``I feel they violated her 
constitutional rights as a citizen to fair treatment, to honest 
treatment. I believe in a sense she was murdered by conspired 
neglect by the staff at Western State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is seeking $1 million in compensatory damages and $5 million  
in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the allegations in the lawsuit mirrored state findings  
under the U.S. Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals 
Act, which requires an investigation into a questionable death at a 
mental facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed Boatright, spokesman for the state mental health  
department, refused to comment on matters under litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 2, 1997, Ms. Patten, who had schizophrenia, called her  
brother and spoke to his friend, Margaret Owen, a registered nurse. 
Ms. Owen said Ms. Patten, who had nearly died from respiratory 
failure in 1994, told her ``she was wheezing and said that she was 
not allowed to carry her inhaler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Owen notified Margaret Keller, Ms. Patten's sister and  
authorized representative in family dealings with the hospital. She 
called the hospital the next morning. She says she was told Ms. 
Patten was in good condition and was just being paranoid and that 
no one would be available to examine Ms. Patten for several days.

<HEADLINE> Olazabal Out of US Open With Injury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal,  
angry after a poor opening round at the U.S. Open, was forced to 
withdraw today when he broke his right hand by punching a hotel 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who shot 75 on Thursday, arrived at the course with a  
splint on his hand. He took a few swings on the practice range but 
realized he wouldn't be able to play the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard left Pinehurst before his noon tee time with Tom  
Lehman and Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
	``I punched a wall in my hotel,'' said Olazabal, who broke his  
hand Thursday night. ``I was upset with myself. I wanted to do well 
this week. After the way I played yesterday, I did something I 
should not have. Now, I'm paying the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal ended any chance he had of becoming the first  
golfer since Jack Nicklaus in 1972 to win both the Masters and U.S. 
Open in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that takes him out of the Grand Slam,'' defending Open  
champion Lee Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players were more sympathetic when told of Olazabal's  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's understandable,'' Tiger Woods said. ``We do get angry  
out here. We do get frustrated and sometimes we take it home with 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal broke the fifth metacarpal on his right hand and will  
be out for three to four weeks. That casts doubt on his ability to 
play in the British Open at Carnoustie July 15-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, it is a clean fracture,'' Olazabal said.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Finds Niche in San Antonio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Jaren Jackson has always kept his luggage  
handy and his dreams big. 
</P>
<P>
	Through years of playing for CBA franchises and getting cut by  
NBA teams, Jackson believed he could make it in professional 
basketball. Now he's proving it with the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deep down, I've always felt that I can play in this league,''  
said Jackson, whose outside shooting was a key to the Spurs' 
victory in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson hit five 3-pointers and scored a total of 17 points in  
the Spurs' 89-77 defeat of the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is no stranger to the pressure of a championship series.  
He played in four of them in the Continental Basketball Association 
and twice helped his team win a title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had success in other leagues, and I remember those days.  
I was going through playoff series. It wasn't in the NBA, but that 
helped me as far as my outlook on the playoffs,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A journeyman willing to go wherever his love for basketball  
takes him, the San Antonio guard looks fondly upon the lessons he's 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had my travels. I've been to the little towns and the big  
cities. I've been all over,'' he said. ``I always tried to envision 
my time in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a trusted reserve for the Spurs, Jackson has found some  
career stability. He's provided San Antonio with solid shooting in 
the playoffs before the Game 1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On the road against the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western  
Conference semifinals, Jackson scored a career playoff high 22 
points in Game 3 and followed up with 20 points in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said Jackson's 17 points hurt New  
York more than Tim Duncan's 33 points Wednesday. It's expected that 
Duncan will have a big game. But Van Gundy doesn't want to let the 
Spurs' supporting players do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to find a way to keep the other guys out of the  
game. We did that with some of the guys. We didn't do a good enough 
job on Jaren Jackson,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson made half of his 10 3-point attempts. His biggest basket  
came with 8:10 left in the game after the Knicks closed to 74-68. 
</P>
<P>
	Closely guarded in the corner, with the shot clock running down,  
Jackson hit a 3-pointer as he nearly tumbled out of bounds. It 
stopped New York's last rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson joined the Spurs before the 1997-98 season after having  
played for seven other NBA teams. He played college basketball at 
Georgetown, graduating in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson wasn't drafted by an NBA team. New Jersey signed him as  
a free agent shortly after college and waived him a few months 
later. Then he played in the Continental Basketball Association 
with Wichita Falls in Texas and La Crosse in Wisconsin, winning a 
championship with each team. 
</P>
<P>
	He also played in Pittsburgh and Fort Wayne, Ind., in the CBA  
and for the Dayton Wings in Ohio in the WBL, a small summer league. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he established himself in the minor leagues, Jackson began  
to land contracts in the NBA. He played for Golden State, Portland, 
Philadelphia, Houston, Washington and the Los Angeles Clippers. He 
was signed by Chicago before the 1993-94 season, but was waived 
before the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and fellow Spurs guards Mario Elie and Avery Johnson  
often joke about their lengthy resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows the story about how A.J. was cut by the Spurs  
once, the Spurs twice. We try to joke about that moment when the 
coach is telling you you're gone,'' he said. ``If it happens, 
you've got to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said he's thrilled for Jackson that  
the situation in San Antonio has worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to respect the fact that he continued, that he never  
stopped trying to get it right,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	If basketball hadn't been an option, Jackson said, he never  
doubted he could make a living in the ``real world.'' He earned a 
degree in finance. His wife, Terri, also a Georgetown graduate, is 
a lawyer. An avid reader, Jackson said he enjoyed school and that 
he would like to eventually return for more education. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Spurs, Jackson became a starter last season and had the  
same role early this season before Popovich replaced him with Elie 
and decided Jackson would be more effective as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Spurs are anchored by big men Duncan and David  
Robinson, the squad needs outside shooters like Jackson more so 
than a smaller team might, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who becomes a free agent after this season, said he  
enjoys San Antonio and finally feels at home. Right now, he's 
concentrating on the NBA Finals. Whether he has a future with the 
Spurs isn't definite. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, his luggage is waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to count my chickens yet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cost Estimated For Olympic Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The state will pay $31 million on  
Olympic-related programs, a 10 percent increase over year-old 
estimates, a legislative panel was told Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	State Olympic officer John Fowler said the projections were  
bumped up $3 million to include fire, emergency medical and public 
works costs not included last year. He presented his annual report 
to the Olympic Coordination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Public safety costs come to $18 million, the largest share,  
Fowler said. The budget also contains a $7 million contingency 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs still are not expected to rival the $47.4 million  
that's estimated to flow into the state's general fund from tax 
collections related to Olympic stimulation of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's costs will depend on how much money the federal  
government comes up with, and the $31 million estimate assumes Salt 
Lake gets the same level of support as Atlanta did for the 1996 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is very important,'' Fowler said.  
</P>
<P>
	Craig Dearden, Utah's public safety director, said he expects  
the same level of support, based in part on the fact federal law 
enforcement agencies are involved in group planning of the safety 
aspect of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional displeasure with Salt Lake over the lavish  
spending on International Olympic Committee members during the bid 
may affect the federal funding, Dearden said, ``but we really don't 
foresee that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $18 million public-safety cost, $8 million is for  
overtime pay of officers, and the rest is for hotel rooms, food and 
uniforms. The safety of the public works systems -- clean water 
supplies and terrorist-free sewer pipes, for instance -- is expected 
to cost $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler noted the overtime figure covers all police officers,  
even those working for cities and counties, but does not include 
the University of Utah's costs, since those have not been 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his annual report, Fowler also tallied up the value  
of the infrastructure Utah has built for the 2002 Winter Games, 
including new hotels, the Delta Center, highways and ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	It came to a whopping $2.7 billion, which should answer some  
critics internationally who see Salt Lake ``as a taker, not a 
giver,'' Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	That refrain can be expected more in the coming months as the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee presses the IOC and U.S. Olympic 
Committee to give games organizers a bigger share of the 
sponsorship revenue and other concessions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the items included in the $2.7 billion is the $300 million  
cost of the Gateway Project planned for the west side of Salt 
Lake's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will make a very nice addition to the experience people  
have as they come to our community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> ABC, Union Reach Tentative Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television network ABC Inc. and a union  
representing behind-the-scenes network workers have reached a 
tentative contract agreement for five bargaining units that 
rejected a proposal earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The network and the National Association of Broadcast Employees  
and Technicians announced the tentative agreement Friday. It will 
be submitted to the 1,400 members of NABET units in New York, 
Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco that turned down 
ABC's December proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon ratification, the new contracts would become part of the  
master agreement between ABC and NABET, which represents 2,400 
camera operators, engineers, producers and other workers at the 
network. That agreement, which runs through March 31, 2003, would 
cover those five units as well as the seven units already under 
contract after ratifying the package in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the vote are expected by July 16, the network and  
union said. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected NABET members at the network have been working  
without a contract since March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The lengthy dispute turned rancorous last November when a  
one-day strike over health benefits led to a lockout of the workers 
by ABC. During the 11-week lockout, ABC used temporary workers 
while NABET members walked picket lines at network facilities.

<HEADLINE> Dudley Not the Ordinary NBA Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- With a Yale pedigree and a former diplomat  
for a grandfather, Chris Dudley is no typical NBA player. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks center probably has never heard this  
question, posed to Tim Duncan during the NBA Finals: ``Do you 
consider the paint your own territory, your own domain, an area 
where you feel you can do whatever you want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Dudley, the paint has always been the spot on the floor  
above which his often futile free throw attempts have soared. He 
has never averaged double-digit points in his 13 seasons in the 
league, held back by the uncontested 15-foot shot he has struggled 
mightily to master. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Dudley's dogged pursuit of competition and a championship  
ring has led him to the most difficult job in basketball these 
days. While Patrick Ewing sits on the bench in a suit with a torn 
Achilles' tendon, Dudley must stand in that paint, between Duncan 
and the basket, and hope for the best against the San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admire Chris Dudley for a lot of reasons,'' Knicks coach  
Jeff Van Gundy said Friday as his team prepared for Game 2 against 
the Spurs. ``The main one is his professionalism. He always is 
ready, plays hard, thinks team first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks need Dudley now, maybe even more than they needed  
Ewing to fight through his Achilles' injury until the tendon 
finally gave way in Game 2 against the Indiana Pacers. They need 
him on the floor, because at 6-foot-11 he is their best defensive 
weapon against the Spurs' twin towers, Duncan and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley hasn't made even half his free throws in a season since  
1995-96 with Portland. He is shooting -- the term used loosely -- 46 
percent in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he has a badly swollen, hyperextended, possibly bruised  
right elbow, further imperiling his quirky foul-line delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet he continues to do what he has done since Cleveland made  
him the 75th pick in 1987, the sixth Yale player picked in the NBA 
draft. He plays when he's needed, as well as he can, however banged 
up his body might be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I've just had to become accustomed to,'' Dudley  
said. ``It's been like that all year really, and the end of last 
year, too -- when Pat had some injuries. I've just had to be 
flexible, just tried to stay ready at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a degree in economics and political science, Dudley was  
ready for more than basketball when he left Yale. His parents, 
uncle and grandfather all went there. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his middle name, Guilford, from a grandfather who was an  
ambassador to Denmark under Presidents Nixon and Ford. Rather than 
pursue diplomacy, politics or macroeconomic theory, Dudley decided 
to make his living playing a game that involved depositing a round 
ball in a 10-foot-high basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were fired up,'' Dudley said of his family. ``It was just  
going to college, it was kind of the idea of don't put all your 
eggs in one basket. As long as I took care of the education, they 
were very supportive of basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old center chuckles when asked to recount jokes he's  
heard from teammates or opponents about his Yale education or 
ineptitude at the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best one?'' he asks, indicating that the jabs have been  
numerous. ``To be honest with you, I don't hear much about either 
one from my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from the looks of his 8-month-old son, Charles, there  
could be yet another Dudley roaming the paint in the NBA in about 
20 years. Dudley is often seen toting the enormous child around the 
court before or after games. Young Charles already tips the scales 
at nearly 30 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's great, he's here,'' Dudley said. ``He's a real bruiser.''  
</P>
<P>
	Just like dad.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 13.93; Nasdaq Up 19.29 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks managed a small gain Friday as investor  
optimism about interest rates overcame profit concerns about Intel 
and Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
was up 13.93 at 10,855.56. The Dow gained 365.05 this week, having 
risen each day, and more than wiped out a 309-point loss the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher Friday. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.94 to 1,342.84 and the Nasdaq composite index 
rose 19.29 to 2,563.44. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the Dow is up 18.2 percent, the S&AMP;P is up 9.2  
percent and the Nasdaq has gained 16.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest maker of chips for personal  
computers, fell 3 1/16 to 54 15/16 after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
&AMP; Co. cuts its rating on the stock because of delays in launching a 
new chip for laptop computers. But other computer and semiconductor 
shares held their ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``This seems to be a company-specific not industry-specific  
issue,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette fell after the razor and blade maker warned that  
second-quarter profits will miss analysts' forecasts for the rest 
of this year because of weak sales in Brazil, Russia and Japan. 
Gillette tumbled 5 1/8 to 42 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The dampened earnings outlook for the two big companies came a  
day after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that 
only a modest interest rate hike may be needed to keep inflation 
well-tamed. His comments had a generally soothing effect on the 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the news on Gillette and Intel, market watchers remain  
optimistic about second-quarter earnings, which will be released 
next month. ``We are going to see some pleasant surprises and that 
will be the norm, not the exception,'' Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan expects earnings to propel the Dow back over 11,000, which  
it last reached on May 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, there was still caution on Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are still not in the most friendliest interest rate  
environment and with bond yields still in the 6 percent area, the 
trading has become choppy,'' said Steven Goldman, market strategist 
at Weeden &AMP; Co. When bond yields are trading around 6 percent, 
government and corporate bonds become a more attractive investment 
alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher Friday by construction equipment maker  
Caterpillar, up 2 5/8 to 61 1/2 and computer maker Hewlett Packard, up 2 5/8 
at 61 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer software stocks got a boost from Adobe, which rose 8  
11/16 to 82 9/16, after the maker of graphics software used by 
magazines and newspapers topped earnings forecasts. Microsoft rose 
2 1/8 to 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 0.48 to 636.55, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite fell 0.12 to 768.57. The Russell 2000 
index, comprising small-company stocks, rose 1.67 to 445.05. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE composite volume totaled 1.07 billion shares, up from  
854.28 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.22 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.34 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
1.30 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.68 percent.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Opens N.H. Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Steve Forbes opened his New Hampshire  
campaign headquarters Friday, pledging to build a strong network of 
volunteers to help spread his ``positive, substantive message of 
political change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' grass-roots efforts represent a change from his 1996 run  
for the White House, when he relied almost exclusively on 
advertising. ``With the compressed caucus and primary calendar, an 
intense, experienced and enthusiastic ground operation is 
crucial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential hopeful released a list of 321  
volunteers he said are ready to rally support in 144 New Hampshire 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to take a positive, substantive message of  
political change,'' Forbes said. ``We're not going on glitz or 
glitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes is using advertising along with grass-roots politics.  
</P>
<P>
	He has launched a television, radio and newspaper advertising  
blitz that will cost him about $10 million before summer ends. 
Forbes hopes the earlier-than-usual advertising campaign will give 
his message the staying power it did not have in 1996, when he 
finished fourth in the New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he is pressing in person the themes he  
highlights in his commercials -- the need to do away with a 
too-complicated tax code and privatize Social Security, which the 
government has ``made a hash of financing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people want change. It's going to take an  
independent outsider who is not beholden to special interests,'' he 
said. Forbes is not taking federal matching funds, paying for his 
campaign with private contributions and his own money. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the United States must stop cutting defense  
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The message struck a chord with John Hanson, of Cincinnati, who  
attended the headquarters opening while visiting relatives in New 
Hampshire. He said he served in the Navy for six years in the 1980s 
and that the military today is not what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	He liked the rest of what Forbes had to say, too. ``I told Steve  
I hope my kids will never have to pay Social Security taxes,'' 
Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes spokesman K.B. Forbes said the campaign hopes to raise  
about $2.5 million by the June 30 reporting deadline. Forbes raised 
$1.1 million at an event in New York on Wednesday, and planned 
fund-raisers in Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and 
Washington, D.C., next week.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Buys TransMedia for $407M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Cisco Systems Inc. agreed to acquire  
privately held TransMedia Communications Inc. in an all-stock 
transaction valued at approximately $407 million. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose-based TransMedia develops technology that unites  
multiple voice communication networks, bridging the gap between 
traditional phone lines and high-performance Internet lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, also based in San Jose, said the acquisition complements  
its commitment to migrate from traditional circuit-based phone 
networks to packet-based systems that carry voice transmissions in 
bits of digital data, the company said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cisco originally focused on hardware for connecting  
computers over networks, it recently has put increased attention on 
voice traffic. In April, Cisco bought GeoTel Communications Corp., 
a software maker with technology to combine data, voice and video 
transmissions for delivery in a single system based on Internet 
standards, for about $2 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cisco-TransMedia deal already has been approved by the board  
of directors for each company, and they expect the transaction to 
close in the first quarter of Cisco's fiscal year 2000.

<HEADLINE> More Fatalities Cited for Black Moms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Black women are more than four times as likely to  
die of pregnancy-related complications than white women, federal 
researchers said in a report that outlines one of the sharpest 
racial contrasts in public health. 
</P>
<P>
	The mortality rate for black women was 19.6 deaths per 100,000  
births, while 5.3 whites died per 100,000 births, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC study found that a black woman's risk of dying is higher  
than whites for every specific cause of death and in every age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Data for other minority groups were not included.  
</P>
<P>
	The information expands on maternal-mortality data released in  
September, which predicted that the United States would not achieve 
its goal of 3.3 deaths per 100,000 births by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The national maternal mortality rate is 7.7 deaths per 100,000  
births -- or the death of one mother for every 12,987 giving birth, 
according to the study which analyzed deaths in each state from 
1987 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The study confirms that the goal of 3.3 deaths set by the  
federal Healthy People 2000 campaign will not be met. Only three 
states -- Massachusetts, Nebraska and Washington -- have met that 
figure and only for white women. 
</P>
<P>
	Pregnant blacks in New York had the highest mortality rate at  
28.7 deaths for every 100,000 who gave birth, the CDC said, while 
Massachusetts had the lowest at 8.7 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers identified 3,086 pregnant women who died in the  
study period, but said the number is likely underestimated. 
Pregnancy-related deaths within 42 days of giving birth were 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Thomas, director of the Institute for Minority  
Health Research at Emory University, said the study shows the 
continued profound health disparities between races. 
</P>
<P>
	``When these gaps persist at the same time that we are  
increasing the amount that medicine can do, we should be 
concerned,'' Thomas said.

<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Eric Akin got a bit of revenge against long-time  
nemesis Sammie Henson on Friday, beating the world champion 3-1 in 
the 119-pound finals on the first day of competition in the U.S. 
World Team Freestyle Wrestling Trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Akin will face 1999 national champ Lee Rosselli in a best-of-3  
match Saturday for the World Team title and the chance to represent 
the United States in this year's Pan American Games and World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Akin had had little success against Henson before Friday, losing  
two big matches in the past five years. Henson, wrestling for 
Clemson, beat Akin, who wrestled for Iowa, to win the 1994 NCAA 
title. Last year, it was Henson beating Akin in overtime in this 
tournament's championship match. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taken some pretty good titles from me,'' Akin said. ``I  
just beat the defending world champion. Tomorrow I'm going to beat 
the national champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosselli beat Akin for a spot on the U.S. Olympic team in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	In another match, Steve Marianetti beat Sean Bormet 2-1 in the  
167 1/2-pound division in a match that lasted 10 minutes, 50 seconds. 
Marianetti won with a takedown. Marianetti didn't have to wrestle 
in the mini-tournament last year, and went on to win this 
tournament 
</P>
<P>
	``There's pros and cons to both sides,'' Marianetti said. ``Last  
year I watched all day Friday and my stomach was churning the whole 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marianetti will face 1999 national champ Joe Williams on  
Saturday in the finals. This is Williams' first year on the 
international freestyle circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 286-pound division, defending team trial champ Kerry  
McCoy beat Tolly Thompson 7-1 to advance to the finals against 
Stephen Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Eric Guerrero beat Kerry Boumans 3-2 at 127 3/4 pounds; Billy  
Zadick beat John Fisher 7-4 at 138 3/4; Pat Santoro beat Chris Bono 
6-1 at 152; Charles Burton topped Derek Jones 4-1 at 187 1/4; and J.J. 
McGrew beat Joel Sharratt 4-0 at 213 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Aide: Foreman Not in Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Tyson's advisor says as far as he's  
concerned, talk about a Mike Tyson-George Foreman fight is just 
that -- talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelly Finkel also said Friday that Tyson probably will fight in  
September or October, and that two fighters being considered as an 
opponent were Axel Schulz of Germany and Brian Nielsen of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a Foreman fight being in Tyson's future, Finkel said, ``I  
asked Foreman to call me, and he never did. As far as I'm 
concerned, it's not real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who has not fought since January, was released from a  
Maryland jail on May 24 after serving 3 1/2 months for assaulting two 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, the former heavyweight champion, trailing on  
all three cards, knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round Jan.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Release Larry Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals on Friday released  
fullback Larry Centers, a two-time Pro Bowl selection and the only 
running back in NFL history to catch more than 100 passes in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Centers' release was intended to give the Cardinals more  
flexibility under the NFL salary cap. The Cardinals have yet to 
sign their first-round draft picks, receiver David Boston and 
offensive tackle L.J. Shelton, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Ferguson said the move was prompted by a  
need to commit to younger players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's NFL is forcing all teams to make difficult decisions,  
but none more difficult than this one for us,'' Ferguson said. 
``Larry Centers was a cornerstone of this franchise through some 
very rocky times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Centers, 31, a fifth-round draft pick from Stephen F. Austin in  
1990, caught 101 passes in 1995, the team record for any position, 
and also holds the franchise career mark with 535 catches. He 
rushed for 1,736 yards and 10 touchdowns in his career.

	NATO Will Apprehend War Criminals  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO troops in Kosovo will take an  
active role in bringing suspected war criminals to justice under an 
agreement worked out Friday by allied nations and the international 
tribunal for Yugoslavia. Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said KFOR's 
role in dealing with suspected war criminals will be ``considerably 
different'' to that of the NATO-led force in Bosnia which has been 
criticized for not detaining Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and 
others indicted for war crimes. Teams of forensic experts from 
Britain, the United States, Canada and France would be arriving in 
Kosovo within the next few days to help the tribunal uncover 
evidence of war crimes, Arbour said.

	U.S., Russia Sign Kosovo Peace Deal  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- More than 3,600 Russian troops will  
help NATO keep the peace in Kosovo, patrolling sectors commanded by 
French, German and American generals instead of operating 
independently as Moscow had wanted, U.S. and Russian leaders agreed 
Friday. Russia's role in postwar Kosovo is particularly sensitive 
because of its historical ties to the Serbs, who expelled ethnic 
Albanians from Kosovo by the hundreds of thousands. Moscow opposed 
NATO's 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, and it had 
insisted it be given a peacekeeping role on even footing with NATO.

	House Rejects Gun Control Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the House rejected gun control  
legislation, leaving the fate of the issue uncertain in Congress, 
the leaders of the two parties searched for political gains in the 
bill's ruins. ``Let there be no mistake,'' said Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., in a written statement. ``The vast majority of the 
Democrat caucus walked away when they had the chance to walk 
forward for the good of the country.'' Democratic Whip David Bonior 
of Michigan countered bluntly: ``the main obstacle here has been 
primarily the Republican leadership.'' The 280-147 rejection was 
led by Democrats objecting to weakened rules for gun shows and 
conservatives against mandatory handgun safety devices.

	Clinton Blocks Israeli Embassy Move  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton overruled Congress Friday  
and kept the U.S. Embassy in Israel from relocating to Jerusalem, 
the declared capital of the Jewish state. Under law, the shift was 
supposed to begin May 31 -- unless Clinton decided it would 
jeopardize U.S. national security. His decision was based on that 
judgment, and keeps the embassy in Tel Aviv for at least six 
months. In the letter to Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., a copy of 
which was obtained by The Associated Press, Clinton said he was 
prepared to discuss with members of Congress addressing the issue 
``in a way that protects our national security interests.''

<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed an Iraqi radar  
facility Friday after being fired upon by Iraqi forces in the 
northern no-fly zone, U.S. military officials said. Iraq said one 
person was injured and buildings were destroyed in the attack. U.S. 
and British warplanes have been enforcing a no-fly zone above the 
36th parallel in northern Iraq to protect Iraqi Kurds. A similar 
no-fly zone was also set up in southern Iraq to protect Shiite 
minorities. Baghdad says the zones violate international law and 
has challenged allied planes since December.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp. stock closed up nearly 12 percent  
Friday after a published report said the company could be the 
target of a merger with supermarket giant Safeway Corp. Kmart's 
stock closed at $17, up $1.81 1/4 in heavy trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Business Week magazine reported yesterday that 
Safeway was looking at Kmart in the wake of Wal-Mart Corp.'s recent 
purchase of British supermarket chain Asda Group PLC. Kmart 
chairman Floyd Hall said in October that the company would consider 
merging or aligning with a grocery business.

2-0 lead in the best of-7 series. The Spurs broke a tie with the 
1988 Los Angeles Lakers for the streak, and they did it without the

Duval, the No. 1 player in the world, made a 12-foot birdie putt on 
No. 17 that gave him an even-par 70 and left him tied with Stewart

<HEADLINE> Three Calif. Synagogues Set On Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Three of the area's five synagogues  
were hit almost simultaneously by arsonists Friday, and a leaflet 
blaming the ``International Jew World Order'' for the war in Kosovo 
was left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires caused moderate damage to two synagogues and gutted a  
third temple's library, destroying a collection of videos on Jewish 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators detained at least one youth and were seeking  
several others who fled from police near Congregation B'nai Israel, 
the most heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate is hate. You can't predict when it will happen,'' said  
Lou Anapolsky, president of B'nai Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is  
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	A flier blaming the ``International Jewsmedia'' for the war in  
Kosovo was found at the Knesset Israel Torah Center by KOVR-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are Slavs, we will never allow the International Jew World  
Order to take our Land,'' the flier read. ``We fight to keep Serbia 
free forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News of the fires stunned a clergyman at Sacramento's only  
Serbian church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our church and our people have nothing to do with this act of  
terror, this act of hate,'' said the Rev. Dobrivoje Milunovic of 
the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Assumption. ``Our prayers and 
thoughts are with the members of the Jewish congregations whose 
temples have been burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the FBI investigated a Serb-language letter faxed to  
Milunovic's church and several other U.S. Orthodox churches urging 
terrorist strikes on U.S. military installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Milunovic said he found Friday's events difficult to understand  
because Serbs and Jews have gotten along well for centuries. Many 
Jews found refuge in Serbia during the Holocaust, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first blaze was reported at 3:24 a.m. at B'nai Israel in  
downtown Sacramento. The second was called in at 3:48 a.m. at 
suburban Congregation Beth Shalom, and the third 10 minutes later 
at Knesset Israel, also in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the timing and distance between synagogues, one  
person could not have set all three fires, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	A burglar alarm went off at B'nai Israel at 3:19 a.m. Police  
responding to the alarm saw four youths in the area, who ran when 
they saw the patrol car. One was caught and was being questioned 
but was not under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The B'nai Israel library contained a Jewish heritage video  
collection, including Holocaust videos, children's videos and other 
footage relating to Jewish culture. The sanctuary had minor fire 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a peaceful place where you could sit comfortably and  
read,'' former congregation president Robert Harris said of the 
library. ``Now it's ashes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack is the second at B'nai Israel in six years. B'nai  
Israel was among the targets of firebombings aimed at minority 
groups in the Sacramento area in July 1993. A 17-year-old white 
separatist was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A national arson task force documented 670 attacks on houses of  
worship between January 1995 and September 1998. Of those, 33 were 
in California and only one was in Sacramento, a Baptist church. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty rare, generally speaking, for three synagogues to  
be hit all in a row like this,'' said Jonathan Bernstein of the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. ``It's obviously a sign 
that there was planning involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Reuven Taff of the 100-year-old Mosaic Law Congregation in  
Sacramento invited rabbis at the three targeted congregations to 
use his synagogue in the meantime. Mosaic Law officials also 
planned to discuss what security precautions they should take.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Civic Health Said Rebounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Crime rates are down. Confidence in government  
is up. Americans are getting more involved -- short of going to the 
polls. A new report says the nation's civic health is rebounding 
after a 10-year slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``That troubling decline has at least been arrested,'' said  
William Galston, executive director of the National Commission on 
Civic Renewal, which spent 18 months studying the state of 
citizenship in American life. ``Stay tuned, but I think this is an 
important beginning of a rejuvenation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the commission, chaired by William Bennett, a  
Republican and former education secretary, and former Sen. Sam 
Nunn, D-Ga., issued a report that decried Americans' disengagement 
from government and community work. ``In a time that cries out for 
civic action, we are in danger of becoming a nation of 
spectators,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	An update released by the commission on Thursday says civic  
activity is on an upswing. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's national index of civic health, a compilation  
of data on political participation, trust, family strength, group 
membership and personal security, fell by more than 20 percent 
during the decade ending in 1994. After that, the index began to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The index for 1997, the last year the commission has data to  
track all the trends, says more people trust the government, feel 
safer in their neighborhoods and participate in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The new index says the percentage of adults who trust the  
federal government rose to 38 percent in 1997, up from 29 percent 
in 1994. Americans' perception of how well the government is going 
its job often improves in times when crime rates are declining and 
the economy is robust, Galston says. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the index, the number of crimes reported per 1,000  
people fell from 51 in 1994 to 39 in 1997. The index shows that 
fewer people are afraid to walk near their home at night -- 38 
percent in 1997, down from 47 percent in 1994. Declining crime 
rates and community policing practices that move police officers 
from their squad cars to street corners may be responsible, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The index also reveals that more people are becoming politically  
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1994 and 1997, the percentage of adults who attended a  
rally or speech rose from 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The number 
who worked for a political party increased from 2.7 percent to 3.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the report says the percentage of adults who vote fell to  
43 percent, down from 47 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Levine, deputy director of the commission, says the  
question now is whether the index will continue to rise. Will 
citizens' trust in government, for instance, withstand President 
Clinton's impeachment? Will more people feel safe walking near 
their homes at night after the recent school shootings? He wonders.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Commission Report Summary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Facts, observations and conclusions from the report of the  
National Gambling Impact Study Commission: 
</P>
<P>
	--Far from monolithic, the ``gambling industry'' includes  
commercial casinos on land and rivers, tribal casinos, state-run 
lotteries, pari-mutuel wagering on dog and horse racing and 
jai-alai, sports betting, charitable gambling, Internet gambling 
and stand-alone electronic gambling devices such as video poker and 
keno. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gambling has grown tenfold since 1975. Today 37 states and the  
District of Columbia offer lotteries, 28 states have commercial 
and/or Indian casinos, and 43 states have pari-mutuel betting. 
</P>
<P>
	--Between 1976 and 1997, revenues from legal wagering grew nearly  
1,600 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gambling expenditures as a percentage of personal income more  
than doubled between 1974 and 1997, from 0.3 percent to 0.74 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1997, Americans spent more than $47 billion of their leisure  
activity money on gambling, compared to $81 billion on video, audio 
and computer equipment, $52 billion on publications and $6 billion 
on movie tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	--From 1988, when Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory  
Act, to 1997, gambling revenues to American Indian tribes increased 
from $212 million to $6.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sports betting, illegal in all states except Nevada and Oregon,  
is widespread. Many Americans are not aware it is illegal because 
they see Las Vegas point spreads in numerous publications. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lottery advertising often is misleading and exploits themes  
that conflict with the state's role as protector of the public 
good. For example, many advertisements emphasize luck over hard 
work, instant gratification over prudent investment, and 
entertainment over savings. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is a dearth of impartial, objective research on the  
impact of legal gambling. Gambling questions can be added to 
existing federal research on substance abuse and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Internet represents a new frontier in the spread of  
gambling, with the number of on-line bettors growing each year. One 
estimate predicts that Internet gambling will exceed $2 billion by 
2001.

<HEADLINE> Mets, Mariners Swap Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets dealt left-hander Allen Watson  
and cash to the Seattle Mariners today for right-hander Mac Suzuki 
and a player to be announced later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets general manager Steve Phillips said the trade would give  
the team more flexibility. He said the recent addition of Pat 
Mahomes, who can work in middle relief and be used as a spot 
starter, plus the return of reliever Greg McMichael from the 
disabled list made Watson expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki, who was designated for assignment last week by the  
Mariners, had a 0-2 record with a 9.43 ERA in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson was 2-2 with a 4.08 ERA in 14 games with the Mets.  
</P>
<P>
	Both pitchers had started four games.  
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the Mets had been impressed with Suzuki's  
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had him touching 94 miles an hour with his fastball,''  
Phillips said. ``It's nice to have that kind of an arm in our 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's struggled, but we're hoping to get him on track.''

	House Rejects Gun Control Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has overwhemingly rejected a gun  
control bill that would have lessened some current restrictions 
while imposing others. The vote against was 280-147. The vote 
leaves the fate of gun control legislation uncertain. The Senate 
last month approved stronger restrictions, and compromise talks 
with the House are likely to begin this summer. Most of the no 
votes were supplied by Democrats, who objected to a National Rifle 
Association-backed provision that would have weakened existing 
restrictions on the sale of weapons at gun shows. But some 
conservatives also objected, on grounds that the bill would also 
have required safety devices to be sold with all handguns.

Russian defense chiefs are ``into a period of closure.'' Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said he was hopeful a deal could be 
completed. Russian Defense Minister Marshall Igor Sergeyev raised 
the possibility that the issue might have to be resolved by 
President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who will 
meet Sunday at an economic summit in Cologne, Germany.

	Arson Caused Calif. Synagogue Fires  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Three synagogues were hit by  
coordinated arson attacks today, and hate literature blaming the 
``International Jewsmedia'' for the war in Kosovo was found at one 
of the buildings. The fires caused moderate damage to two 
synagogues and gutted a third temple's library, destroying a

<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A hostage standoff at the state's largest  
mental institution ended today with a fired employee killing one 
hostage and critically wounding the other after police broke a 
window to get a better look at him. Dennis Czajkowski, a former 
Norristown State Hospital nurse who had held the hostages -- both 
nursing supervisors -- since Wednesday, shot and killed Carol 
Kepner, police said. Czajkowski wounded the second hostage, 
37-year-old Maria Jordan, who was flown to the Hospital of the 
University of Pennsylvania, where she was in critical condition. 
Czajkowski himself was taken away by medical helicopter, in 
critical condition with unspecified injuries, but not gunshot 
wounds.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Gun Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just two months after the bloody shooting  
spree at Columbine High School, the House killed a gun control bill 
today that would have lessened some current restrictions while 
imposing others. The vote against was 280-147. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan rejection came at the end of a tumultuous  
three-day debate as lawmakers struggled to respond to school 
shootings in Colorado and Georgia. Leaders of both parties 
immediately blamed each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week, instead of listening to the American people and  
strengthening our gun laws, the House of Representatives listened 
to the gun lobby and did nothing at all. The House leadership 
gutted this bill in the dark of night to keep common-sense gun 
legislation from seeing the light of day,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people will not stand for this. Our nation is  
waiting for Washington to pass a real law that keeps guns away from 
children and out of the hands of criminals. I call on the Congress 
to stop playing politics and start living up to its responsibility 
to help save lives,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let there be no mistake,'' countered House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill. ``The vast majority of the Democrat caucus walked 
away when they had the chance to walk forward for the good of the 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote leaves the fate of gun control legislation uncertain.  
The Senate last month approved stronger restrictions, and 
compromise talks with the House are likely to begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the no votes were supplied by Democrats, who objected to  
a National Rifle Association-backed provision that would have 
weakened existing restrictions on the sale of weapons at gun shows. 
But despite a last-minute letter from the NRA urging lawmakers to 
vote yes, some conservatives also objected, on grounds that the 
bill would also have required safety devices to be sold with all 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leadership met a few hours before the vote, and Hastert  
said he wanted an all-out effort to pass the bill. GOP officials, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said he expressed concern that 
unless the bill passed, Democrats would pepper appropriations bills 
with gun-related amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about 90 minutes before the roll call whether he would  
have the votes to prevail, the GOP whip, Rep. Tom DeLay, said, 
``Maybe. Not right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came several hours after a midnight vote in  
which the NRA prevailed on an amendment to loosen restrictions on 
sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton conceded momentary defeat.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked today if the NRA beat him, Clinton snapped: ``They did.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 218-211 vote, he added, ``was a great victory for the NRA  
but it was a great defeat for the safety of our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno concurred, saying the vote is ``a  
very big step backwards.'' and ``incomprehensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure said it would help restore the rights  
of law-abiding citizens, but Clinton accused them of squeaking the 
legislation through ``in the dead of night'' when the average 
American might not notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``So one more time, the Congress of the United States ... said,  
'We don't care what's necessary to protect our children. We can't 
possibly bear to make anyone in the NRA mad,''' Clinton said 
bitterly in a morning-after exchange with reporters in Cologne, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The House vote took place Thursday at midnight on an amendment  
sponsored by the chamber's most senior Democrat, Rep. John Dingell 
of Michigan, to the gun control bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The House began its daylight proceedings today by approving,  
311-115, an amendment by Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., requiring safety 
locks to be sold with all handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from conforming to the Senate-passed gun restrictions,  
Dingell's provision would cover even fewer gun shows than current 
law. In addition, the amendment would give the government only 24 
hours to complete background checks, rather than the three days 
that is now the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The House rejected a Senate provision requiring background  
checks at gun shows, regardless of their size or the number of guns 
sold. The proposal by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., lost 235-193. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who is attending a world economic conference in  
Cologne, Germany, said, ``Instead of closing the deadly gun-show 
loophole, the House of Representatives voted in the dead of night 
to let criminals keep buying guns at gun shows. This vote will not 
stand the light of day. I will keep working until Congress stands 
up to the gun lobby and makes the commonsense measures passed by 
the Senate the law of the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a separate juvenile justice bill, the House voted to  
permit the Ten Commandments to be posted in schools and state 
public facilities, a provision that supporters said would help 
promote morality. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he applauds the intent behind that amendment, but  
believes the measure invites a court challenge. He said he would 
speak to lawmakers about ``another option'' he didn't specify that 
would avoid imposing one religion on students. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes marked the House's opening shots at juvenile violence  
in the politically volatile period between a spate of school 
shootings and an election year. The task is particularly weighty 
for House Republicans, who are defending their narrowest majority -- 
six seats -- since the GOP's historic takeover of Congress in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats chanted ``six seats, six seats!'' as the vote on  
Dingell's amendment was tallied. But the chief GOP vote wrangler, 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, wasn't listening. After days 
lobbying his colleagues, his eyes stayed locked on the vote board, 
which lists the names of lawmakers and the votes as they cast them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell had promised 38 Democrats would support his amendment.  
But when DeLay realized seven additional Democrats were voting yes, 
the Texan slapped his hands together once, turned toward the back 
of the chamber and pumped his fist back and forth in victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats refused to give up.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are whipped, but we're not down,'' Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,  
D-Texas, said on her way back to the Capitol this morning, just a 
few hours after the House recessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the House today approved several measures that bring its  
juvenile justice bill closer to the Senate's. 
</P>
<P>
	Members approved amendments banning the import of large-capacity  
clips and magazines; permitting retired and former law enforcement 
officers to carry concealed weapons; prohibiting those under 18 
from possessing semiautomatic assault weapons; requiring background 
checks on those who try to reclaim their pawned guns after a year; 
allowing District of Columbia citizens with no criminal history to 
possess loaded handguns in their homes; and imposing a lifetime 
ownership ban on those who committed ``violent acts of juvenile 
delinquency.''

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Ease Gun Show Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a victory for the National Rifle  
Association, the Republican-controlled House voted Thursday night 
to loosen restrictions on sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 218-211, and came as lawmakers worked past midnight  
to craft legislation in response to a recent spate of high school 
shootings in Colorado and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, attending a summit of industrial nations in  
Cologne, Germany, complained that the House ``voted in the dead of 
night to let criminals keep buying guns at gun shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This vote will not stand the light of day,'' Clinton said in a  
statement issued here by the White House. ``I will keep working 
until Congress stands up to the gun lobby and makes the 
common-sense measures passed by the Senate the law of the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the House voted to permit the Ten Commandments to be  
posted in schools and other state and local facilities, a provision 
that supporters said would help promote morality across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun proposal, said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., would allow for  
``meaningful and reasonable background checks'' for purchasers at 
gun shows, without necessary and time-consuming delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was shot to death  
on a commuter railroad six years ago, fought back tears as she 
argued the case for tougher, Senate-passed gun controls. ``This is 
not a game to me,'' she said well past midnight in chamber suddenly 
grown silent. ``This is not a game to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voting in favor of the NRA-backed proposal were 173 Republicans  
and 45 Democrats. Opposed were 163 Democrats, 47 Republicans and 
one independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law requires federally licensed dealers to conduct  
background checks on customers at gun shows, but does not cover 
sales by private dealers at the same events. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision advanced by Democratic Rep. John Dingell of  
Michigan and backed by the NRA would cover fewer gun shows than 
current law, and give the government only 24 hours to complete the 
checks, rather than the three business days that is now the case. 
It also would extend the shortened checks to private sales. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative, backed by the White House, would have retained  
the provisions approved by the Senate last month but was rejected, 
235-193. They include mandatory background checks for all purchases 
at gun shows, closing what supporters said was a loophole left in 
the 1993 Brady Bill. Further vote on the bill were planned for 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The political overtones of the debate were inescapable, and a  
few Democrats said the risk of losing their seat in Congress was 
worth the vote. One, Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., noted he had lost 
re-election in 1994 after voting to ban assault weapons, but said 
he was voting against the NRA this time, too. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, public opinion polls indicate support for  
tougher gun control measures in the wake of the Colorado high 
school shootings, and chants of ``six seats, six seats'' floated up 
from the Democratic side of the House chamber as the vote was 
tallied. A switch of six seats would deliver control of the House 
to the Democrats in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun control debate unfolded immediately after the House  
cleared a companion measure permitting the Ten Commandments to be 
posted in schools and in other state and local facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 287-139 on the legislation, which also includes a  
variety of get-tough provisions related to juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the provision relating to the Biblical commandments  
was unconstitutional, but its sponsor, Rep. Robert Aderholt, 
R-Ala., countered that it would ``promote morality and work toward 
an end of children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a second victory for the entertainment industry in  
as many days, the House rejected a proposal to require labeling of 
violent content in entertainment products such as video games. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions in the bill would toughen penalties for  
juvenile offenders, make it easier to try some juveniles as adults 
and require federal prosecutors to devote increased time and money 
to pursuing gun-related crimes. The legislation envisions the 
federal government spending $1.5 billion over the next three years 
in grants to states to help combat juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure explicitly permits religious symbols to  
be included in the design of a memorial on any public school campus 
to commemorate anyone slain there. That provision was offered by 
Rep. Thomas Tancredo, a Colorado Republican who represents the area 
where this spring's shootings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage led immediately to debate of the gun control measure,  
the focus of a pitched political battle between the forces of the 
White House and gun control on one side and the National Rifle 
Association on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost more kids yesterday because of school violence than we  
lost in Kosovo and Bosnia put together the last three years,'' said 
Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, citing statistics that 
show 13 children die each day because of youth violence. Earlier, 
Gephardt paid grudging respect to the work of the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in admiration of what they're able to do,'' he said at a  
news conference, referring to an organization that has poured an 
estimated $14 million into political campaigns in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got members (of Congress) who are looking at a big  
independent expenditure that can be run against them, at votes that 
can be implemented against them'' if they defy the organization's 
wishes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the NRA issued a letter to members of the House  
detailing its position on a variety of proposed amendments. It said 
it ``very strongly supports'' a provision advanced by Rep. John 
Dingell, D-Mich., which it said ``does not include any gun control 
provisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell's proposal would curtail existing requirements for sales  
at gun shows, partly by redefining a gun show, and partly by giving 
the government only 24 hours to complete a background check, rather 
than the current three business days. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, votes were expected on proposals to require that a  
safety device be sold with all handguns, to raise the minimum age 
for purchase of a handgun from 18 to 21 and to ban the importation 
of high capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and aides in both parties agreed the outcome was  
virtually impossible to predict, and that in the end, it was 
possible that nothing would command a majority on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	As an indication of the uncertainty, Dingell told reporters that  
even if his NRA-backed gun show proposal passed, he would probably 
oppose final passage of the measure if it contained any other gun 
control provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if those additional provisions fail in the House, he said  
``I might'' vote against the bill on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the Ten Commandments was largely along party lines,  
with 203 Republicans and 45 Democrats in favor and 164 Democrats, 
one independent and 15 Republicans against. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt said the commandments ``represent the very cornerstone  
of Western civilization and the basis of our legal system here in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., countered that the proposal sought  
``to elevate one particular religion over all others,'' an effort 
that he said was ``blatantly unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky state law that required  
posting the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom, 
ruling that the postings would violate the constitutionally 
required separation of government and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt's amendment gives states permission to decide whether  
the commandments can be displayed in public facilities. It comes 
several years after a celebrated case in Alabama in which a local 
judge tried to hang the commandments in his courtroom but was 
ordered to remove them.

<HEADLINE>  East Timor Rivals Sign Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- East Timor's rival factions signed an  
agreement today that is aimed at stopping violence ahead of a 
planned Aug. 8 referendum on the troubled territory's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Although short on details, the agreement calls for a cease-fire  
and disarmament. It was reached during three days of talks that 
also included U.N. officials and the Indonesian Human Rights 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how effective the agreement would be. A similar  
peace deal, signed in April, did not address disarmament, 
considered one of the thorniest issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between rival groups in the former Portuguese colony,  
which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, has increased with the 
approach of the U.N.-sponsored referendum that will let East 
Timorese choose between independence and autonomy within Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint communique was signed by East Timorese rebel leader  
Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence 
under house arrest in Jakarta; Leandro Isaac, leader of a 
pro-independence umbrella group; Joao Tavares, head of an 
anti-independence militia; and Domingos Soares, a local government 
leader who opposes independence. 
</P>
<P>
	It calls for stopping any activity that could lead to  
disturbances ahead of the ballot, including ``every form of hatred, 
intimidation, violence, terrorism and acts of disinformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached on the same day that Ian Martin, head  
of the U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) claimed that 
Indonesian soldiers were seen helping militiamen attack 
pro-independence rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst quoted Martin as saying that a  
UNAMET team witnessed militias that were ``accompanied and 
directed'' by the Indonesian military. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from Dili, East Timor's capital, Wimhurst said the  
militiamen and soldiers were seen burning houses and assaulting an 
old man Tuesday in Leotela, a village in Liquica district. 
</P>
<P>
	The militiamen reportedly were armed with daggers and machetes  
as they looted and burned homes in an efforts to chase people out 
of the village about 25 miles west of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Local military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman denied any  
involvement by Indonesian soldiers in the incident that coincided 
with the release of a policeman and two civilians abducted last 
week by pro-independence activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin claimed the militiamen also have ambushed teams from the  
United Nations, Red Cross and local officials involved in 
negotiations for the release. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no active Indonesian soldiers, but retired ones who  
joined PAM-Swakarsa,'' a local civilian defense force, Suratman 
said. ``They did not ambush the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He neither confirmed nor denied the looting and arson.

</P>
<P>
	``We have observed over the last year a distinction between  
statements of the industry and the actions of the industry,'' said 
Modisett, who chairs the Subcommittee on Sweepstakes and Prize 
Promotion for NAAG. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proof will be in the pudding. If they do not follow, we  
would recommend that these be adopted nationally. It would take 
federal legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group wants sweepstakes companies to put warning labels into  
their contest envelopes that read: ``You have not yet won. Enter 
for free. Enter as often as you like. Buying won't help you win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that sweepstakes marketers should not imply that a  
person is a winner, or stands a better chance than anyone else, 
unless that is in fact the case,'' Modisett said. ``We want the 
industry to take responsibility for not taking advantage of 
vulnerable consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group wants the industry to:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Stop implying that a person won or is in a unique position to  
win or that ordering a product increases the odds of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Create a simple and uniform way to enter the contests.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Stop multiple deadlines for a single sweepstakes contest.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Make getting off sweepstakes mailing lists easier.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Stop including checks that often look like they've been issued  
or endorsed by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading sweepstakes companies insist they already use many of  
the consumer advisories being outlined by NAAG. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support clear disclaimers. We've already done it for a  
year,'' said Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for American Family 
Publishers, the company that uses Ed McMahon and Dick Clark in its 
mailings. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Irving, director of consumer affairs for Publishers  
Clearing House, said his company wasn't sure if another piece of 
paper would be the best way because it could become lost with the 
other inserts. 
</P>
<P>
	``A stand-alone slip may not do that,'' he said. ``That  
information might better be communicated on the entry order form, 
which the consumers may be more apt to read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana, South Carolina, West Virginia and Florida agreed to a  
$4 million settlement with AFP last month. It included a pledge to 
stop the mailings that duped hundreds of people into thinking they 
were winners. Iowa and Connecticut are still in negotiations with 
the company and could sign on later.

<HEADLINE> Sion, Turin Named 2006 Finalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Swiss town of Sion and the Italian  
city of Turin were selected Saturday as the two finalists for the 
2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Four cities were eliminated from the all-European race:  
Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and 
Zakopane, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion and Turin, who had been considered the two main contenders,  
were chosen by a special 16-member panel of the International 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner was to be elected later Saturday by a secret ballot  
of the 89-member general assembly -- the first selection of an 
Olympic host city since the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the selection of Sion  
and Turin as finalists was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Viuwner, a Sion bid official, said: ``We feel much better  
this morning. We hope to become the final winner, but you never 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turin bid leader Evelina Cristillin said, ``We're very happy. We  
expected such a result. We are confident, but it's already a 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race came down to a contest between two sharply different  
candidates -- Sion, a provincial capital of 26,000 in the heart of 
the Swiss Alps, and Turin, the northern Italian industrial city of 
2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion was bidding for the third time, following failed attempts  
for the 1972 and 2002 Games. Switzerland hasn't staged the Winter 
Games since 1948 in St. Moritz. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first bid from Turin, seeking to bring the Winter  
Olympics back to Italy for the first time since 1956 (Cortina 
D'Ampezzo). 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the IOC voted on a Winter Olympic site, in 1995,  
Salt Lake City won the 2002 games in a landslide. As it turned out, 
the victory was aided by more than $1 million in inducements to IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, which broke six months ago, plunged the IOC into  
the biggest crisis of its 105-year history. Ten members have 
resigned or been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the scandal, IOC members were banned from  
visiting the 2006 bid cities, and the voting process was changed to 
allow a ``selection college'' to narrow the field to two. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials said the new rules were designed to make the  
system ``fireproof'' against any form of corruption or improper 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sion had been the front-runner from the start, delegates  
said Turin made a strong impression in Friday's presentation to the 
IOC assembly and could have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	In the head-to-head final between Sion and Turin, the Swiss  
feared the vote could be swung by the strong Italian lobby in the 
IOC and possible bloc support from other Latin countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on member visits has been seen as an advantage for Sion,  
which played host to more than 60 IOC members during the 2002 bid. 
The Swiss said they had a vastly improved bid this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion was worried about possible resentment by some IOC members  
over the role of Switzerland's Marc Hodler in blowing the whistle 
on Olympic corruption in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``selection college'' that chose the two finalists was  
composed of eight members elected by the IOC, including former 
Olympic champions Jean-Claude Killy of France and Valery Borzov of 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	The international federations appointed Joseph Fendt of luge,  
while Spain's Feliciano Mayoral represented the national Olympic 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Three athletes' representatives were named to the panel: Prince  
Albert of Monaco, who competed in bobsled and is now an IOC member; 
Tomas Gustafson of Sweden, a speedskater; and cross-country skier 
Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, former FIFA president Joao  
Havelange of Brazil and Japanese IOC member Chiharu Igaya filled 
out the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler did not speak during Sion's presentation Friday, which  
revolved around a film featuring a ``modern Heidi'' searching for 
five golden rings in the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We changed our tactic from the last time,'' Sion bid president  
Adolf Ogi said. ``We underlined not the technical side but the 
emotional side of our bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turin made a businesslike presentation, emphasizing it is the  
largest city in the arc of the Alps. Bid leaders said Turin can 
provide all the amenities of a big city, while offering easy access 
to world class mountain venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki, whose bid includes Alpine ski events in Lillehammer,  
Norway, had hoped to get the Winter Games for Finland after five 
previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt proposed a ``games without borders'' concept that  
includes sites in Austria, Slovenia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Slovak and Polish bids were never given a chance, with  
delegates saying they need more time to develop their economies and 
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Burger King Plans Larger Kids Meals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Burger King is cooking up something new for  
older youngsters still hungry after eating its Kids Meals and 
unwilling to give up the toy. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-biggest hamburger chain said Friday it will  
add the Big Kids Meal to its menu nationwide June 28 with larger 
portions, a higher price tag and the same toys found in its regular 
children's meals. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hamburger or chicken meals will be priced at $2.79 to  
$2.99, which is 60 cents to 80 cents more than regular Kids Meals. 
The new meals are aimed at children aged seven to 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The new meals will contain two hamburger and cheeseburger  
patties compared to one in the regular meals and six pieces of 
chicken instead of four. 
</P>
<P>
	They will also contain a 16-ounce drinks, up from 12 ounces in  
regular meals. Both versions contain a small portion of french 
fries. 
</P>
<P>
	The menu addition could help Burger King compete for customers  
with the industry leader, McDonald's Corp., whose pioneering Happy 
Meal program has been a powerful attraction for parents and hungry 
children for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeated calls to McDonald's for comment were not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Paul, head of the Chicago-based restaurant consulting firm  
Technomic Inc., said he expects McDonald's will be watching closely 
and will match the program if it appears to be working. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Lynch, a spokesman for Wendy's, said that chain's  
children's meal program is already skewed toward older children and 
he did not expect any changes to result from Burger King's new 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Meal packages for children offered parents a convenient way to  
buy the mealtime basics at a price lower than if the items were 
purchased individually. A toy was included as an added attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	One important result of the bigger packages would be to boost  
the average amount people spend when they go to Burger King, an 
important objective in a very competitive industry, Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the program fits with Burger King's long-standing  
philosophy of letting customers ``have it your way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we have small and large. Why shouldn't there be  
small, medium and large,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's is the overall leader among the fast-food hamburger  
chains with nearly 43 percent of the U.S. market last year compared 
with 20.2 percent for Burger King and 11.5 percent for Wendy's. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Taylor, vice president of marketing for Burger King,  
said the Miami-based restaurant chain has been examining the idea 
of bigger meals for older children for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He said older youngsters told Burger King researchers they liked  
the toys that came with Kids Meals but complained the food didn't 
fill them up. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular children's meal program at Burger King, which  
continues, has been aimed at children as young as three or four, 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Kids Meal name alone should appeal to youngsters who  
often yearn to be treated like older kids, he said. ``They like to 
be recognized as a big kid,'' Taylor said. He hopes it will also 
inspire more customer loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The new meals will have distinctive packaging and the  
advertising will show youngsters hoisting a package as proof they 
are growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	The company tested the bigger meals for several months in San  
Diego, Albany, N.Y., and Greensboro, N.C. Taylor said customers 
seemed satisfied, came back more often and sales rose. He declined 
to be more specific.

<HEADLINE> Indian Tribe Builds Drug Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) -- An Indian tribe that has made a  
fortune from casino gambling has quietly built a profitable 
sideline business in mail-order prescription drugs, taking 
advantage of federal rules to undercut HMOs and pharmacy chains. 
</P>
<P>
	As gamblers feed quarters into the slot machines at the Foxwoods  
Resort Casino, a half-dozen pharmacists in white coats work nearby 
for the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, filling pill bottles 
bound for patients all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal regulations, Indian tribes recognized by the  
government can buy prescription drugs at a deep discount and resell 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Started 10 years ago as a small health service for members of  
the tribe and their employees, the Pequot Pharmaceutical Network 
today is a $15 million business, handling 250,000 prescriptions 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 million people are enrolled in the network, and its  
customers include General Dynamics, Connecticut College, AAA 
Connecticut Motor Club and about 40 other Indian tribes around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the state of Connecticut, looking to cut its pharmaceutical  
expenditures for 85,000 elderly and disabled Medicaid patients, is 
considering becoming a customer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we met with the Pequots, they described their purchasing  
power,'' said Michael Starkowski, deputy commissioner of the 
Department of Social Services. ``They described to us a pricing 
schedule that would be 40 to 50 percent less than what we would be 
paying otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pequots refused to disclose profit figures and insisted they  
are not looking to put independent pharmacies or national chains 
like Walgreen or Rite Aid out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet industry executives are jittery. Mark Grayson, a spokesman  
for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said 
his organization fears the government has given the Pequots an 
unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe that the federal supply schedule can be  
utilized in this way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelly Carter, spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Indian  
Affairs, said the Pequots' use of the discount is perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's why the Indians have the edge: Drug manufacturers, in an  
effort to capture market share, created different price schedules 
for different customers. Hospitals typically get a lower price than 
drug store chains. As the biggest consumer of pharmaceuticals in 
the world, the federal government gets the lowest price of all. 
Indian tribes are entitled to the same discount the government 
gets. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Indian tribes also obtain cheap prescription drugs for  
their reservation health centers. But the Pequots are the first to 
set up a health care business that extends beyond their 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pequots get the government discount only for prescription  
drugs that go to people on federal assistance, such as Medicaid. 
For all other patients, the Pequots pay the HMO rate for drugs, 
which is still cheaper than what drug store chains pay. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the Pequots are not allowed to charge the patients on  
federal assistance a markup on the drugs. They make a profit by 
imposing a handling fee of about $9 per prescription. The Pequots' 
other customers can be charged a markup. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of the Pequots' business is in mail-order  
prescriptions that are shipped directly from the reservation to 
patients, most of whom have chronic conditions, like diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe also has a pharmacy on the reservation that serves  
about 600 tribal members and about 13,000 employees. And it has 
alliances with 35,000 pharmacies across the country, enabling 
patients to go to drug stores to pick up some prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the tribe performs claims processing for large  
employers and has customer service representatives and pharmacists 
on call nearly 24 hours a day to answer questions and check patient 
histories for allergies or drug interactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're focused mainly on discrete populations that are  
homebound, the elderly poor, for example,'' said Matt Uustal, 
president of the network. ``We think we give them a competitive 
price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven J. Valiquette, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read in New  
York, said mail-order is one of the fastest-growing market 
segments. He said small pharmacies are more likely to suffer than 
large chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole prescription drug pie is growing 5 to 6 percent  
annually, and the independents are the ones who are losing,'' he 
said. ``Mail-order is just lower overhead overall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe's main source of revenue remains its casino. Though  
the tribe will not divulge profits, it reports its slot machine 
take to the state, which keeps 25 percent. With slot revenue 
topping $600 million in 1998, the state's share exceeded $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Although pharmaceuticals may seem like an odd side business, the  
tribe has a long history in health care, said Marjorie Colebut, a 
tribal member and former nurse who leads the network's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that many in the tribe are descendants of shamans, or  
medicine people, and that the tribe's current medicine woman, named 
Laughing Woman, holds a revered position on the Council of Elders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Health care is something that we normally do. It is a part of  
our culture,'' Ms. Colebut said. ``It just comes naturally for 
us.''

<HEADLINE> Sanders Gets Contract Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Deion Sanders is on the defensive after  
Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones suggested the star cornerback 
might not be healthy enough to play his best when he returns to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hurt severely in the last game I played in the playoffs  
and I still played my game,'' Sanders said at Cowboys headquarters 
on Thursday, the same day the team announced his contract 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys were wrapping up a three-day minicamp at their  
Valley Ranch practice site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't know if he's going to play at the level we'd  
like for him to,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``But when I 
look at what our alternatives are and when I look at what he can 
bring to the table for our team this year, it's worth the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came up as Jones -- reeling from salary-cap problems  
and Sanders' nagging toe injury -- agreed on the contract extension 
for the All-Pro cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I have to prove anything,'' Sanders told The  
Daily Oklahoman. ``It wasn't like I was on a downward spiral. I 
just have to go out there and keep doing what I've been doing ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones wouldn't say how much the extension is worth, but he  
conceded that the decision is a calculated risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones initially announced Thursday that it was a three-year  
deal. But Jones later said he misspoke about the time frame, 
according to Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tentative agreement has been reached, although the  
contract has not been signed and the length of the agreement will 
not be released,'' Jones later said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the deal is unquestionably complex, especially  
since the Cowboys find themselves about $1 million below the 
league's salary cap. The extension, which will provide the team 
some salary-cap relief, was expected to be signed today and 
includes incentive clauses to ensure that Sanders gets paid in full 
only if he performs up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The only specifics Jones offered are that the signing bonus will  
be paid up front. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension is expected to be surpass the highest contract for  
an NFL cornerback: a four-year, $22.8 million deal that Dale Carter 
signed recently with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, still sidelined from a turf toe injury he suffered on  
Nov. 15, attended workouts on Thursday, but did not practice. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent toe surgery April 28. The team trainer said last  
month that recovery was expected to take another 3-4 months, 
lasting at least into the preseason. Dallas starts the season Sept. 
12 at Washington.

<HEADLINE> Sterling Marlin Breaks Pole Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Although sitting on the pole is not unique  
to Sterling Marlin, a four-year drought made it seem like a new 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, it's a new car,'' Marlin said Friday after breaking the  
track qualifying record at Pocono International Raceway. ``It's a 
good race car. Now I hope I don't mess it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly didn't make a mistake during his time test for the  
Pocono 500, getting his first pole since July 1995 by taking his 
Chevrolet around the 2 1/2-mile triangular oval at 170.506 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a perfect lap,'' said Marlin, who needed it to edge  
Dale Jarrett, the Winston Cup points leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett got his Ford up to 169.952, and will start Sunday on the  
outside of the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it was comfortable, but it was fast,'' Jarrett  
said, giving most of the credit to crew chief Todd Parrott. ``We 
weren't that happy about what we had when we unloaded, but Todd and 
the guys gave me something I could really be aggressive with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin felt the same way, although he knew how good the car was  
from the moment practice began. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came off the truck fast,'' said Marlin, who claimed the  
10th pole of his career, but first in 123 races overall and in 28 
tries at Pocono. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who leads Jeff Burton by 66 points, is coming off a  
rout of the field last week in Brooklyn, Mich. He is using the same 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys just cleaned it up and got it ready to go again,'' he  
said. ``When you get a good car, you want to race it as much as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only Jarrett and Bobby Labonte, who is third in the driver  
standings, managed serious runs at Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to take it a little too easy through turn 3,'' Labonte  
said after a lap of 169.821 in a Pontiac. ``I don't think I carried 
enough steam through there, but we're awfully happy with what we 
did today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several others weren't, notably Jeff Gordon, a disappointing  
17th with a run of 168.757. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Jarrett by 349 points as he tries for a record-tying  
third straight series title, Gordon was hoping for better. But he 
was no threat to his 1996 track qualifying mark of 169.725. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got real, real loose out there,'' Gordon said after his  
worst qualifying effort this year. ``That was the slowest we've 
been all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so for Marlin, who practiced fast and just kept building on  
that as the day progressed. He said his day wasn't without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he nearly spun the car in practice, and realized that  
instability in the tight turns could be his undoing. So adjustments 
were made, and Marlin said team manager Tony Glover and the crew 
made the right call on the setup. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his call on the radio to Marlin that made the  
driver's day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming off turn 3 he said, `You've got the pole by a long  
shot,''' Marlin said. ``It felt good. We used up all the race track 
in that lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Labonte came the Ford of Bill Elliott, a four-time Pocono  
polesitter, at 169.757. Rick Mast was next in a Ford at 169.747. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Schrader, whose five poles are a Pocono record, qualified  
sixth. He was followed by brothers Ward and Jeff Burton, Wally 
Dallenbach and Mark Martin.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Steaming Going Into Game 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Dallas Stars know how to win. The  
Buffalo Sabres say they know how Dallas does it: by playing dirty. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're probably the dirtiest team we've every faced,'' Sabres  
captain Michael Peca said Friday afternoon. ``Part of their 
experience is they know how to hide all their two-hand swats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Peca spoke, Buffalo defenseman Rhett Warrener was undergoing  
surgery on a broken ankle that will sideline him the rest of the 
Stanley Cup finals. They could end Saturday night when Dallas takes 
a 3-2 lead into Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener was injured in a fight during Thursday night's game, a  
2-0 Dallas win that gave the Stars a 3-2 lead in the series.. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Shannon will replace Warrener alongside Jay McKee.  
</P>
<P>
	Warrener was wrestling with Derian Hatcher when he fell to the  
ice. ``I don't know what happened,'' Hatcher said. ``I know he 
tried to throw me down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher claimed the Sabres targeted the Stars in order to gain  
an advantage for Game 6, after Pat Verbeek's goal made it 2-0 with 
4:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say it was one-sided is a misunderstanding on Derian's  
part,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``On offense they go with 
their soft sticks and on the defense they swing by the bench and 
pick up their hatchets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You watch Pat Verbeek play, he turns his stick over every  
time, and it's a two-hand swing,'' Ruff said. ``Is that an intent 
to hurt one of our guys? It's darn close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Sabres' tougher and more reliable defensemen with a  
plus-12 rating in the playoffs, Warrener probably would not play 
again even if the Sabres were able to extend the series to a 
seventh game in Dallas on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said he sent Warrener out as an enforcer as the game grew  
increasingly violent toward the end. ``It was vicious out there,'' 
Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres insisted they did not send Warrener out to attack the  
6-foot-5, 225-pound Hatcher -- one of the toughest players in the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thinking was let's get somebody out there in case  
something happened, but let's be realistic,'' Ruff said. ``If we're 
going to go after somebody, are we going to go after Derian 
Hatcher? Come on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll go after (Guy) Carbonneau, we'll go after (Joe)  
Nieuwendyk, we'll go after (Mike) Modano,'' Ruff said. ``We'll go 
after somebody we can do some damage to. We're not going to send 
David after Goliath for crying out loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peca acknowledge he respects Hatcher, who was suspended for  
seven games for breaking the jaw of Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick on 
April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a guy that every team would love to have, a big strong  
defenseman that plays nasty in front of the net and in the 
corners,'' Peca said. ``He does a great job and it's just a matter 
of outplaying him and outworking him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon played for much of the regular season with McKee. He  
played in 71 games during the regular season, but appeared in only 
one playoff game this year. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the veteran's first appearance in a Stanley Cup final.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited a long time for this, but it's not the way I  
wanted it to happen,'' said Shannon, who turns 30 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon hasn't played since Game 1 of the first-round sweep of  
Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> Judge Delays Ruling in Capitol Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge put off a decision Friday on  
whether Russell Weston Jr., charged with killing two Capitol police 
officers last year, should be forced to take drugs that doctors say 
could make him mentally fit to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ordered officials at the  
Federal Corrections Center in Butner, N.C., to hold further 
proceedings before he makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston, 42, is charged with murdering Capitol Police officers  
John M. Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut in the Capitol on July 24, 
1998. Sullivan committed Weston to the Butner facility May 5 for 
treatment after determining he was incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan said Weston's lawyers were not given proper notice of a  
hearing held on the drug issue in May. The judge noted that Weston 
refused to cooperate with a staff representative appointed to help 
present his views, but added it was unclear whether the 
representative reviewed Weston's file or interviewed witnesses who 
might have evidence in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychiatrist Sally C. Johnson, an associate warden at the Butner  
facility, has said she believed Weston was a paranoid 
schizophrenic. But she did not rule out the possibility that Weston 
could stand trial after receiving treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have filed papers arguing that forcing Weston  
to take medication could violate his constitutional rights and 
could have harmful mental and physical effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Weston knew what he was doing when he shot  
the officers. Investigators believe Weston was planning an attack 
on the federal government for at least five days before the 
killings.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Five heavily armed men chased a  
15-year-old boy into a public school yard and shot him dead while a 
group of students looked on, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing took place late Thursday afternoon in Grajau, a  
low-income district in Sao Paulo. Police suspect that Fabio 
Monteiro da Silva was killed because of an unpaid drug debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing witnesses, police said da Silva climbed onto the school's  
roof to escape from the men. He then jumped into the yard just as 
his pursuers, shooting randomly, caught up with him and pumped 
several bullets into him. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 15 students have been murdered this year inside or near  
schools in Sao Paulo. Experts blame the rising violence on easily 
available weapons and the growing use of drugs.

office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A court in La Paz on the Baja California peninsula also ordered  
Manuel Rodriguez Lopez to pay $47,000 and forfeit seven boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez Lopez was an associate of Jose Castrillon Henao, a  
Colombian who allegedly headed Cali Cartel operations in Panama, 
the attorney general's office said. Castrillon is imprisoned in the 
United States.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- City council member Denise  
Ventrici Campos' slogan was, ``Our family works to serve your 
family better.'' But a court has now ruled that too much of her 
family was on the government payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The court on Thursday ordered the suspension of 53 workers at  
the city council in Diadema, a working-class suburb of Sao Paulo. 
Forty-one were relatives of city council members, whom the court 
claimed had misused public funds by hiring them. 
</P>
<P>
	Campos employed three brothers, her husband and her father,  
according to a published list of the suspended aides. Their average 
salary was $1,618, considered good pay in a country where the 
minimum wage is just $78. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest employer was Joao Pereira de Souza Filho of the  
People's Socialist Party, formerly the Brazilian Communist Party. 
His staff included his wife, mother, sister, son, cousin, nephew 
and brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Council spokesman Wilson Cardoso de Sa said each councilor was  
legally allowed to hire 10 aides and there was no legal obstacle to 
hiring relatives. He predicted the suspension would be thrown out.

enact the constitutional reform, had promised it during last year's

<HEADLINE> Rev. Lyons Ordered To Pay $5.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons, once the powerful  
leader of one of the nation's largest black church groups, was 
ordered to pay $5.2 million in restitution today to for bank fraud 
and tax-evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old minister, already serving 5 1/2 years in state  
prison for bilking companies and stealing from charities, also was 
sentenced to four years and three months. But the federal sentence 
will be served concurrently with the state sentence, U.S. District 
Judge Henry Lee Adams Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do ask for mercy today,'' Lyons told the judge before  
sentencing. ``I'm 57. I don't have a lot of time to right all the 
wrong I have done. Time is not on my side. I need to do at least 
100 good deeds for every bad deed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons pleaded guilty March 17 to five counts growing out of his  
business dealings as head of the Baptist group. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted failing to pay taxes on $1.3 million in income,  
defrauding a bank and making false statements to a financial 
institution and to federal housing officials. In return, federal 
prosecutors dropped 49 other charges, including extortion, 
conspiracy and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was sentenced in state court after he was convicted in  
February of racketeering and grand theft for bilking nearly $4 
million from corporations seeking business with the convention and 
stealing nearly $250,000 donated by the Anti-Defamation League of 
B'nai B'rith for burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons said he agonizes ``over my handling of ADL, the crime that  
has been committed there. That simply won't go away. It tugs at 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons began his state sentence April 1 at Lowell Correctional  
Institution about nine miles north of Ocala. 
</P>
<P>
	``I question myself day in and day out,'' Lyons told the judge.  
``How did I come to be here? What did I do? What took me off the 
path that I traveled for so many years? What happened to Henry 
Lyons? ... I brought this on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams waived a fine that could have ranged from $10,000 to $2  
million. The judge said he knew Lyons would be unable to pay since 
he already has forfeited his assets and properties and faced the 
hefty restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's reading the Bible and reading prayer every day ... trying  
to find peace for himself,'' Lyons' attorney, Jeff Brown, said 
earlier. Separation from his family has taken its toll, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' wife, Deborah, must apply for special authorization to  
visit her husband since she is on probation for a 1997 arson that 
sparked the probe into Lyons' finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple has not applied for the special visitation because  
Lyons does not want to ``draw any more attention to himself,'' 
Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Europe Bank Buys Euros for Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank said Friday it  
bought euros for Japanese yen on behalf of the Bank of Japan, the 
ECB's first confirmed intervention in currency markets since the 
launch of the single European currency six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials attending the Group of Seven leading  
industrial nations refused to comment on the reason for the 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	At bilateral talks with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,  
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he would like to see 
close cooperation on world markets regarding the yen and the euro, 
according to Japanese delegation officials briefing reporters 
afterward. There was no elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank action came amid concerns in Japan that the yen was  
getting too strong and fears in Europe that the euro was getting 
too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading, the euro was up a penny to $1.04, while the  
yen slipped slightly to 120.25 per dollar from 119.30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan intervened twice this month -- on June 10 and  
June 14 -- to slow the rise in the value of the yen, seeking to keep 
it around 120 to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo doesn't want the yen to strengthen significantly, fearing  
it would make Japanese exports more expensive in overseas markets 
and hurt efforts to restart its economy after more than a year of 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting between Obuchi and U.S. President Bill Clinton,  
Clinton welcomed the signs of Japanese economic growth and said he 
hoped it would continue, the Japanese officials said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, meanwhile, has declined more than 10 percent against  
the dollar since its launch on Jan. 1, raising fears about the 
viability of the common currency shared by 11 European Union 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	A European Central Bank spokesman confirmed that the  
Frankfurt-based bank, together with the 11 euro-zone central banks, 
``bought euros against yen on behalf of the Bank of Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman didn't specify the exchange rate or the volume of  
the transaction, nor did he say which of the banks in the ECB were 
involved in the intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	During the German-Japan talks, Obuchi asked Schroeder how the  
euro was doing, and Schroeder said he is confident that the euro is 
a strong currency and is winning acceptance among Europeans, 
according to the Japanese officials.

<HEADLINE> Irregular Incomes Suffer in Summer / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many workers welcome the summer months because  
they're typically more relaxed than the rest of the year, but those 
whose incomes are erratic may find themselves sweating them out. 
</P>
<P>
	Freelancers, consultants, small business owners, salespeople,  
project workers, or piecework factory workers, may see their 
salaries decline as some industries cool down operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless they've adequately planned for it, they could end up in  
financial hot water. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've run into that problem (with clients) ... and it's all in  
the budgeting,'' said David Duttenhofer, a financial planner with 
J.K.R. &AMP; Co. Inc., a Laguna Beach, Calif., brokerage and financial 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to getting through those quieter times, he and other  
financial advisers say, is to base your budget on income that 
reasonably can be counted on each month, like a base pay, minus 
commission or bonus. In other words, conduct a cash-flow analysis 
of what you take in and spend. 
</P>
<P>
	If that's not possible, income is too unpredictable, then create  
a monthly average -- first coming up with an average annual income 
based on previous years' wages and dividing that by 12. Many school 
systems, which are closed over the summer, pay their teachers over 
12 months instead of just during the months they work. 
</P>
<P>
	On months when income exceeds the average, bank the extra,  
advisers say, although they admit it may be tempting to do 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully difficult when you go along and you have been  
making $3,000 a month, then your salary jumps to $5,000 ... to sit 
there and not figure out a way to spend it,'' said Jonathan Pond, a 
Boston-based financial counselor and author of several personal 
finance books. ``Most bonuses are spent at least psychologically 
before they're announced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While sticking to a budget is crucial, it's also important to  
establish an emergency cash reserve just in case there's a 
shortfall at some point. Budget-busters like car repairs are always 
lurking. 
</P>
<P>
	Duttenhofer suggests keeping anywhere from three months' to a  
year's worth of salary in an interest-bearing savings account, 
money market account or short-term bond fund, all of which can be 
easily liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, this may be difficult for some. In fact, a recent survey  
by Minneapolis insurer Lutheran Brotherhood found that half of all 
Americans believe they would fall behind in their bill payments in 
three months or less if their regular incomes were disrupted due to 
job loss or other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	If borrowing is the only way to get through the tough times,  
repay the loan as soon as possible. That should be the first order 
of business when more money finally does come in, advisers agree. 
</P>
<P>
	A home equity line of credit might work for some people, and the  
advantages to taking one out are lower interest rates, and in most 
cases, a tax deduction, Pond says. 
</P>
<P>
	Avoid dipping into retirement accounts, like an Individual  
Retirement Account or employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, however. 
Pulling money out of them would not only hurt one's future nest 
egg, but also produce income tax penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Risky investments also should be kept at a minimum, advisers  
say. While investment decisions will depend on many factors, such 
as financial goals, age and risk tolerance, many financial experts 
recommend that those with unstable incomes keep a slightly larger 
portion of their portfolio in cash instruments or short-term bond 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key thing is recognizing the realities of the business  
you're in,'' Pond said of those with erratic incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unusual to have one or two characteristic which are  
the envy of the working stiffs -- more control over your own destiny 
or above-average incomes -- but it comes with its peril.''

<HEADLINE> One Dead As Hostage Standoff Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A hostage standoff at the state's largest  
mental institution ended this morning with one of the hostages 
killed and the second wounded. The gunman was taken into custody, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Czajkowski, a former nurse at Norristown State Hospital  
who had held the hostages since Wednesday, shot and killed nursing 
supervisor Carol Kepner after police broke into the room where he 
was holed up, state police spokesman Robert Whitebeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski shot a second hostage, Maria Jordan, who was flown to  
the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Whitbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski, 40, who apparently had been angry over being fired  
from his job, was taken away by medical helicopter with unspecified 
injuries. Whitbeck said state police did not fire any shots at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was terminated and the two women his is holding were part  
of that decision,'' Whitbeck said earlier today. ``He specifically 
targeted at least Maria Jordan. We don't know whether he knew for 
sure whether Carol Kepner would be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The power had been shut down Thursday night and police  
negotiators worked round the clock talking to Czajkowski. But they 
said he did respond to conventional hostage-negotiation techniques. 
By this morning, he had apparently been awake for the entire time 
since the standoff began around 10:45 a.m. Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital's 650 patients were moved to safe quarters on  
Wednesday. Areas away from the nursing offices continued to operate 
normally Thursday for the most part, with workers showing up for 
their regular shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 118-year-old hospital, situated on 233 acres, has a locked  
area where the worst of the criminally insane are kept, and also 
serves the chronically mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors have sought tighter security after dozens of patients  
walked away from the hospital without permission in the past two 
years.

<HEADLINE> Dierker Out of Intensive Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker has been  
moved out of intensive care and into a private room after 
undergoing surgery this week to remove tangled blood vessels from 
the front of his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rob Parrish, who performed the surgery Tuesday at Methodist  
Hospital, told Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker on Thursday 
that Dierker was ``walking around on his own'' in his private room. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, who suffered a seizure in the Astros dugout during a  
game Sunday, was expected to remain hospitalized into next week. He 
likely won't return to managing until mid-July at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say two tangled sets of blood vessels caused 52-year-old  
Dierker to suffer the grand mal seizure on Sunday. An angiogram 
performed on Dierker the day after his surgery showed no remaining 
tangled blood vessels.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Israeli Mobster Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former Israeli jet-setter convicted of disguising  
$43 million in Colombian drug proceeds as profits from a family 
jewelry business was sentenced to more than 19 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Tisona, 56, was found guilty in July of all 146 federal  
counts against him in one of the nation's biggest drug laundering 
trials. Charges included money laundering, filing false bank 
statements and making illegal overseas wire transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tisona, who owned a fish farm in the Colombian drug capital of  
Cali, was considered one of Israel's 11 biggest mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Tisona was sentenced 19 years and seven months, according to a  
release issued Friday by U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Scott's office. 
The release did not specify when the sentencing took place. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case was a unique example of cooperation between  
international and national law enforcement and the governments of 
Colombia and Israel,'' Scott said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses last year said Tisona met couriers carrying $4 million  
cash to him in Israel, and Colombian authorities intercepted a fish 
shipment bearing his company label and liquid cocaine in insulating 
gel packs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tisona was accused of using his daughter and her jeweler in-laws  
to bank cash collected on the streets of New York from cocaine 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Internal Revenue Service agent Deborah Reichenbaum testified

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Suspension Ends Aug. 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry will be eligible to return to  
baseball Aug. 11 following a suspension for his arrest on a cocaine 
possession charge, commissioner Bud Selig decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry could return slightly sooner, with Selig saying he  
will review the situation July 22 because of ``mitigating health 
factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's suspension will total 120 days, retroactive to his  
April 14 arrest in Tampa, Fla. Selig had suspended Strawberry 
indefinitely on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy there may be a light at the end of the tunnel  
for Darryl,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his ailing left knee, Strawberry will need several  
weeks in the minor leagues to rehabilitate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we come together again remains to be seen,'' Torre  
said. ``We're not going to know anything until he's ready and we 
see what our situation is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old New York Yankees outfielder, who served a 90-day  
suspension in 1995 after testing positive for cocaine, was slated 
to be a left-field candidate before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees broke camp before the start of the season, he  
remained at their Tampa training complex because he had not yet 
recovered from colon cancer surgery last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who last spoke with Strawberry 3-4 weeks ago, said it was  
too early to assess Strawberry's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what he's been doing,'' Torre said. ``A lot of it  
has to do with how much he's been working out. ... He's still going 
to need (minor league) games before he's ready for games. He's 
going to need a few weeks of games because he's not going to be 
able to play every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors for the players' association and the commissioner's  
office had worked on a joint recommendation to Selig on how he 
should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who served a 90-day suspension in 1995 after testing  
positive for cocaine, pleaded no contest to cocaine possession and 
solicitation charges and was sentenced to 18 months' probation and 
100 hours' community service. 
</P>
<P>
	He also must undergo more drug treatment, be tested twice a week  
and pay $456 in court fees.

<HEADLINE> Bar Accused of Hiring Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Many Irish immigrants looking for work at the  
start of the century encountered signs in the city that read: 
``Irish Need Not Apply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Times have changed, say three waitresses who accused Hilton  
Hotels Corp. in a discrimination complaint of squeezing them out of 
their jobs so Irish natives can work in the hotel's planned Irish 
pub. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to push us out. And why? Because we don't speak  
with an Irish accent,'' said Gloria DiMartino, 55. ``It's 
discrimination, pure and simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past 30 years, DiMartino, Dorothy Webb, 61, and Jo  
Murray, 71, have worked at the Logan Airport Ramada, calming 
anxious travelers and being happy to entertain tourists with their 
``Bahstahn'' accents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how many people have come up to me again and  
again to hear me say `chowdah,''' said Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, the women say managers made it clear in a staff  
meeting that first preference for jobs in the new pub -- to be 
called Kitty O'Shea's -- would be given to those with Irish accents. 
The hotel, managed by Hilton since 1996, plans to open the saloon 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The waitresses said the hotel is violating a collective  
bargaining contract that states employees with seniority have first 
preference for jobs in the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't care if they hire students from Ireland,'' Murray  
said. ``But we should have first preference for those jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women filed the complaint with the Massachusetts Commission  
Against Discrimination, and plan to stage protests if the hotel 
doesn't give them first choice of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by Hilton on Thursday said the Beverly Hills,  
Calif.-based hotel chain ``has acted and will continue to act 
consistent with its collective bargaining agreement ... and 
applicable law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Managers at another Kitty O'Shea's pub -- unrelated to the  
planned airport bar -- say they hire qualified people, regardless of 
their speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise McCool, a spokeswoman for the Irish Immigration Center in  
Boston, said Irish restaurants would better serve their patrons by 
teaching them about Irish history rather than focus on the staff's 
accents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the accent that makes a culture,'' McCool said. ``I  
wonder how many people know who Kitty O'Shea was because if they 
did they would know that she didn't stand for exclusion or 
discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kitty O'Shea was a married woman whose relationship with Irish  
nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell led to a scandal that 
ended Parnell's career and divided Irish public opinion. Parnell 
married O'Shea after her divorce.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Open Mixed / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed today as concerns about the  
earnings outlook for Intel and Gillette tempered the market's 
positive feelings about interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 25.96 at 10,897.59. The Dow has pushed higher each day this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The S&AMP;P 500 was down 1.43  
at 1,338.47 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 6.77 at 
2,537.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductor stocks declined after earnings forecasts for  
Intel, the world's No. 1 maker of chips for personal computers, 
were cut at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. Intel dropped 3 1/8 to 
54 7/8 in Nasdaq trading . 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, Gillette fell 5 9/16 to 41 3/4  
after the razor and blade maker warned second-quarter profits will 
miss analysts' forecasts for the rest of this year because of weak 
sales in Brazil, Russia and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dampened earnings outlook for the two companies came a day  
after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that only a 
modest interest rate hike may be needed to keep inflation 
well-tamed. His comments had a generally soothing effect on the 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 276.98 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.14 at 636.21, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.73 at 769.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.22 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.67 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.26 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
0.23 percent.

<HEADLINE> Principal Financial Buys Aussie Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Principal Financial Group is buying  
the Bankers Trust Australia Group, which includes Australia's 
second largest investment management business, for $1.38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase announced Thursday would boost the combined group's  
assets under management to more than $110 billion worldwide. It 
comes in the wake of Deutsche Bank AG's purchase of Bankers Trust 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Financial, a large pension and insurance company, said  
the deal includes BT Funds Management's Australian and New Zealand 
businesses, BT Portfolio Services, BT Margin Lending and the 
Investment Banking business. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal said it is already discussing selling the Investment  
Bank operations being acquired in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Principal Financial Group is a diversified global financial  
services company with more than $84 billion in assets under 
management, serving more than 10 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Financial Group chairman and chief executive David J.  
Drury said the deal creates ``a powerful force in one of the 
fastest-growing pension systems in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it combines BT Funds Management's ``strong active fund  
management capability and recognized brand name'' with Principal's 
expertise in investment management, retirement services and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Martin will remain chief executive of BT Funds Management,  
reporting directly to Drury. Rob Ferguson, currently managing 
director of Bankers Trust Australia Group, will assume the role of 
non-executive chairman of BT Funds Management upon completion of 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Griswell, president of the Principal Financial Group and  
head of U.S. and global retirement and retail operations, said 
Principal plans to ``aggressively grow our non-US operations over 
the next five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is expected to close third quarter 1999 and is  
subject to approval by regulators in Australia and the United 
States.

<HEADLINE> Hanging Around Not Enough For NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- In a 48-minute game, a couple of seconds and  
a couple of mistakes helped sink the New York Knicks in Game 2 of 
the NBA Finals on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout their impressive playoff run, the Knicks have managed  
to hang around in games, staying close enough to make something 
good happen at the end. Defense and rebounding often overcame 
spotty shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Friday night, though, as New York fell behind 0-2 in the  
best-of-7 series with an 80-67 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The same formula that had been working this postseason seemed to  
be happening against San Antonio in Game 2 with the Knicks' stellar 
work off the boards and hard-nosed defense keeping them in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Typical was the first half when they went through a dry spell  
that produced just one basket in 19 shots. Yet they trailed at 
halftime by just five points. This despite shooting an ugly 29.8 
percent from the field over the first 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	New York fell 11 points back in the third quarter but whittled  
the Spurs' lead to a manageable 52-49 in the final minute of the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	A shot clock violation and three straight misses by Marcus  
Camby, Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston prevented New York from 
moving even closer. 
</P>
<P>
	And then came the fatal errors.  
</P>
<P>
	With time running out in the quarter, Sprewell let Sean Elliott  
get by on the baseline for a layup. Elliott was fouled on his way 
to the basket, setting up a possible three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
	When Elliott missed the foul shot, Camby found himself blocked  
away from the rebound by Tim Duncan, who grabbed the ball and put 
it back for a basket. 
</P>
<P>
	In 2.5 seconds, the Spurs had four points. Suddenly, the  
manageable three-point deficit was a more daunting seven-point 
problem. It was not the kind of end to the quarter that the Knicks 
needed and it proved decisive. 
</P>
<P>
	New York came unglued in the fourth quarter and the Spurs  
restored the double-digit lead and pulled away for the victory.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hurt As Roller Rink Roof Caves In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A roof caved in at a suburban  
roller-skating rink Friday, injuring a young skater and her coach. 
Several others practicing for an upcoming competition escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole ceiling started falling down from the back to the  
front like a wave,'' said Melissa Cunningham, 15. ``Everyone was 
yelling, 'Run, run, run' and a couple of people got stuck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse of about a third of the roof at the Foothill Skate  
Inn in northeast Sacramento County happened shortly after 5 p.m. 
when eight children and three adults were inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The rink is normally is packed with skaters later on Friday  
nights, Sheriff's Lt. Jim Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a complete mess. Had it been two or three hours later,  
we would have definitely had casualties,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	A young girl who was briefly trapped in the debris was taken to  
a hospital with back pain. She was treated for a few scrapes and 
released. The 57-year-old team coach was in fair condition, treated 
for shoulder and hand injuries.

<HEADLINE> Kevin Lowe To Coach Edmonton Oilers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Kevin Lowe, the Edmonton Oilers'  
first-ever draft pick and the first player to score a goal for the 
franchise, was hired Friday as the team's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, a defenseman in the Oilers' glory years of the 1980s, was  
hired to replace Ron Low, who rejected a one-year contract 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin Lowe was the first draft pick of the Edmonton Oilers  
many years ago and today I am proud to name him our coach,'' Oilers 
general manager Glen Sather said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, 40, is the seventh coach in the team's 20-year NHL  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, an assistant to Low last season, has never played or  
coached in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played for five great coaches, starting with Glen, John  
Muckler, Ted Green, Ronnie Low and Mike Keenan,'' Lowe said. 
``Particularly Glen and Mike Keenan, one of their main emphasis was 
you're going to play if you show me early in the game and I think 
that's what I'd like to see in our hockey club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see the guys jumping, ready to go from the outset  
and accountable for their actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe inherits a team stung last season by injury and shoddy  
goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely enthusiastic about the group of guys because of  
the playoffs,'' Lowe said. ``Even though we lost four straight (to 
Dallas), I think anyone who followed the series would agree it was 
a pretty hard-fought series and, although Buffalo may beg to 
differ, Dallas is on the verge of winning the Stanley Cup. We 
played well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas leads Buffalo 3-2 in the Stanley Cup finals.  
</P>
<P>
	Lowe played 15 of his 19 NHL seasons with the Oilers, winning  
five Stanley Cups in Edmonton and another with the New York 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1,254 games, he had 84 goals, 347 assists and 1,498 penalty  
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Some B-2 Flaws Revealed in Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The B-2 ``stealth'' bomber is hobbled by  
significant flaws that include a short lifespan for the stealthy 
materials that give the plane its name, congressional investigators 
say, though the bomber's fans say its combat debut in Kosovo was a 
huge success. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2 billion plane has passed most operational tests, but  
deficiencies were identified ``that will limit, or under some 
circumstances slow, its pace in flight operations,'' a report 
released this week concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth General Accounting Office report in five years on the  
B-2 was completed before the 11-week Balkan air war ended June 9. 
President Clinton praised the B-2's success rate in Kosovo last 
week, calling the plane a marvel and its crews a testament to 
American military prowess. 
</P>
<P>
	Six B-2s flew 30-hour nonstop missions from Whiteman Air Force  
Base to Yugoslavia and back. Although the plane flew only about 50 
of the more than 30,000 sorties by NATO pilots, its payloads 
accounted for 11 percent of the bombs dropped -- 1.4 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane scored near-perfect accuracy in its first taste of  
combat, Pentagon officials say. Although a B-2 mistakenly dropped 
bombs on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last month, the fault lay 
with bad maps and other errors at NATO rather than with the plane 
or its crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proof is in the pudding,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.,  
whose district includes the B-2 base. ``The fact that it did so 
well should cause everybody who is critical to own up to the fact 
that they were wrong. It was dependable, and it worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GAO auditors questioned the durability of the special materials  
that make the B-2 nearly invisible to enemy radar and said the air 
crew can't properly see the enemy because of cockpit equipment that 
does not perform as advertised. The report also found the planning 
system for missions insufficient and said the plane is limited by 
the fact that all the planes are housed and maintained at one 
Missouri Air Force base. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-plane B-2 fleet is high-maintenance, with long down times  
for repair of the historically delicate stealth parts, the GAO 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These factors diminish the ability of the Air Force to fly the  
aircraft as frequently as operational requirements stipulated,'' 
the auditors wrote, particularly when the planes were away from 
their home turf at Whiteman Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force spent more than $740 million to develop a network  
of systems that help B-2 crews detect enemy planes, missiles or 
other threats in flight, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It either incorrectly identified threats or did not provide an  
accurate location of threats, '' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said the Air Force had made progress in correcting  
problems in planning, but that little progress had been made in 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	A Defense Department official agreed that more work needed to be  
done, but said the GAO overstated the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	George Schneiter, director of strategic and tactical systems,  
acknowledged problems in technology that warns crews about threats, 
but said the trouble is less severe than the GAO concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneiter said the Air Force is making improvements in the  
radar-deflecting skin of the plane, and that there is an effort to 
acquire maintenance shelters where the planes can make pit stops. 
</P>
<P>
	The bat-wing-shaped plane has been a regular target for critics  
even before its introduction in 1989. Criticism has often centered 
on the plane's mechanical reliability and whether its stealth 
abilities are worth the price. The Pentagon eventually plans to buy 
21 B-2s. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the GAO found extensive fault with a new  
version of the Navy F-18 fighter jet. The F/A-18 Super Hornet has 
so many flaws -- 84 -- that it may not pass operational tests with 
flying colors, auditors found. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Donator May Be Extradited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine president will not  
interfere in a U.S. request for the extradition of one of his 
friends, who allegedly made illegal campaign contributions to 
President Clinton, his spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy asked the Philippine government on Thursday to  
arrest and extradite Filipino businessman Mark Jimenez on charges 
of tax evasion, wire fraud, conspiracy, giving false statements and 
campaign financing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	An indictment issued September in Washington accused Jimenez of  
illegally giving nearly $40,000 to Democratic Party candidates. 
Those charges were incorporated into an indictment in April that 
also accuses him of conspiracy, tax evasion and mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez fled the United States in December. He returned to the  
Philippines, helped broker several large business deals and became 
a friend and adviser to President Joseph Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government also requested that Jimenez's assets be  
frozen and confiscated pending the outcome of his trial, said 
Franklin Ebdalin, chief legal officer of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Embassy charge d'affairs Eugene Martin presented the U.S.  
extradition request and evidence to back up the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada spokesman Jerry Barican said the judiciary would decide  
the extradition request. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is purely a matter between Mr. Mark Jimenez and the U.S.  
government,'' Barican said. ``The president's policy is not to 
interfere with any matter that is before the judiciary, whether in 
the domestic or international courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez was not immediately available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ebdalin said the U.S. extradition request ``has a strong  
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez allegedly conspired to defraud the Federal Elections  
Commission by using corporate money for campaign contributions. The 
indictment says Jimenez got employees of companies he owned and 
controlled to give money to Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and 
candidates for Congress, and then reimbursed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez also allegedly defrauded the IRS by taking business  
deductions for personal expenses and political contributions made 
with money from Future Tech International Inc. Jimenez was chief 
executive of the company.

<HEADLINE> Frontier Won't Act on Qwest Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Telecommunications upstart Qwest appears to have  
lost the first round in its bid to buy Frontier Corp. out from 
under Global Crossing Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier Corp., a small long-distance telephone company, said  
Thursday it would take no action on the $11.3 billion unsolicited 
takeover offer from Qwest Communications International Inc., and 
would proceed with its plans to merge with Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current circumstances surrounding the Qwest proposal do  
not warrant any change at this time in our current initiatives that 
are designed to move Frontier's transaction with Global Crossing 
toward a prompt closing,'' Joseph P. Clayton, Frontier's chief 
executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Qwest with at least three options: sweeten its bid,  
take the offer directly to Frontier's shareholders, or walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Qwest said the company has no plans to raise the  
stakes, but expressed hope Frontier might be swayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are comfortable with our bid and we are positive that as  
Frontier continues to review our proposal they will find it 
superior'' to Global Crossing's, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, based in Denver, is the No. 4 long-distance phone  
company, but has grand visions of becoming a global provider of 
high-speed Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The company made its bold offer to Frontier on Sunday along with  
a companion $32.3 billion bid to acquire U S West Inc., a 
Denver-based Baby Bell telephone company. Both U S West and 
Frontier, based in Rochester, N.Y., have agreed to combine their 
operations with Global Crossing, a nascent communications company 
that is building a vast undersea cable network for Internet 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's takeover offers, which consist mostly of Qwest stock,  
quickly lost much of their appeal Monday as skeptical investors 
bailed out, sending Qwest's shares down 24 percent. The stock has 
since recovered slightly, but only enough to make the combined bid 
of $43.6 billion neck-and-neck with the $43.9 billion offer from 
Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Annunziata, Global Crossing's chief executive officer,  
took Frontier's inaction as a sign of victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that the Frontier board of directors has  
reaffirmed its commitment to complete the merger with Global 
Crossing as planned,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West spokesman David Banks today said the company had no  
comment on Frontier's statement, and would continue to evaluate the 
offer from Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest offered a $2 per share premium if both U S West and  
Frontier agreed to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors signaled today they liked the turn of events, bidding  
up shares of all of the companies involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier's shares rose 12 1/2 cents to $57.87 1/2 in midmorning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where U S West's shares 
were up 6 1/4 cents at $57. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's shares jumped $1.37 1/2 to $37.37 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, where Global Crossing's stock was $1.56 1/4 higher at $50.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is revolutionizing the telecommunications industry  
and is driving a string of merger bids. Companies are hoping that 
the next generation of high-speed Internet technologies will link 
more homes and businesses, providing a wealth of new opportunities 
to sell goods and provide information and entertainment. These 
hopes have prompted telecom and cable companies to make big bets on 
mergers so they can gain the size and market share that will be 
keys to new profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long-distance  
company, won a bidding war against Comcast Corp. for MediaOne, a 
large cable company. And in Europe, upstart Olivetti SpA won a 
fight with Deutsche Telekom for control of Telecom Italia SpA.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Plans To Buy 30 Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines plans to upgrade its  
aging fleet by purchasing 30 Airbus A-319 and A-320 planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes, valued at $1.2 billion, will replace 38 Boeing 727's  
built in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the airline said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal involves Northwest converting long-standing options  
into firm orders to buy planes from the European aircraft maker 
Airbus Industrie. Two years ago, Northwest announced options to buy 
up to 100 Airbus planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The options still stand on the other 70,'' said Jon Austin,  
Northwest spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliveries of the new planes are set to start in January 2002  
and continue through 2004.

<HEADLINE> Internet Use Rises 11 Pct. in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Internet use has risen to 11 percent of Japanese  
households, although high costs and privacy problems on the World 
Wide Web remain hindrances, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telecommunications Ministry's report found that Internet use  
was spreading in Japan at a faster rate than the proliferation of 
computers and cellular phones, taking only five years to reach 10 
percent of the nation's households. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 13 years for at least 10 percent of households to have  
computers and 15 years for cellular phone use to top that rate, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet use climbed 47 percent in the fiscal year ended in  
March to a total of nearly 17 million people, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said one problem with expansion was the possible violation of  
people's privacy and other crime on the Internet. It also said that 
telephone charges for Internet use in Tokyo were about three times 
those in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said that electronic commerce was taking off,  
doubling in the last fiscal year to more than 166 billion yen ($1.4 
billion).

<HEADLINE> Europe Hit With Another Food Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mad Cow, dioxin and now tainted Coke.  
</P>
<P>
	There seems no end to food scandals in Europe, despite the fact  
that regulators tightly control food purity and the public rejects 
controversial products like hormone-treated beef and genetically 
engineered grain. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Europeans, strict government standards and a healthy  
dollop of pride in their centuries-old culinary traditions make 
these panics all the more distressing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some government officials and large food producers contended  
Friday the scares are random accidents more than symptoms of a 
flawed regulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an awful lot of legislation, from the stable to the  
table, but that doesn't stop someone from breaking the rules, and 
it's not going to stop an accident,'' said European Commission 
spokesman Gerry Kiely. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics including smaller producers and consumer advocates  
aren't so sure, suggesting large profit-centered companies might 
cut corners. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday he wants to create  
an international council to better monitor food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wish is to see ... whether it might be possible to find a  
solution able to better guarantee the health of Europeans, of all 
the inhabitants of the world,'' Chirac said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola remained banned in Belgium this weekend after scores  
of people who drank it suffered nausea and vomiting. The country's 
Health Ministry agreed Thursday to lift restrictions from some of 
Coca-Cola Co.'s other beverages. It said the bans on Coke, Fanta 
and Sprite would continue until investigators learn what caused the 
problems, which were linked to two of the company's plants in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola has blamed the outbreak on substandard carbon dioxide  
used to put bubbles in the drinks in one plant, and a fungicide on 
wooden pallets used to transport cans at the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union has woven a dense layer of laws aimed at  
ensuring food purity, from limits on antibiotic residues in milk to 
the color of paint on slaughterhouse walls. Kiely said he sees no 
evidence that any EU member governments have been slack in 
enforcing these laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands plans to go even further, with its Agriculture  
Ministry pushing to tighten rules governing what can be used as 
ingredients in animal feeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The task has been made ``more urgent'' by the discovery that a  
factory in Belgium produced feeds using fat laced with dioxins, 
said Ton Van Der Molen, a spokesman for the Dutch ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiely said the dioxin scare, which led the EU to ban exports of  
Belgian products that might contain the carcinogens, was the result 
of fraud or an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The dioxin scare was Europe's worst panic over food safety since  
1996, when the European Commission banned exports of British beef 
due to fears that the meat could infect people who ate it with a 
possibly fatal cattle ailment, bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
(BSE). 
</P>
<P>
	BSE, popularly known as mad cow disease, is believed to have  
spread through cattle feed containing the ground-up remains of 
animals infected with brain illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some suggest that the production of food on an intensified,  
industrial scale is partly to blame. U.S.-style agribusiness is 
establishing a foothold in Europe, where many farms are still 
small, family-owned properties. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 outbreak of contagious swine fever led to the preventive  
slaughter of 10 million pigs in the Netherlands. The disease -- 
fatal to pigs but not to people -- spread ``like wildfire'' because 
the animals lived on large, densely stocked farms, Kiely said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Food and Drink Federation, a trade group of the  
country's large-scale food producers, sees no pattern in these 
seemingly random incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Food safety is the highest priority of the U.K. food  
manufacturing industry and we have every confidence in the U.K. 
regulatory system,'' the federation said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sandy Boyd, a small-scale British food producer, said mad  
cow disease and the Belgian dioxin problem illustrate the risks 
posed by large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very concerned that it's the accountants now that are  
getting hold of the business, and that there is a continuous effort 
to drive down prices and to maximize profit. Inevitably, in doing 
so, corners are going to be cut,'' said Boyd, who manages a 
butchery and 1,500-acre cattle and sheep farm south of Sheffield in 
central England. 
</P>
<P>
	For Belgian consumer advocate Geert Gommers, concerns over food  
safety can grow if companies like Coca-Cola are reticent to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy to get really objective and clear information  
from the producer,'' said Gommers, a member of VELT, a non-profit 
group based in Antwerp, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's worst case of food poisoning in recent times occurred a  
decade ago in Spain, when adulterated rapeseed oil killed some 500 
people who thought they were buying edible oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former Spanish government officials were convicted in 1997  
of negligence and given six-year suspended sentences.

<HEADLINE> Tracy Looks Ahead to Next Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Paul Tracy actually enjoyed his Milwaukee  
victory for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he began to think about Sunday's Budweiser-G.I. Joe's 200  
at Portland International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting my first win for Team Kool Green at the last race in  
Milwaukee has given me a boost,'' Tracy said. ``It seemed to lift a 
weight off my shoulders. But I've been thinking about what I need 
to do to win in Portland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, barred from the season-opening race in Homestead, Fla.,  
because of a rough driving incident in Australia late last year, 
needs more good results like Milwaukee to get back into 
championship contention. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into today's opening of practice and qualifying for the  
Portland race, Tracy is tied for eighth with Max Papis, trailing 
series leader Juan Montoya by 37 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Up at the top of the CART FedEx Series standings, things are  
considerably tighter, with five drivers bunched within 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Dario Franchitti, Tracy's teammate, who probably  
should be considered the favorite to take control of the 
championship as the series enters his favorite time of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Scot blossomed into a championship contender  
last year with his prowess on the permanent road courses and 
temporary street circuits, earning the first three victories of his 
CART career and scoring 138 of his 160 points away from the oval 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning with Sunday's race, the CART series turns to road  
racing for four straight events and six of the next seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to look at the schedule and see all those road  
courses coming up,'' Franchitti said. ``The ovals are fun, but a 
lot of drivers in this series come from road racing backgrounds, 
and it's a good feeling to turn right again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti is just two points behind Montoya, the dazzling  
rookie from Colombia who replaced Alex Zanardi, the winner of two 
of the last three CART races in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Greg Moore -- who has scored points in all seven races  
this season -- is just two points behind Franchitti, followed by 
teammates Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi of Brazil, tied 
for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Franchitti has been particularly effective on road  
circuits, Portland has not been one of his best tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been quick at Portland both times I've raced here, but  
I've never actually finished the race,'' he said. ``Both times I've 
been involved in other people's accidents. So it's been 
particularly frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I like the circuit; it's got a nice flow to it, but it's  
very physically demanding. All the drivers find it one of the 
toughest tracks. By now, everybody is used to ovals. Then you come 
to the road course at Portland and it's pretty physical. So you've 
got to have been in the gym for a while to be comfortable going 
around here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who came to CART after winning the championship in a  
European road-racing series, earned the first of his CART victories 
on the temporary street circuit in Long Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, I'm happy with the first seven races,'' the 23-year-old  
speedster said. ``Our team has done better than anyone predicted, 
so that's good. But after the past two races (11th in St. Louis and 
10th in Milwaukee), it will be nice to have a change from going in 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good test in Portland and I really liked the track. I  
think we'll be a little happier following the Portland race than we 
were after Milwaukee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is also confident, especially with his extensive  
experience at the Portland track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been racing here since my days in karting,'' he said.  
``With the drivers' standings being as tight as they are, and with 
so much parity among the drivers, it's really important to stay 
consistent during this road-racing segment of the schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, who ran over one of his own crewmen, vent man Ty  
Manseau, during the race in Milwaukee, is anxious to get back to 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really glad Ty's OK,'' Andretti said. ``That was  
definitely the low point I have had in a really long time.''

<HEADLINE> Odom Will Turn Pro After All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Sophomore forward Lamar Odom, who sought  
this week to pull out of the NBA draft despite having signed with 
an agent, will turn pro after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island announced Friday evening that it will not seek a  
waiver that would allow Odom, considered a top five prospect in the 
draft, to return to college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom, who played only one season with the Rams, lost his  
collegiate eligibility May 26 when he signed a contract with an 
agent. But he soon changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``During his time away, he realized he was just a piece of  
property,'' assistant athletic director John Vanner said Thursday. 
Odom's agent resigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island officials spent four days deciding whether they had  
enough of a case to appeal to the NCAA for a waiver of its 
eligibility rules. In the end, they bailed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't really feel there was enough of a case,'' school  
spokesman Mike Ballweg said Friday. He refused to say on which 
grounds the university considered making an appeal, citing a 
concern for Odom's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Odom led Rhode Island in scoring (17.6) and  
rebounding (9.4) last season. He hit a 25-footer at the buzzer as 
Rhode Island beat Temple in the Atlantic 10 tournament championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom now has to convince NBA teams that he has a strong  
commitment to the league. Last weekend, he skipped a league-wide 
physical. He later missed workouts with the Charlotte Hornets and 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ballweg said Odom's future is not totally bleak.  
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA certainly is an attractive option. It isn't his first.  
But playing for $12 million is not a bad option,'' he said, 
referring to the contract value a top draft pick can sign.

	``It's the first step in what will be a long and expensive  
rebuilding of the factory,'' said Susan Mogerman, director of the 
Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But George M. Pullman, founder of both the factory and the  
community, might have been appalled by the designations 
``historic'' and ``endangered.'' As an inventor and business 
innovator, the father of the railroad sleeper car industry kept his 
eyes on the future, not the past. And what he did, he did for 
keeps. 
</P>
<P>
	Pullman was already the leading figure in his industry in 1879  
when he decided to consolidate operations at a site near Lake 
Calumet, nine miles south of what were then the city limits of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	And to ensure an available -- and sober -- workforce, Pullman  
ordered architect Solon S. Beman to design a model town. The new 
community around the plant would have housing for several classes 
of employees, shops, parks, a school, a hospital and a church -- but 
no taverns. Drinks would be served at the elegant Hotel Florence, 
named for Pullman's daughter, but only to executives and visiting 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of several thousand workers took residence in 1881.  
</P>
<P>
	A bit later, Pullman surveyed his realm and found it good.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been disappointed in any respect,'' he told a  
reporter. ``On a broad avenue lined with cozy houses, with flowers 
and lawns on every hand, and scrupulous neatness everywhere 
maintained, a man of the dullest mind would feel ashamed to appear 
in public in his shirtsleeves or barefooted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he wasn't alone in his opinion. The International Hygienic  
and Pharmaceutical Exposition, meeting in Prague, voted Pullman 
``the most perfect town in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Pullman's reaction, then, had he been able to visit his  
model town on a recent sunny afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The only vestige of commercial activity was at the Pullman Pub,  
where six workmen were watching the History Channel over their 
post-lunch beers. All of them were in their shirtsleeves except for 
one, and he was shirtless under his overalls. 
</P>
<P>
	And they weren't Pullman workers, either. There's been no heavy  
industry in the area since 1982, when the last sleeper cars were 
built -- by Amtrak, not the Pullman Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The spectral visit wouldn't have been all unpleasant, though.  
Despite an ominous scattering of ``for sale'' signs, the blocks of 
housing for workers and foremen would have looked much as they did 
in Pullman's lifetime. The red-brick row houses are small, but with 
a charm and architectural harmony that's rare in Chicago. Add some 
white front steps and they might be from a pleasant neighborhood in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	But the factory a few blocks to the north looks like something  
from Atlanta after General Sherman's social call. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dec. 1 fire tore through the 220,000 square-foot factory and  
administration building. The blaze, which was blamed on a homeless 
man, toppled the building's landmark clock tower and collapsed its 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the fire occurred just a week before the site was  
scheduled to undergo a $3.4 million stabilization project to stop 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, $2.1 million in state and federal funds are being  
used for emergency work. Another $10 million for Pullman 
restoration work has been set aside under Gov. George Ryan's recent 
public improvement program. But some authorities have estimated 
that an additional $20 million may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Just where the additional money would come from and what it  
would be used for is still unclear. Ryan and Chicago Mayor Richard 
M. Daley are appointing a panel under former Gov. James R. Thompson 
to study various plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Robert W. Fioretti is president of the Historic Pullman  
Foundation, which leases the Hotel Florence from the state. He says 
he envisions an interactive museum of ``industrialization and 
urbanization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daley is said to favor a smaller cultural museum, combined with  
a mix of shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	All agree, though, on the historic importance of the site, which  
was at the center of two of the most important labor struggles in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was the Pullman Strike of 1894, which snarled the  
nation's railroads for several months before it was put down by 
federal troops. That strike began when Pullman cut wages during a 
depression, but kept the rents in his ``workers' paradise'' at 
their boomtime levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The second struggle was that of the African-Americans who served  
as porters on Pullman's railcars. They won their fight for 
increased wages and union recognition only in 1937, 40 years after 
George Pullman's death.

<HEADLINE>  India To Fight for Himalayan Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Artillery moved forward and air force jets  
roared high above the Himalayan peaks Friday as the Indian army 
prepared for a frontal assault on an almost vertical rock face held 
by Pakistan-based Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	While India's foreign minister said a full-fledged war between  
nuclear powers India and Pakistan is unlikely, soldiers fired 
machine-guns and artillery across the disputed line that divides 
Kashmir between them. 
</P>
<P>
	Since early May, Indian soldiers have fired artillery shells at  
the snow-covered peaks to drive out what they call Pakistan-backed 
Afghan guerrillas and Pakistani soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	New Delhi says the fighters seized Indian territory after  
sneaking across a cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between the 
two nations. Pakistan says Kashmiri ``freedom fighters,'' and not 
its troops, are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries' navies are on high alert in the Arabian Sea, and  
the Indian army has moved anti-aircraft batteries, tanks and 
artillery up to the border in the state of Punjab, eyeing Pakistani 
troops across abandoned wheat fields. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 13, Indian troops captured one of three major peaks,  
Tololing, that Muslim separatists had used as a vantage point for 
shelling India's only highway in the region. On Friday they were 
moving artillery closer to the next targets, Tiger Hill and an 
almost sheer rockface called Peak 5140, for its height in meters, 
the equivalent of 16,864 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enemy has entered our territory, is holding land, our men  
are dying,'' said a young Indian major at a gun position between 
the abandoned, shelled-out towns of Dras and Kargil. ``If this is 
not war, what is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past 24 hours there has been heavy firing from the  
Pakistan side of the demarcation line, answered by Indian forces, 
army spokesman Col. Bikram Singh told reporters in New Delhi on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been concentrated attacks on intruders. The air  
force has been successful in dealing with them and is having a 
telling effect,'' Indian Air Force Capt. D.N. Ganesh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers piled bags of wheat, beds, electronic appliances, and  
farm utensils on their tractors, ox carts and bicycles and headed 
to the houses of relatives or friends in nearby villages and towns. 
Nearly 70 percent of local villagers have fled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sleep at the grain market, beyond the defense line,'' said  
Ram Singh, a farmer of Theh, a village surrounded on three sides by 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the barbed wire fences, in Pakistan, some 30,000  
villagers have also fled their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have conducted three surveys and we estimate there are  
about 30,000 displaced persons,'' said Paul-Henri Arni, the deputy 
head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems could arise if the exodus from the border continues and  
if the fighting is prolonged, forcing people into refugee camps 
throughout the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the military build-up, India's foreign minister said the  
fighting would be contained. ``Good sense will dawn at the earliest 
(in Pakistan),'' Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh told 
reporters in New Delhi. ``I don't foresee a large-scale war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Press Trust of India news agency quoted army sources as saying a  
Pakistani major and four of his men were killed in an Indian 
artillery attack in the Skardu region of Pakistan-held Kashmir. The 
attack targeted a camp that was providing logistics, food and 
ammunition to the intruders, carried to the Indian side carried by 
mules and thousands of human porters. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no confirmation or denial from Pakistan about the  
reports. Pakistan has acknowledged the loss of 30 men in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	India says it has lost more than 110 men, with eight missing,  
and 250 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Both India and Pakistan lay claim to the former Himalayan state  
of Kashmir, which was divided between the two nations after the end 
of British rule in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the leaders of the industrialized world,  
attending the Group of Eight Summit in Cologne, Germany, Pakistan's 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said ``G-8 leaders individually and 
collectively must play a positive role to resolve the crisis and 
avert a conflict.''

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Academic Counselor Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Alonzo Newby, the academic counselor for  
Minnesota men's basketball team and a key figure in the academic 
fraud inquiry, was fired Friday for refusing to cooperate with 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby, was terminated for ``refusing to cooperate with  
independent investigators looking into charges of academic fraud 
and other violations in the university's athletic department and 
for participating in violation of NCAA rules,'' the university said 
in a statement. Newby could provide information linking coach Clem 
Haskins to alleged improprieties in the program, 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not specify which NCAA rules were violated.  
</P>
<P>
	Newby allegedly gave $3,000 in cash to Jan Gangelhoff, the  
former academic counseling office manager who said she wrote more 
than 400 papers for Gophers players from 1993 to 1998. Gangelhoff 
has said the money was from Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff has described Newby's job as doing ``whatever it took  
to keep kids eligible.'' She also said Newby edited some of the 
first papers she wrote for players. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby, the team's academic counselor since 1992, has been on  
medical leave since April. He will remain on paid leave until 
Monday, his final day of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Gardebring, the university's vice president for  
institutional relations, said Thursday that Newby would have been 
entitled to around $30,000 in severance pay if he cooperated with 
the investigation and his year-to-year contract was not renewed. 
She called the package standard for an employee of Newby's position 
and seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby's lawyer, Ron Rosenbaum, said no severance was offered  
Friday, since Newby was terminated with cause. Rosenbaum said Newby 
was not surprised by the firing, but he was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Number one, he expected this, so he's been prepared. Other  
than that, he feels isolated, alienated, lonely and abandoned,'' he 
said. ``These are the people he spent a lot of years with, people 
in the athletic department, and he's taken the fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university has been negotiating with Haskins' attorney to  
buy out Haskins' contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach's contract contains an unusual clause that allows him  
to receive $423,000 in deferred compensation even if he is 
terminated with just cause. If just cause cannot be shown, Haskins 
would be entitled to almost $1.2 million, plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins has maintained his innocence and said he hopes to return  
as Gophers coach next season. He is expected to talk with 
investigators next week.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Again Pushing Comp Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans say comp-time legislation  
should be part of the coming showdown over boosting the minimum 
wage, but Democrats say that would be a ``poison pill'' designed to 
kill the wage hike. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP lawmakers on Thursday renewed a push to let workers choose  
time off instead of overtime pay. The measure would make it easier 
for employees to pick compensatory time off -- 1 1/2 hours for every 
hour of overtime work -- rather than time-and-a-half overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed such a bill in 1996 because of concerns  
that employers could discriminate against workers who choose money 
instead of time off. Senate Democrats filibustered the measure in 
the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Working parents, especially moms, need flexible working hours to  
help balance the demands of their jobs with the needs of their 
families, said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., the bill's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft said he has made changes to make the measure more  
palatable to Democrats. The bill sets up an 80-hour, two-week 
schedule, but unlike past proposals, it sets a 50-hour limit for 
any given workweek. Unused time off would be converted to cash at 
the end of each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft and Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., one of more than 30  
co-sponsors, said the approaching debate over boosting the minimum 
wage is an ideal setting for another attempt to pass comp-time 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, led by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep.  
David Bonior of Michigan, are pushing to phase in over two years a 
$1 increase in the minimum wage, to $6.15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The last wage increase, 90 cents an hour, was implemented in two  
stages in 1996 and 1997. Republicans are facing potentially 
unstoppable demands for another increase and House Majority Leader 
Dick Armey, R-Texas, conceded in April that Congress may act this 
year to raise the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's spokesman, Jim Manley, ruled out any compromise on the  
GOP measure, which he labeled ``an anti-labor poison pill.'' Even 
with the concessions, Manley said, employers could misuse it to 
undermine the traditional 40-hour workweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft, who was joined at a Capitol Hill news conference by  
Bond and Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and Michael Enzi, 
R-Wyo., said the option would be voluntary and optional for 
employees.

<HEADLINE> Pennsylvania Hostage Standoff Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A two-day hostage standoff at  
Pennsylvania's largest mental hospital ended Friday with a fired 
nurse killing one of his captives and critically wounding the other 
after police broke a window to get a better look at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Czajkowski, whose hostages had a role in his dismissal in  
April, hadn't slept or eaten in 48 hours, refused to allow police 
to talk to his captives and wasn't responding to conventional 
hostage-negotiation techniques, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shortly after midnight, we didn't hear anything more from the  
hostages,'' Capt. Thomas LaCrosse said at a news conference. ``At 3 
a.m. (Czajkowski) began referring to the hostages at suspects, and 
that was very telling to me. He had previously talked about them as 
witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning to fear for the women's safety, LaCrosse ordered  
police to break a window at 8:45 a.m. to get a better look at them. 
Czajkowski immediately began firing his .44-caliber revolver, 
killing Carol Kepner, 54, and critically injuring Maria Jordan, 37, 
before being subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Michael Marino charged Czajkowski, 40, with  
murder, kidnapping, burglary and related charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, wounded in the chest and abdomen, was in fair condition  
and expected to make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski, 40, was hospitalized in fair condition with cuts,  
broken bones and other injuries that police said were caused when 
officers seized him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Czajkowski took the two supervisors hostage and  
demanded an investigation into his firing. After the standoff 
ended, police recovered a bag containing a claw hammer, a gunpowder 
flask, handcuffs, lead bullets, and percussion caps. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski had worked at Norristown State Hospital for 11 years  
but was fired after his performance deteriorated, said Mary Ellen 
Fritz, a spokeswoman for the Public Welfare Department. She would 
not be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	For years his supervisors had considered him a well-qualified  
registered nurse and assigned him to provide the highest level of 
patient care, Fritz said. His annual evaluations were positive, 
until his work began to go downhill, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired after numerous failed attempts to resolve problems  
on the job, Fritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 118-year-old hospital on 233 acres has a locked area where  
the worst of the criminally insane are kept. It also serves the 
chronically mentally ill. Neighbors have sought tighter security 
after dozens of patients walked away from the hospital over the 
past two years.

<HEADLINE> $40M Gettysburg Complex Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Interior Department unveiled plans today  
for a $40 million visitors complex for the Gettysburg National 
Military Park in Pennsylvania, saying it is the best way to 
preserve the park's historic resources while accommodating the many 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The development plan has been the focus of controversy, with  
some historians arguing the joint government-commercial venture 
will detract from the park's historic sites. Local merchants also 
have complained it will take away business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in a statement that  
the plan, somewhat scaled back from previous versions, ``will help 
restore historic integrity to some of America's most hallowed 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It moves the landscape and the battlefield much closer to the  
way things looked to the brave men who fought there in July 1863 in 
the battle that changed the course of the Civil War,'' continued 
Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service's plan calls for an existing visitors  
center with its 360-degree panoramic painting of the battle to be 
removed from a place near where Pickett's Charge ended at the Union 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	The $40.4 million visitors center will be built about one-half  
mile southeast, where it will house the painting, a bookstore and 
an eating area that may include up to 250 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service said the new museum will be located outside the  
battle action and, therefore, have less effect on the historic 
landscape. And it would allow restoration of Ziegler's Grove, which 
was the center of the Union battle line and overlooked fields where 
Union troops turned back Confederate soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum complex ``with greatly improved interpretation'' of  
the battle will include ``a greater emphasis on the causes and 
consequences of the battle'' as well as the role of the nearby town 
of Gettysburg, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the site of the 1863 battle brings in 1.8 million  
tourists who spend more than $100 million for accommodations, 
meals, sightseeing and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Town officials in Gettysburg, with a population of about 7,000,  
are worried the new, more expansive visitors complex will take away 
business from town merchants within walking distance of the 
battlefield park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no incentive for them to go into town,''  
Gettysburg Councilman Ted Streeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the new complex is being financed through a  
nonprofit foundation set up by developer Robert Kinsley of York, 
Pa., with the construction debt to be retired through charitable 
donations and tourist dollars. The complex would be turned over to 
the government after the debt is paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service said some changes were made from an earlier  
draft to try to ease community concerns. The complex, for example, 
will have a limited food menu, so as not to compete as much with 
local restaurants. The seating capacity was reduced from 300 to 
250. 
</P>

	Park Service Director Robert Stanton said ``the driving force''  
behind the development was ``the need to preserve and protect the

<HEADLINE> Compassionate Buzzword in Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the 2000 presidential campaign, the C word  
is the buzzword. C for compassionate. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Gov. George W. Bush's self description, ridiculed by  
rivals, who nonetheless insist that they are no less compassionate 
than he. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud to be a compassionate conservative,'' Bush says.  
``I welcome the label.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He chose it during his first term as governor of Texas. ``Call  
me a compassionate conservative,'' he said two years ago. The line 
is now part of the set speech in his Republican campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hardly original.  
</P>
<P>
	A search of political stories turns up several uses of the  
phrase. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who is venturing toward a 
presidential bid in 2000, described himself that way in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The tag was even spotted in the political vocabulary of fiery  
former Rep. Robert K. Dornan, a hard-line California conservative 
whom it didn't seem to fit, proving, at least, the elasticity of 
the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned up in the lexicons of the Doles, Bob in 1988,  
Elizabeth a decade later. Mrs. Dole, seeking the 2000 GOP 
nomination, now prefers to speak of courageous conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
	Labels are shorthand. They don't tell voters how candidates  
would operate in office, only what they'd call it. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, the dictionary defines compassionate as showing  
``a ready inclination to pity, sympathy or tenderness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said last December that Republicans -- he  
meant Bush -- were using the rhetoric of the center when they urged 
compassionate conservatism, but would govern from the right. So 
saying, he chose a temporary label for his own philosophy: 
``practical idealism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's still sniping at the Bush phrase. ``I want to keep our  
prosperity going, and I know how to do it ... not by letting people 
fend for themselves or hoping for crumbs of compassion, but by 
giving people the skills and the knowledge to succeed,'' he said in 
his formal campaign kickoff on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans weren't so easy on the Bush phrase. Former Tennessee  
Gov. Lamar Alexander called them ``weasel words,'' clever but 
meaningless. Former Vice President Dan Quayle called the phrase 
silly, and said in a fund-raising letter earlier this year that 
he'd ordered his staff ``never -- ever -- to utter the words 
'compassionate conservative.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle uttered them himself as he campaigned in New Hampshire  
Wednesday, although not in the same order. ``Conservatives are 
compassionate,'' he said. ``We care deeply about our friends and 
neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Compassionate conservatism is a contrived copout,'' said Joe  
Andrews, who trailed Bush's first campaign swing for the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush built his reply into his standard stump speech. ``I know  
this approach has been criticized,'' he says. ``But why? Is 
compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our party be led 
by someone who boasts of a hard heart?'' 
</P>
<P>
	No candidate does, of course. But labels beget labels.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bush speech offers a general description of what his chosen  
label means. ``It is conservative to cut taxes,'' he says. ``It is 
compassionate to help people save and give and build.'' 
Conservative to reform welfare, compassionate to encourage charity. 
Conservative to set standards for education, compassionate to make 
sure no child is left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Bond, former Republican national chairman, sees significant  
differences behind the rhetorical skirmishing about compassion and 
conservatism. He wrote in ``Newsday'' that Bush and other leading 
Republican governors are the compassionate conservatives, open to 
innovative solutions, pragmatic and consensus-based. On the other 
side, he said, are ``Beltway conservatives ... dogmatic, unyielding 
and too often polarizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This may be all a political word game, or it may lead to a  
meaningful debate about governing philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the C word, or perhaps CC, for compassionate  
conservative, is part of the campaign now. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a winning slogan for Bush back home. It is his keynote  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``And on this ground I'll take my stand,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Controversial 'Buffy' Finale Airing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The season finale of ``Buffy the Vampire  
Slayer,'' yanked last month by WB because of scenes of high school 
violence, will air July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to delay the episode, the conclusion of a two-part  
finale, was both praised and condemned, said Jamie Kellner, the TV 
network's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we erred, it was on the side of caution,'' Kellner said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode was to have been shown May 25, a month after the  
shootings at Colorado's Columbine High School that left 15 people 
dead. The ``Buffy'' finale also would have coincided with thousands 
of school graduations nationwide, WB noted. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fantasy drama, a solar eclipse turns a town's mayor into  
a serpent who attacks students during graduation. The youngsters 
defend themselves with stakes, bows, arrows and other implements. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Buffy, a teen-ager who teams with  
vampire Angel (David Boreanaz) to fight the forces of evil.

<HEADLINE> Helms Says Holbrooke Approval Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After nine months without a U.S. ambassador to  
the United Nations, the Senate is close to confirming veteran 
diplomat Richard Holbrooke for the post, the Foreign Relations 
Committee chairman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke ``probably will be confirmed in a week or so,'' said  
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., whom some Holbrooke supporters had feared 
would block his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms made the remark on the Senate floor while urging that  
payment of U.S. debts to the United Nations be tied to a plan to 
reform the world body and cut its budget. He noted approvingly that 
Holbrooke ``strongly favors the reform of the United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton named Holbrooke, whose work helped bring peace  
to Bosnia, as his choice for the post a year ago. Bill Richardson 
left the job to become energy secretary in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton held up the formal nomination until February, while  
the departments of State and Justice investigated whether Holbrooke 
had violated conflict-of-interest laws. Holbrooke paid a $5,000 
Justice Department fine for blurring his public and private roles 
during a trip to South Korea, but denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had complained that Helms was slow to schedule  
confirmation hearings, arguing that the Kosovo crisis and other 
foreign policy concerns made it critical that the post be filled 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	When the hearings began Thursday, Holbrooke's contrite testimony  
seemed to soothe some senators' concerns. Only Helms offered strong 
criticism on the ethics questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms had blocked several previous Clinton appointments and was  
considered the greatest obstacle for Holbrooke's confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Brian Atwood, who headed the U.S. foreign aid agency for six  
years, withdrew his nomination to be ambassador to Brazil on May 18 
because of Helms' opposition. In 1997, Helms killed the nomination 
of former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld to be ambassador to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 10 Republicans on the Foreign Relations Committee,  
including Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, a former chairman, have 
expressed support for Holbrooke's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the eight committee Democrats has expressed  
reservations, so only two Republicans need to back Holbrooke to 
send his nomination to the full Senate. Two more days of hearings 
are scheduled next week before the committee votes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Republicans leaning toward supporting him, Sen. Bill  
Frist of Tennessee, said after the hearing that he was impressed by 
Holbrooke's contrition. Sens. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Gordon Smith 
of Oregon and Paul Coverdell of Georgia also are expected to 
support the nomination.

<HEADLINE> Free Dental Care Given to Retarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It started in 1993 when doctors wanted to pull all  
the teeth of Rosemary Kennedy, the elderly retarded sister of 
President Kennedy who has been in an institution for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Rosemary's sister and guardian, stepped  
in and instead took her to see Massachusetts dentist Dr. Steven 
Perlman, a specialist in working with disabled children. Perlman 
performed a root canal and other restorative work without pulling 
any teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Angered by her sister's plight, the founder of the Special  
Olympics started an international program to help the retarded get 
better dental care, beginning with an offer of free dental care for 
the games' 20,000 athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Mrs. Shriver) said to me, `I spent my whole life to improve  
quality of life for people with mental retardation, but I never 
thought about oral health,''' said Perlman, co-founder of the 
``Special Olympics, Special Smiles'' effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Perlman and dozens of other volunteer dentists will offer  
screenings to more than 2,000 Special Olympics athletes attending 
events on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort, now in its sixth year, is intended to raise  
awareness about inadequate dental care for the nation's 7.5 million 
retarded citizens, Perlman said. This summer, 20,000 athletes in 25 
cities will be offered care. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem, he said, is that many retarded patients  
rely on Medicaid, which in some states doesn't cover dental care. 
In other states where federal programs cover checkups, 
reimbursements are so low that dentists are unwilling to accept 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Some dentists are uncomfortable treating mentally disabled  
people, who often need more time, emotional attention and special 
accommodations for wheelchairs or other equipment. Retarded 
patients can also become terrified during dental procedures and 
require anesthesia or other accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's those people who need regular dental checkups the most,  
Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The retarded often suffer from overbites or underbites and  
experience seizures and grimacing, which can cause teeth grinding, 
and some cannot brush or floss their own teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonverbal patients who suffer chronic tooth pain sometimes  
resort to hitting their own teeth or banging their faces and heads 
against walls before a caregiver figures out what is wrong, Perlman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are no statistics on how many retarded Americans  
regularly visit the dentist, The Arc, a Texas-based national 
advocacy group for the disabled, called the problem a ``priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Davis, a spokeswoman for the group, said she often  
receives reports from families who can't find dentists willing to 
see retarded children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see people with pretty bad teeth, both institutionalized or  
even living with their families,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with health concerns, good dental care is a matter of good  
self-esteem for millions of mildly retarded people able to hold 
down jobs and live independently, Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the efforts to get (the mildly retarded) into the  
community and workforce, it's even more crucial,'' he said. 
``People don't want to get served with someone with terrible breath 
and bad oral hygiene.''

<HEADLINE> Dad Must Do Service Elsewhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The man who abducted his two  
daughters 20 years ago, starting a new life for his family under 
assumed names, may have to find another place to work off his 
court-ordered community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The state asked Stephen Fagan, who admitted kidnapping his  
daughters from their mother in Massachusetts, to stop working at a 
veterans hospital after former Florida Gov. Claude Kirk complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason why we vets, and I'm one of them, have to be  
subjected to a con man, crook, gigolo, doing anything for us,'' 
said Kirk. ``It's just an insult to have anybody assigned to that 
kind of work for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After pleading guilty to kidnapping last month, Fagan, 57, was  
sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to perform 2,000 
hours of community service at the Department of Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials planned to ask a judge in Massachusetts to  
specify the work be done some place other than the medical center, 
said Debbie Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the state Department of 
Corrections.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Want One More Trip to Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals will be the last  
time the Buffalo Sabres play in Marine Midland Arena this season. 
If they lose, it'll be their last game of the season, period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres arrived home today facing elimination for the first  
time this postseason. They must beat the Dallas Stars on Saturday 
night to send the series back to Reunion Arena for Game 7 on 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lay it all on the line, then come back here for  
Game 7,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca said following a 2-0 loss 
Thursday night that put Buffalo into a win-or-else mode. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Brian Holzinger pointed out that the Sabres won Game 4  
after falling behind in the series 2-1. They also won Game 2 of 
their second-round series against Boston after losing the opener; 
that was the only other time they've trailed this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``We responded once before and we'll respond once more,''  
Holzinger said. ``I think we're upbeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of 15 teams that have lost Game 5 of a 2-2 finals  
rebounded to win the championship. It hasn't happened since the 
Montreal Canadiens did it in 1971. None of the last four teams even 
stretched the series to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing Buffalo has going for it is an 8-1 record on home ice  
this postseason. The Sabres have won 14 of their last 16 there, 
counting the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident team in our building,'' Ruff said. ``Our  
players believe they'll be back here for Game 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo never led Game 5, but the Sabres were within a shot of  
tying until the final 4:39. They've either been ahead, tied or down 
by one for all but 5:05 of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out really good in the first period, they took it to  
us for a while in the second, and in the third they must've iced it 
10-12 times to relieve pressure,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominik Hasek kept the Sabres in the game with terrific  
goaltending, but he was beaten by Darryl Sydor on a second-period 
power play and by Pat Verbeek in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Belfour, Dallas' less-heralded goalie, didn't have to make as  
many tough saves, but nonetheless stopped every shot he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	He caught bullets from Jay McKee and Geoff Sanderson, got lucky  
when a shot deflected just wide of the post, then went behind the 
net to make a save when the puck came off the boards. Shortly 
thereafter, Belfour let a rebound squirt away, but dived on it 
before any Sabres arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the third period, we let it all hang out,'' Ruff said. ``We  
weren't generating a lot of quality chances, but we did have a 
couple of truly good ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotions of the game -- and series -- spilled over several  
times in the final minutes, beginning when a fan threw a foil 
Stanley Cup into the Sabres bench following Verbeek's goal with 
4:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Ruff and Stars coach Ken Hitchcock shouted at each  
other, and the game ended with Buffalo's Rhett Warrener and Dallas' 
Derian Hatcher tangling on the ice as time expired. Each was 
assessed a roughing penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener had his right ankle put in a cast for precautionary  
reasons. He was to be re-examined in Buffalo today.

	Senate OKs Steel, Oil, Gas Loans  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved a $1.5  
billion loan package Friday to help tide over U.S. steel, oil and 
natural gas producers until their industries' prices recover. The 
63-34 vote to send the measure to the House sets the stage for a 
second showdown in the Senate next week on ways to help domestic 
steel producers hit by low-priced imports. The Senate is to take up 
a controversial bill Tuesday establishing steel quotas. The U.S. 
steel industry praised the bill's passage but said the measure 
would not end their woes. The industry wants comprehensive quotas 
on foreign steel shipments.

	G-7 Debt Relief Deal Reached

<P>
	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- French President Jacques Chirac said the  
Group of Seven leaders signed a ``generous'' debt relief agreement 
Friday. Chirac called the deal ``a substantial and very important 
effort'' by the world's richest nations to forgive debt owed by the 
poorest. He said in recent years, overall aid from most of the 
Group of Seven nations had steadily dropped, with the exception of 
France and Japan. At British Prime Minister Tony Blair's 
insistence, text was added whereby private creditors will be 
invited to also forgive debt, Chirac said. The United States had 
objected to including the private sector.

	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega Corp. is cutting 450 jobs, or 10 percent  
of its workforce, as it struggles to recover from sluggish sales of 
its computer storage products and the loss of top managers. Iomega 
said Friday it will lose 5 cents to 10 cents a share in the current 
financial quarter, excluding a restructuring charge, compared to 
analysts' expectations of zero profits. A year earlier, the company 
lost 13 cents a share.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Passengers who were stranded on the runway at  
Detroit Metropolitan Airport during a January snowstorm can join 
forces against Northwest Airlines in a class-action lawsuit, a 
judge ruled Friday. The ruling allows about 8,000 passengers -- who 
in some cases were trapped on airplanes for more than eight hours 
Jan. 3 -- to join four lawsuits already filed. Friday's ruling came 
one day after the Air Transport Association announced it adopted a 
voluntary passengers' Bill of Rights.

	Study Backs Betting Age of 21

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and state leaders must confront a  
compulsive gambling problem that has grown with the spread of 
casinos, slot machines and lotteries, a federal study panel said 
Friday. Members of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, 
concluding two years of work, unanimously recommended a nationwide 
minimum age of 21 to place bets and less advertising by state 
lotteries. Other recommendations passed on divided votes, including 
a ban on collegiate sports betting and restrictions on campaign 
donations by the gambling industry.

<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- The forecast for the usually sunny  
Caribbean is gloomy, at least for the vital tourism industry that 
most islands depend on. With new competition turning up every year, 
tourism industry leaders at this week's Caribbean Hotel 
Association's conference in the Bahamas say their best-case 
projections show no growth, with declines possible in many areas. 
``The brand called the Caribbean will continue to see a loss of 
market share from North America, unless something else is done to 
market this brand,'' said Robert Lawrence, vice president of Go-Go 
Worldwide Vacations.

	Misplaced Comma Costs Lockheed $70M

	LONDON (AP) -- A comma in the wrong place of a sales contract  
cost Lockheed Martin Corp. $70 million, The Financial Times 
reported Friday. An international contract for the U.S.-based 
aerospace group's C-130J Hercules had the comma misplaced by one 
decimal point in the equation that adjusted the sales price for 
changes to the inflation rate, the newspaper said. In Europe, 
commas are used instead of periods to mark decimal points. It was a 
mistake, the newspaper quoted James A. Blackwell, president of 
Lockheed's aeronautics division as saying. But the customer held 
them to the price.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Suspension Ends Aug. 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's suspension from baseball  
will run through Aug. 11, commissioner Bud Selig said Friday in a 
decision that allows the outfielder to return for the season's 
final 7 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's suspension will total 120 days, retroactive to his  
April 14 arrest in Tampa, Fla. Selig had suspended Strawberry 
indefinitely on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy there may be a light at the end of the tunnel  
for Darryl,'' New York Yankees manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Strawberry, who has repeatedly found himself in  
alcohol, drug and tax trouble since 1987, could return slightly 
sooner, with Selig saying he will review the situation July 22 
because of ``mitigating health factors.'' He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people had second, third chances. Why not him?''  
Yankees designated hitter Chili Davis said. ``Steve Howe had 29,000 
chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his ailing left knee, Strawberry will need several  
weeks in the minor leagues to rehabilitate, meaning the best-case 
scenario is probably a return to the majors sometime around Sept. 
1, when active rosters expand from 25 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we come together again remains to be seen,'' Torre  
said. ``We're not going to know anything until he's ready and we 
see what our situation is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who served a 90-day suspension in 1995 after testing  
positive for cocaine, was slated to be a left-field candidate 
before his arrest. He hit .247 with 24 homers and 57 RBIs last 
year, his best season since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees broke camp before the start of the season, he  
remained at their Tampa training complex because he had not yet 
recovered from colon cancer surgery last fall, an illness that 
caused him to miss the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Some argued that chemotherapy may have caused a depression that  
led to a drug relapse. Others in baseball wanted Strawberry 
suspended for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good decision,'' Yankees pitcher David Cone,  
Strawberry's closest friend on the team, said in the clubhouse 
after the decision was announced. ``If he walks through that door, 
I'll be the first one to shake his hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who last spoke with Strawberry 3-4 weeks ago, said it was  
too early to assess Strawberry's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what he's been doing,'' Torre said. ``A lot of it  
has to do with how much he's been working out. ... He's still going 
to need (minor league) games before he's ready for games. He's 
going to need a few weeks of games because he's not going to be 
able to play every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors for the players' association and the commissioner's  
office had worked on a joint recommendation to Selig on how he 
should proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who served a 90-day suspension in 1995 after testing  
positive for cocaine, pleaded no contest to cocaine possession and 
solicitation charges and was sentenced to 18 months' probation and 
100 hours' community service. 
</P>
<P>
	He also must undergo more drug treatment, be tested twice a week  
and pay $456 in court fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy who had gone through cancer and chemotherapy,  
and who also had done a lot of good the last three years,'' Cone 
said. ``I think that given this decision, that was taken into 
account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry may make it back to Yankee Stadium because New York  
has used five left fielders this year without finding much offense: 
Chad Curtis (.223, 13 RBIs), Shane Spencer (.203, five RBIs), Ricky 
Ledee (.200, five RBIs), Tony Tarasco (.167, three RBIs) and Clay 
Bellinger (.120, no RBIs).

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects School-Shooting Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- In some initial stories about the  
shootings at Columbine High School on April 20, The Associated 
Press quoted a youth who identified himself as Bob Sapin and said 
he was a student at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone using that name telephoned a Denver television station  
during the siege, saying that he had seen the gunmen in the school 
and that he was hiding in bushes outside. However, school records 
show no one by that name was registered as a student at the school, 
according to Marilyn Saltzman, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County 
School District.

<P>
	Showers soaked most of Florida on Friday while rain also  
dampened parts of the Northeast, the Northwest and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Steady rain and scattered thunderstorms hit south Florida,  
through the Keys as well as in the Tampa Bay area. Clouds covered 
parts of central and southern Georgia, as well as along the coast 
of the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Overcast skies were also seen in Maine through New Hampshire and  
eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut. Mostly 
cloudy to partly cloudy skies were found in far west New England 
and eastern New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Some moderate rain fell on Maine and New Hampshire.  
</P>
<P>
	Partly cloudy skies otherwise covered the Northeast states and  
through the upper Ohio Valley. Elsewhere in the eastern third of 
the nation, skies were mainly clear to occasionally partly cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
	A mass of clouds extended from lower North Dakota and Minnesota  
to eastern South Dakota, into Nebraska, middle Kansas, western and 
central Oklahoma, as west Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate to heavy rain was found in northeastern South Dakota  
and in south-central Kansas to northwestern Oklahoma. The storms 
were moving east, bringing some scattered showers to southwest 
Minnesota as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of Nebraska were seeing light to moderate areas of rain.  
Farther south, some clouds, widely scattered showers and 
thundershowers were pushing into the deep south regions of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Other areas of the central United States were fair to partly  
cloudy, including northeastern Texas, much of Louisiana, Arkansas 
and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front sliding toward the upper Rockies was bringing  
clouds to eastern Washington through northwestern Montana. Areas of 
rain were found in this same region, with some heavy storms in near 
the northern Montana-Idaho border. A few scattered clouds were 
found in central and southern Idaho, into southeastern Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Others were rolling into central Montana, with a trough east of  
the Rockies. More clouds were also present over the Cascades into 
the northwest coast of California, thanks to an on shore flow of 
moisture. A few showers were also occurring in western Washington 
and northwestern Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the West, a trough near east New Mexico was  
generating clouds and widely scattered showers in the southern 
regions of this state, as well as into far western Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the West was mainly dry and fair, with the exception  
of low clouds and fog clinging to the central and southern coast of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Some record low temperatures were set because of a broad  
Canadian high presusre system. They include 43 in South Bend, Ind., 
which broke the old record of 46 set in 1960 and 46 in Springfield, 
Ill., which broke the low of 51 set in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, temperatures around the continental United States  
ranged from 30 in Bradford, Pa., to 95 in Phoenix. The highest heat

<HEADLINE> Mich. Congressman, Party at Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The walls of John Dingell's House office are  
lined with hunter's trophies -- a boar's head, elk antlers, a deer 
head. Intermingled are the pictures of the Michigan congressman 
with his political allies. 
</P>
<P>
	One photo shows Dingell and his fellow Democrat Bill Clinton on  
a duck hunting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	On many issues the president and the congressman are allies. But  
on the House showdown over gun control, Dingell's choice was clear: 
He broke with the president and sided with his longtime friends in 
the National Rifle Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A former NRA board member, Dingell successfully led a movement  
to water down gun-control legislation in the House that managed to 
anger Democratic colleagues. In the end, Democrats rallied Friday 
to help defeat the gun bill, principally because they objected to 
the Dingell amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	From Germany where he was attending an economic summit, Clinton  
denounced the vote on the Dingell amendment as ``a great victory 
for the NRA but it was a great defeat for the safety of our 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-year-old Dingell is the senior House Democrat, first  
elected in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	On health care he worked closely with Clinton in the  
unsuccessful effort to pass sweeping legislation to expand 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	But gun control was a different matter. House Democratic leader  
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., privately urged Dingell not to offer his 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is he's the senior Democrat, and he carried with  
him probably two dozen Democrats he gave cover to.,'' said Rep. 
James Moran, D-Va. ``Maybe the public will catch on that Democrats 
were four-to-one for the kind of gun control the public wants, but 
through no thanks to John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell, 72, brushes aside his close NRA ties, saying he merely  
did what he felt was right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our purpose (in Congress) is not to harass or delay or to  
inconvenience the law-abiding citizens,'' the congressman said, 
adding that his constituents ``would have none of this nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 Dingell hunts frequently and is a strong opponent  
of gun control but he also is a liberal voter on social issues and 
loves the ballet and classical music. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned a reputation as a dogged pursuer of government waste  
and fraud as chairman of the Commerce Committee's oversight 
subcommittee before Republicans took control of the House. Dingell 
often used his dry wit to sting opponents, and his critics have 
called him intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year House veteran has served with every president since  
Dwight Eisenhower and seen the passage of such landmark legislation 
as Medicare, which he pushed for, and the Clean Air Act, which he 
is accused of stalling. 
</P>
<P>
	His big game trophies include the head of a 500-pound wild boar  
that he is said to have felled with a pistol as it charged him 
during a hunting trip in Soviet Georgia some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In another office picture, Dingell is shaking hands with Clinton  
in a formal setting during the president's first term in office. 
Clinton scrawled at the bottom: ``With thanks for helping me get 
here and helping me do what I fought the election for.''

<HEADLINE> Finale Setting Up Nicely for Canes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- This year's trip to Omaha is working out as  
well as Miami coach Jim Morris could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the Hurricanes beat Alabama 5-2 Thursday to reach the  
College World Series championship game. Then, Florida State beat 
Stanford 8-6 to force a rematch between those schools today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to play 17 innings ... and then come back with  
another 17-inning game, that's OK with me,'' Morris said Thursday 
after Miami (49-13) eliminated the Crimson Tide (53-16). 
</P>
<P>
	While the Seminoles (56-13) and Cardinal (50-14) determine who  
advances to the final, the Hurricanes can relax. Morris has his top 
starter, Alex Santos, and No. 2 man, David Gil, both available for 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either way, I think we're in a pretty good position,'' Morris  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's victory gave one of the nation's perennial contenders a  
chance to win the championship that has eluded Morris, the only 
coach to bring his team to Omaha in each of his first six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes were one out away in 1996, losing 9-8 on a  
ninth-inning home run by LSU's Warren Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very excited to be back in the national championship  
game, and I'm glad Warren Morris is not playing,'' the Miami coach 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Beating the Crimson Tide was big for another reason, too. Lale  
Esquivel wanted to send Alabama home, and he did it with a double 
off the center-field wall in the fifth, driving in two runs for a 
5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	When Esquivel reached second, he stood on the bag, yelled with  
excitement and pumped his fists. As a sophomore, he played at 
Alabama, but transferred for reasons he wouldn't discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on a mission because I went to Alabama and it didn't  
work out, so I was trying to knock them out of the tourney,'' 
Esquivel said. ``I saw some good pitches and they fell in for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes have gone unbeaten in eight postseason games by  
getting timely hitting and defense. During losses to Miami, Alabama 
was 0-for-14 with runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really didn't give us a whole lot of opportunities,''  
Crimson Tide coach Jim Wells said. ``We got by hitting well all 
season, and we just didn't have enough this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami has solid pitching, too. Right-hander Darryl Roque (5-1)  
went five innings before turning it over to setup man Vince 
Vazquez. Closer Michael Neu earned his 15th save by getting two 
ninth-inning strikeouts and a forceout. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secret to us is our bullpen,'' Morris said. ``I believe in  
our setup guy and our closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State went to reliever Zach Diaz (4-1), and the  
Seminoles also got a towering two-run homer from designated hitter 
Sam Scott to cap a four-run sixth against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz faced 14 batters in 4 1-3 innings. While he had just one  
strikeout, he threw effectively and retired six in a row at one 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to say I was getting ahead early, but that didn't  
happen a lot of the time,'' Diaz said. ``I was just trying to throw 
a lot of fastballs. Fortunately when they did hit it hard, it was 
at someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State came back from a 6-2 deficit, tying it on Scott's  
shot into the right-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just looking for something,'' Scott said. ``I wanted to  
hit the ball hard and just get it up in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinal brought the tying run to the plate in the bottom of  
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz walked leadoff hitter John Gall, then got Joe Borchard to  
foul out. Josh Hochgesang popped out to first and Damien Alvarado 
to grounded to second for the force, ending the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any time you're dealing with young men, age 18 to 22,  
the emotions are a roller coaster,'' Florida State coach Mike 
Martin said. ``Gosh, we're one game from playing for the whole 
enchilada. So yes, I think we were a little bit moody when we were 
down four runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinch-hitter Karl Jernigan put the Seminoles ahead for good in  
the seventh. With no outs and runners on first and third, he hit 
into a double play that brought in Brett Groves, who led off with a 
double. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Diaz, Zach's brother, added a double off the center-field  
wall to score Marshall McDougall from first, making it 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying to come inside,'' Matt Diaz said. ``I was  
thankful for that because I was looking for a fastball. I hit it 
good, but I didn't think it was going out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a change, Florida State is sticking around Omaha a while.  
The Seminoles have made 18 trips to the College World Series, but 
it's just the sixth time they've won more than twice. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also Florida State's longest stay since 1989. Four times  
during the 1990s, the Seminoles had a 1-2 record and twice they 
went 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame we can't enjoy this for a long period of time,''  
Martin said. ``That was obviously a great win for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's rematch features two right-handers. Stanford ace Jason  
Young (12-3) goes against Florida State's Jon McDonald (9-3), who 
allowed eight hits and five earned runs in a second-round loss to 
the Cardinal.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: NRA Wins in House Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House narrowly voted  
to loosen restrictions on sales at gun shows, handing a victory to 
the National Rifle Association in the wake of a spate of school 
shootings. President Clinton conceded momentary defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked today if the NRA beat him, Clinton snapped: ``They did.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 218-211 vote, he added, ``was a great victory for the NRA  
but it was a great defeat for the safety of our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno concurred, saying the vote is ``a  
very big step backwards.'' and ``incomprehensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House already was talking of veto, should the  
provision remain in the final compromise bill passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``isn't interested in signing into law any NRA-sponsored  
legislation that opens more loopholes than it closes,'' his 
spokesman, Joe Lockhart, told reporters today. The fight will begin 
Saturday in the president's radio address, Lockhart added. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the measure said it would help restore the rights  
of law-abiding citizens, but Clinton accused them of squeaking the 
legislation through ``in the dead of night'' when the average 
American might not notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``So one more time, the Congress of the United States ... said,  
'We don't care what's necessary to protect our children. We can't 
possibly bear to make anyone in the NRA mad,''' Clinton said 
bitterly in a morning-after exchange with reporters in Cologne, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The House vote took place Thursday at midnight on an amendment  
sponsored by the chamber's most senior Democrat, Rep. John Dingell 
of Michigan, to a juvenile crime bill being crafted in response to 
recent high school shooting sprees in Colorado and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The House began its daylight proceedings today by approving,  
311-115, an amendment by Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., requiring safety 
locks to be sold with all handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from conforming to the Senate-passed gun restrictions,  
Dingell's provision would cover even fewer gun shows than current 
law. In addition, the amendment would give the government only 24 
hours to complete background checks, rather than the three days 
that is now the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The House rejected a Senate provision requiring background  
checks at gun shows, regardless of their size or the number of guns 
sold. The proposal by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., lost 235-193. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, whose husband was shot to death on a Long Island,  
N.Y., commuter train, was near tears as she addressed the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we were supposed to be doing tonight was trying to serve  
the American people,'' who in polls following the April 20 
Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colo., decisively 
favored more gun control, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dingell said her proposal would have allowed government too  
great a role over the private lives of gun owners, required 
background checks of buyers who purchase firearms at flea markets 
and driven gun shows out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go beyond this is simply to harass innocent, law-abiding  
citizens and to hurt people who love to go to gun shows,'' Dingell, 
a former NRA board member, told the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who is attending a world economic conference in  
Cologne, Germany, said, ``Instead of closing the deadly gun-show 
loophole, the House of Representatives voted in the dead of night 
to let criminals keep buying guns at gun shows. This vote will not 
stand the light of day. I will keep working until Congress stands 
up to the gun lobby and makes the commonsense measures passed by 
the Senate the law of the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the House voted to permit the Ten Commandments to be  
posted in schools and state public facilities, a provision that 
supporters said would help promote morality. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he applauds the intent behind that amendment, but  
believes the measure invites a court challenge. He said he would 
speak to lawmakers about ``another option'' he didn't specify that 
would avoid imposing one religion on students. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes marked the House's opening shots at juvenile violence  
in the politically volatile period between a spate of school 
shootings and an election year. The task is particularly weighty 
for House Republicans, who are defending their narrowest majority -- 
six seats -- since the GOP's historic takeover of Congress in 1995.

<P>
	Democrats chanted ``six seats, six seats!'' as the vote on  
Dingell's amendment was tallied. But the chief GOP vote wrangler, 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, wasn't listening. After days 
lobbying his colleagues, his eyes stayed locked on the vote board, 
which lists the names of lawmakers and the votes as they cast them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell had promised 38 Democrats would support his amendment.  
But when DeLay realized seven additional Democrats were voting yes, 
the Texan slapped his hands together once, turned toward the back 
of the chamber and pumped his fist back and forth in victory.

	Democrats refused to give up.

	``We are whipped, but we're not down,'' Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,  
D-Texas, said on her way back to the Capitol this morning, just a 
few hours after the House recessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the House today approved several measures that bring its  
juvenile justice bill closer to the Senate's. 
</P>
<P>
	Members approved amendments banning the import of large-capacity  
clips and magazines; permitting retired and former law enforcement 
officers to carry concealed weapons; prohibiting those under 18 
from possessing semiautomatic assault weapons; requiring background 
checks on those who try to reclaim their pawned guns after a year; 
allowing District of Columbia citizens with no criminal history to 
possess loaded handguns in their homes; and imposing a lifetime 
ownership ban on those who committed ``violent acts of juvenile 
delinquency.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Aims at Bush on Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore took direct aim at  
George W. Bush on Friday, accusing the Texas governor of being soft 
on gun control for signing a bill limiting cities' ability to sue 
firearms manufacturers and dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes are too high for any presidential candidate to  
stand on the sidelines'' of the gun-control debate, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore never mentioned Bush by name, but his reference to the  
Texas bill was an unmistakable shot at the leading Republican 
presidential contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's political aides dispatched California Assembly Speaker  
Antonio Villaraigosa to introduce the vice president and tell the 
audience and news media about the new Texas bill, which Bush signed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That might fly in Texas, but it's not going to fly in  
California,'' Villaraigosa told hundreds of students and Democratic 
activists at a high school. The crowd roared in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign asked Villaraigosa ``to carry that message as  
much as possible'' to California audiences, said the speaker's 
spokeswoman, Elena Stern. Gore trailed Bush in a Los Angeles Times 
poll of California voters released this week, 49-44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some want to pass new protections for gun manufacturers to  
protect the gun manufacturers against lawsuits from cities who want 
to protect their citizens,'' Gore said. ``I will fight for new 
protections for families, to get guns off the streets, out of the 
schools and away from criminals and away from the hands of 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said the law  
is meant to discourage frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president must suffer from a sense of misplaced  
responsibility, because as a matter of sound public policy, 
Governor Bush does not believe the manufacturer of a legal product 
should be held responsible for the criminal misuse of that 
product,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill Bush signed prohibits Texas governmental units --  
including cities and counties -- from suing firearm or ammunition 
makers or sellers for damages related to lawful manufacturing or 
sales to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's remarks came the same day the House killed a gun-control  
bill that would have imposed some new restrictions. The vice 
president called the House vote ``a step in the wrong direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the Congress doing?'' he demanded, departing from his  
prepared speech. ``Why don't they just wake up and respond to what 
the American people want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore presented a package of gun-control measures he supports,  
including raising the age for handgun possession from 18 to 21; 
barring juveniles from possessing assault weapons or large-capacity 
ammunition clips; imposing new penalties for adults who sell guns 
to minors; and requiring safety locks on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's speech and town-hall forum with the  
students came on the third day of his national tour officially 
announcing his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	His rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, former New  
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, was holding his own forum in nearby 
Glendale during a 10-day campaign swing through California. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, toured a cancer center and held  
a roundtable discussion with breast cancer survivors and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley planned to deliver his own speech on gun control late  
Friday night. On Thursday, he called for requiring background 
checks at gun shows and banning ``junk'' handguns as ways to combat 
firearms-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's forum was more scripted than Bradley's have been this  
week, but the famously reserved vice president appeared loose, 
shedding his suit coat and mixing with the audience before and 
after the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	He took questions from young people, some of whose names and  
stories he knew in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	One questioner, Jesse Funes, broke down in tears as she called  
for stiffer laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination. Gore's 
wife introduced Funes by name, and when Funes lost her composure, 
Gore strode from the podium to give her a hug and kiss her 
forehead.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Buys Avon, Morrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Moving to shore up its recovering HarperCollins  
publishing house, News Corp. is buying Avon Books and William 
Morrow &AMP; Co. from Hearst Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest sign of health for HarperCollins, which has  
turned itself around from a dire situation two years ago. Financial 
terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Friedman, who came as president of HarperCollins in late  
1997, said that some consolidation of the acquired houses was 
inevitable, but she said it was too early to say what form it would 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all seen this industry shrinking as publishers  
consolidate, and we need two things: economies of scale and market 
share,'' Friedman said in an interview. ``They have a fantastic 
roster of authors that we felt would really complement what we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avon is known for its successul mass-market paperbacks and  
children's books, and will join HaperCollins' stable of children's 
titles including works by the artist Maurice Sendak and the late 
Shel Silverstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrow publishes hardcover and trade paperbacks, representing  
authors like Sidney Sheldon, Faye Kellerman, and Cokie Roberts. 
They will join HarperCollins authors such as Barbara Kingsolver, 
Tony Hillerman and Wally Lamb. Morrow will also beef up 
HarperCollins' line of cookbooks with authors like TV cook Emeril 
Lagasse. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Avon and Morrow publish some 1,000 books each year and  
have a combined backlist of nearly 6,000 titles. They had operated 
together as the book publishing division of Hearst Corp., a major 
privately held media company with interests in television, 
newspapers, radio and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marked the latest merger in the U.S. publishing  
industry as companies seek to cut costs and gain market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann bought the  
biggest U.S. book publisher, Random House, from Advance 
Publications, for a price estimated by analysts at between $1.1 
billion and $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelsmann also bought Bantam Books in 1977 and owns Doubleday,  
Dell-Delacorte and Broadway Books. Also last year, Viacom Inc. sold 
the educational, professional and reference divisions of Simon &AMP; 
Schuster to the British media group Pearson for $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	HarperCollins has been coming back from a devastating period two  
years ago, when it took a $270 million charge against earnings, 
slashed more than 100 book contracts and laid off staff as it 
struggled to cope with a massive backlog of unsold books. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Friedman came on board, the company has bounced back with  
a big upswing in profits and 34 books on the New York Times 
bestseller list last year, including ``The Divine Secrets of the 
Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' by Rebecca Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine months ending in March, HarperCollins' operating  
profits rose 60 percent on a revenue increase of 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tests Military Planes for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- U.S military aircraft will be Y2K compliant and  
will be able to ``fly, fight and win on Jan. 1 and beyond,'' 
according to an officer overseeing exercises at Nellis Air Force 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Paul Avella, manager of Y2K Flag, said no surprises  
have been found in the four-day exercise, which ended Thursday. Y2K 
Flag is a major military exercise intended to assess the Air 
Force's ability to fight and win in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	For three years, the Defense Department has been preparing for  
any computer glitches that might be encountered at the turn of the 
century, Avella said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Various aircraft were tested on the sprawling Nellis Air Force  
Range to determine if their complex computer systems are Y2K 
compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Avella said no surprises were found in the mix of aircraft  
tested. U-2 and E-8C ``sensor'' surveillance craft communicated 
successfully, and B-2, F-117 stealth fighter, F-16 and F-15 
aircraft responded to targets during a simiulated change of the 
calendar from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Assessments also were made in anticipation of potential  
airstrikes on Feb. 29 during a leap year, which occurs every fourth 
year and will occur in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Avella said potential problems include readings of calendar  
dates on aircraft and pilot communications. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid potential problems on Dec. 31 through Jan. 1 and on  
Feb. 29, dates can be reprogrammed. In the case of ground-based 
communications, vital equipment such as what Avella called a 
mission planning system can be fixed or ``patched'' through 
computer programming to function properly on those days. 
</P>
<P>
	Two F-15s participating in the Y2K Flag were injured, neither  
seriously, when their planes crashed Tuesday. The cause is under 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Swindler Told To Repay $12 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A businessman was ordered Friday to repay  
$12 million he swindled from Christian groups by telling them 
profits from an investment scheme would be used to build churches 
and educate the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Strawder, the 26-year-old founder of Sovereign  
Ministries International, also got five years in state prison, but 
the term will be served concurrently with a five-year federal 
sentence he received last week. 
</P>
<P>
	With his clean-cut good looks and his knowledge of the Bible,  
Strawder persuaded at least 2,200 church groups and individuals to 
entrust their money to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawder promised to invest in offshore trading programs he said  
would yield as much as 600 percent a year. Investors also were told 
profits would build churches in Kenya and Poland and pay for poor 
students to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture was instead a Ponzi scheme, in which early investors  
are paid with money from new investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawder bought himself several sports cars, a boat and real  
estate.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Drop / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks dropped slightly late today when  
caution ahead of an upcoming international summit in Germany took 
the steam out of a morning rally. The dollar slipped against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average edged down 39.19  
points, or 0.22 percent, to close at 17,431.26. On Thursday, the 
index gained 260.27, or 1.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.32 yen, down 0.72 yen from late Thursday  
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 119.25 yen overnight. 
The greenback ranged between 119.27 yen and 119.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices rose early today on bullish  
sentiment boosted by gains in U.S. stocks, but fell in the 
afternoon as investors took profits before the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants were cautious before the summit of leaders from the  
Group of Eight nations in Germany this weekend, though traders 
expect no major surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	However, market sentiment is still good amid hopes that the  
economy has hit bottom, said analysts. Big overseas financial 
institutions are expected to remain active buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may take some time ... but the key index could try the  
18,000 level as early as next week,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general 
manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks were strengthened earlier today by results in New  
York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.68 points on 
Thursday to close at 10,841.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks there were boosted by remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who indicated to Congress that only a 
modest interest rate rise may be in order to keep inflation tamed. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was down 2.88 points, or 
0.21 percent, to 1,396.29. The TOPIX finished up 16.00 points, or 
1.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 694.99 million shares, down from 703.87 million shares 
Thursday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 617 to 572, while 
131 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Softbank, Japan's leading wholesaler of personal  
computer software, soared on Tuesday's news that Softbank and the 
U.S. National Association of Securities Dealers agreed to set up a 
computerized securities market in Japan, traders said. Also, an 
overnight rise in the Nasdaq index in New York contributed to the 
rally, a dealer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Fujitsu continued to post record highs following  
Thursday's announcement of a major alliance with German electronics 
giant Siemens AG for the production of personal computers in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar rose slightly early in the  
session on strong remarks from Japanese officials, then eased back 
down on selling by U.S. funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of further market intervention by the Bank of Japan  
following its aggressive dollar-buying operation earlier this week, 
however, were expected to kept the U.S. currency from falling much 
further, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister for international affairs at  
Japan's Finance Ministry, said the government would do what it 
could to prevent a slide in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``A premature yen strengthening before recovery is unwelcome,''  
he said. ``We will take decisive action if needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.73 yen, down  
from 123.90 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7500 percent today after finishing Thursday with a 
yield of 1.7250 percent, pushing its price down to 97.18 yen from 
97.22 yen a day earlier.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Backs College Gambling Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The NCAA supports a proposed ban on  
betting on college sports events, even as it acknowledged legal 
bookmakers' help in catching point shavers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the game should be watched for the spontaneous  
action and reaction on the field, not for the point spread,'' Bill 
Saum, the organization's director of agent and gambling activities, 
said in a conference call Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saum also renewed the NCAA's call for media outlets to stop  
publishing point spreads on college games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the media publishes point spreads in any state other than  
Nevada, it encourages illegal sports betting,'' he said. ``We at 
the national office are not going to give in on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada gambling officials have said that a ban on college sports  
betting would be a severe financial blow to the state's 142 
licensed sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only that, it would have a tremendous impact -- on the  
positive side -- for the illegal bookmaking industry,'' Joe Lupo, 
sports book director at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas, said on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's statements came in response to a report issued by the  
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, following a two-year 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes the proposed ban on betting on college games  
and also calls on the NCAA to organize research on the effects of 
gambling on young people. 
</P>
<P>
	That proposal will be presented to the NCAA Research Committee  
in July, Saum said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA also supports three other recommendations in the  
gambling report, Saum said. They include a national minimum 
gambling age of 21, a continued ban on Internet gambling and harsh 
penalties for underage gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA athletes and college athletic officials are already  
prohibited from betting on college or pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, there's nothing to prohibit them from going to a  
casino,'' Saum said. ``But we don't encourage that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saum acknowledged that legal Las Vegas bookmakers had helped the  
NCAA and law-enforcement officials investigate a 1994 point-shaving 
scandal involving Arizona State basketball players. But, he said, 
legalizing betting on college sports nationally -- in hopes of 
providing a policing mechanism -- isn't the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't stop the action of sports bribery,'' he said.  
``You look at that Arizona State case, and all the money was laid 
on the legal side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saum also acknowledged that nothing would stop all gambling on  
college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``One way we keep our sanity around here is that we admit we're  
not going to solve the problem. It's not going to go away,'' he 
said. ``But we're trying to have a dramatic effect on those who 
wish to wager, and a dramatic effect on any individual who may even 
think about point shaving.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Delays Air Passenger Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are putting off a vote on airline  
passenger rights legislation, but with the caveat that they would 
reapply the pressure if the industry fails to follow through on 
promises to improve customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines industry on Thursday announced a package of  
voluntary measures, including promises to inform customers of the 
lowest fare, provide prompt ticket refunds and notify passengers of 
known delays and cancellations, in response to growing consumer 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``All airlines need to do a better job of ensuring that  
passengers have a satisfying flight and that is exactly what this 
plan will do,'' said Gerald Greenwald, chairman and CEO of United 
Airlines and chairman of the Air Transport Association Executive 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and the administration both proposed tough passenger  
rights bills earlier this year after the House and Senate held 
hearings in which passengers related personal horror stories of 
being trapped on runways for hours or in airports for days without 
adequate food and information. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, warning that new Washington-imposed rules could  
force up ticket prices, agreed to instead come up with its own 
plan. It took two months of negotiations with the Transportation 
Department and Congress, and some issues, including congressional 
demands the airlines notify passengers of overbooking, were left 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he supported the  
voluntary approach, but ``if they fail to honor their commitments, 
if they delay implementation, or if service deteriorates in the 
future, then the prospect of a mandated solution will grow even 
greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., who had  
sponsored a passenger rights bill with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., 
endorsed the industry plan but said he would seek legislation 
requiring the Transportation Department's inspector general to 
review industry compliance with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater agreed that ``the  
voluntary promises will be welcomed, but real performance will be 
closely monitored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in conjunction with the industry plan, the  
department was acting to double to $2,500 the minimum liability 
limits on lost, damaged and delayed baggage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said he would still try to advance his bill because the  
industry had failed to agree on such issues as overbooking, 
divulging all the fares on a flight or redeeming frequent flier 
miles. ``This voluntary program consists mostly of stuff they are 
already required to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., also said he was  
skeptical of the industry promises and would continue to seek 
legislation. ``Poor service, shabby treatment and misinformation 
will continue unless competition is restored.''

<P>
	But with McCain and House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud  
Shuster, R-Pa., both giving qualified support to the industry plan, 
it was unlikely that the two Democrats would succeed in moving 
their legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Ruden of the American Society of Travel Agents said he was  
concerned that the industry, by promising to give the lowest 
available fare over each airline's telephone reservation system, 
was trying to induce customers to deal directly with them rather 
than through travel agents, which now handle 80 percent of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, Amtrak revealed its plan to win back the  
hearts of disgruntled rail passengers. It includes training and 
incentives for all 24,000 employees, enhanced food-service options 
and improved onboard amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is also guaranteeing refund vouchers for future travel to  
any dissatisfied passenger.

<HEADLINE> Kuralt Widow Backs Out of Radio Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Charles Kuralt's widow has backed out of  
plans to give Minnesota Public Radio two stations that belonged to 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	MPR is trying to sort out why Suzanna Kuralt instead sold the  
Ely stations to a group of investors for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Mrs. Kuralt had prepared a statement saying  
the gift of the stations to MPR would fulfill her husband's goal of 
bringing a top station to Ely, a town on the edge of the wilderness 
that he discovered when he canoed in the area in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuralt estate's attorney refused to comment on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kuralt, however, did pledge $5,000 to the network in  
appreciation of its ``broadcasting excellence.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Tears Down Sinking Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- As Mark Kuonen watched demolition crews  
break apart the sinking homes on his block, it felt as if something 
fundamental was being torn away. 
</P>
<P>
	``My American dream is going down with that house,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	City and state officials have promised to compensate Kuonen and  
six other families on Hegerman Street who were ordered from their 
sinking houses a week ago. The homes, located in a neighborhood 
flanked by factories and warehouses, were built in the 1920s over 
old creek beds that were filled with a layer of ash up to 21 feet 
deep in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents complained for years about the shifting buildings. The  
city buttressed several homes, but determined two months ago that 
the problem had worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	The site was inspected this week to determine whether city sewer  
work in 1996 hastened erosion there. Mayor Edward G. Rendell said 
he decided there was enough likelihood that the city might have 
contributed to the problem ``that I gave the residents the benefit 
of the doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the families will receive the fair market value of their  
houses, compensation for the stress of the hasty move and payment 
for any damage done to their furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are our citizens,'' Rendell said. ``They did nothing  
wrong here. We are going to try to make them whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement brought some relief to grim-faced residents who  
watched crews with sledgehammers, pry bars and electric saws begin 
demolishing seven of the homes on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a little bit more hope,'' said Dolores Washburn, who  
along with her husband and son were among the families ordered out. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no experience like it, lying in bed on that first  
night thinking, `My God, I'm homeless,''' Mrs. Washburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners near Hegerman Street could face the same fate. City  
officials are checking cracks in many structures, including the 
home of Diane McDowell, 45, who lives three doors away. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't say this property is condemned. We are just  
waiting for that,'' Mrs. McDowell said. ``Every time someone comes 
to the door, we jump.''

<HEADLINE> Six Cities Vie for 2006 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- With films, celebrities and  
impassioned entreaties, six European cities took their best shots 
today at winning the 2006 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will be selected Saturday by secret ballot among  
International Olympic Committee members after a 15-member committee 
narrows the bidders down to two finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first site selection since the Salt Lake City  
vote-buying scandal broke six months ago, plunging the IOC into the 
worst crisis of its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City won the 2002 Games in a landslide in 1995, but it  
has been disclosed that the bid committee spent more than $1 
million in cash, gifts and other inducements for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	After that came to light, 10 IOC members were expelled or  
resigned, the two top officials of the Salt Lake organizing 
committee were ousted, and state and federal agencies began an 
ongoing investigation of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal also brought a change in IOC rules that prevented  
members from visiting or having virtually any contact with the 
would-be host cities -- Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; 
Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Turin, Italy; Sion, Switzerland; and 
Zakopane, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	That might give an edge to Sion, which played host to more than  
60 IOC members in an unsuccessful attempt to win the 2002 games. 
Sion backers say they have improved their bid this time. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sion might also have a handicap -- resentment by some IOC  
members over the role of Switzerland's Marc Hodler in blowing the 
whistle on Olympic corruption last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalized by the rules change in January that prevented visits  
by IOC members, the cities resorted instead to mailing brochures 
and video cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, they each made one final pitch in hour-long presentations  
to the 89 members attending the 109th general assembly of the IOC 
in South Korea's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt opened with a challenge to the IOC to ``make  
history'' by holding the 2002 games in three nations that were 
traditional enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Klagenfurt would conduct the games at venues in Austria,  
Slovenia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The election of Klagenfurt will do more than open a new  
chapter in Olympic history, it will demonstrate the ideals of the 
Olympic camp -- three countries united through peace in sport,'' 
said the city's mayor, Harald Scheucher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to show the world that former enemies have become  
friends forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zakopane introduced a touch of humor. Its presentation featured  
a performer who used putty, a sock, bread rolls and a hot water 
bottle to turn himself into a caricature of IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly didn't know how to react, but broke into laughs  
when the performer used a makeup sponge, a stocking and pantyhose 
to turn himself into a likeness of former Polish sprinter Irena 
Szewinska, one of Zakopane's delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Szewinska took the lectern and told the delegates: ``We  
Poles, we like to make jokes, but our bid is absolutely serious, as 
serious as our sport achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helsinki, which lacks mountains high enough for Alpine events  
and proposes to share the games with Lillehammer, Norway, was 
making its sixth bid for the winter games. Its organizing chief, 
Martin Saarikangas, pleaded with the delegates to finally reward 
the Finnish city. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions have been raised about the three-hour travel time by  
air and rail between Helsinki and Lillehammer, but Saarikangas said 
the ``distance is great only if you intend to walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sion, Poprad-Tatry and Turin, seen by many as the No. 2 choice  
behind Sion, were to make their final presentations later today, 
then join delegates from the other three cities in waiting for 
Saturday's decision.

<HEADLINE> Auditors Cite Missing IRS Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing inadequate records, congressional  
auditors said they were unable to substantiate claims made in 
high-profile Senate hearings of IRS misconduct, including 
retaliation against employee whistleblowers and taxpayers viewed as 
uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican senator who chaired last year's Finance Committee  
hearings, William Roth of Delaware, said the General Accounting 
Office report released Friday raises ``serious concern'' because 
the Internal Revenue Service did not keep adequate records in any 
of these areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lack of necessary information and systemic breakdowns in  
record-keeping and reporting procedures make it all but impossible 
to track and verify most of the cases'' referred by the committee, 
Roth said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said the agency is already  
instituting more accountability, new employee performance measures 
based on taxpayer satisfaction and a better system of tracking 
misconduct allegations. Most of these actions were required by a 
1998 reform law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly cannot undo what happened in the past, but we can  
take concrete actions today and in the future to ensure that it is 
not repeated,'' Rossotti said. ``In the end, we will have a tax 
agency that does a far better job of serving taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roth requested the audit after witnesses appearing before the  
committee he chairs made several allegations against the IRS, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
	--The agency retaliated against employee whistleblowers and  
taxpayers who were considered uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agency executives got preferential treatment in disciplinary  
cases, such as being allowed to retire before action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	--IRS agents reduced or eliminated some tax bills and increased  
others for reasons other than the merit of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	--There was racial discrimination at the IRS Midwest District  
Office in Milwaukee, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO auditors repeatedly cited ``limited and incomplete data''  
for their inability to substantiate most of the allegations and 
found insufficient evidence to support most cases specifically 
referred by the Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On the whistleblower claims, the audit did find that IRS  
employees brought 108 reprisal claims from 1995 through 1997 with 
two independent agencies -- the Office of Special Counsel and the 
Merit Systems Protection Board. The former found in favor of the 
employees in four of 63 cases, while the latter dismissed most of 
its 45 claims and settled many of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit could not determine the extent of alleged abuse of  
taxpayers or retaliation by IRS agents. The agency's systems, GAO 
found, could not distinguish between those claims and allegations 
not involving taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, however, noted that previous internal IRS reports have  
found ``significant problems concerning abuses in the collections 
process and problems with illegal use of enforcement statistics'' 
in measuring employee performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``A majority of IRS employees share the perception that  
allegations like these have merit,'' Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the Midwest District Office discrimination claims, the  
GAO said IRS acknowledged past ``problems in hiring and promotion'' 
and that a new district director appears committed to resolving 
those problems.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Report Paints Dark Portrait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and state leaders must confront a  
compulsive gambling problem that has grown with the spread of 
casinos, slot machines and lotteries, a federal study panel said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission,  
concluding two years of work, urged Americans to assess the pros 
and cons of the various forms of legal gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come too far, too fast,'' said commissioner Richard  
Leone, a gambling critic who drafted many of the report's strongest 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairwoman Kay James, a gambling opponent who guided the  
commission's pro- and anti-gambling members to a consensus on the 
report's overall tone, said legal betting has created thousands of 
jobs but has brought troubling consequences to millions of 
gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm deeply disturbed by the impact of gambling on individuals,  
on families and on communities, '' James said as the commission 
submitted its report to Congress, the White House, state governors 
and tribal leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against  
Legalized Gambling, said the report ``will act like the surgeon 
general's 1964 report on smoking and health -- a wake-up call for 
America on the dangers of gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But commissioners disagreed on government's role. While  
supporting the report's emphasis on compulsive gambling, 
commissioner William Bible, a former casino regulator in Nevada, 
said that ``each individual, and not the government, is best able 
to decide ... about engaging in gambling for recreation and 
entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Created by Congress in 1996 and given a $5 million budget, the  
commission held 250 hours of hearings throughout the country, 
commissioned studies and heard from hundreds of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the overall report, most of the commission's 76  
recommendations generated unanimous support, including a nationwide 
minimum age of 21 to place bets (up from 18 in some states) and 
less advertising by state lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recommendations passed on divided votes, including a ban  
on collegiate sports betting and restrictions on campaign donations 
by the gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most controversial decision, the commission voted 5-4 to  
include a sentence urging governments to consider imposing ``an 
explicit moratorium'' on further expansion of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest recommendations are aimed at curbing state  
lotteries and forms of ``convenience gambling'' like slot machines 
and video poker terminals in neighborhood stores. Casino resorts, 
to which people must travel, were treated kindly by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	``While this report is not without its faults, it definitely  
draws a favorable distinction between commercial casinos and other 
segments of the gaming industry,'' said Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., 
president of the American Gaming Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners found common ground in concluding ``that a  
serious pathological gambling problem exists and that it must be 
addressed aggressively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Opinion Research Center reported earlier this year  
that 2.5 million American adults are ``pathological,'' or 
clinically addicted, gamblers; another 3 million are ``problem'' 
gamblers; and 15 million are ``at risk'' of developing a gambling 
problem. The National Research Council estimated that 1.1 million 
teenagers also are pathological gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	History places steep odds against the report producing real  
change. Another federal commission more than 20 years ago offered 
nearly two dozen recommendations, but few were enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	But James and other commissioners said the report is less a  
blueprint for legislation than a starting point for conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to commend the report to the American people,'' James  
said. ``Let the dialogue begin.''

<HEADLINE> Errors Cited in Chicago Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Officers violated department policy during two  
traffic stops earlier this month that ended in fatal shootings of 
blacks, the city's police superintendent says. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Thursday over the shouts of angry protesters, Police  
Superintendent Terry Hillard told a city council committee that a 
preliminary investigation shows the June 4 death of 26-year-old 
LaTanya Haggerty happened after four officers ignored an order to 
stop pursuing a car that had fled a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggerty, 26-year-old a computer analyst, was a passenger in the  
car, and was shot after an officer mistook her cellular phone for a 
gun, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the supervisor gives a direct order to stop a chase, it  
should be stopped -- period,'' Hillard told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other incident, Northwestern University football player  
Robert Russ, 22, was shot June 5 after police say he grabbed an 
officer's weapon pointed inside his car after a chase. Hillard said 
that an officer had acted improperly in that case by using a lug 
wrench to knock out a window in Russ' car. 
</P>
<P>
	The five officers have been served with allegations of violating  
department policy, Hillard said. 
</P>
<P>
	In both shootings, both the victims and officers who fired were  
black. The cases have raised questions about how the race of 
suspects may be a factor in tense situations, even when the 
officers themselves are black. 
</P>
<P>
	That issue was raised by some aldermen on Thursday after  
Hillard's remarks failed to satisfy them. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderman Dorothy Tillman noted that while Russ was fatally shot,  
a white man who crashed his car into a state office building last 
week, claiming to have a bomb, was taken into custody unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillard acknowledged that the shootings have strained ``bonds of  
trust and confidence'' but said there is no racial pattern to 
police abuse in the city.

	LONDON (AP) -- The stage set used for Agatha Christie's ``The  
Mousetrap,'' the world's longest-running play, was bought at a 
charity auction Friday for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	A new set will be in place for Monday's performance, which will

<HEADLINE> Indian Tribe Builds Drug Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) -- An Indian tribe that has made a  
fortune from casino gambling has quietly built a profitable 
sideline business in mail-order prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	As gamblers feed quarters into the slot machines at the Foxwoods  
Resort Casino, a half-dozen pharmacists in white coats work nearby 
on tribal land, filling pill bottles bound for patients all over 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal regulations, Indian tribes recognized by the  
government can buy prescription drugs at a deep discount and resell 
them. As a result, Mashantucket Pequot Indians can undercut HMOs 
and pharmacy chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Started 10 years ago as a small health service for members of  
the tribe and their employees, the Pequot Pharmaceutical Network 
today is a $15 million business, handling 250,000 prescriptions 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 million people are enrolled in the network, and its  
customers include General Dynamics, Connecticut College, AAA 
Connecticut Motor Club and about 40 other Indian tribes around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the state of Connecticut, looking to cut its pharmaceutical  
expenditures for 85,000 elderly and disabled Medicaid patients, is 
considering becoming a customer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we met with the Pequots, they described their purchasing  
power,'' said Michael Starkowski, deputy commissioner of the 
Department of Social Services. ``They described to us a pricing 
schedule that would be 40 to 50 percent less than what we would be 
paying otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pequots refused to disclose profit figures and insisted they  
are not looking to put independent pharmacies or national chains 
like Walgreen or Rite Aid out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet industry executives are jittery. Mark Grayson, a spokesman  
for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said 
his organization fears the government has given the Pequots an 
unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe that the federal supply schedule can be  
utilized in this way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelly Carter, spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Indian  
Affairs, said the Pequots' use of the discount is perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's why the Indians have the edge: Drug manufacturers, in an  
effort to capture market share, created different price schedules 
for different customers. Hospitals typically get a lower price than 
drug store chains. As the biggest consumer of pharmaceuticals in 
the world, the federal government gets the lowest price of all. 
Indian tribes are entitled to the same discount the government 
gets. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Indian tribes also obtain cheap prescription drugs for  
their reservation health centers. But the Pequots are the first to 
set up a health care business that extends beyond their 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pequots get the government discount only for prescription  
drugs that go to people on federal assistance, such as Medicaid. 
For all other patients, the Pequots pay the HMO rate for drugs, 
which is still cheaper than what drug store chains pay. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the Pequots are not allowed to charge the patients on  
federal assistance a markup on the drugs. They make a profit by 
imposing a handling fee of about $9 per prescription. The Pequots' 
other customers can be charged a markup. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of the Pequots' business is in mail-order  
prescriptions that are shipped directly from the reservation to 
patients, most of whom have chronic conditions, like diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe also has a pharmacy on the reservation that serves  
about 600 tribal members and about 13,000 employees. And it has 
alliances with 35,000 pharmacies across the country, enabling 
patients to go to drug stores to pick up some prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the tribe performs claims processing for large  
employers and has customer service representatives and pharmacists 
on call nearly 24 hours a day to answer questions and check patient 
histories for allergies or drug interactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're focused mainly on discrete populations that are  
homebound, the elderly poor, for example,'' said Matt Uustal, 
president of the network. ``We think we give them a competitive 
price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven J. Valiquette, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read in New  
York, said mail-order is one of the fastest-growing market 
segments. He said small pharmacies are more likely to suffer than 
large chains. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole prescription drug pie is growing 5 to 6 percent  
annually, and the independents are the ones who are losing,'' he 
said. ``Mail-order is just lower overhead overall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe's main source of revenue remains its casino. Though  
the tribe will not divulge profits, it reports its slot machine 
take to the state, which keeps 25 percent. With slot revenue 
topping $600 million in 1998, the state's share exceeded $150 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Although pharmaceuticals may seem like an odd side business, the  
tribe has a long history in health care, said Marjorie Colebut, a 
tribal member and former nurse who leads the network's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that many in the tribe are descendants of shamans, or  
medicine people, and that the tribe's current medicine woman, named 
Laughing Woman, holds a revered position on the Council of Elders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Health care is something that we normally do. It is a part of  
our culture,'' Ms. Colebut said. ``It just comes naturally for 
us.''

<HEADLINE> `Star Wars' Goes Digital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The new ``Star Wars'' became the first major  
movie to be shown to the public Friday using a digital projector, a 
piece of equipment that doesn't use film reels or any celluloid at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	The showing received a general thumbs up, but some viewers found  
the image didn't match the quality of old-fashioned film. 
</P>
<P>
	Computers and a digital projector replaced the big platters of  
35 mm film as ``Star Wars Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was 
screened at a handful of theaters in Los Angeles and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans were enthusiastic at a showing at a Pacific Theatres screen  
in the San Fernando Valley, where the digital version will have a 
month-long test run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture was crystal clear, the sound. It was like you're  
actually in it when the lightsaber battles, the pod races, 
everything. It was fantastic,'' said Jonathan Carras, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the best picture quality I've ever seen of any film  
I've ever seen,'' said Roger Kraemer, 44. ``There are no scratches, 
no spots, no nothing. I mean, it's just basically a perfect 
picture, and it's just gorgeous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Professionals were more critical.  
</P>
<P>
	The image had flaws due to missing computer data, and the  
movement was marred by a sort of ultrafast jitteriness known as 
``crawl,'' said Ted Fay, director of technology at Santa Monica 
Studios, which has worked on movies such as ``The General's 
Daughter'' and ``Godzilla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was this sort of crawliness to the image that isn't  
natural and is distracting,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps people will grow accustomed to it,'' he added. ``I'd  
take 35 (millimeter) hands down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many flaws were from the film itself rather than the digital  
process, said Steven A. Morley of Qualcomm Inc., a San Diego firm 
that worked with CineComm of Beverly Hills to create the digital 
system used for the ``Star Wars'' rollout. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital picture is so sharp that such flaws show up clearly,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, 35 mm film is screened via a movie projector --  
technology that has essentially changed little since Edison's 
Kinetoscope in 1891. The digital system is closer to the way images 
are transferred for video conferencing or over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital movies can be distributed to theaters by satellite, over  
fiber-optic cable or on special discs. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a film opening in a few major cities and then moving  
to smaller locations, a satellite could beam it to thousands of 
theaters at once. If different sound tracks are provided, a theater 
could switch languages between showings. 
</P>
<P>
	And the movie itself never will scratch or wear out.  
</P>
<P>
	For ``Star Wars,'' a 35 mm film print was converted to  
electronic information on a digital tape, which then was 
transferred into an array of 18 computer hard drives. The data then 
went to a digital projector, which created a screen image by 
bouncing light off special computer chips containing more than 1 
million microscopic mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawback for such a system is the equipment cost, estimated  
at $80,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	However Robert Lemer, senior vice president of CineComm, said  
the company plans to supply the system for free and make money by 
charging exhibitors a fee per showing. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that digital equipment will start going into  
theaters in 16 to 18 months, with ``a couple thousand'' installed 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the launch of digital cinema. It's the future,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Sentenced in Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former Justice Department attorney was sentenced  
Friday to more than seven years in prison for laundering drug money 
for a Colombian cocaine kingpin. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Abbell, who will remain free pending an appeal, was  
convicted of transferring money from Cali cartel leader Miguel 
Rodriguez Orejuela to jailed cartel members and their families to 
ensure their loyalty and silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbell, 58, headed the Justice Department's effort to extradite  
Colombian drug smugglers before becoming their attorney more than a 
dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching sides after 17 years at Justice, he brought to the  
Cali group an intricate knowledge of the U.S. legal system. The 
now-defunct cartel made about $40 million a month shipping cocaine 
into this country from 1983 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbell and co-defendant William Moran, a lawyer, were convicted  
in July of conspiracy to commit racketeering and laundering drug 
money. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler threw out the 
racketeering convictions last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was closely watched by the legal profession because of  
its implications for other lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the lawyers went beyond just zealously  
representing their clients and actually took part in their crimes 
by transferring money to jailed cartel members and their families. 
They also claimed the two knew their legal fees were paid with drug 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said Moran and Abbell may have acted  
unethically, but they in no way helped the cartel run its drug 
smuggling business. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbell's attorneys contended the money he received from  
Rodriguez was no different from the fees any attorney would receive 
from a client for legal services. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal advice Abbell gave his client was all within the realm  
of a lawyer's duties, his attorneys argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no requirement that a lawyer stand on the courthouse  
steps with a megaphone and announce that he just got money from 
Miguel Rodriguez,'' said his attorney, Scott Srebnick. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran, a lawyer for 31 years, was sentenced last week to five  
years on the laundering conviction. He bolted from court a year 
ago, when he heard his jury had reached a verdict, and was on the 
lam for two months before his arrest in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 indictment named 59 people, including six lawyers, in a  
top-to-bottom attack on the Cali cartel. Four lawyers pleaded 
guilty to lesser charges and agreed to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the lawyers, including Abbell, had worked for Justice.

	BELLA VISTA, Ark. (AP) -- Twelve golfers started with a 5:30 a.m.  
tee time in Nebraska and holed the last putt at sunset in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, they got in nine holes in Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and  
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Watson and his playing partner of more than 30 years in  
Mount Ayr, Iowa, Lynn Rinehart, plotted Thursday's trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Their group is called ``Jay-Lynn-O Tours.'' Previously, the men  
played in five states in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of no other fellow that could have pulled it off, and  
Lynn did 90 percent of it,'' Watson said. ``He spent hour, after 
hour, after hour, for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The golfers split into three foursomes and played a two-man  
scramble throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	They began their trek at Tregaron Golf Course in Bellevue, Neb.  
</P>
<P>
	``We got out there about 4:30 and had a little prayer gathering  
where a golfing minister from Omaha came out,'' Rinehart said. ``It 
was about 48 degrees when we teed off at 5:30. All in all, it's 
been great. We met lots of people who love the same game we love, 
and that's what it's all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A short drive to Carter Lake, Iowa, took them to Shoreline Golf  
Course. Next, they hopped on a charter plane, which took them to 
Joplin (Mo.) Regional Airport. From there, they drove to Baxter 
Springs Country Club in Baxter Springs, Kan., to tee it up just 
before noon. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, they drove to Grove, Okla., to take on Patricia  
Island Golf Club. They played Elk River Golf Course in Noel, Mo., 
before driving to Bella Vista where they played Berksdale golf 
course. Their last tee time was 7:02 p.m. and the final foursome 
was only three minutes late. 
</P>

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Two-time world figure skating champion Alexei  
Yagudin has escaped suspension by the Russian Figure Skating 
Association for his boorish behavior while in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Yagudin was put on probation for a year, with a warning  
that similar antics will result in a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old was thrown off the Champions on Ice Tour last  
month in Denver after cursing a member of the media. Previously, he 
had made off-color remarks to a security guard at an ice-show in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid speculation the teen-ager had a drinking problem, he was  
sent back to Russia and examined by doctors, who said the behavior 
could not be blamed on heavy drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Russian federation, Valentin Piseyev, said  
Yagudin expressed regret for his behavior and said it wouldn't 
happen again.

	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Now that Maurice Greene beat Donovan  
Bailey's world record at 100 meters, a showdown between the two 
would be a major event. 
</P>
<P>
	But, it's not likely to happen at next month's Pan Am Games in  
Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, coming back from a torn Achilles' tendon, plans on  
running in the July 23-Aug. 8 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's representatives said Friday, however, that it's  
unlikely he will run in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other lucrative European track meets during the same  
period as the Pan Am Games, which will feature about 5,000 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's 100-meter time of 9.79 seconds in Athens this week

	RIMINI, Italy (AP) -- Marco Pantani, banned from this year's Tour  
of Italy for failing a blood test, said Friday he also had 
unusually high levels of red blood cells in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed that on a three-week stay in the mountains of  
Colombia, where he had been road racing. 
</P>
<P>
	After his return from South America, he broke a leg in a spill  
in the Milan-Turin race and his blood was tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani's team, Marcatone Uno, said the cyclist also was in the  
mountains before the next-to-last stage of the Tour of Italy. He 
again showed high levels of red blood cells and was kicked out of 
the race with victory only a day away. 
</P>
<P>
	The high count can signal the use of the banned EPO, but also  
can occur naturally.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Again Pushing Comp Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans say comp-time legislation  
should be part of the coming showdown over boosting the minimum 
wage, but Democrats say that would be a ``poison pill'' designed to 
kill the wage hike. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP lawmakers on Thursday renewed a push to let workers choose  
time off instead of overtime pay. The measure would make it easier 
for employees to pick compensatory time off -- 1 1/2 hours for every 
hour of overtime work -- rather than time-and-a-half overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed such a bill in 1996 because of concerns  
that employers could discriminate against workers who choose money 
instead of time off. Senate Democrats filibustered the measure in 
the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Working parents, especially moms, need flexible working hours to  
help balance the demands of their jobs with the needs of their 
families, said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., the bill's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft said he has made changes to make the measure more  
palatable to Democrats. The bill sets up an 80-hour, two-week 
schedule, but unlike past proposals, it sets a 50-hour limit for 
any given workweek. Unused time off would be converted to cash at 
the end of each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft and Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., one of more than 30  
co-sponsors, said the approaching debate over boosting the minimum 
wage is an ideal setting for another attempt to pass comp-time 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, led by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep.  
David Bonior of Michigan, are pushing to phase in over two years a 
$1 increase in the minimum wage, to $6.15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The last wage increase, 90 cents an hour, was implemented in two  
stages in 1996 and 1997. Republicans are facing potentially 
unstoppable demands for another increase and House Majority Leader 
Dick Armey, R-Texas, conceded in April that Congress may act this 
year to raise the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's spokesman, Jim Manley, ruled out any compromise on the  
GOP measure, which he labeled ``an anti-labor poison pill.'' Even 
with the concessions, Manley said, employers could misuse it to 
undermine the traditional 40-hour workweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft, who was joined at a Capitol Hill news conference by  
Bond and Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and Michael Enzi, 
R-Wyo., said the option would be voluntary and optional for 
employees.

<HEADLINE> Widow of Skins' Late Owner Engaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marlene Ramallo Cooke, the colorful widow of  
former Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke and heir to a 
reported $20 million from his estate, is engaged to be married. 
</P>
<P>
	Anders Ulle, 27, proposed to the 46-year-old Ms. Cooke on  
Tuesday, according to Friday's editions of The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a wonderful person. He's got a wonderful family,'' the  
Bolivian-born Ms. Cooke said of her new fiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cooke had a first husband, before marrying Jack Kent Cooke  
twice. After Cooke learned in 1994 that his wife's divorce from 
another husband had not been finalized, he declared his first 
marriage to Ms. Cooke invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cooke is still fighting government efforts to deport her  
over her 1986 guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine. Last month, a federal judge said she could remain in the 
United States for at least four more months. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke died in April 1997 at age 84. The football team was sold  
last month by his estate for $800 million to Daniel Snyder, a 
34-year-old businessman.

<HEADLINE> Devils Sign Defensemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Embarrassed by two straight playoff  
failures, the New Jersey Devils began a facelift by saying goodbye 
to veterans Bobby Carpenter and Dave Andreychuk and signing an 
American defenseman who played in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Lou Lamoriello said Friday that the Devils would  
not offer either of the 35-year-old free agents a contract for next 
season, a decision that had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter, who spent six of his 18 seasons in New Jersey and was  
a member of the Devils' Stanley Cup championship team in 1995, 
would be considered for a coaching job in the organization if he 
was ready to retire, Lamoriello said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter did not immediately return a telephone call left at  
his home in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than to say it was multi-year, Lamoriello wouldn't  
disclose terms of a contract given defenseman Brian Rafalski, a 
former University of Wisconsin player from Allen Park, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafalski was second in scoring in the Finnish Elite League with  
19 goals and 34 assists with IFK Helsinki. Teemu Selanne played in 
that league before joining the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter, the first American player to score 50 goals in the  
NHL, has spent most of his time with the Devils as the center of 
their checking line and a penalty killer. He had two goals and 
eight assists in 56 regular-season games. He did not have a point 
in the Devils' seven-game first-round playoff loss to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the second straight year New Jersey had the best  
record in the Eastern Conference and lost in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreychuk, the leading goal scorer among active left wingers  
with 532, had 15 goals and 13 assists in 52 regular-season games. 
He scored two goals in the playoffs but played only four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamoriello said Carpenter was released because the Devils want  
to move Denis Pederson, 23, back to center. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Dave Andreychuk, we felt we wanted to go in a little  
different direction,'' said Lamoriello, who added the Devils will 
be looking to make other deals before next season.

<HEADLINE> Army Witches Raise Congressman's Ire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) -- Marcy Palmer paces in the shade of a  
post oak tree. Two dozen people listen as she teaches the tenets of 
an ancient religion: 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in the divinity of all things.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we are all of one life force.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we are one with nature.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Know thyself.''  
</P>
<P>
	Scenes like this have rankled one congressman and triggered a  
debate about religious freedom within the military. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Ms. Palmer is a witch, the high priestess of a  
group that practices Wicca at Fort Hood with the knowledge and 
approval of the U.S. Army. Most in her group are active-duty 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including some Christian groups and Rep. Bob Barr,  
R-Ga., say the Army's decision to permit Wiccan services at Fort 
Hood and four other posts is wrong. Barr tried unsuccessfully to 
attach a witchcraft-banning amendment to a Defense Department 
authorization bill last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it brings disrepute to the military and ought not to  
be allowed as something on par with the Judeo-Christian beliefs on 
which our country was founded,'' Barr told The Associated Press. 
``If in fact people want to practice this in their personal lives, 
that's one thing. But to allow it as a sanctified practice on 
military bases ... is nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such sentiments are rooted in fear and false notions that  
witches worship Satan or sacrifice animals, said David Oringderff, 
head of the San Antonio-based pagan group that sponsors Ms. 
Palmer's Fort Hood Open Circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no accounting for fear and bigotry,'' Oringderff said.  
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 50,000 Americans practice Wicca, a form of  
polytheistic nature worship. Its core ethical statement, the 
``Wiccan Rede,'' states that if ``it harm none, do what you will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Open Circle has been meeting at Fort Hood for about two  
years. Lt. Col. Benjamin Santos, Fort Hood's spokesman, said 
witches who were members of the Army submitted their request for a 
meeting place in mid-1997. It was approved by the chaplain's office 
at U.S. Army Forces Command headquarters in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has since sanctioned similar groups at Pensacola  
Naval Air Station in Florida, Fort Wainwright in Alaska, Fort Polk 
in Louisiana and Kadena Air Force Base on Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos said the Army's stance is simple: Identify soldiers'  
needs and serve them. That applies to spiritual needs as well as 
temporal needs served by six elementary schools, two commissaries 
and a bowling alley for the post's 71,500 residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The post has nine chapels, but, Santos said, ``For us it's not a  
religious issue. It's a quality-of-life issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are 92 chaplains among the 42,000 Fort Hood soldiers. The  
inch-thick chaplain handbook includes a five-page primer on Wicca, 
described as ``a reconstruction of the Nature worship of tribal 
Europe.'' It is sometimes referred to as druidism, paganism and 
witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Donald Troyer is the chaplain assigned as a liaison to  
the witches and to ensure the group complies with regulations. A 
Seventh-day Adventist, he has championed the group's right to 
exist, telling The Austin American-Statesman that ``we're 
responding to the First Amendment ... and we're glad to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The witches of Fort Hood meet at Camp Finlayson, a remote, hilly  
campground teeming with squirrels and birds. Despite the frequent 
rumble of low-flying Apache attack helicopters on training runs, 
the site feels peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
	They gather for ritual holidays, such as the summer solstice,  
and two evenings a week for ``classes'' led by Ms. Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	On this 90-degree Monday night, about 30 people attend.  
Three-fourths are in the Army, but only one -- a sergeant in an 
airborne unit -- is in uniform. Some wear pentagram necklaces. There 
are former Catholics, Mormons, Baptists and Presbyterians. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean, a 30-year-old former soldier who served in an artillery  
unit deployed to Kuwait several years ago, said witches were in the 
Army long before they were sanctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my particular unit we had several witches and we would all  
congregate in one room and discuss things,'' said Sean, who 
declined to give his last name. ``It helped us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sean, a deacon in the Open Circle, said the Army is ahead of  
society in its religious tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first sergeant was very much for it,'' he said of his  
faith. ``So was my chaplain. ... He even came out here a couple 
times to the circle and gave classes about his religion so we could 
all learn about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Palmer, a former military policewoman who now is a civilian  
Army hospital nurse, drills the class on Wiccan principles. She 
talks about the fine points of summoning spirits and how to design 
rituals. She discusses casting spells, by which Wiccans mean 
enlisting ``psychic energy'' to heal, protect or aid members in 
various endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	Such practices are forbidden by the Bible, according to those  
who want the Fort Hood covens curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 112 verses where God calls this not just sin but ...  
abomination,'' said the Rev. Jack Harvey, pastor of the Tabernacle 
Baptist Church in Killeen, just outside Fort Hood. 
</P>
<P>
	One verse he cites is Exodus 22:18: ``Thou shalt not suffer a  
witch to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God detests this,'' Harvey said. ``This is like homosexuality,  
which God also says is an abomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, 13 conservative religious groups, including  
the Christian Coalition with 2.1 million members, called on 
Christians to boycott joining or re-enlisting in the Army until 
witchcraft is banned on posts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Open Circle, some soldiers groaned at such criticism.  
Others called it an opportunity for witches to come out of hiding 
and to defend the rights of all religions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they deny our right to worship ... then everybody loses,''  
Ms. Palmer said.

<HEADLINE> Misplaced Comma Costs Lockheed $70M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A comma in the wrong place of a sales contract  
cost Lockheed Martin Corp. $70 million, The Financial Times 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An international contract for the U.S.-based aerospace group's  
C-130J Hercules had the comma misplaced by one decimal point in the 
equation that adjusted the sales price for changes to the inflation 
rate, the London-based newspaper said. In Europe, commas are used 
instead of periods to mark decimal points. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a mistake, the newspaper quoted James A. ``Micky''  
Blackwell, president of Lockheed's aeronautics division as saying. 
But the customer, who Lockheed refused to name, held them to the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	``That comma cost Lockheed $70 million,'' Blackwell was quoted  
as telling the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	James Fetig, a Lockheed spokesman, said Blackwell was describing  
the major elements of the C-130J cost increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blackwell indicated ... the inflation-related impacts,  
including the effects of the misplaced comma in one contract, 
accounted for $70 million of $275 million in reduced earnings 
outlook for the C-130J in 1999,'' Fetig said. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to elaborate. Last week, the company announced that  
launch failures and problems with the cargo plane and anti-missile 
programs have hurt their profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed has secured contracts from three countries outside of  
the United States -- Britain, Italy and Australia -- for its C-130J, 
the latest version of its Hercules air transportation aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Leader Addresses Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The son of Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad,  
who disbanded his father's group after finding it too militant, 
told a Jewish congregation Friday night that he felt ``very much at 
home in soul'' with them. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare address by a Muslim leader during a Jewish service,  
Imam W. Deen Muhammad visited the Temple Israel of Greater Miami to 
deliver his message of unity and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sacred day,'' Muhammad said in brief remarks near  
the end of Erev Shabbat services. ``I feel very much at home in 
soul with you. I feel your purity and your peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad, 65, heads the Society of Muslim Americans based in  
Chicago. He said Friday's appearance was the second time -- and the 
first in more than a decade -- that he has participated in Jewish 
Sabbath services. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 people attended Friday's service, including more than  
two dozen Muslims who mingled with temple members in the sanctuary 
and later for punch and sweets at a social. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Datko, a Temple Israel member, brought her 13-year-old  
son, Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they get older in Sunday school, they get to (studying)  
comparative religion,'' she said. ``This was a good opportunity to 
learn and not just take it out of a textbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elijah Muhammad led the Nation of Islam to prominence by  
preaching militant black nationalism. After his death in 1975, his 
son took over and soon disbanded the group upon rejecting racial 
separatism. 
</P>
<P>
	He since has worked to support interfaith dialogue between  
Muslims, Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Farrakhan revived the Nation of Islam in 1978 and has been  
criticized for driving a wedge between blacks and whites.

<HEADLINE> Congress Delays Air Passenger Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are putting off a vote on airline  
passenger rights legislation, but with the caveat that they would 
reapply the pressure if the industry fails to follow through on 
promises to improve customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines industry on Thursday announced a package of  
voluntary measures, including promises to inform customers of the 
lowest fare, provide prompt ticket refunds and notify passengers of 
known delays and cancellations, in response to growing consumer 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``All airlines need to do a better job of ensuring that  
passengers have a satisfying flight and that is exactly what this 
plan will do,'' said Gerald Greenwald, chairman and CEO of United 
Airlines and chairman of the Air Transport Association Executive 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and the administration both proposed tough passenger  
rights bills earlier this year after the House and Senate held 
hearings in which passengers related personal horror stories of 
being trapped on runways for hours or in airports for days without 
adequate food and information. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, warning that new Washington-imposed rules could  
force up ticket prices, agreed to instead come up with its own 
plan. It took two months of negotiations with the Transportation 
Department and Congress, and some issues, including congressional 
demands the airlines notify passengers of overbooking, were left 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he supported the  
voluntary approach, but ``if they fail to honor their commitments, 
if they delay implementation, or if service deteriorates in the 
future, then the prospect of a mandated solution will grow even 
greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., who had  
sponsored a passenger rights bill with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., 
endorsed the industry plan but said he would seek legislation 
requiring the Transportation Department's inspector general to 
review industry compliance with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater agreed that ``the  
voluntary promises will be welcomed, but real performance will be 
closely monitored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in conjunction with the industry plan, the  
department was acting to double to $2,500 the minimum liability 
limits on lost, damaged and delayed baggage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said he would still try to advance his bill because the  
industry had failed to agree on such issues as overbooking, 
divulging all the fares on a flight or redeeming frequent flier 
miles. ``This voluntary program consists mostly of stuff they are 
already required to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., also said he was  
skeptical of the industry promises and would continue to seek 
legislation. ``Poor service, shabby treatment and misinformation 
will continue unless competition is restored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with McCain and House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud  
Shuster, R-Pa., both giving qualified support to the industry plan, 
it was unlikely that the two Democrats would succeed in moving 
their legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Ruden of the American Society of Travel Agents said he was  
concerned that the industry, by promising to give the lowest 
available fare over each airline's telephone reservation system, 
was trying to induce customers to deal directly with them rather 
than through travel agents, which now handle 80 percent of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, Amtrak revealed its plan to win back the  
hearts of disgruntled rail passengers. It includes training and 
incentives for all 24,000 employees, enhanced food-service options 
and improved onboard amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is also guaranteeing refund vouchers for future travel to  
any dissatisfied passenger.

<HEADLINE> WTO in Bid To Unblock Leader Impasse </HEADLINE>

	GENEVA (AP) -- Faced with a growing need to take decisive action,  
World Trade Organization members met Friday in another fruitless 
attempt to unblock the appointment of a new director-general. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has been leaderless since Italy's Renato

can gain the organization's backing, while Asian countries say 
Supachai -- the frontrunner for many months -- is still a valid 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men insist they are still in the race and have no intention  
of backing down.

<HEADLINE> Youth Violence Summit Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Several black community groups are demanding their  
members boycott a summit on youth violence because it is being held 
on the same day as a celebration marking black history. 
</P>
<P>
	The statewide summit was initially planned for fall, but it was  
moved ahead to Saturday shortly after the Columbine massacre in 
which two student gunmen killed a dozen classmates, a teacher and 
themselves on April 20 at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gov. Bill Owens regretted the scheduling conflict with  
the black history celebration known as Juneteenth, the Columbine 
shootings made it important to hold the youth violence summit 
sooner, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black leaders are not pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely offensive,'' said Michael Hancock of the Urban  
League. ``To me it boils down to a sensitivity issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock would not say how many people would be involved in the  
boycott, which is supported by the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People and the Colorado Black Chamber of 
Commerce, among other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens noted that a lot of other events were scheduled for June  
19 as well. And he said 15 black ministers have encouraged their 
congregations to attend both events. Owens plans to visit both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look forward to Saturday as a time we can learn from one  
another, listening rather than talking,'' Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 people from across the state are expected to attend  
the day-long summit. Topics will include youth gangs, gun control 
legislation, parenting and school safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Two miles northeast of the college, about 140,000 people will  
gather for the 33rd annual Juneteenth celebration, a street fair 
featuring barbecue, arts and crafts and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The event is celebrated in numerous states, primarily in the  
South and Southeast.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Hoping For Second Open Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Payne Stewart had at least two good  
reasons to smile Friday after the second round of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He beat par for the second straight day on Pinehurst No. 2, a  
scrambling 1-under 69 that gave him a share of the lead and yet 
another chance to win his second Open. 
</P>
<P>
	And Lee Janzen was nowhere in sight.  
</P>
<P>
	For the fifth time in eight years, Stewart worked himself into  
contention in the U.S. Open after 36 holes. He has been the 
runner-up twice during that stretch, both times to Janzen, 
including last year at The Olympic Club. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Janzen narrowly made the cut at 147, Stewart made  
three crucial par saves over the final five holes to join David 
Duval and Phil Mickelson at 137. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you can go around and shoot under par at a U.S. Open,  
I don't care where we're playing, it's a good score,'' Stewart 
said. ``I'm proud of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart should know.  
</P>
<P>
	His only U.S. Open victory came in 1991 after an 18-hole playoff  
against Scott Simpson, but he has been in the hunt as much as 
anyone this decade. He led after 36 holes at Oakland Hills in 1996 
until a 76 in the third round knocked him down. He also led after 
three rounds at Olympic until Janzen closed with a 68 and Stewart 
stumbled to a 74. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have 36 holes to play -- I know that,'' Stewart said. ``And I  
know that I've got to take care of my business. I can't worry about 
what everyone else is doing. I have to go out and stick to my game 
plan, try to hit a lot of greens. And if I don't, I get it 
up-and-down and take my pars and go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart already has won on the PGA Tour this year, a one-stroke  
victory at Pebble Beach when the final round was canceled by rain. 
His last 72-hole victory was the Houston Open in 1995, when Scott 
Hoch fell apart on the closing holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Put Stewart in a U.S. Open, however, and he's a new man.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the reasons I do well at U.S. Opens is that I  
get a mind-set that par is a good score,'' he said. ``However I go 
about making par -- whether it's two beautiful shots and two putts, 
or two ugly shots, a chip and a nice putt -- I take my par and go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He could have used that strategy a year ago. With a four-stroke  
lead over Tom Lehman, and seven strokes ahead of Janzen at one 
point in the final round, Stewart made bogey on two of the last 
five holes to lose by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Old news, as far as Stewart is concerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about the way I'm playing,'' he said. ``I feel  
like I'm playing better this year at the U.S. Open than I played 
last year. I feel I've got more control over my golf game, over my 
swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic has always been known as a graveyard of champions. Ben  
Hogan lost to Jack Fleck in a playoff and never won another Open. 
Arnold Palmer squandered a seven-stroke lead to Billy Casper in 
1966, then lost in a playoff and never won another major. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Watson was on his way to winning the 1987 Open until Simpson  
birdied the 14th, 15th and 16th for a one-stroke victory. After 
that year, Watson went nine seasons before winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a two-time major winner, is determined not to be the  
next one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have crawled away and hid after that happened last  
year,'' he said. ``Or, I could build on what happened and the 
position I was in, and use it to strengthen myself. And that's the 
avenue I chose to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it's working.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Reportedly Gets Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders signed a  
contract extension Friday with the Dallas Cowboys reported to be 
worth $51 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited that we will once again have a player the  
caliber of Deion Sanders on the field for us this season,'' Cowboys 
owner Jerry Jones said in a statement Friday. ``Deion has rare 
football skills that opposing teams recognize and respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that the new deal saved  
the Cowboys roughly $1.4 million toward the NFL salary cap by 
lowering Sanders' base salary and giving him an up-front bonus -- 
putting the Cowboys close to $3 million under the 1999 cap of $57.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the deal gives ``the salary cap flexibility we will  
need in the coming weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, the highest-paid player in the league last season with  
a base salary of $5.8 million, had been expected to be paid $6.5 
million in base this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I have to prove anything,'' Sanders said. ``It  
wasn't like I was on a downward spiral. I just have to go out there 
and keep doing what I've been doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came up as Jones, reeling from salary-cap problems and  
Sanders' nagging toe injury, said Thursday he had agreed to the new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't know if he's going to play at the level we'd  
like for him to,'' Jones said. ``But when I look at what our 
alternatives are and when I look at what he can bring to the table 
for our team this year, it's worth the risk.''

<HEADLINE> Art Showcases Post-Apartheid Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 23-foot mural, ``First Time Voters,'' takes  
up an entire wall in the National Gallery of African Art's first 
exhibit devoted to work by South African artists. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the biggest and one of the most colorful pieces,  
constructed by Kay Hasan of scraps of colored paper from 
advertising billboards found near his studio in the township of 
Soweto. The work, with 11 life-size figures, celebrates the 1994 
election that gave South Africa its first black president, Nelson 
Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit opening Sunday comes as Mandela's successor, Thabo  
Mbeki, is setting up his Cabinet after South Africa's second free 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	``My palette is hot because the climate here is hot, and women  
wear brightly colored cloths,'' Hasan told curator Lydia Puccinelli 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually I do not give names to my work,'' Hasan said. ``I  
prefer that a work speaks for itself. After I completed this piece, 
the excitement of the people waiting to cast their very first vote 
came alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decade after apartheid began collapsing, the pictures still  
reflect a time when schools for blacks did not teach art and blacks 
could not travel freely to meet other artists or share exhibit 
space with whites, said Puccinelli. The works are still dominated 
by politics but beginning to move on to religion and other topics. 
</P>
<P>
	Gavin Jantjes has a painting that illustrates a creation legend  
of the Fan people, one of the first to inhabit the region, showing 
young women taking ashes from a fire and throwing them into the 
air, creating the Milky Way. 
</P>
<P>
	Another artist, Azaria Mbatha, learned to make linoleum prints  
from two Swedish Lutheran missionaries. He received additional 
training at their art and craft center at Rorke's Drift in the 
province of Natal, one of the few places where blacks could study 
art under white rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The current show includes works by 21 South African artists, six  
of them white. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Claiming Art/Reclaiming Space: Post-Apartheid Art in South  
Africa'' will be at the National Museum of African Art through 
Sept. 26. Admission is free.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that a  
woman who dissented from the findings of a White House panel 
chaired by Vice President Al Gore has the right to the same 
information as other commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Victoria Cummock, appointed by the president to a special  
commission on aviation safety in the wake of the TWA Flight 800 air 
disaster, sued Gore and others on the panel, saying she had been 
denied access to a ``classified annex,'' but never got the document 
despite her security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummock also said she was denied almost all of an inch-thick  
briefing paper that she saw Gore and commissioner and ex-CIA 
director John Deutch reviewing. Cummock's husband was killed in the 
1988 crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and she 
is an advocate for improved air safety and security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge dismissed her lawsuit, in which the government  
argued that Cummock's access was limited to those rights enjoyed by 
members of the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find that Cummock was unlawfully denied the opportunity to  
review documents that were prepared or relied upon by the 
commission in formulating its recommendations,'' said a three-judge 
panel of the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cummock possesses an even greater right than a member of the  
public, because, as a commission member, she is entitled to fully 
participate in its deliberations,'' said the court ruling by 
appeals judge Judith Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission's ... violations frustrated Cummock's ability  
to prepare a complete and informed dissent,'' the court said.

<HEADLINE>  Olazabal Out of US Open With Injury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal,  
angry after a poor opening round at the U.S. Open, was forced to 
withdraw today when he broke his right hand by punching a hotel 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who shot 75 on Thursday, arrived at the course with a  
splint on his hand. He took a few swings on the practice range but 
realized he wouldn't be able to play the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard left Pinehurst before his noon tee time with Tom  
Lehman and Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
	``I punched a wall in my hotel,'' said Olazabal, who broke his  
hand Thursday night. ``I was upset with myself. I wanted to do well 
this week. After the way I played yesterday, I did something I 
should not have. Now, I'm paying the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal ended any chance he had of becoming the first  
golfer since Jack Nicklaus in 1972 to win both the Masters and U.S. 
Open in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that takes him out of the Grand Slam,'' defending Open  
champion Lee Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players were more sympathetic when told of Olazabal's  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's understandable,'' Tiger Woods said. ``We do get angry  
out here. We do get frustrated and sometimes we take it home with 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal broke the fifth metacarpal on his right hand and will  
be out for three to four weeks. That casts doubt on his ability to 
play in the British Open at Carnoustie July 15-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fortunately, it is a clean fracture,'' Olazabal said.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Keeps Coke Off Shelves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Supermarkets began restocking some  
Coca-Cola Co. brands Friday, but shelves were devoid of ``the real 
thing'' -- Coke itself -- which has been banned by the Belgian 
government since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shopkeepers said they had to turn away consumers demanding Coke  
despite the publicity over the ban that followed reports of dozens 
of illnesses among people who drank Coca-Cola products. 
</P>
<P>
	As Belgians headed into a rare sunny and hot weekend, one that  
cried out for a cool drink, the ``Always Coca-Cola'' slogan was no 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Douglas Ivester, the chairman of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co.,  
was meeting in Belgium with local management Friday on a 
damage-control mission for the world's largest soft-drink business. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was not scheduled to meet with Health Ministry officials,  
who on Thursday extended the ban on Coke, Fanta and Sprite as 
regulators sought more information on how people became ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no plans at this time to meet with the government,''  
said Coca-Cola's European director of communications, Paul 
Pendergrass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, the president of the French bottler of Coca-Cola said  
the cost of the health scare would be considerable, but did not 
provide an estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola, one of the components of the Dow Jones industrial  
average, fell $1.12 1/2, or by 1.7 percent, to close at $63.43 3/4 a 
share Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. It was down 1.6 
percent from where it ended last week. 
</P>
<P>
	As Coca-Cola was working to restore European confidence in its  
brands, there was evidence of loyal support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had clients in here insisting on nothing but Coke,'' said  
Hendrik Hempe, owner of a grocery store close to European Union 
headquarters in Brussels. ``They could not care less if it was 
banned or not. I had to insist 'A ban is a ban.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Hempe has already approached two wholesalers for Pepsi, but said  
he was told that it already had been sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Coca-Cola products, through, reappeared at stores in time  
for weekend shoppers, with Nestea, Aquarius, Bonaqua, Kinley, Lift 
and Minute Maid back on shelves after the Belgian government on 
Thursday removed them from the list of prohibited beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are plenty of them again in all our outlets,'' said  
Karen Segers, spokeswoman for the GB supermarket chain, Belgium's 
biggest retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	But she knows Belgians want Coca-Cola first and foremost. Over  
55 percent of soft drinks sold by GB is Coke, Segers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government imposed its ban Monday after dozens of  
youngsters were hospitalized complaining of stomach pains and 
nausea after drinking Coca-Cola products. Belgian news media said 
Thursday some 200 people had been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Coke said it traced the origin of the  
problems in Belgium to a plant at the French port of Dunkirk, just 
across the border from Belgium, and a factory in the Belgian city 
of Antwerp. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke said substandard gas used to carbonate drinks at the  
Antwerp plant caused a bad taste, and that a fungicide used on 
crates in Dunkirk was absorbed by the underside of cans and gave 
off an ``offensive odor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The health scare rapidly spread to other nations, with  
restrictions on sales imposed in Luxembourg, France, the 
Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	In France, where canned Coke produced at the Dunkirk plant  
remain banned, bottled Coke was all sold out at a Franprix 
supermarket in Paris. Faical Arifette, a sales assistant at the 
store, said he, too, is only buying bottled Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't drink it anymore from cans because of what they said  
on the TV, my family too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Lawry wasn't buying any Coke as she shopped Friday in  
Paris, but it wasn't because of the ban. ``I didn't want any,'' she 
said. ``But if I did, it wouldn't stop me from buying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Belgium, the soft-drink ban came on the heels of a scandal  
over Belgian food contaminated by cancer-causing dioxins, which led 
to bans on poultry, eggs, pork, beef and diary products from 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	``People forget quickly,'' Francesco Mazza said of the latest  
scare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like with chicken. I have clients who ask for chicken,''  
said Mazza, a restaurant owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first people will avoid drinking it, but then they'll drink  
it again. Coke is too well known, too many people like it to stop 
drinking it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Logistical Problems in Fugitive Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fading memories and a public unfamiliarity  
with the Symbionese Liberation Army could create problems for the 
prosecution of Kathleen Ann Soliah more than 20 years after her 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	In an arraignment Thursday in St. Paul, Minn., the woman  
identified as Ms. Soliah by police was ordered held without bail. 
Los Angeles authorities are seeking the extradition of the woman 
who goes by the name Sara Ann Olson. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Howard Bass did not concede that Ms. Olson is Ms.  
Soliah, and it appeared an extradition fight would precede her 
return to California. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Spokeswoman Coleen Rowley said a fingerprint analysis  
concluded that Ms. Olson and Ms. Soliah are the same person. 
</P>
<P>
	Loyola Law School Associate Dean Laurie Levenson said that at  
52, the woman facing jurors in a trial would bear little 
resemblance to the 1970s radical who was charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she has lived an exemplary life, there will be sympathy,''  
Levenson said. ``No one is going to applaud her actions, but it is 
harder to prosecute a person who lives like the lady next door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles District Attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons  
declined to say what evidence remains against Ms. Soliah, who 
allegedly placed pipe bombs under two police cars in 1975 and then 
made a new life for herself in Minnesota as a doctor's wife, 
actress and mother of three before she was captured Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have successfully prosecuted cases older than this one,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The physical evidence in Ms. Soliah's case includes the two pipe  
bombs, which did not explode. She was linked to the case along with 
her then-boyfriend, SLA member James Kilgore, who remains a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Hanlon, a lawyer who has represented radicals in the San  
Francisco area, recalled puzzled jurors when he won a murder 
acquittal for SLA member Russell Little in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trial was in Salinas and we had some 19- and 20-year-old  
jurors who had no idea what the SLA was,'' he said. ``And that was 
in 1981.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury that indicted Ms. Soliah in 1976 heard from 28  
witnesses, including a police bomb expert who has since died. It is 
unknown how many witnesses remain alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a physical evidence case it's easier,'' Hanlon said.  
``If it's a witness case, it's almost impossible to try it 25 years 
later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the anti-government SLA became front-page news when its  
members kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. The group 
demanded that her parents distribute $2 million worth of food to 
the needy before it would discuss freedom for their daughter. The 
demand later climbed to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The case took a bizarre twist when Ms. Hearst sent word that she  
had become Tania, a member of the group that abducted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after the kidnapping, Ms. Hearst was photographed  
carrying a carbine during an SLA holdup of a San Francisco bank -- 
the robbery for which she eventually was convicted and sent to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Hearst was arrested in San Francisco in October 1975,  
she was living with Ms. Soliah and her brother, Steven. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fugitives from that era have received light treatment,  
including Weather Underground figure Bernadine Dohrn, an alleged 
conspirator in bombings who was allowed to plead guilty to lesser 
counts and drew probation. She went on to become a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Katherine Ann Power, an anti-war radical implicated in a fatal  
bank robbery in Boston in 1970, surrendered in 1993 and pleaded 
guilty to manslaughter. With continued good behavior in prison, she 
can be freed in January.

<HEADLINE>  East Timor Rivals Sign Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- East Timor's rival factions signed an  
agreement today that is aimed at stopping violence ahead of a 
planned Aug. 8 referendum on the troubled territory's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Although short on details, the agreement calls for a cease-fire  
and disarmament. It was reached during three days of talks that 
also included U.N. officials and the Indonesian Human Rights 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how effective the agreement would be. A similar  
peace deal, signed in April, did not address disarmament, 
considered one of the thorniest issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between rival groups in the former Portuguese colony,  
which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, has increased with the 
approach of the U.N.-sponsored referendum that will let East 
Timorese choose between independence and autonomy within Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint communique was signed by East Timorese rebel leader  
Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence 
under house arrest in Jakarta; Leandro Isaac, leader of a 
pro-independence umbrella group; Joao Tavares, head of an 
anti-independence militia; and Domingos Soares, a local government 
leader who opposes independence. 
</P>
<P>
	It calls for stopping any activity that could lead to  
disturbances ahead of the ballot, including ``every form of hatred, 
intimidation, violence, terrorism and acts of disinformation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached on the same day that Ian Martin, head  
of the U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) claimed that 
Indonesian soldiers were seen helping militiamen attack 
pro-independence rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst quoted Martin as saying that a  
UNAMET team witnessed militias that were ``accompanied and 
directed'' by the Indonesian military. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from Dili, East Timor's capital, Wimhurst said the  
militiamen and soldiers were seen burning houses and assaulting an 
old man Tuesday in Leotela, a village in Liquica district. 
</P>
<P>
	The militiamen reportedly were armed with daggers and machetes  
as they looted and burned homes in an efforts to chase people out 
of the village about 25 miles west of Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Local military chief Col. Suhartono Suratman denied any  
involvement by Indonesian soldiers in the incident that coincided 
with the release of a policeman and two civilians abducted last 
week by pro-independence activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin claimed the militiamen also have ambushed teams from the  
United Nations, Red Cross and local officials involved in 
negotiations for the release. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no active Indonesian soldiers, but retired ones who  
joined PAM-Swakarsa,'' a local civilian defense force, Suratman 
said. ``They did not ambush the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He neither confirmed nor denied the looting and arson.

<HEADLINE> Ocean Spray Chief To Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKEVILLE, Mass. (AP) -- Ocean Spray Cranberries President and  
Chief Executive Thomas E. Bullock will step down next year after 
three years on the job, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, 53, has overseen the elimination of 500 jobs -- about 20  
percent of the company's work force -- as the industry continues to 
suffer from overproduction and falling prices. About 300 of the job 
cuts were in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, some growers got as much as $85 for a 100 pound barrel  
of cranberries, but Ocean Spray said berries harvested next fall 
may sell for just $42 to $48 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	As d a result, the company suspended payments to former co-op  
growers who were required to buy shares in the company. The shares 
are redeemed over a six-year period when the grower leaves the 
co-op. 
</P>
<P>
	But some outside analysts said the company under Bullock's  
leadership has suffered for strategic reasons that have nothing to 
do with the cranberry glut. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the company never recovered from losing its monopoly in  
the 1990s amid competition from companies like Northland 
Cranberries of Wisconsin and Tropicana. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't know how to deal with competition,'' George S.  
Dahlman, an industry analyst, told The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	When Northland began marketing a premium line of 100 percent  
cranberry juice, Ocean Spray started a price war that hurt it more 
than Northland, Dahlman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean Spray had contracted with PepsiCo Inc. to distribute its  
beverages to convenience stores, but last year Pepsi announced 
plans to buy and distribute Tropicana instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the company's troubles, Ocean Spray reported sales of  
$1.48 billion for its last fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 3 percent 
more than the previous year. It also reported profits of $280 
million, up from $273 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts grows more cranberries than any state except  
Wisconsin. Ocean Spray controls about 70 percent of the U.S. crop.

<HEADLINE> Arson Caused Calif. Synagogue Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Three synagogues were hit by  
coordinated arson attacks today, and hate literature blaming the 
``Jewish media'' for the war in Kosovo was found at one of the 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires caused moderate damage to two synagogues and gutted a  
third temple's library, destroying a collection of videos on Jewish 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials were at the scenes, investigating the fires as  
hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators took one youth into custody and were seeking  
several others who were seen near Congregation B'nai Israel, where 
the library was broken into and set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the timing and spacing of the synagogues, one person  
could not have set all three fires, authorities said 
</P>
<P>
	A flier from an organization calling itself the North Atlantic  
Terrorist Organization was found at the Knesset Israel Torah Center 
by KOVR-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ugly American and NATO aggressors are the ultimate  
hypocrites. The fake Albanian refugee crisis was manufactured by 
the Jewish media to justify the terrorizing, the bestial bombing of 
our Yugoslavia back into the dark ages,'' the flier reads. 
</P>
<P>
	The first blaze was reported at 3:24 a.m. at B'nai Israel in  
downtown Sacramento. The second was called in at 3:48 a.m. at 
Congregation Beth Shalom in suburban Carmichael, and the third 10 
minutes later at Knesset Israel Torah Center, in northeastern 
Sacramento County, Sheriff's Lt. Jim Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the area of B'nai Israel, police saw four youths who ran when  
they saw the patrol car. One of the youths was caught and was being 
questioned. ``Nobody's under arrest,'' said police Officer Eric 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst damage was at B'nai Israel, where a library used by a  
nonreligious private school was destroyed and offices were damaged. 
The library housed what was described as a ``Jewish heritage video 
collection,'' including Holocaust videos, children's videos and 
other films relating to Jewish culture. 
</P>
<P>
	At Beth Shalom, the sanctuary was damaged but the sprinkler  
system halted the fire on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disturbing to be a target of this kind of activity,''  
said Beth Shalom member Debby Nelson. ``But I feel fortunate. They 
attempted to do real damage. We have a good security and fire alarm 
system. It stopped them in their tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my temple,'' said Estelle Opper, a member of B'nai  
Israel. ``I am heart-stricken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You're dealing with a sick mind,'' a distraught Rabbi Joseph  
Melamed of Beth Shalom told television station KXTV. ``There's no 
question about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A national church arson task force documented 670 attacks on  
houses of worship between January 1995 and September 1998. Of 
those, 33 were in California and one in Sacramento, a Baptist 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty rare generally speaking for three synagogues to  
be hit all in a row like this,'' said Jonathan Bernstein of the 
Anti-Defamation League's San Francisco office. ``It's obviously a 
sign that there was planning involved. It wasn't just a spontaneous 
act.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Steel, Oil, Gas Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved a $1.5  
billion loan package Friday to help tide over U.S. steel, oil and 
natural gas producers until their industries' prices recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-34 vote to send the measure to the House sets the stage  
for a second showdown in the Senate next week on ways to help 
domestic steel producers hit by low-priced imports. The Senate is 
to take up a controversial bill Tuesday establishing steel quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised a House vote  
on the loan bill, which would let steel companies borrow up to $250 
million and small oil and gas firms borrow up to $10 million. Those 
industries say they have suffered tens of thousands of layoffs 
because of sagging prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``A vote for this bill is a `Buy American' vote, a vote of  
confidence in American steel, American workers and American 
families,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., called the program a  
mistake, even after supporters agreed to ensure that the $270 
million in taxpayer spending needed to back the loans would not 
come from Social Security reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that I don't want to help the steel industry or help  
the oil and gas industries,'' he said. ``I don't think giving 
government-guaranteed loans is the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry praised the bill's passage but said the  
measure would not end their woes. The industry wants comprehensive 
quotas on foreign steel shipments. The House overwhelmingly passed 
a quota bill in March despite a presidential veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Steelworkers of America plans to make telephone calls  
through Tuesday morning and send a thousand workers to Capitol Hill 
on Tuesday for a last-minute push on quotas. Eighty steelworkers 
were to leave Gary, Ind., by motorcycle on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (loan program's) objective is to help heal the wounds  
created by the crisis, while the objective of quotas is to end the 
crisis,'' said William Klinefelter, a union lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., who supports quotas, said the loans  
would help only the companies that have been hurt the most. Quotas 
would offer broader relief but also are harder to pass, Santorum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more of a fight on that (quota) bill than this  
one,'' Santorum said. ``It's a policy change, while this is just a 
couple of bucks. The other bill changes our trade laws and could 
have an impact on our trading relations with others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quota critics say the provision would violate international  
trade laws and could launch a trade war likely to hurt U.S. 
businesses that rely on foreign export markets.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Agency Likely To Help Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Just weeks after it was created, Mexico's  
bank insurance agency will likely have to bail out the country's 
third-largest banking group and cover $1.4 billion in losses, 
financial regulators and bank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue of Grupo Financiero Serfin SA is the first test of  
the Bank Savings Protection Institute, created in the aftermath of 
one of the biggest political issues last year: the government's $65 
billion bank rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican financial regulators and Serfin executives said at a  
news conference Thursday that the bank will hold an extraordinary 
shareholders meeting July 8 to determine if current shareholders 
are willing to provide the capital needed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officials said that such a move is highly unlikely and  
suggested that the insurance agency, known by its Spanish initials 
as IPAB, will have to assume control of Mexico's oldest bank. They 
did not say what the taxpayer share of the bailout would likely be. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said that IPAB will then likely put Serfin up for  
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Serfin's current management team, headed by chief executive  
Adolfo Lagos, will continue to run the institution. Lagos said the 
bidding process for Serfin is expected to be completed in four to 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	IPAB president Vicente Corta said several banks have expressed  
their interest in participating in the bidding process. Financial 
authorities are also holding talks with HSBC, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Warrener Out With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Sabres defenseman Rhett Warrener  
will miss the rest of the Stanley Cup finals after breaking an 
ankle in a fight during Thursday night's game. He had surgery 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we get him a bigger skate, he won't be able to play,''  
coach Lindy Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener was injured in a scuffle with Dallas defenseman Derian  
Hatcher in the final moments of the Stars' 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave Dallas a 3-2 lead and put the Stars one victory  
from winning the best-of-7 series. Game 6 will be played Saturday 
night in Buffalo 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener was wrestling with Hatcher when he fell to the ice. ``I  
don't know what happened,'' Hatcher said. ``I know he tried to 
throw me down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener left the dressing room after the game on crutches and  
with a cast on his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Sabres' tougher and more reliable defensemen with a  
plus-minus rating in the playoffs of plus-12, Warrener probably 
would not play again even if the Sabres were able to extend the 
series to a seventh game in Dallas on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrener's probable replacement, Darryl Shannon, played for much  
of the regular season with Warrener's defensive partner, Jay KcKee. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon played in 71 games during the regular season and  
appeared in only one playoff game this year. This is the veteran's 
first appearance in a Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited a long time for this,'' said Shannon, who turns 30  
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannon hasn't played since Game 1 of the first-round sweep of  
Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Golfers in the U.S. Open described some  
of Friday's second-round pin placements as cruel on the crowned 
greens at Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Wait until the weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	``Brutal would be a good word for a few of them,'' Jim Furyk  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk said the pin on the first hole was ``on the side of a  
hill'' and told reporters to ``go out and look at No. 14, that's a 
fun one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some players laughed at Saturday's predetermined USGA pin  
placements on the treacherous greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw where they dotted a few (holes) and it's pretty funny,''  
John Daly said. ``It looks like to me if you do miss it on the bad 
side of the hole you are not getting it up and down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk just sighed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look for No. 16, that one's a doozy,'' Furyk said of the pin  
placement Saturday for the second-hardest hole on the course. 
``We'll enjoy that one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Corey Pavin called the pin placement Friday on No. 14 ``an  
optical nightmare. It looks like you can hit it an inch by the pin 
and it will roll 40 yards over.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IRWIN OUT:* Three-time U.S. Open champion Hale Irwin withdrew  
halfway through his second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, who plays on the senior tour and won the Open in 1974,  
'79 and '90, packed it in with a shoulder injury after his second 
shot on the seventh hole. Irwin was 8-over for the tournament when 
he pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time I've ever withdrawn from a tournament  
in my career,'' Irwin said. ``This is something new for me, but I 
do want to do the smart thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin said his left shoulder had been feeling funny the past few  
weeks while practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear if the injury would interrupt Irwin's schedule on  
the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PAVIN PUSH:* Corey Pavin was on his way to missing the cut in  
his third straight Open before staging a nice comeback with birdies 
on Nos. 17 and 18 to close Friday's second round with a 1-over 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavin won the '95 Open at Shinnecock Hills, but has struggled  
with his game, winning only once since then, the Colonial in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavin's two closing birdies came on the heels of three straight  
bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty mad after 16. I worked pretty hard and battled  
and got it back to 4-over for the tournament and then I bogeyed 14, 
15 and 16 and I could have just kicked myself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was quite an eventful round for Pavin, who holed a bunker  
shot from 40 yards on No. 8 for a birdie. Three holes later, he 
made a 40-footer for birdie that drew a cheer so loud that those on 
the next fairway thought it was for Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AMATEUR CHAMP:* Defending U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne may  
hit the ball a long way, but admitted Friday he has a lot to learn 
as a golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Kuehne plans to turn pro Monday after the U.S.  
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his second round Friday with a perfect tee shot, and  
had a wedge to the green. He ended up with a triple-bogey 7 after 
having his chip shot roll back to his feet and then three-putting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne birdied the difficult second hole, bogeyed the easy No. 3  
and birdied the next two and ended his roller coaster round with a 
5-over-par 75. 
</P>
<P>
	``He played some really good shots, and when he hits it straight  
it makes the play easier because he's so long. And I was impressed 
with his touch,'' playing partner and defending Open champion Lee 
Janzen said. ``He hit some pretty sorry shots, too, which I think 
he would admit to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuehne said he wasn't impressed with his two rounds, despite  
tying Janzen at 7-over and beating his other playing partner, Mark 
O'Meara, who missed the cut at 10-over. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the big picture, that's great, but I shot 7-over-par,''  
Kuehne said. ``I'm happy to have been here and played, but you 
don't want to beat people playing poorly. You want to beat them 
playing well.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THUMBS UP:* The general consensus among golfers is that the  
U.S. Open should return to Pinehurst No. 2 -- and soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donald Ross gem designed in the early 1900s seems to be  
standing the test of some of the world's greatest golfers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was A-plus, I think it was great,'' Jack Nicklaus said of  
No. 2. ``I think they (the USGA) would want to run back here as 
fast as they could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other golfers agreed with Nicklaus. Greg Norman went as far to  
say No. 2 should be included in the USGA's rotation with courses 
such as Pebble Beach, Oakmont and Baltusrol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait to come back here,'' defending Open champion Lee  
Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players said they like No. 2 because it's a thinking man's  
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USGA has got this golf course set up the way they wanted  
it set up,'' Hal Sutton said. ``A lot of times when we get out 
there in a normal round of golf, it's almost mindless sometimes. 
It's 170 yards and, `OK give me the 6-iron.' Around here, 170 yards 
is not necessarily a 6-iron; you may be shooting at another part of 
the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LOVE LOST:* Former British Open champion Justin Leonard was  
none too pleased to address the cameras after shooting a 5-over 75 
to fall back on the leader board. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard's playing partners, Greg Norman and Davis Love III,  
refused to come to the podium set up for cameras to interview 
players, which seemed to aggravate Leonard. He turned to a USGA 
official and asked in a stern voice why he had to come to talk 
about his round. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman was available in the locker room and talked to reporters  
there, while Love went to the driving range to hit balls. 
</P>
<P>
	The tense interview session lasted a few minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I played the last three holes at 2-over-par and it doesn't sit  
well with me,'' said Leonard, who is 4-over after two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DUVAL-WOODS:* The much anticipated matchup between David Duval  
and Tiger Woods will have to wait a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation Friday after the second round of the Open  
that the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the world would meet Saturday 
for the first time. However, the USGA pairing sheet said otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was the first to finish in fourth place at 139, while  
Payne Stewart was the first of the leaders in at 137. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Michelson and Duval were in the same pairing, with  
Mickelson tapping in first to tie Stewart at 3-under. But according 
to the USGA, Duval, also tied for the lead, would not be paired 
with Woods because Duval's name was listed first in the 
tournament's original pairing sheet.

<HEADLINE> Ocean Spray Chief To Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKEVILLE, Mass. (AP) -- Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. president  
and chief executive Thomas E. Bullock will step down next year 
after three years on the job, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, 53, has overseen the elimination of 500 jobs -- about 20  
percent of the company's work force -- as the industry continues to 
suffer from overproduction and falling prices. About 300 of the job 
cuts were in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, some growers got as much as $85 for a 100-pound barrel  
of cranberries, but Ocean Spray said berries harvested next fall 
may sell for only $42 to $48 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the company's troubles, Ocean Spray reported sales of  
$1.48 billion for its last fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 3 percent 
more than the previous year. It also reported profits of $280 
million, up from $273 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts grows more cranberries than any state except  
Wisconsin. Ocean Spray controls about 70 percent of the U.S. crop.

<HEADLINE> Raiders Cut Harvey Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Tailback Harvey Williams, who rushed for  
1,114 yards for the Raiders four seasons ago but was shuttled 
between tight end and fullback the past two years, was cut by 
Oakland as the team opened minicamp Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, one of the few remaining players from the Raiders team  
that moved back to Oakland from Los Angeles in 1995, lost his 
starting job to Napoleon Kaufman three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough. Harvey's a good football player and I know he's  
going to play good football somewhere else,'' said coach Jon 
Gruden, who said he wanted to give several tailbacks on the roster 
a chance to get more playing time in minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was a first-round pick of the Kansas City Chiefs in  
1991 and was signed by the Raiders as a free agent in April 1994. 
He ran for 983 yards for the Raiders in 1994 and had 1,114 yards 
and nine touchdowns rushing the following season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman became the starter in 1996, limiting Williams to 431  
yards on 121 carries, and Williams rushed for just 70 yards in 1997 
while spending most of his time at tight end. Last season, he had 
496 yards on 128 carries and also caught 26 passes for 173 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman, who had the locker next to Williams at the team's  
training camp, said he'll miss his former backfield mate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels strange when your friends leave,'' Kaufman said. ``I  
learned a lot from his game. I saw the situations that arose with 
him, such as the move to tight end. But when he came in here he was 
a class act, he never really complained. He's a great back, he can 
do a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders earlier this month signed former Heisman Trophy  
winner Rashaan Salaam, who rushed for 1,074 yards in 1995 as a 
rookie for the Chicago Bears but missed all of last season 
following surgery on his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland also is following the performance of controversial  
running back Lawrence Phillips, who is playing for the Barcelona 
Dragons in NFL Europe. Phillips, whose off-field problems have 
included domestic violence and drunken driving, was dumped by the 
St. Louis Rams and Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I speak for just about everybody in football that realizes  
he's a talented guy. He's clearly the marquee player in the World 
League,'' Gruden said. ``You've got to admire what he's doing over 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips rushed for 613 yards and eight touchdowns in his first  
six games with Barcelona. The Dragons' season could go until late 
June if they make the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spoken to (the Raiders), and they have spoken about  
their interest in Lawrence,'' said Mitch Frankel, Phillips' agent. 
``That seems to be their indication, that they would like to have 
Lawrence with them next season. We will revisit with them after the 
end of the (NFL Europe) season, and then Lawrence will make a 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, 24, was the sixth player selected in the 1996 NFL  
draft and had 1,309 yards on 394 carries in two seasons with St. 
Louis. But he was cut by the Rams after repeatedly missing 
practices and did not last long with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to judge beforehand,'' Gruden said, adding that  
he has never met Phillips. ``I like to judge someone after I've 
talked with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders also signed free agent wide receiver Horace Copeland  
on Friday. He has played in 61 games for Miami and Tampa Bay since 
entering the NFL in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Woman Swindled NFL Players' Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A former sports management company head  
pleaded guilty Friday to swindling $342,000 from the bank accounts 
of two NFL players who hired her to manage their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Therese Jose, 44, admitted in federal court that she pilfered  
the money from the accounts of Lester Holmes and Leonard Renfro, 
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew O. Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
	She pleaded guilty to a single count information charging her  
with interstate transportation of property obtained by fraud. She 
faces up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were living in Cherry Hill at the time and playing  
for the Philadelphia Eagles. The fraud occurred between December 
1995 and February 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, an offensive lineman, and Renfro, a defensive lineman,  
paid Jose, who controlled a company known as Pro Nets Sports 
Management, between $40 and $45 an hour to open their mail, prepare 
checks to pay their bills and present them for their signatures, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose forged Holmes' signature on checks totaling about $223,000,  
the information alleged. Checks totaling $114,969 were made payable 
to cash or to Pro Net and one in the amount of $3,600 was paid to 
Jose's landlord, the government said. 
</P>

	In what prosecutors say was a ``robbing Peter to pay Paul''  
move, Jose deposited $96,432 of the money taken from Holmes' 
account into Renfro's account. It was unclear what prompted that 
action or what happened to the money, Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose also admitted forging Renfro's signature on checks totaling  
$119,432, Schiff said. She kept those funds, according to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose will be sentenced Sept. 17 before U.S. District Judge  
Jerome B. Simandle who set her bail Friday at $50,000.

<HEADLINE> Iomega Cuts 450 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega Corp. is cutting 450 jobs, or 10 percent  
of its workforce, as it struggles to recover from sluggish sales of 
its computer storage products and the loss of top managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega said Friday it will lose 5 cents to 10 cents a share in  
the current financial quarter, excluding a restructuring charge, 
compared to analysts' expectations of zero profits. A year earlier, 
the company lost 13 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock plunged as much as 16 percent in early  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. By late morning it was down 
56 1/4 cents a share, or 13 percent, at $3.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to take a second-quarter charge of $45 million  
to pay for restructuring its operations, which includes shutting 
plants in San Jose and San Diego, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost-cutting is expected to save $40 million a year.  
</P>
<P>
	Iomega tied its disappointing results to weak sales of its Jaz  
drive and disks, a delay in shipping its Clik! PC Card drive and 
parts shortages resulting in slow sales of Zip drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega disclosed Wednesday that it was losing three top  
executives and two other key company officials.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Slip / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slipped Friday, as investors sold  
Treasury securities to profit from a day-earlier rally that pushed 
the yield on the 30-year bond back below 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which shot up  
1 9/32 points on Thursday, dropped 1/8 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 in 
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 
to 5.97 percent from 5.96 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders sold bonds at prices driven higher by the market rally,  
which was triggered by investor relief over appearances that 
interest rate increases would be kept to a minimum by the Federal 
Reserve. Higher rates tend to hurt the value of bonds and other 
Treasury securities that pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday hinted that  
the central bank would raise rates at its meeting later this month 
but was vague as to whether rates would climb again later this 
year. His comments came a day after the Labor Department reported 
that May consumer prices rose only slightly, easing concerns that a 
surge in inflation would spur the Fed to raise rates substantially 
to check price increases in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader bond market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were up 1/8 point to 5/32 point and intermediate 
maturities were up 9/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.65 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.53 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.96 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.77 percent. One-year yields were 4.96 percent as the 
discount rose 0.03 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.72 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Stock Slumps on Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette's stock dropped nearly 11 percent Friday,  
a day after the shaving and consumer products company warned that 
its earnings would be lower than expected this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices closed at $42.18 3/4, down $5.12 1/2, in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 million shares were exchanged, making Gillette Co.  
the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Thursday it will report a 20 percent decrease  
in quarterly earnings per share compared with a year ago, falling 
well short of analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	It cited an unexpectedly low recovery in Japan, Brazil, Russia  
and Germany. Sales for Gillette's Braun appliance, stationery and 
toiletries businesses also were disappointing, the company said, 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, ``we still expect sales to be up in a low  
single-digit increase,'' said Stephen Brayton, company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings will return to normal levels in the second half of the  
year, Brayton said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second quarter of 1998, Gillette earned $372 million, or  
33 cents a share, on sales of $2.3 billion. The company's warning 
means it expects profits to drop about 7 cents per share this 
quarter to 26 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. were predicting 29 cents a  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Long known as a steady money maker for blue-chip investors,  
Gillette announced in September it would lay off 4,700 employees 
worldwide, or 11 percent of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes Sensor shaving products, Oral B toothbrushes  
and Duracell batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette also announced Thursday that its board of directors has  
authorized and expansion of its stock repurchase program from 50 
million to 75 million shares.

<HEADLINE> John Daly Has Thrown Punches Before  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- The beauty of golf is that its judgments  
are limited to the scorecard. The trouble with John Daly is that he 
refuses to sign his and disappear, at least until the time comes to 
tee it up again. 
</P>
<P>
	For some reason, the man has to talk. And talk. And talk. It's  
almost as though all the addictions Daly fights every day -- 
alcohol, gambling and smoking, even soft drinks and chocolate -- 
still leave him with too many hours to fill. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday morning, reigning Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal  
showed up at Pinehurst No. 2 wearing a splint on his right hand. It 
turned out he broke it the previous evening by slamming a wall in 
his hotel room, so angry was Olazabal after shooting a 5-over-par 
75 in Thursday's opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Daly got his mouth around it, though, that was only  
the second-most embarrassing admission of the day. Or third, and 
maybe fourth, if you count every stupid tangent Daly took off on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little bigger than he is,'' Daly began. ``Most things I  
punch, it just goes right through the damn thing, except one time 
in South Africa. I punched a TV and it kind of fought me back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funny stuff -- if Daly had simply stopped there. But with two  
wins in major championships, the same number of trips through 
alcohol rehab, and three failed marriages, he is never at a loss 
for material. And like an egg once it's cracked, there was no way 
to keep everything inside from spilling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``One time in Swaziland, I think I got my first divorce, I was  
just in a great mood, I was drunk off my ass, I ended up shooting 
23 under and winning the tournament. This game is crazy. I've done 
a lot of crazy things with my fists. I never hit anybody, but I 
tore up a few houses and a few cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's what we do,'' he said. ``It's not the total glamorous  
life that everybody thinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, a few people probably thought about stopping Daly  
-- a charitable urge to be sure. Others probably wanted to ask 
whether the ``we'' referred to reformed alcoholics, all pro 
athletes, just golfers or -- as in Daly's case -- all three. 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't time. Daly was rolling now, under a full head  
of steam. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put a lot of time and effort and energy into this game, and  
when it doesn't go good ...,'' he said, finally pausing. ``Hell, if 
I'd have won the Masters, I don't think I'd have been punching the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only one right now who has a reason to punch anything.  
I haven't done crap all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sad thing is that he practically guaranteed that trend would  
continue by following up an opening-round 68 with a 7-over 77 
Friday. Gone was the Daly who patiently steered his way across the 
treacherous greens playing delicate chip shots and putting 
nervelessly. In his place was the Daly of U.S. Opens past, the bull 
who refused to recognize that the course was set up like a china 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Pinehurst No. 2 is not your typical Open layout -- the  
fairways are more generous, the rough playable -- Daly's first-round 
performance was startling on several counts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last nine starts on Tour, he has missed the cut three  
times, withdrawn three times and his best finish is a tie for 51st. 
His Open track record is not much more heartening. In nine previous 
Opens, over 27 rounds, he averaged 74. His best finish is a tie for 
27th. Daly missed three cuts and two years ago, withdrew between 
nines at Congressional Country Club because his latest stab at 
rehab wasn't taking. His hands were shaking too much to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why he seemed as startled as anyone Thursday to  
find out there was still magic left in those weary bones. Maybe he 
shouldn't have. The last time Daly played Pinehurst No. 2, in the 
1991 Tour Championship, he finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	But the second he started talking about it, you realized why the  
spell couldn't last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I played so drunk here in '91,'' he said, ``I don't  
even remember the holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The more Daly rambled Thursday, the more memories he wanted to  
wipe clean. Even though he claimed his last gambling episode was 30 
months ago, there were debts of $9 million to settle. And there are 
lingering problems with alimony payments and the tax man. 
</P>
<P>
	For all that, it was something else Daly said before the  
microphones were turned off that left you feeling uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing with me,'' he said, ``is I don't know who is going  
to show up tomorrow. It's a little scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say this much for Daly: He can still draw a crowd. But more and  
more it has the feel of rubbernecking at an accident. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hallmark Selling Low-Cost Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This Father's Day, if you care enough to send  
the very best, you can do it for under a buck. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark has begun selling a line of 99-cent cards with simpler  
designs and basic messages to mark holidays and other, less formal, 
occasions. The nation's top greeting card maker hopes the strategy 
will eliminate its pricey image and boost sales in a flat market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' said Eleana Conde, 36, while buying eight  
Father's Day cards on Friday at a Hallmark store in midtown 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying traditional greeting cards for fathers, stepfathers,  
godfathers, and grandfathers for herself and her two children gets 
quite expensive -- even before buying a gift, Ms. Conde said. 
``These cards really help me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other greeting card companies have sold $1 cards for years, but  
Hallmark's move stands out because it's the industry biggest player 
as well as the emphasis the company is placing on the new cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the privately held Kansas City, Mo.-based company has  
sold about 63 million of the 99-cent Warm Wishes cards since it 
began a national rollout in March. Still, the Warm Wishes sales 
will make up only a small portion of the 3.5 billion cards Hallmark 
expects to sell this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Schaadt, a securities analyst with Fourteen Research in  
New York, said Hallmark's foray into bargain prices is an attempt 
to capture consumers who increasingly buy cards at drugstores, 
grocery stores or mass retailers such as Wal-Mart because they 
believe greeting card stores have become too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark acknowledged the pricey image exists, though questioned  
its accuracy. ``There has been a perception that Hallmark cards are 
expensive when we are in fact middle of line,'' said Jay Dittman, 
Hallmark's vice president of business research. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark cards sell for an average of about $2, though it's not  
hard to find their cards for $2.95 or $3.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schaadt said the new cards also will be helped by the  
novelty factor. ``The industry really lives and breathes on new 
merchandise,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark is prominently displaying the cards at its 5,000 stores  
and is spending $50 million to advertise them. In all, the cards 
are available at more than 20,000 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers say the 99-cent cards have the Hallmark quality. With  
their bright, glossy color, quality paper and fun and corny 
language, the cards don't look like a cheap version of their 
standard assortment. 
</P>
<P>
	By selling the cards for less than $1, Hallmark officials say  
they hope consumers will be motivated to buy cards for more casual 
relationships such as neighbors, co-workers and acquaintances -- in 
other words, people for whom you might balk at buying a $3 card 
just to say ``Hello.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lower price may also persuade some consumers to send a  
traditional card rather than using a less personal -- but free -- 
electronic greeting card offered by companies such as Blue Mountain 
Arts and Amazon.com, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallmark's chief rival, American Greetings, said it does not  
envision a price war breaking out in the industry, in part because 
the company already sells cards for less than $1. And more 
significantly, consumers don't see price as a barrier, said Steve 
Laserson, executive director of product management at Cleveland, 
Oh.-based American Greetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more a matter of having cards relevant to people's  
lives,'' he said. ``And having cards talk the way people talk.''

<HEADLINE> Contested Patent Raises Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An application rejected by the U.S. Patent and  
Trademark Office and destined to end up in the courts may force the 
federal government to address a perplexing question: What is a 
human being? 
</P>
<P>
	The patent application sought to claim rights to all laboratory  
processes involving the combined use of human and animal cells and 
was rejected by the patent office because it ``embraces human 
beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Rifkin, co-applicant for the patent and a well-known  
biotechnology activist, said the PTO failed to define how many 
human cells or genes there must be in a laboratory human-animal 
experiment for the hybrid to be considered human. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is territory that has not been chartered and we think it  
is time for them to look at this and give us a definition,'' said 
Rifkin, a well-known opponent of many types of genetic research. 
``We want to force the government to draw a line in the sand'' that 
would limit human-animal research, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rifkin and his co-applicant, New York Medical College biology  
professor Stuart Newman, refiled their application this week and 
plan to the push the issue, if necessary, through the federal 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of patent applications are initially rejected.  
The system requires a second rejection before the issue can be 
carried to the Board of Patent Appeals, a process that usually 
takes more than two years. Only then, said Rifkin, would he file in 
the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is burgeoning research in which scientists insert human  
genes into laboratory animals. The hybrid animals, called chimeras, 
are then used to test drugs for the treatment of human disease. 
Since they contain human genes, their response to drugs more 
accurately mimics the response of humans. Some researchers also are 
experimenting with human-animal hybrids to find ways to grow 
replacement organs, such as skin or hearts, for ailing humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Rifkin said his patent application would cover all of these  
activities. If granted, he said, he would force a 20-year 
moratorium on human-animal patents, because the PTO cannot turn 
down his patent without also turning down other human-animal 
chimera patents that have been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	His goal, said Rifkin, is to force the government to examine the  
whole field of human genetic manipulation and to decide what should 
and should not be permitted. Right now, he said, neither the courts 
nor Congress have cleanly defined what the nation will permit 
scientists to do with the human genome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are beginning to be able to engineer our own offspring,''  
said Rifkin. ``This all moves us toward eugenics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Godici, acting assistant director for patents at the PTO,  
said that there is no precise definition of what constitutes a 
human being in patent law. He said case law in such controversies 
is often established in court and ``that may be the real objective 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among medical researchers, though, there is fear that Rifkin's  
patent could slow research that holds the promise of cures for many 
of the diseases that plague millions of humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The net outcome of this (patent) attempt may hurt valuable  
medical research and ultimately deny therapies for patients who 
need them,'' Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry 
Organization, said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Florida State 8, Stanford 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Sam Scott's towering two-run homer capped  
Florida State's four-run sixth inning and the Seminoles rallied to 
beat Stanford 8-6 on Thursday night in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles (56-13) forced a rematch Friday with the Cardinal  
(50-14). Both teams have one loss in their double-elimination 
bracket, and the survivor will play Miami in Saturday's 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford brought the tying run to the plate in the bottom of the  
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	After reliever Zach Diaz (4-1) walked leadoff hitter John Gall,  
he got Joe Borchard to foul out, popped Josh Hochgesang out to 
first and got Damien Alvarado to ground to second for the force. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State came back from a 6-2 deficit, tying it on Scott's  
shot into the right field bleachers. Reliever Mike Wodnicki left a 
fastball too high and Scott hit it high and deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, the Seminoles struggled to find their offense,  
going 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position to that point. 
</P>
<P>
	Wodnicki replaced right-hander Brian Sager with runners on first  
and second and no outs. Marshall McDougall welcomed him with a 
double off the wall in center to score the inning's first two runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinch-hitter Karl Jernigan put the Seminoles ahead for good in  
the seventh. With no outs and runners on first and second, he hit 
into a double play that brought in Brett Groves, who led off with a 
double to left. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Diaz added a double off the center field wall to score  
McDougall from first, making it 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	For a change, the Seminoles are sticking around Omaha. While  
Florida State has made 18 trips to the College World Series, it's 
only the sixth time the Seminoles have won more than twice. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also Florida State's longest stay since 1989. Four times  
during the 1990s the Seminoles had a 1-2 record and twice went 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz replaced starter Nick Stocks in the fifth, inheriting a  
bases-loaded, two-out situation that the Cardinal turned into a 6-2 
lead after Eric Bruntlett's sharp grounder past third produced two 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks, a first-round draft pick by the St. Louis Cardinals,  
went 4 2-3 innings, allowing six hits, two walks, hitting two and 
striking out two. Half of his six runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
	Sager, a freshman who rejected a $1 million signing bonus from  
the Arizona Diamondbacks to attend Stanford, threw into the sixth, 
when the Cardinal's run of dominant pitching in Omaha ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles should have scored more. They stranded 16 runners,  
nine in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Rich (3-1) came in after Wodnicki threw 11 pitches and got  
one out. Rich lasted 1 1-3 innings, allowing the go-ahead runs.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead As Pa. Hostage Standoff Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A hostage standoff at the state's largest  
mental institution ended today with a fired employee killing one 
hostage and critically wounding the other after police broke a 
window to get a better look at him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Czajkowski, a former Norristown State Hospital nurse who  
had held the hostages -- both nursing supervisors -- since Wednesday, 
shot and killed Carol Kepner, 52, state police spokesman Robert 
Whitbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski wounded the second hostage, 37-year-old Maria Jordan,  
who was flown to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 
where she was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski, 40, was taken away by medical helicopter with  
unspecified injuries. He also was in critical condition; doctors 
said his injuries did not include gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Neumar, the emergency room physician, said both were  
expected to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Czajkowski had been angry over being fired from his  
job two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was terminated and the two women he is holding were part of  
that decision,'' Whitbeck said today. ``He specifically targeted at 
least Maria Jordan. We don't know whether he knew for sure whether 
Carol Kepner would be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visibly shaken after the standoff ended badly, Whitbeck said  
that as of 8:45 a.m. today Czajkowski had become increasingly 
agitated. Police, who at that point could not see the gunman, 
decided to break in a window. 
</P>
<P>
	``Immediately on breaking one of the windows the subject opened  
fire,'' Whitbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The power had been shut down Thursday night and police  
negotiators worked round the clock talking to Czajkowski. But they 
said he did respond to conventional hostage-negotiation techniques. 
By this morning, he had apparently been awake for most if not all 
of the time since the standoff began about 10:45 a.m. Wednesday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Czajkowski had held the women in Ms. Jordan's office.  
Negotiators were in another room of the building, negotiating by 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of Ms. Jordan and Ms. Kepner had been brought in  
Thursday afternoon and were giving information to police. It wasn't 
immediately clear whether the families were at the hospital when 
the shooting broke out this morning. An unidentified man was loaded 
into an ambulance shortly after standoff ended, but it wasn't clear 
what was wrong with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital's 650 patients were moved to safe quarters on  
Wednesday. Areas away from the nursing offices continued to operate 
normally Thursday for the most part, with workers showing up for 
their regular shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 118-year-old hospital, situated on 233 acres, has a locked  
area where the worst of the criminally insane are kept. It also 
serves the chronically mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors have sought tighter security after dozens of patients  
walked away from the hospital without permission in the last two 
years.

	``Polls show that a majority of Americans think that getting  
kids off to the right start should be our No. 1 national 
priority,'' said Democrat Bill Bradley, who like almost everyone 
else running for president has raised family values forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians like to talk about children,'' he says. ``Just  
throw in a mention of children and you get an applause line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, more is at work than the verbal equivalent of kissing  
babies. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted this week to let schools post the Ten  
Commandments in what the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Robert 
Aderholt of Alabama, called a first step to ``promote morality'' 
and stop ``children killing children'' after the Colorado school 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is explicitly at the core of the two campaigns begun  
this week, those of Democratic Vice President Al Gore (``We must 
make family life work in America'') and Republican Gov. George W. 
Bush, the ``compassionate conservative'' who declares ``Some people 
think it's inappropriate to draw a moral line. Not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Lamar Alexander, calling child-rearing his  
overarching theme, declares: ``Families are broken. We've gotten 
busy. And we're not taking care of the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley asserts ``our children are becoming a blur. ... It's not  
supposed to be this hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family values theme of prior elections has turned into an  
all-out race to capitalize on people's feelings of inadequacy about 
the moral authority in their lives. It's not about putting a 
chicken in every pot, but letting values flourish in every home. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress and presidential candidates alike advocate  
more parental responsibility. Yet families are also getting the 
message that what has happened is not their fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, Republicans say taxes are so high and stacked against  
married couples that people must work too many hours to get by. 
Democrats say laws are needed to bypass inflexible employers and 
give parents the right to stay with an ill child or attend 
important school meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the public believes either party when it says  
we're going to solve this,'' says theologian Martin E. Marty at the 
University of Chicago. But he thinks people are glad it's on the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty is most struck that Democrats now feel compelled to talk  
about the traditional family. After years of easy divorce, the 
growth of single-parent families and the loss of familiar 
neighborhoods and organizations, the impulse to hold on to 
remaining old values crosses ideology, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today when everything else has collapsed you try to shore up  
what is only eroded,'' he said. ``That Gore is doing this is 
neither providing leadership nor dragging his feet. He's part of a 
force that is out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Gallup Poll found the decline of family to be the top  
worry, followed closely by crime. But experts are divided on 
whether Americans in fact have less free time. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study by the Council of Economic Advisers found families  
are spending an average of 22 fewer hours per week away from the 
job than they did 30 years ago. But other studies have found that 
time actually spent with children has remained fairly steady. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians are doing ``a lot of running around but not with a  
lot of information,'' says John P. Robinson, head of a 30-year 
research project at the University of Maryland on the use of time. 
</P>
<P>
	For months now Gore has been promoting a ``livability agenda''  
addressing time parents spend with children, traffic congestion and 
even the dispiriting vision of strip malls. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are our deficits now,'' he said in his campaign kickoff  
speech, ``the time deficit in family life, the decency deficit in 
our common culture, the care deficit for our little ones and our 
elderly parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the central prescriptions in a variety of presidential  
campaigns, including Gore's and Bush's, concern schools, 
preschools, and after-school care, steps that bow to the reality of 
two-income families and long hours apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has simply won,'' Marty said, gazing outside his  
downtown Chicago office at shoppers flocking into pricey stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of the market winning is, I see about every third  
person walking along with a cell phone. And they'll be doing that 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom and dad are never quite off work.''

<HEADLINE> US West Weighs Rival bid From Qwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street is closely watching U S West Inc.,  
the focus of two competing buyout offers, now that another 
telecommunications company involved in the takeover bids has made 
its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, a Colorado-based Baby Bell telephone company, is  
weighing a $34 billion offer from Qwest Communications 
International Inc. against a $32.5 billion bid from Global Crossing 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West and Frontier Corp., a Rochester, N.Y., long-distance  
phone company, had previously agreed to merge with Global Crossing 
Ltd. before receiving tandem bids from Qwest on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier said Thursday it is sticking to its deal with Global  
Crossing, which is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda. Now U S West 
must decide. 
</P>
<P>
	Billions of dollars hang in the balance of this bidding war as  
each of the companies place their bets on the winners and losers of 
the Internet revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The telecommunications industry is changing dramatically in  
attempt to serve residential and business customers who want to 
send and receive music, e-mail, television programming, movies and 
data. Both Qwest and Global Crossing are building global fiber 
optic cable networks to provide these services. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining forces with Qwest makes more sense, some U S West  
investors said Friday, because Qwest has a longer track record. 
Qwest and U S West are also both based in Denver and have a 
long-standing relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little bit more infrastructure and business planning  
in Qwest,'' said Catherine Zaharis, a portfolio manager for Invista 
Capital who owns about 1 million shares of U S West in her funds. 
``The merger might make more sense ... with Qwest than with Global 
Crossing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arguments for U S West siding with Global Crossing are also  
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing struck an agreement to acquire U S West last  
month. And although Qwest's offer was originally far superior at 
$40 billion, it eroded quickly as Qwest's stock price tumbled. The 
value of Global Crossing's bid, which will also be paid in stock, 
is structured to protect it from all but the most violent swings in 
the company's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement between U S West and Global Crossing, U  
S West was expected Friday to complete a $2.45 billion tender offer 
for about 10 percent of Global Crossing's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	If U S West backs out of the merger agreement, the company will  
have to pay an $850 million penalty fee to Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West must also consider Frontier's move. The companies were  
each promised a premium of about $2 a share if they both agreed to 
go with Qwest. If Frontier goes with Global Crossing, then U S West 
shareholders will be paid $65.94 a share instead of $67.64 if they 
choose Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to deliberate whatever is in the best interest of  
our shareholders and obviously will get that done in due course,'' 
said David Banks, a spokesman for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	If U S West rejects Qwest, than Qwest may decide to sweeten its  
bid, or take it directly to shareholders of U S West for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether U S West picks Global Crossing or Qwest, the deal will  
face intense regulatory scrutiny. Baby Bells are prohibited from 
offering long-distance service until they prove they have opened 
the local market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me as a (Qwest) shareholder to be interested in  
buying U S West today,'' said Catherine Jackson, a managing 
director for Trainer Wortham, which owns more than 500,000 shares 
of Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Qwest doesn't expect to get regulatory approval to sell  
long-distance phone service in U S West's 14 states until Jan. 1, 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something as a shareholder I really don't want to wait  
around for,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock jumped $1.93 3/4 to $37.93 3/4 Friday on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market, where Global Crossing's shares rose 93 3/4 cents to 
$49.75. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's shares climbed $1.06 1/4 to $58 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where Frontier's shares rose 56 1/4 cents to $58.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Mets 6, Cardinals 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mike Piazza homered to extend his career-best  
hitting streak to 21 games and the New York Mets beat the St. Louis 
Cardinals 6-2 Friday night for their fourth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was hitless in his first four at-bats before leading off  
the ninth inning with a homer off Mike Mohler. Piazza is three 
games short of tying the longest hitting streak in team history, 
set by Hubie Brooks in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgardo Alfonzo, who has an RBI in seven straight games, doubled  
twice and drove in two runs for the Mets, who have won 10 of 12. 
The Cardinals fell to 3-5 on their 13-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	Orel Hershiser (7-5) allowed one hit in five scoreless innings  
for his 197th career victory. He won for the fifth time in six 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser faced the minimum in the first four innings, picking  
off Ray Lankford after a walk in the second. Joe McEwing singled in 
the fourth and was erased on a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	After walking Fernando Tatis and Darren Bragg in the fifth,  
Hershiser got Eli Marrero on a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Turk Wendell relieved Hershiser and allowed a two-run homer to  
Thomas Howard in the eighth. Armando Benitez got the final four 
outs for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Acevedo (4-2) gave up four runs in 5 2-3 innings. The  
Cardinals had won in all six of his previous starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Cedeno went 2-for-2 with three walks and scored three  
runs. He also stole two bases, giving him a major league-leading 
37. 
</P>
<P>
	New York chased Acevedo with two runs in the sixth for a 4-0  
lead. The Mets loaded the bases with one out and, after 
pinch-hitter Matt Franco struck out, Rickey Henderson hit a two-run 
single. 
</P>
<P>
	Rey Ordonez, who is batting .436 in his last 11 games, made it  
2-0 in the fourth with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Lankford had his hitting streak stopped at 12 games. ... 
Right fielder Eric Davis returned to the starting lineup for St. 
Louis after missing six games with a contusion of the left rotator 
cuff. ... Cardinals manager Tony La Russa and pitching coach Dave 
Duncan were ejected in the eighth inning for arguing balls and 
strikes from the dugout.

<HEADLINE> Bush Rivals Use Mail for Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While George W. Bush soaks up money from  
deep-pocket donors, other Republican presidential hopefuls are 
raising money through the mail with letters that use the Texas 
governor's rapid rise as part of their pitch for funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Buchanan asks supporters not only to send money but to  
mail a preprinted postcard to the Bush campaign, declaring that 
``the nomination for president should be a contest, not a 
coronation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle's letters tell voters to reject  
the conventional wisdom. ``Folks in Iowa, New Hampshire and 
elsewhere don't take kindly to pundits and so-called experts 
telling them their votes don't count,'' he writes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar vein, a fund-raising letter from millionaire  
publisher Steve Forbes insists, ``Voters decide elections, not 
pollsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The direct-mail route is expensive, eating up the early dollars  
essential to young campaigns. Relying heavily on mass mailings, 
Quayle spent more than $1 million on fund raising during the first 
quarter of 1999 -- more than any other presidential hopeful, 
Republican or Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	But mail campaigns may be the best hope for candidates trying to  
stay in contention against Bush, who already boasts a string of 
endorsements, a big lead in fund-raising -- a hefty $15 million so 
far -- and constant media attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It activates people,'' Republican consultant Eddie Mahe said.  
``You get out a message and the hoped-for result is the people you 
are activating with fund-raising direct mail are the same people 
who are going to vote in Republican primaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mass mail is also an investment. While taking in money,  
candidates build lists of supporters whom they will reach out to 
time and again. Some people are willing to write several $25 checks 
to a campaign. Since the federal government matches 
dollar-for-dollar the first $250 of an individual's total 
contributions, those $25 checks are really worth $50 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you identify donors earlier in the campaign, you have more  
opportunities to go back to them,'' said Frank Cannon, campaign 
manager for another Republican aspirant, Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a third of both Quayle's and Bauer's early campaign  
contributions came in chunks of less than $200, according to an 
analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. Quayle took in 
$798,824 in small chunks, more than any other Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, in contrast, raised just 9 percent of his money from  
contributions of $200 or less. He relied instead on 5,373 donations 
of at least $1,000, more than the rest of the Republican field 
combined, during the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	And he did it while spending only $854,520, 11 percent of the  
$7.6 million he raised during the first three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor had  
more than 1,200 Texas supporters who not only contributed 
themselves but asked their friends and neighbors to donate as well. 
The Bush campaign sent out only one fund-raising letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has carefully limited his spending. At a $1,000-a-plate  
fund-raiser in San Antonio last month, he saved money by serving 
only peanuts and pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know how much it takes to raise $10 million?'' Bush told  
one of his fund-raisers, according to a person familiar with the 
conversation who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Zero. Nothing. 
Nada. Not one penny. Not one dinner. Not one piece of mail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, other candidates were spending most of what they  
raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who raised $1.4 million, less than one-fifth of Bush's  
total, spent more: $883,518, or 64 percent of his money. Quayle and 
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander went into debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because there's so much ostensible support going for Bush,  
they have to spend money in order to get the visibility and 
exposure that will keep them viable as candidates,'' said Herbert 
Alexander, professor emeritus of political science at the 
University of Southern California. ``They can't appear to be doing 
nothing when Bush is off running with all these endorsements.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Woos Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a move considered crucial to wooing  
foreign investors, Congress has voted to overturn a constitutional 
provision that enabled the government to confiscate foreign-owned 
property without compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a decision of enormous importance that allows us to  
sign investment protection treaties with many countries,'' Foreign 
Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto told The Associated Press on 
Friday. ``This is going to generate long-term employment and 
economic development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although never applied, the law overturned Thursday was widely  
considered to have dampened investment prospects in this 
violence-plagued nation in the midst of its worst recession since 
the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	President Andres Pastrana, whose signature is now required to  
enact the constitutional reform, had promised it during last year's 
election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will allow Colombia to ratify already-negotiated  
investment protection agreements with Britain, Peru and Cuba and to 
initiate agreements with the United States, Spain, France and 
Canada, said External Trade Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez, 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, 400 foreign companies operate in Colombia, employing  
some 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez said Colombia expects between $6 billion and 7 billion  
in foreign investment in the coming year.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Who Defected in Gun Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the 45 House Democrats who bucked  
their party by voting to loosen background checks at gun shows hail 
from districts with lots of hunters or other conservative voters. 
</P>
<P>
	They're much more likely than other Democrats to have received  
donations from the National Rifle Association. And some had to 
stave off strong Republican challenges last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats are reflecting, in many of these cases, their  
constituents and their districts,'' said Democratic political 
consultant Peter Fenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill that carried the divisive amendment ultimately failed  
in the House on Friday, but the battle over the amendment suggests 
that many Democrats learned a lesson from the 1994 election. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, the NRA and other gun groups helped the GOP capture  
the House for the first time in 40 years in part by hammering 
Democrats for votes to ban assault-style firearms and to give 
authorities up to five days to check backgrounds on those seeking 
to buy handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, 37 of the 45 Democrats who defected on the gun  
show amendment later voted with their party to defeat the larger 
bill, which Democratic leaders said didn't go far enough to control 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45 party defectors were led by Rep. John Dingell of  
Michigan, who sponsored the amendment that would have loosened some 
existing restrictions on firearms sales at gun shows. An avid 
hunter and former NRA board member, Dingell once described agents 
of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as ``jackbooted 
American fascists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Dingell's district is mostly suburbs south of Detroit,  
hunting is popular throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Democratic defectors regularly oppose gun control  
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dissenters were most of the House's ``blue dog'' group  
of conservative Democrats, including four of the five Democrats who 
voted to impeach President Clinton last December: Reps. Charles 
Stenholm and Ralph Hall of Texas, Virgil Goode of Virginia and Gene 
Taylor of Mississippi. The fifth, Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, did 
not seek re-election in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us in the South and in Texas, especially in rural  
areas, have a different perspective than those of us that come, for 
example, from urban areas in the Northeast,'' said Rep. Max 
Sandlin, D-Texas, who supported the Dingell amendment. ``We see it 
as a heritage, a connection to family history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not just regional. In addition to Dingell, from  
Michigan, the defectors included Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, who 
earned a 95 percent approval rating from the liberal Americans for 
Democratic Action in 1998. Obey, who represents Wisconsin's most 
rural district, also voted against the ``Brady bill'' background 
checks on handgun buyers in 1993 and the assault-style firearms ban 
in 1994. He voted for an unsuccessful GOP attempt to repeal that 
ban in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one Democrat who supported the NRA-backed amendment, Rep.  
James Traficant of Ohio, voted to keep the assault-style firearms 
ban in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic defectors include many in competitive districts,  
such as Reps. Leonard Boswell of Iowa and Ted Strickland of Ohio, 
as well as freshmen Ken Lucas of Kentucky and Ronnie Shows of 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA has been generous to congressional campaigns. In the  
last election, its political action committee gave $1.6 million, 
13th highest among all PACs, and the NRA spent more than $1 million 
on its own efforts to support or oppose particular congressional 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 31 Democrats who received NRA contributions in the last  
two years, 30 supported the gun show amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Democratic holdout was Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan, an  
NRA member and former state trooper who normally backs gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to have a check system, then it has to apply  
equally to everybody,'' said Stupak, who got $6,450 from the NRA. 
``If you buy a gun, whether you buy it down the street or at a gun 
show, you're subject to the same law. I think that's fair. I'm not 
restricting anybody's rights.''

<HEADLINE> Mets, Mariners Swap Pitchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets, seeking flexibility in their  
pitching staff, acquired hard-throwing right-hander Mac Suzuki from 
the Seattle Mariners for left-hander Allen Watson on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets general manager Steve Phillips said the team was impressed  
with Suzuki's fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to acquire a pitcher of Mac's ability,''  
Phillips said. ``He has a world of talent and he just turned 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had him touching 94 miles an hour with his fastball. It's  
nice to have that kind of an arm in our organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's struggled, but we're hoping to get him on track.''  
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki is the first Japanese-born player to play in the major  
leagues without starting his career in the Japanese professional 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Over three major league seasons with Seattle, Suzuki was 1-4  
with a 9.17 ERA in 23 games, including nine starts. This year, he 
was 0-2 with a 9.43 ERA in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The more experienced Watson, 28, has a seven-year career record  
of 47-54 with a 4.99 ERA in 165 games with St. Louis, San 
Francisco, Anaheim and New York. This year, his first with the 
Mets, Watson was 2-2 with a 4.08 ERA in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the recent addition of Pat Mahomes, who can work  
in middle relief and be used as a spot starter, plus the return of 
reliever Greg McMichael from the disabled list, made Watson 
expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal, the Mets also will receive a player to be decided  
later and the Mariners will get cash considerations.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Team To Use Banned Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The Spanish team ONCE said Friday that it  
would compete in the Tour of France with its sports director, two 
days after he was barred from the event. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, tour organizers said ONCE was free to enter, but  
without Manolo Saiz and the team's doctor, Nicolas Terrados. 
</P>
<P>
	ONCE said it had plans to take legal action against Tour  
organizers, according to a statement released by the Spanish team. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Tour, fearful of new drug scandals like those  
that marred last year's event, are seeking a clean ride for this 
year's classic, which starts July 3. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, they banned Frenchmen Richard Virenque, Laurent  
Roux and Philippe Gaumont, as well as the entire TVM team. On 
Friday, they added to the list the Italian team Vini Caldirola 
following the expulsion of the team's leader from the Tour de 
Suisse on suspicion of having used banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish team withdrew last year to protest how French police  
treated its members when the scandal erupted following seizure of 
performance-enhancing drugs. Saiz then criticized the Tour's 
director, Jean-Luc Leblanc.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with the key index slipping in Tokyo but surging in 
Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nikkei edged down 39.19 points to close at 17,431.26. On  
Thursday, the index gained 260.27, or 1.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks rose in early trading in reaction to overnight  
gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 
56.68 points on Thursday to close at 10,841.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks there were boosted by remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan, who indicated to Congress that only a modest 
interest rate rise may be in order to keep inflation tamed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei fell in the afternoon on profit-taking.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders said participants were cautious before the summit of  
leaders from the Group of Eight nations in Germany this weekend, 
though traders expect no major surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 119.32 yen, down 0.72 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
119.25 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares closed sharply higher, with the key index  
hitting a year high amid growing hopes that the overall 
vote-counting process following the June 7 elections will continue 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said the bullish trend of the Indonesia currency also  
helped fuel the buying frenzy. In afternoon trading, the U.S. 
dollar was trading at 7,295 rupiah, compared with its close 
Thursday at 7,280. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 3.9 percent,  
or 26.845 points, to a yearly high of 707.884. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares also closed higher, buoyed by indications that  
any rate hike in the United States is likely to be small, dealers 
said. The benchmark Straits Times Index rose 13.29 points to 
2,070.63. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in Hong Kong and Taiwan for public  
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply lower, as a  
late round of overseas selling sent the local market reeling into 
negative territory. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 37.40 
points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,091.81. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher. The 30-company  
Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSE Index) rose 11.56 points, or 
0.5 percent, to 2,429.64. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed only moderately  
higher as a weak resources sector tarnished gains by industrial 
stocks and banks. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 2,985.0, up 
4.7 points, or 0.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed generally mixed. The Korea Composite  
Stock Price Index rose 5.47 points, or 0.6 percent, to 837.73. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower on  
profit-taking. The Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip 
stocks, slipped 1.16 points, or 0.1 percent, to 786.63. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed slightly lower. The Stock  
Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index slipped 1.74 points, or 0.3 
percent, to 518.81.

<HEADLINE> Daly Struggles In US Open 2nd Round  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- The first round of the U.S. Open was a  
good day for John Daly. He couldn't follow it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who was one shot behind the leaders after an open-round  
68, slumped to a 7-over 77 today in breezy, challenging conditions 
at Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, I'm going to put four good rounds together,''  
he said. ``It hasn't happened yet, but hopefully I can put three of 
four together before I leave here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the hero of the everyman strolled up the 18th  
fairway with his shaggy blonde hair, orange-tinted sunglasses, 
expansive belly and cigarette dangling from his lips, soaking up 
the cheers of the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	The reception for Daly was more subdued after his dismal second  
round, which included a double bogey, six bogeys and just one 
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who is going to show up tomorrow,'' Daly said  
after Thursday's round, which turned out to be prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many times, he's fallen off the wagon of sobriety. Too many  
times, he's stumbled into an abyss of gambling debts and other 
personal woes. Too many times, he's staggered off the golf course, 
uncertain if this bedeviling game is really worth all the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly is a baffling, complex man, capable of pushing aside his  
demons every so often to demonstrate considerable skills with a 
club in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Daly won the PGA Championship. In 1995, he captured the  
British Open. The calendar says it's time for another major title, 
but it seems unlikely now. 
</P>
<P>
	``John can play that well at any time,'' said Tiger Woods, tied  
with Daly after the first round but now six shots ahead. ``He's got 
so much talent. Yeah, he hits it a long way, but he's also got a 
wonderful short game. People overlook his touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who has only four victories in his career, provided scant  
signs in recent weeks that he was ready to contend. He had missed 
the cut or withdrawn from eight of 16 events this season, including 
a meltdown at the Memorial two weeks ago. He dropped out after 
six-putting on the 18th green to cap a first-round 82. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even expect to make the cut when I came here,'' said  
Daly, who seemed likely to be playing on the weekend. ``I thought I 
would go home Friday evening and watch the rest of the tournament 
on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly started the Open with three straight birdies, but his  
putter wasn't as accurate today. He began with second round with 
five straight pars before falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel with my ability and talent, if I can get off to a  
decent start there's no telling what will happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Daly was one of nine players to shoot under par in  
the first round at The Olympic Club in San Francisco, only to 
finish with rounds of 75, 75 and 78. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered skipping this year's Open, saying he was tired of  
narrow fairways and 5-inch rough taking the driver out of his 
hands. But Daly decided to come to North Carolina after hearing of 
the wide, flat fairways where he could whale away with his big 
stick. 
</P>
<P>
	He did just that Thursday, using only one iron off the tee on a  
par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a major championship should be played to where you've  
got to play golf and not having to hit the 4-, 5- and 3-irons off 
the tees,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With typical candor, Daly discussed his ongoing battle with  
alcoholism that still seems capable of destroying his career at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are days when I get down on sobriety,'' said Daly, who  
has been seeing a sports psychologist the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	He also revealed to the News &AMP; Record of Greensboro, N.C., that  
he gambled away $9 million during the mid-1990s, sometimes wagering 
more than $200,000 on a single hand of blackjack. He managed to pay 
off most of the gambling debts but is struggling to cope with 
dwindling earnings on the PGA Tour -- less than $22,000 in the last 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``John is coming around,'' Payne Stewart insisted. ``I think he  
is in control of his life and he has thought of a way to play this 
golf course and he's doing a good job of it. More power to him.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Steel, Oil, Gas Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steelworkers seeking relief from low-priced  
imports are setting their sights on a Senate showdown next week 
over a controversial plan to impose quotas on foreign shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Steelworkers of America plans to make telephone calls  
and send a thousand workers to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a 
last-minute push on quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hundred steelworkers are leaving Michigan, Indiana and  
Ohio by motorcycle this weekend. Bikers from Pennsylvania will join 
them on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pulling out all the stops,'' union lobbyist William  
Klinefelter said Friday. ``We're going to make our voices heard 
here on Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is when the Senate is to take up a House-passed bill  
establishing comprehensive quotas on foreign steel shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has threatened a veto. Commerce Secretary  
William Daley and other administration officials have been 
contacting senators in person and by phone, urging the bill's 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry says quotas and other sanctions are  
necessary to counter low-priced imports it blames for thousands of 
layoffs and bankruptcies at three U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Quota critics say the provision would violate international  
trade laws and could launch a trade war likely to hurt U.S. 
businesses that rely on foreign export markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said he still was a few votes short  
of the 60 needed to clear a procedural hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight over quotas is expected to be more intense than the  
debate over a $1.5 billion loan program for domestic steel, oil and 
natural gas producers hurt by low prices. The Senate passed the 
loan bill Friday, 63-34, sending it to the House. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised a House vote  
on the loan bill, which would let steel companies borrow up to $250 
million and small oil and gas firms borrow up to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the loans would help  
companies tide themselves over but would not address the 
fundamental problems, namely the low-priced imports. Weirton Steel 
Corp. in his state is expected to qualify for the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program will give these manufacturers life enough to stay  
in business and make necessary capital improvements until we find a 
solution to this import crisis,'' Rockefeller said.

<HEADLINE> Tests: SUV Bumpers Crumple Easily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Sport utility vehicles have a tough image, but  
their bumpers are meek when it comes to a crash, a new study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety recently tested six  
1999 model midsize sport utility vehicles. Four of the six racked 
up a repair bill of more than $5,000 after hitting an obstacle four 
ways at 5 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very different from the rugged image utility vehicle  
manufacturers are selling,'' said Adrian Lund, the institute's 
senior vice president. ``Instead of rugged, a more appropriate 
description for the bumpers on these vehicles is flimsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for one automaker, however, said the bumper tests  
don't show how safe an SUV is to drive. Those high-speed crash 
tests are due out in several weeks, said Sheila Gruber McLean, 
spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler AG at the company's U.S. 
headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute previously tested 1996 models of the Jeep Grand  
Cherokee and Land Rover Discovery. Both got poor scores. The 1999 
models tested had been largely redesigned and had a slightly better 
performance than the 1996 models, the institute said. But they 
still racked up more than $5,000 in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six models tested, the Mercedes ML 320 scored the best,  
with $2,918 in total repairs needed from the four tests. The Lexus 
RX 300 racked up $3,293 in repairs; the Jeep Grand Cherokee, 
$5,107; the Dodge Durango, $5,153; the Land Rover Discovery, 
$5,226; and the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, $6,282. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Land Rover said it is satisfied with the  
Discovery's performance, especially since repair costs on the 1999 
Discovery were nearly $2,000 lower than repairs costs on the 1996 
Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In its tests, the institute drove the SUVs four ways: forward  
and backward into a flat barrier, forward into an angled barrier 
and backward into a pole. During the pole test, the Dodge Durango's 
tailgate opened during impact. The company redesigned the bumper, 
which stood up better in the second test. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean said the low-speed tests don't address whether the  
Durango and Grand Cherokee are safe in high-speed crashes, which 
she contends they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing for customers to remember is this (bumper  
test) is not a safety issue,'' she said. ``We're confident that in 
real-world experience, our vehicles provide adequate protection to 
occupants and drivers, which is the most important thing for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Bazemore, spokesman for Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America  
in Cypress, Calif., said the automaker is working on reducing the 
cost of repairs, but stands by the Montero Sport's overall safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each vehicle that our company sells in the United States meets  
or exceeds federal safety standards,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our engineering emphasis is on the overall protection of  
the occupants in our vehicles, we recognize that there is room for 
improvement in reducing the cost of repair. ... We've provided the 
(test) results to the appropriate engineers so the performance of 
our products can be improved in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason sport utility vehicles had such high repair costs is  
that they aren't subject to any government requirements to prevent 
damage in low-speed impacts, the institute said. Car bumpers have 
to meet federal standards for 2.5-mph impacts, and most have 
energy-assorbing foam to cushion the crash. Some of the SUVs do 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, SUV bumpers tend to cost more than car bumpers. The front  
bumper on the Land Rover Discovery is a one-piece system that must 
be completely replaced at a cost of $600, even if the crash damaged 
only one side, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean said the institute did not take into account that SUVs  
are designed to be driven off-road, which cars are not. That 
demands a different bumper, she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tests Military Planes for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- U.S military aircraft will be Y2K compliant and  
will be able to ``fly, fight and win on Jan. 1 and beyond,'' 
according to an officer overseeing exercises at Nellis Air Force 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Paul Avella, manager of Y2K Flag, said no surprises  
have been found in the four-day exercise, which ended Thursday. Y2K 
Flag is a major military exercise intended to assess the Air 
Force's ability to fight and win in the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	For three years, the Defense Department has been preparing for  
any computer glitches that might be encountered at the turn of the 
century, Avella said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Various aircraft were tested on the sprawling Nellis Air Force  
Range to determine if their complex computer systems are Y2K 
compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Avella said no surprises were found in the mix of aircraft  
tested. U-2 and E-8C ``sensor'' surveillance craft communicated 
successfully, and B-2, F-117 stealth fighter, F-16 and F-15 
aircraft responded to targets during a simiulated change of the 
calendar from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Assessments also were made in anticipation of potential  
airstrikes on Feb. 29 during a leap year, which occurs every fourth 
year and will occur in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Avella said potential problems include readings of calendar  
dates on aircraft and pilot communications. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid potential problems on Dec. 31 through Jan. 1 and on  
Feb. 29, dates can be reprogrammed. In the case of ground-based 
communications, vital equipment such as what Avella called a 
mission planning system can be fixed or ``patched'' through 
computer programming to function properly on those days. 
</P>
<P>
	Two F-15 pilots participating in the Y2K Flag were injured,  
neither seriously, when their planes crashed Tuesday. The cause is 
under investigation.
