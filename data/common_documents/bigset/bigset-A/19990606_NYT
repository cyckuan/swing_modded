SABRES SAY THEY'RE MORE THAN ONE-MAN SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
BUFFALO _ Dixon Ward was upset. Speaking after his team's Game 3
victory over Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals, the Buffalo
Sabres winger was saying how his team was more than a one-man show;
more than Dominik and the 20 Dwarfs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This team has the reputation of being an average team with a
great goalie,'' he said, blaming the Buffalo media for perpetuating
that reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres' image as a roster full of grinders fortunate to have
world-class goalie Dominik Hasek behind them has stuck. As a
Toronto Star columnist put it: ``The Sabres are a whole bunch of
fast guys with medium skill coming at you all night, with the Brian
Holzingers barely distinguishable from the Curtis Browns or the
Dixon Wards or the Geoff Sandersons.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Sabres have shown anything in their remarkable run to
the Stanley Cup Finals, it's that their overall talent has been
greatly underestimated. How else to explain their playoff-best 12-3
record?
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres say they've won three consecutive playoff series
thanks to teamwide scoring balance, improved play by key veterans
and the emergence of several young players, as well as the
goaltending of Hasek. Still, they said that The Dominator hasn't
had to be as brilliant in this postseason because of the improved
play of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different guys have stepped up every night,'' defenseman James
Patrick said. ``There's a lot of depth here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got speed up front and we're starting to get size up
front,'' winger Rob Ray said. ``It's a bunch of guys that are 10-20
goal scorers, except for \R40-goal scorer Miroslav Satan\S. I would
rather have that than three or four big scorers.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, there was little reason to expect a Sabres
sojourn to the Finals. After posting a 22-12-7 record in the first
half of the regular season, Buffalo stumbled home with a
second-half mark of 15-16-10.
</P>
<P>
   But key March trades that netted veterans Joe Juneau, Stu Barnes
and Rhett Warrener bolstered the club as did the improved play of
young defenseman Jay McKee, which strengthened Buffalo along the
blue line. Offensive-minded forwards began to check and
defensive-minded players began to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the last six weeks of the season we played as well
as a team defensively as any team in the league,'' head coach Lindy
Ruff said. ``The one thing any team needs in this league is to play
well at your own end. So there were a lot of good signs; we just
weren't getting much up on the board. Suddenly, offensively, a
couple guys broke out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have broken out in the postseason are defenseman
Jason Woolley, the Sabres' top scorer in the playoffs with 13
points, forwards Curtis Brown and Ward, who lead in goals with
seven and six, respectively, and center Michael Peca, who has added
firepower to his sterling defensive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of talent. I'm amazed,'' said Juneau, who came
over from Washington in March. ``I didn't really know Buffalo when
I played against them. We knew there was a lack of experience when
we played them last year \Rin the Eastern Conference final\S. But
these kids learned so much last year. Some of the key guys are 23,
24-years-old, and they're playing like 30-year-old veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo players say their biggest star, Hasek, has been as good
as he has needed to be, but that he hasn't been a one-man team in
the playoffs because that hasn't been necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played good, which has allowed him to play well,'' Ray
said. ``There were a couple games in the Ottawa \Rfirst-round\S
series where if we didn't have him, we might not be to this point.
But in the Toronto series, he really wasn't called upon to play
great because we were able to contain them up front. But one hand
washes the other.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Sabres, Ray said, ``It's not just one person. It's
everybody.'' / nn

<P>
   TIRANA _ Ten weeks of bombing by NATO, together with diplomatic
pressure from Russia, may at last be squeezing Serbia and its
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, into making large enough concessions to
end the war with the West over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As The Economist went to press, it was unclear how conditional
was Milosevic's apparent acceptance of a peace plan jointly
concocted by the Russian and American envoys for Kosovo, Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Strobe Talbott, with Finland's president, Martti
Ahtisaari, helping out as the EU's mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the outrage which the news provoked among several
leading Serb nationalists and prickly Russian generals, Milosevic
may indeed be steeling himself to back down.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is too soon to assume that peace will definitely
break out. But, for the first time since the war began, hopes are
rising that it will.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difficulty is still over the precise makeup of an
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, presuming that
Milosevic has accepted that all but a symbolic handful of his
forces should withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting off for talks in Belgrade on June 2, Chernomyrdin
said that ``NATO will command the NATO force, Russia the Russian
forces'' in Kosovo in any peacekeeping deal.
</P>
<P>
   NATO instantly retorted that it would insist on a single force,
with its own soldiers forming the core _ but acknowledged there
could be ``various areas of command'' in different bits of the war
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian's phraseology immediately fueled speculation about a
virtual partition of Kosovo. That is something which, at a pinch,
Milosevic has probably long contemplated as part of an exit
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   While diplomacy has been grinding on, NATO has been intensifying
its bombardment of the Serbs. Ironically, however, it has not been
a particularly bad week, militarily, for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Their armor and artillery still look just about capable of
fending off the kamikaze-style attacks of the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), even after enduring relentless aerial bombing and the
loss, according to NATO, of about 100 tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Such strategic facts must have been uppermost in the mind of
Milosevic, as he began parleying about a settlement with envoys
from Russia and the EU in midweek.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's forces could not indefinitely go on absorbing
punishment at the rate NATO has recently been meting it out, with
up to 400 air attacks per day by bombers now swooping in from
Hungary and Turkey as well as from NATO bases in Italy. But nor, it
appeared, have Serb forces been reduced to the ruined shell that
would force Milosevic to sue for a humiliating peace.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO's campaign, as usual, has not been without its share of
blunders.
</P>
<P>
   In what NATO described as a ``very small, very slight incident''
on June 1, its aircraft mistakenly dropped at least seven bombs on
the Albanian side of the border, scattering television crews who
had been observing a furious battle between NATO-backed Albanian
fighters and Serb forces using multiple rocket launchers to defend
the strategic slopes of Mount Pastrik, just inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days earlier, the alliance acknowledged that a bid
by the KLA to regain control of Kosovo's western highways had
failed. By June 2, NATO was describing the fighting as
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a breakthrough towards peace, the KLA will in any
case become increasingly awkward for the West, as well as the
Serbs, to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, the young KLA man who is the declared prime
minister of a provisional Kosovo government, instantly sniffed a
sellout when it emerged from the talks in Belgrade that Russian and
western peacekeeping forces might occupy different zones in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, within and beyond Kosovo, the political reality
has already changed. The Kosovars, nearly all of whom have been
displaced from their homes by the Serbs since the province
descended into war, have become much more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The semi-clandestine KLA has emerged as the only serious
fighting force of any kind in the Albanian-speaking world, which
embraces western Macedonia as well as Kosovo and Albania itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist who a year ago was reelected
president of the Kosovars in a semi-official poll, seems to be
losing fast to the guerrillas in a battle for ethnic-Albanian
hearts and minds.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova forfeited some credibility by spending the first few
weeks of the war under Serb ``protection'' and being seen on
television (apparently under duress) with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   His only visit to the refugees in Macedonia was a hasty affair;
he has not even set foot in Albania, where he has feuds with
politicians at both ends of the spectrum. As for the KLA, it would
give him a frosty reception, unless he accepted its authority.
</P>
<P>
   Even Albania's ruling Socialists, who tend to come from the
country's Orthodox, Greek-oriented south, and have little natural
affinity for the Kosovars, are now forced to back the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because it has little choice, the government winks at the
flow of arms and soldiers from its own (virtually worthless) army
to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Blushi, the government's diplomatic point man, acknowledges
that the KLA's moral authority in the eyes of all Albanians has
soared as a result of its battle with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   An ill-kept secret among the small army of foreign aid workers
which has descended on Albania (170 nongovernmental organizations,
as well as the U.N., are there) is that the KLA has become
entrenched in some of the camps where some 100,000 displaced
Kosovars are eking out an existence, and not just in border areas.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. denies evidence of guerrillas in the camps, but any
visitor to the Mullet camp south of Tirana comes across dozens of
uniformed fighters, not visibly armed but itching to go to the
front.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Albania's 3 million prewar residents could be forgiven
if they secretly fear that Kosovars will take over their country.
</P>
<P>
   Such worries will not unduly bother the West's negotiators as
they scent a weakening in Milosevic's resolve, however much he and
the Russians still insist on conditions that NATO will resist. But
at least, after the most taxing months in the alliance's history,
peace seems to beckon. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The mind of Slobodan Milosevic has long been a Balkan enigma. He
is both cunning and naive. He is ruthless and bloodstained, yet has
generally shrunk from confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   He is paranoid about his own security and believes deeply that
Serbia and Serbs are victims of history, yet he has remorselessly
bullied Serbia's smaller neighbors and has brutally persecuted
minority groups within his own reach.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to compromise with NATO, yet his assault on the
Kosovars made it ever harder for the alliance to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   He is coldly calculating, yet his strategic blunders over the
years have led to the collapse of the Yugoslav federation (from six
republics down to two) and to the devastation of Serbia, the
country at its core.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a genius at manipulating people and preserving power, or
will he, in the end, go down merely as a crassly shortsighted
dictator who brought disaster on his people _ and on himself?
</P>
<P>
   The indictment leveled against him on May 27 by the U.N.'s
International War Crimes Tribunal must have rattled him.
Geographically and tactically, he is trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Until the indictment, he had been quietly preparing an escape
route, should things suddenly go awry. He has relied _ as a link to
the world outside _ on close friends in Greece, whom he has often
visited in Athens and Crete.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Milosevic's son, Marko, has been in South Africa,
making financial arrangements for the family.
</P>
<P>
   All that, it now seems, is academic. A semi-rogue state, such as
Belarus, even Russia itself, might offer Milosevic an exile's
haven. But a Minsk suburb cannot be his ideal for a gracious
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cornered as he is, Milosevic is nothing if not a
master-wriggler. His lingering hope, of course, was that quarrels
within NATO and the force of Russia's pro-Serb feelings (perhaps
even promises of Russian arms and men) would yet produce a
compromise that would, above all, leave him in power _ by letting
him tell his people that their sacrifices were not in vain.
</P>
<P>
   That would have required NATO to agree not just to uphold
Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo, but also that some Serb forces
could stay there; that, if an international force came in, Russians
would be its mainstay; and that, at a pinch, the province might be
partitioned, even with only a small bit staying under Serb control.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as now seems more likely, Milosevic is preparing to back
down a lot further, could he survive?
</P>
<P>
   For a start, he is not much loved by his own people _ in times
of peace.
</P>

   Two years ago, street demonstrations nearly finished him off. He
probably has the solid support of only about a fifth of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the secret police and army, his family-connected network of
businessmen and cronies, who control much of the economy and suborn
enough politicians, and a slavishly deferential state-controlled
press all contrive to keep him going.
</P>
<P>
   The secret police are crucial. Two years ago, several of his
closest colleagues, including the then-interior minister, with whom
Milosevic had fallen out, met mysterious deaths.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a leading but insufficiently supportive newspaper
owner in Belgrade, Slavko Curuvija, was shot dead. One of the few
serious opposition politicians left, Zoran Djindjic, has had to
flee to Montenegro, Serbia's rebellious little partner in rump
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps even more important to Milosevic is his wife, Mira
Markovic. She is moody, vindictive, much ridiculed by Serbs at
large and, unlike her husband, who has no real ideology save the
pursuit of power, is a fierce Marxist who runs her own communist
party.
</P>
<P>
   She sees a world that will be dominated by Russia, China, India
and, yes, Serbia. She _ and he _ can surely not believe that that
dream can now come true. But at least the pair are determined still
to keep their battered country a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   In this they have the eager cooperation of their son and
daughter, both big in business. Nearly all state-owned monopolies,
including arms-making, are tied to the ruling inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The shady world of communist big business was, after all, how
Milosevic got going. His first big job was running the communist
state's main gas-import company. Then he ran its biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Old communist apparatchiks-turned-tycoons, such as Russia's
envoy for Kosovo, Viktor Chernomyrdin, are the sort of people he
feels comfortable with. If the Russian gas magnate and former prime
minister said the game was up, Milosevic might well have listened. &QL;

<P>
   But it is primitive nationalism, egged on by the self-deluding
myth of Serbs as perennial victims, that has become both
Milosevic's rescuer (when communism collapsed with the Soviet
Union) and his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stirringly virulent nationalist speech he made in
Kosovo, in 1989, harking back to the Serb Prince Lazar's suicidally
brave battle against the Turks a mere six centuries ago, that saved
his leadership when the Serbian old guard looked in danger of
ejection. Now he may have become a victim of his own propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that Milosevic, at moments of desperation, may be
inspired by a ``Lazar complex'' _ a feeling that, if the worst
comes to the worst, he could bring the whole nation crashing
heroically down around him under the weight of NATO's bombs.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly a darkly wretched streak in his background.
As a boy in Pozarevac, the north Serbian town where he was born 57
years ago, he was clever and competitive, running the school branch
of the Communist Youth League.
</P>
<P>
   Never popular, he was then scarred by a double tragedy when his
father, a Montenegrin schoolteacher who had wanted to be an
Orthodox priest, committed suicide; a few years later, his mother

<TEXT>
<P>
   The mind of Slobodan Milosevic has long been a Balkan enigma. He
is both cunning and naive. He is ruthless and bloodstained, yet has
generally shrunk from confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   He is paranoid about his own security and believes deeply that
Serbia and Serbs are victims of history, yet he has remorselessly
bullied Serbia's smaller neighbors and has brutally persecuted
minority groups within his own reach.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to compromise with NATO, yet his assault on the
Kosovars made it ever harder for the alliance to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   He is coldly calculating, yet his strategic blunders over the
years have led to the collapse of the Yugoslav federation (from six
republics down to two) and to the devastation of Serbia, the
country at its core.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a genius at manipulating people and preserving power, or
will he, in the end, go down merely as a crassly shortsighted
dictator who brought disaster on his people _ and on himself?
</P>
<P>
   The indictment leveled against him on May 27 by the U.N.'s
International War Crimes Tribunal must have rattled him.
Geographically and tactically, he is trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Until the indictment, he had been quietly preparing an escape
route, should things suddenly go awry. He has relied _ as a link to
the world outside _ on close friends in Greece, whom he has often
visited in Athens and Crete.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Milosevic's son, Marko, has been in South Africa,
making financial arrangements for the family.
</P>
<P>
   All that, it now seems, is academic. A semi-rogue state, such as
Belarus, even Russia itself, might offer Milosevic an exile's
haven. But a Minsk suburb cannot be his ideal for a gracious
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cornered as he is, Milosevic is nothing if not a
master-wriggler. His lingering hope, of course, was that quarrels
within NATO and the force of Russia's pro-Serb feelings (perhaps
even promises of Russian arms and men) would yet produce a
compromise that would, above all, leave him in power _ by letting
him tell his people that their sacrifices were not in vain.
</P>
<P>
   That would have required NATO to agree not just to uphold
Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo, but also that some Serb forces
could stay there; that, if an international force came in, Russians
would be its mainstay; and that, at a pinch, the province might be
partitioned, even with only a small bit staying under Serb control.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as now seems more likely, Milosevic is preparing to back
down a lot further, could he survive?
</P>
<P>
   For a start, he is not much loved by his own people _ in times
of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, street demonstrations nearly finished him off. He
probably has the solid support of only about a fifth of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the secret police and army, his family-connected network of
businessmen and cronies, who control much of the economy and suborn
enough politicians, and a slavishly deferential state-controlled
press all contrive to keep him going.

<P>
   Their campaign message is brutal and simple: find the box
numbered 33 on the ballot paper _ the one that contains the yellow
and green symbol of the Golkar party _ and make sure you vote for
that.
</P>
<P>
   All across Indonesia's vast archipelago the party of
ex-President Suharto constantly rams the message home: on
television, on posters and by having its supporters chant it
relentlessly at political rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a scent of change in the air. For the first time in
more than four decades, the ruling party is not guaranteed to win.
</P>
<P>
   When Indonesians go to the polls on June 7, they will have 47
other political parties to choose from. How they vote will decide
the future of the world's fourth-largest nation and possibly the
stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters from all sides have poured onto the streets, many in
carnival mood.
</P>
<P>
   Those backing the party of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter
of Indonesia's first president, have brought the capital, Jakarta,
to a standstill with a sea of red banners, flags and painted
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Those supporting Amien Rais, a popular Muslim leader, have
attempted to turn it blue with the colors of his National Mandate
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Such high spirits are in celebration not only of a free vote,
but also of the passing of the old order. But the jubilation is
premature and could prove dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia takes its first steps towards becoming the world's
third largest democracy, many hopes and expectations are bound to
be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the rioting and bloodshed that forced Suharto to
step down last May, the election could pass with relatively little
violence.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be reasonably clean. Mechanisms are in place to
protect against fraud, vote-buying and intimidation. But, despite
an army of overseas and local observers, ``money politics'' will
corrupt the result in some areas. By how much will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Their unduly optimistic expectations disappointed, some
opposition parties may feel they have been robbed of their chance
of power. Indonesia could once again descend into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Assume, for the moment, that this does not happen and, after
some initial venting of resentment, the election result is
accepted. Indonesia will still face an uphill struggle to defend
its rookie democracy.
</P>
<P>
   First comes the messy process of building a government, probably
a coalition. With its money and organizational advantage, Golkar
will still be the force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   The three most popular opposition leaders, Megawati, Rais and
Abdurrahman Wahid, another Muslim leader, have been united only in
their desire to unseat Golkar. On most other issues, their
differences are huge.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling and deal-making that are bound to follow will
confirm the complaint of many Indonesians that their new parties
offer few policies, only symbolism and rhetoric. That was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   During his 32 years of authoritarian rule, Suharto kept politics
as the preserve of an elite few. Nevertheless, new leaders and new
policies will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia's case, it is to be hoped that neither will widen
the country's religious and ethnic fault lines. That would tempt
intervention by another simmering group, the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The army has agreed that its role in national politics should be
reduced, but it could still brush aside its own reformers and try
to ``save'' a faltering country with a coup. Again, assume the
best.
</P>
<P>
   There still remain the restive provinces. In East Timor, which
Indonesia invaded in 1975, a referendum is to be held in August on
an offer of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the offer is rejected, President B.J. Habibie,
Suharto's little-liked and handpicked successor, has said that East
Timor could instead be granted independence.
</P>
<P>
   But some opposition groups reject this: they do not want the
vote to take place at all, or want it delayed. They are banking on
a big enough change at the center that they can talk not only the
East Timorese around, but also separatist groups in other
provinces, such as Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   And amidst all this something has to be done to fix the economy.
Indonesia has been one of the biggest casualties of the region's
economic crisis, but at least the reforms required by the IMF are
broadly agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Russia, capitalism does not have to be sold to
Indonesians. Nor are all of them victims of financial collapse: the
local economies in some outer islands, rich with exportable
resources, such as palm oil, have continued to grow throughout the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the changes have been wrenching, and are not
finished yet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although the June 7 elections are for the People's
Representative Assembly, the assembly will later provide most, but
not all, of the seats in Indonesia's highest legislative body, the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), whose job it will be to pick
Indonesia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   That election may not take place until November, and will also
involve MPR delegates from the army, the regions and different
sections of society.
</P>
<P>
   Such a long wait could itself cause trouble, especially if
Golkar is tempted to exploit it to tighten its political grip on
the presidency. It would be better to choose a new president
sooner, rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's election marks only the beginning of a long journey.
As a democratic giant with a free press and a growing economy, home
to 200 million people, it would be a defining influence for the
better in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That is a long way ahead. But things are moving in the right
direction. &QL;

will still be the force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   The three most popular opposition leaders, Megawati, Rais and
Abdurrahman Wahid, another Muslim leader, have been united only in
their desire to unseat Golkar. On most other issues, their
differences are huge.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling and deal-making that are bound to follow will
confirm the complaint of many Indonesians that their new parties
offer few policies, only symbolism and rhetoric. That was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   During his 32 years of authoritarian rule, Suharto kept politics
as the preserve of an elite few. Nevertheless, new leaders and new
policies will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia's case, it is to be hoped that neither will widen
the country's religious and ethnic fault lines. That would tempt
intervention by another simmering group, the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The army has agreed that its role in national politics should be
reduced, but it could still brush aside its own reformers and try
to ``save'' a faltering country with a coup. Again, assume the
best.
</P>
<P>
   There still remain the restive provinces. In East Timor, which
Indonesia invaded in 1975, a referendum is to be held in August on
an offer of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the offer is rejected, President B.J. Habibie,
Suharto's little-liked and handpicked successor, has said that East
Timor could instead be granted independence.
</P>
<P>
   But some opposition groups reject this: they do not want the
vote to take place at all, or want it delayed. They are banking on
a big enough change at the center that they can talk not only the
East Timorese around, but also separatist groups in other
provinces, such as Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   And amidst all this something has to be done to fix the economy.
Indonesia has been one of the biggest casualties of the region's
economic crisis, but at least the reforms required by the IMF are
broadly agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Russia, capitalism does not have to be sold to
Indonesians. Nor are all of them victims of financial collapse: the
local economies in some outer islands, rich with exportable
resources, such as palm oil, have continued to grow throughout the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the changes have been wrenching, and are not
finished yet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although the June 7 elections are for the People's
Representative Assembly, the assembly will later provide most, but
not all, of the seats in Indonesia's highest legislative body, the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), whose job it will be to pick
Indonesia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   That election may not take place until November, and will also
involve MPR delegates from the army, the regions and different
sections of society.
</P>
<P>
   Such a long wait could itself cause trouble, especially if
Golkar is tempted to exploit it to tighten its political grip on
the presidency. It would be better to choose a new president
sooner, rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's election marks only the beginning of a long journey.
As a democratic giant with a free press and a growing economy, home
to 200 million people, it would be a defining influence for the
better in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That is a long way ahead. But things are moving in the right
direction. &QL;

   IMRALI _ The trial of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of a 15-yearlong
Kurdish insurgency, offers Turkey a chance to show the world that
it can dispense justice freely and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is blamed for the deaths of some 30,000 people. He
certainly has a case to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, an American-based monitoring group that has
often castigated the Turkish state, says that Ocalan's outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) ordered the killings of thousands of
unarmed civilians, most of them families of Kurds who have obeyed
the Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors want Ocalan to hang _ for treason, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in court for the first time on May 31 on an island
called Imrali in the Sea of Marmara, Ocalan came across as a man
desperate to save his life _ at any price.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a bulletproof glass cubicle, Ocalan declared: ``I am
willing to serve the Turkish state so as to promote peace and
brotherhood between Turks and Kurds.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he could bring his men down from the mountains within
three months. But in order to do so his life must be spared, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His fighters do not, however, sound ready to obey. On June 2, a
suicide bomber killed two Turkish soldiers in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the PKK may already be viewing Ocalan as a traitor. So
far during the trial, he has refused to accuse Turkey's security
forces of abuses against the Kurds. And he told the court that he
had been neither mistreated nor tortured by his captors, echoing a
report issued after an impromptu visit in March by the European
Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
</P>
<P>
   One leading Kurdish human-rights activist said: ``We feel
betrayed, crushed. Ocalan no longer speaks for the Kurdish people.
He has no role left for solving the Kurdish issue.''
</P>
<P>
   If militant Kurds appear to be deserting him, Turkish
nationalists, who helped sweep the far-right National Action Party
towards power in a coalition government likely to be led by an old
leftist, Bulent Ecevit, are baying for his blood.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Action Party's slogans in its election campaign was
``Hang Apo,'' as Ocalan is known. He could well suffer that fate.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, partly
because the Turks have been hoping to join the EU, all of whose
governments are against the death penalty. But now that the Union
has pretty well slammed the door on Turkey's application, most
Turks say they no longer care what Europe thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans' calls for a fair trial only make Turks all the more
indignant. They point out that Italy, whose prime minister, Massimo
D'Alema, has called for Ocalan's life to be spared, could itself
have put him on trial when he turned up in Rome last November after
his expulsion from Syria, which had long let him operate from its
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is also gleefully using the trial to indulge in a bout of
Greece-bashing. In Ocalan they have found a more than willing
partner. He agreed with prosecutors that his men had indeed got
arms and training in Greece, which strenuously denies it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, international human-rights groups have sharply criticized
Turkey over its handling of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks from top to bottom,'' said one westerner watching
the proceedings. They cite the presence of a military man on the
panel of judges.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's lawyers complain that they do not have free access to
their client, that meetings with him, which last usually no more
than an hour, are filmed, and that notes taken during them are
photocopied by prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the arguments Ocalan has made during his often rambling
and incoherent defense, there is one that many Turks, as well as
Kurds agree with: that the Kurdish issue will not be solved by
Ocalan's death.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Turkish government now being assembled is willing to
meet at least some of the Kurds' demands, their rebellion (the
29th, some say, since the Turkish republic was founded 75 years
ago) will continue _ whoever leads it. &QL;

<P>
   Glad to see the back of Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinians are now
struck with the fear that Israel's new boss, Ehud Barak, may not be
entirely dissimilar to its old _ when it comes to dealing with
Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Barak has said anything to confirm this fear; it
is just that he has said nothing to dispel it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Palestinian anger is still directed at the outgoing
Likud government, which has continued to lay new time bombs for the
new men.
</P>
<P>
   The first bomb was the decision to start building houses for the
Har Homa settlement in occupied East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The initial decision to create a settlement at this site brought
the Oslo peace process to a halt in March 1997 and the Palestinians
have long tried to make a building freeze a condition for
restarting talks.
</P>
<P>
   Second, came the construction of new Jewish houses at the heart
of Ras al Amud, a densely populated Palestinian village in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most dangerous move came last week with the
announcement that Israel's outgoing defense minister, Moshe Arens,
had approved plans to enlarge Maale Adumim, a Jewish settlement in
the West Bank, by some 13,000 dunums (about 1,700 hectares or 4,200
acres).
</P>
<P>
   Situated between Jerusalem and Jericho, Maale Adumim is already
the largest settlement in the occupied territories, with around
24,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Should Arens's plans be implemented, it would make Maale
Adumim's municipal area larger than Tel Aviv's and effectively
extend Jerusalem's borders so far eastwards that it would split the
West Bank into two halves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much a provocation,'' commented Nabil Amer, one
of Yasser Arafat's ministers, ``as a declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have appealed to the Americans, the European Union
and the new Israeli leaders to have the order rescinded. They have
received some succour.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have criticized Arens's decision, as have members
of Barak's One Israel party and several Israeli left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   But from the prime-minister-elect himself the Palestinians have
heard not a word, save that he``will not be dealing with diplomatic
issues until he has completed the task of setting up his
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's silence would be more digestible were Palestinians not
also alarmed by the character his government appears to be
adopting.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of a ``grand coalition,'' his party is wooing Likud
and the pro-settler National Religious Party, amid rumors that
Barak has promised not ``to dry up'' the settlements and will honor
all decisions on expansion taken by the last government prior to
its fall in December 1998, including, presumably, the decision to
build Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a semiofficial conference in Ramallah pledged a
series of protests against Jewish settlement. These started with
``a day of rage'' on June 3, at which one Palestinian was killed,
and several injured, by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than a trace of fear behind the Palestinian
Authority's support for such demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Arafat has not only ruthlessly cracked
down on his Islamist opponents. He has also kept a lid on the
simmering discontent within his own Fatah movement by persuading
them that nothing should be done that would hinder the replacement
of Israel's ``anti-peace'' government with a ``pro-peace'' one.
</P>
<P>
   This was essentially the argument that won the day in April,
when the Palestinians reluctantly agreed to defer any unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood until after the Israeli
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But now those elections have come and gone, Barak is riding
high, settlements are being built and Arafat is looking like a man
with nothing in his pockets except his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Local Fatah leaders sound increasingly threatening. Arafat's men
are as concerned to keep their control of Fatah as to stop the
settlement expansion. When senior negotiators, such as Saeb Erekat,
plead with Israel's new men, their words have the ring of
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Barak must say something openly about the settlements,''
says Erekat. ``The choice is his, but it's either peace or
settlements. We can no longer have both.'' &QL;

the Oslo peace process to a halt in March 1997 and the Palestinians
have long tried to make a building freeze a condition for
restarting talks.
</P>
<P>
   Second, came the construction of new Jewish houses at the heart
of Ras al Amud, a densely populated Palestinian village in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most dangerous move came last week with the
announcement that Israel's outgoing defense minister, Moshe Arens,
had approved plans to enlarge Maale Adumim, a Jewish settlement in
the West Bank, by some 13,000 dunums (about 1,700 hectares or 4,200
acres).
</P>
<P>
   Situated between Jerusalem and Jericho, Maale Adumim is already
the largest settlement in the occupied territories, with around
24,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Should Arens's plans be implemented, it would make Maale
Adumim's municipal area larger than Tel Aviv's and effectively
extend Jerusalem's borders so far eastwards that it would split the
West Bank into two halves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much a provocation,'' commented Nabil Amer, one
of Yasser Arafat's ministers, ``as a declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have appealed to the Americans, the European Union
and the new Israeli leaders to have the order rescinded. They have
received some succour.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have criticized Arens's decision, as have members
of Barak's One Israel party and several Israeli left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   But from the prime-minister-elect himself the Palestinians have
heard not a word, save that he``will not be dealing with diplomatic
issues until he has completed the task of setting up his
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's silence would be more digestible were Palestinians not
also alarmed by the character his government appears to be
adopting.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of a ``grand coalition,'' his party is wooing Likud
and the pro-settler National Religious Party, amid rumors that
Barak has promised not ``to dry up'' the settlements and will honor
all decisions on expansion taken by the last government prior to
its fall in December 1998, including, presumably, the decision to
build Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a semiofficial conference in Ramallah pledged a
series of protests against Jewish settlement. These started with
``a day of rage'' on June 3, at which one Palestinian was killed,
and several injured, by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than a trace of fear behind the Palestinian
Authority's support for such demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Arafat has not only ruthlessly cracked
down on his Islamist opponents. He has also kept a lid on the
simmering discontent within his own Fatah movement by persuading
them that nothing should be done that would hinder the replacement
of Israel's ``anti-peace'' government with a ``pro-peace'' one.
</P>
<P>
   This was essentially the argument that won the day in April,
when the Palestinians reluctantly agreed to defer any unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood until after the Israeli
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But now those elections have come and gone, Barak is riding
high, settlements are being built and Arafat is looking like a man
with nothing in his pockets except his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Local Fatah leaders sound increasingly threatening. Arafat's men
are as concerned to keep their control of Fatah as to stop the
settlement expansion. When senior negotiators, such as Saeb Erekat,
plead with Israel's new men, their words have the ring of
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Barak must say something openly about the settlements,''
says Erekat. ``The choice is his, but it's either peace or
settlements. We can no longer have both.'' &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Wall Street may be where mathematics whizzes design
innovative financial products, but there is no lack of creativity
at the other end of the credit spectrum: lending to America's
``sub-prime market.''
</P>
<P>
   One new tool for putting cash in the wallets of
credit-challenged Americans is the ``payday loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Payday lenders typically offer a small amount of cash, from $100
to $300, in exchange for a personal check which is held, but not
deposited, for a short period of time (typically until payday).
</P>
<P>
   At the appointed day, the lender can deposit the check, return
it to the borrower in exchange for cash, or accept a fee to roll
the principal over into a new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Payday lenders do not require credit checks or collateral; they
demand only an active checking account and proof of a regular
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, they take their fee: 15-25 percent of the face
value of the check.
</P>
<P>
   When the interest rates on such loans are converted to an annual
percentage rate (APR), the numbers are staggering; a Chicago
Sun-Times survey of Illinois payday loan shops found the average
APR to be 569 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many low- and middle-income Americans appear to have an
insatiable demand for quick cash, even at that price. The number of
payday lenders in Indiana jumped from 11 in 1995 to 59 in 1997 with
the volume of loans climbing from roughly $13 million to $98
million.
</P>
<P>
   Check Into Cash, a Tennessee-based payday lending company,
opened its first store in 1993 and now operates a chain of 432
stores in 16 states, including more than 30 in Illinois. Last
autumn, the company made a preliminary filing with the SEC to offer
shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Payday loans have caused an uproar among advocates for the poor.
The Consumer Federation of America calls the practice ``legal
loan-sharking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay-day industry stands accused of preying on the poor while
making extortionate profits and misleading borrowers about the true
cost of their loans. Payday opponents offer anecdotal stories of
customers overwhelmed by mounting debt, such as the borrower who
rolled over loans 24 times in 15 months, borrowing a total of $400
yet paying back $1,364 and still left owing $248.
</P>
<P>
   But the true social cost of payday lending is more ambiguous.
For someone who is truly hard up, the only thing worse than
borrowing $200 at 600 percent APR may be not borrowing $200 at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of poor Chicago households, Susan Mayer, a professor
at the University of Chicago, found that the ability to borrow $500
significantly lessened the probability that the household would
suffer a ``spell of hardship,'' such as not having enough money for
food.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Check Into Cash argues that its customers are neither
poor nor exploited. The average customer earns over $34,000 a year
and has been at his or her current job for nearly four years; 36
percent of customers own their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth strategy is based on attracting the middle
class with new shops in malls and suburban supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   According to focus-group studies, payday customers are most
likely to use the cash for car and home repairs, Christmas
shopping, and school expenses, although inevitably some also use
the money to go on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   A significant portion of the respondents said that, if they had
not had access to a payday loan, they would have borrowed money
from friends or family, a choice which they describe as humiliating
and stressful.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives complain that using an annual
percentage-rate to evaluate the cost of a one- or two-week loan is
misleading. They compare payday loans to a taxi cab, which is
cost-effective for short distances but probably not the best way to
travel from New York to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting question is whether such companies are
making excessive profits. John Caskey, a professor at Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania who has long studied the ``alternative
financial sector,'' reckons that sub-prime lenders charge high
rates primarily because their transactions are small and the risk
of bad checks is high.
</P>
<P>
   Caskey has found that borrowers have little understanding of APR
but do appreciate that payday borrowing is an expensive form of
credit. Rather, the part of the transaction most prone to abuse is
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Some payday lenders reportedly threaten to use the criminal
justice system to prosecute delinquent borrowers for writing bad
checks, a crime that carries a jail sentence in many states.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states prohibit payday lending outright, usually as the
result of longstanding usury laws.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is working hard to roll back such statutes even
while consumer advocates argue that more regulation is needed, not
less. In fact, borrowers and lenders have usually found a way
around most restrictive laws.
</P>
<P>
   A more fruitful strategy may be to discover why Americans of all
income levels tend to spend more than they earn. A recent consumer
survey found that 55 percent of Americans occasionally lack the
funds to pay all their bills.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a booming economy, the number of Americans filing
for personal bankruptcy rose 73 percent between 1994 and 1997. &QL;

HIGH JAIL STORE MARKUPS, SPENT PROFITS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sheriff Joe Arpaio rakes in a profit of nearly $3
million a year by charging high markups to Maricopa County inmates
for phone calls and jail commissary goods, money that is supposed
to pay for inmates' ``education and welfare'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Arpaio is spending much of the money to help run and build
his jails, including expansion of the sheriff's much-touted Tent
City housing, an examination of records by ``The Arizona Republic''
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio's spending practices are under review by the state
Auditor General's Office. And an inmate-rights group maintains that
the 6,500 inmates aren't being provided sufficient job training,
drug rehabilitation and other programs that could dissuade them
from lives of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate advocates also complain that it's unfair for Arpaio to
levy big markups, such as $1.50 for an 80-cent bottle of shampoo,
or $36 for a $16.99 radio, to inmates awaiting trial who are too
poor to make bail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Arpaio maintains that the inmate fund is being used correctly
and that he saves the taxpayers money.
</P>
<P>
   Past reviews by state and county auditors and budget managers
support the sheriff's spending practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have experts that take care of these matters. The operation
seems to be appropriate as to how we're using these funds. But I
don't go around counting dollars and cents,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the $3 million in annual profits entrusted to the sheriff
from the inmate ``Special Services Fund,'' at least $920,000 was
recently spent in areas that critics say should be covered by the
sheriff's general operations budget.
</P>
<P>
   For example, $820,000 of the inmates' fund is spent each year to
screen and classify detainees when they arrive at the jails. And at
least $100,000 was spent recently for concrete, steel fencing and
utilities to create a Tent City wing for juveniles sentenced as
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Hamm, the head of Middle Ground, a prison-reform group,
says the classification of inmates is a basic constitutional
requirement and should be funded out of the jail operation budget,
not from the inmates' fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine how they can charge inmates for this,''
she said. ``If it isn't illegal, it smells to high heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials maintain that the use of the money for
classification legitimately helps the inmates' welfare by ensuring
that they are placed in the most appropriate jail facilities to
ensure their health, comfort and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a child molester, you don't want to be in a cell
with the wrong guys,'' said Glenn Christenson, the sheriff's budget
chief.
</P>
<P>
   Classification director Rick Bailey added that qualified,
college-educated personnel screen every inmate booked into the
jails. Each inmate is checked for psychological needs and
eligibility for inmate education and counseling programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could classify them by shoe size,'' Bailey said,
emphasizing the thoroughness of the classification efforts. ``This
goes above and beyond most jails in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sheriff's officials contend that the Tent City for
juveniles, dubbed ``pup tents,'' is part of an overall program of
education and job training.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of keeping inmates in Maricopa County jails is
among the lowest in the nation and only a fraction of the cost of
jails in other large metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   But paying for classification out of the inmates' fund is being
questioned by state auditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making sure the dangerous prisoners are separated from the
non-dangerous prisoners, is that for the welfare and benefit of the
inmates?'' state financial audit director Dennis Mattheisen asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to take a real strong stand when you've got these
vague statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the law governing the inmates' fund is the word
``may.'' The law says that the fund ``may be used for the education
and welfare of inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean the sheriff has authority to spend the money
only on inmates' education and welfare. Or it could be read that
the sheriff has permission to do just that, and also to spend it on
anything else he believes is proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell for sure what it means,'' Arizona State
University law Professor Paul Bender said. ``But in order to give
the statute some meaning, you have to interpret it to mean what he
should do with the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender said the law appears to mean that the money is for
``extra things'' beyond food and housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the sheriff uses the money to build jails, that would seem
wrong to me,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Dipping into the inmate welfare account for jail operations
might not be so objectionable if more education and welfare
programs were provided, activist Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia jails, which house a similar number of inmates as
Maricopa County's, provided drug-related programs to 2,600 inmates
in 1997, according to the Criminal Justice Institute, of
Middletown, Conn., a national consulting group that tracks data on
prisons and jails.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the group found that Maricopa County jails, which
hold 1,000 more prisoners than Philadelphia's, provided
drug-related programs that year to just 180 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In all, Maricopa County sheriff's officials say they spend more
than $1.5 million each year on various inmate education programs,
including library, religious and legal services. In addition, the
Sheriff's Office used the inmates' funds for computers, books,
pencils and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Thelda Williams, who heads inmate programs for Arpaio, said
participation in inmate programs ranges from as few as two inmates
being tutored in a literacy program to as many as 3,500 who weekly
attend religious services.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance in other inmate programs, she said, varies from the
500 inmates who attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to the 80
enrolled in the jail's ``intensive'' substance abuse program. The
jails offer a dozen other education and self-help programs,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamm said she believes these programs are inadequate and
simply provide the sheriff with cover for a ``gargantuan petty cash
fund.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason they're doing any programs at all is they'd
(otherwise) be totally caught with their hands in the cookie jar,''
she said. ``It should raise the red flag for any auditor.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law governing jail canteen funds, county supervisors
can order audits every two years. No such audit has been done since
1990. But Fulton Brock, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of
Supervisors, is considering one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to evaluate that (the need for an audit),'' Brock
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to how the money is being spent, an audit might look
at the prices being charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is gouging, it probably would be something we'd want
to look at more closely,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Most jail inmates are citizens who haven't been convicted of a
crime and are too poor to bail themselves out while they await
trial, or they are convicts sentenced to less than a year's
imprisonment for misdemeanors and lesser felonies such as drug
abuse, burglary and drunken driving. Those sentenced to longer
terms are transferred to state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   But, in jail, if inmates want virtually anything beyond a bunk
and toilet, they have to pay the sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Jail inmates must use the sheriff's collect-call telephone
system, at $1.65 per local call, because no other calls are allowed
out of the jail.
</P>
<P>
   And they must buy all but the most basic sanitation items at the
jail canteens. The Sheriff's Office also sells them things like
candy and over-the-counter medications for up to twice the cost. To
prevent contraband, families are forbidden to send anything into
the jails.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hare, who is living on Social Security and recovering
from a stroke, regularly goes to the Madison Street Jail to deposit
money into a friend's account while he awaits trial for auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it stinks,'' Hare said. ``I have $65 a month after I
pay rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, she said, her contributions are taken from her friend's
canteen account to pay a monthly charge of $30 per inmate for jail
food. Since charges for food were imposed in August, canteen sales
have plunged more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff responded in January with a price increase, even
though suppliers had recently reduced the cost of most canteen
items, according to financial reports obtained by ``The Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' said Matthew Hansen, 22, as he pulled a
palm-size radio from his pocket while leaving the Madison Street
Jail. The Gilbert man said he had just served six months for
driving under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost $30,'' he said. ``You could get it on the outside for
$8.''
</P>
<P>
   The canteen price of a portable radio with earphones is $36. The
Sheriff's Office pays $16.99 per set. Cheaper ones don't work deep
in the concrete jails.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen did not complain about the 75-cent canteen charge for
candy bars or the $1.50 price of a 16-ounce bottle of generic
shampoo, even when told that the sheriff pays only 33 cents for the
candy and 80 cents for the shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about normal,'' Hansen said of the prices for most
products.
</P>
<P>
   Budget director Christenson contends that canteen prices are not
out of line. They are adjusted yearly to fall somewhere in the
range of prices charged at convenience, grocery and discount
stores, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hansen's mother, Paula, said her son's jail stay was costly.
She made deposits regularly to his account.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked, so he had money,'' she said. ``It's gone now.'' &QL;

The Consumer Federation of America calls the practice ``legal
loan-sharking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay-day industry stands accused of preying on the poor while
making extortionate profits and misleading borrowers about the true
cost of their loans. Payday opponents offer anecdotal stories of
customers overwhelmed by mounting debt, such as the borrower who
rolled over loans 24 times in 15 months, borrowing a total of $400
yet paying back $1,364 and still left owing $248.
</P>
<P>
   But the true social cost of payday lending is more ambiguous.
For someone who is truly hard up, the only thing worse than
borrowing $200 at 600 percent APR may be not borrowing $200 at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of poor Chicago households, Susan Mayer, a professor
at the University of Chicago, found that the ability to borrow $500
significantly lessened the probability that the household would
suffer a ``spell of hardship,'' such as not having enough money for
food.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Check Into Cash argues that its customers are neither
poor nor exploited. The average customer earns over $34,000 a year
and has been at his or her current job for nearly four years; 36
percent of customers own their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth strategy is based on attracting the middle
class with new shops in malls and suburban supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   According to focus-group studies, payday customers are most
likely to use the cash for car and home repairs, Christmas
shopping, and school expenses, although inevitably some also use
the money to go on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   A significant portion of the respondents said that, if they had
not had access to a payday loan, they would have borrowed money
from friends or family, a choice which they describe as humiliating
and stressful.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives complain that using an annual
percentage-rate to evaluate the cost of a one- or two-week loan is
misleading. They compare payday loans to a taxi cab, which is
cost-effective for short distances but probably not the best way to
travel from New York to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting question is whether such companies are
making excessive profits. John Caskey, a professor at Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania who has long studied the ``alternative
financial sector,'' reckons that sub-prime lenders charge high
rates primarily because their transactions are small and the risk
of bad checks is high.
</P>
<P>
   Caskey has found that borrowers have little understanding of APR
but do appreciate that payday borrowing is an expensive form of
credit. Rather, the part of the transaction most prone to abuse is
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Some payday lenders reportedly threaten to use the criminal
justice system to prosecute delinquent borrowers for writing bad
checks, a crime that carries a jail sentence in many states.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states prohibit payday lending outright, usually as the
result of longstanding usury laws.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is working hard to roll back such statutes even
while consumer advocates argue that more regulation is needed, not
less. In fact, borrowers and lenders have usually found a way
around most restrictive laws.
</P>
<P>
   A more fruitful strategy may be to discover why Americans of all
income levels tend to spend more than they earn. A recent consumer
survey found that 55 percent of Americans occasionally lack the
funds to pay all their bills.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a booming economy, the number of Americans filing
for personal bankruptcy rose 73 percent between 1994 and 1997. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Wall Street may be where mathematics whizzes design
innovative financial products, but there is no lack of creativity
at the other end of the credit spectrum: lending to America's
``sub-prime market.''
</P>
<P>
   One new tool for putting cash in the wallets of
credit-challenged Americans is the ``payday loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Payday lenders typically offer a small amount of cash, from $100
to $300, in exchange for a personal check which is held, but not
deposited, for a short period of time (typically until payday).
</P>
<P>
   At the appointed day, the lender can deposit the check, return
it to the borrower in exchange for cash, or accept a fee to roll
the principal over into a new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Payday lenders do not require credit checks or collateral; they
demand only an active checking account and proof of a regular
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, they take their fee: 15-25 percent of the face
value of the check.
</P>
<P>
   When the interest rates on such loans are converted to an annual
percentage rate (APR), the numbers are staggering; a Chicago
Sun-Times survey of Illinois payday loan shops found the average
APR to be 569 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many low- and middle-income Americans appear to have an
insatiable demand for quick cash, even at that price. The number of
payday lenders in Indiana jumped from 11 in 1995 to 59 in 1997 with
the volume of loans climbing from roughly $13 million to $98
million.
</P>
<P>
   Check Into Cash, a Tennessee-based payday lending company,
opened its first store in 1993 and now operates a chain of 432
stores in 16 states, including more than 30 in Illinois. Last
autumn, the company made a preliminary filing with the SEC to offer
shares to the public.
</P>

CHURCH IN TURMOIL; PARISHIONERS SAY DIOCESE SLIGHTING THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It was a church born of turmoil in the mid-1920s, made
up of HispanicCatholics who had tired of racism and being forced to
sit in the basement of St. Mary's for services.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in central Phoenix is at
loggerheads with the Catholic hierarchy once again, saying that the
language and cultural needs of its predominantly immigrant,
Spanish-speaking parishioners are being slighted.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the decision by the Phoenix diocese to combine
Immaculate Heart's huge congregation with that of St. Anthony
Church and a smaller mission church under the stewardship of one
Spanish-speaking priest, Father Saul Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   It's a move admittedly of desperation, said Father Prudencio
Rodriguez, vicar for the Phoenix diocese Hispanic ministry.
Rodriguez said that the diocese, which has more than 100 parishes
and missions, has only about 20 priests who are fluent in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   And those bilingual priests are being spread increasingly thin.
Half of the diocese's parishes and missions have at least one Mass
weekly in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Diocese officials estimate that they have twice as many
Spanish-speaking people attending Mass as they did a decade ago
because of the wave of immigration, primarily from Mexico, which
has come to the Valley in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the shortage of Spanish-speaking priests is receiving little
sympathy from the congregation at Immaculate Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipers fear that the new priest will change the church's
Mexican customs, cut the number of Spanish-speaking Masses and
maybe even close the church.
</P>
<P>
   Members have been marching in protest repeatedly from the church
to the diocese headquarters a half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez strongly denies that any changes are being planned at
Immaculate Heart, apart from bringing in Madrid and a new assistant
pastor. Madrid did not return calls to his office at St. Anthony
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bishop gave them one of his best men. Sometimes it just
makes me want to scratch my head,'' Rodriguez said, adding that
Madrid is from Mexico and bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Immaculate Heart sent 6,000 signed petitions in
protest of Madrid's appointment to head their church to Bishop
Thomas O'Brien. When Rodriguez was sent to meet with the
congregation, the situation was inflamed even more when the vicar
suggested that those turning in petitions had gone to a Kmart
parking lot for signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the parishioners of Immaculate Heart wrote a
letter to the central office of the U.S. Catholic church in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parish, we believe that due to our Hispanic heritage,
Bishop O'Brien and the diocesan staff that advise him in these
matters disrespected and gave no consideration to our feelings,
needs or opinions,'' the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation demanded in the letter that Father Jose Corral,
the assistant to Father Antonio Sotelo, the current priest at the
church, be elevated to that position. It also demanded that all
current Masses and other church activities be kept intact and that
separate church organizations be retained at both Immaculate Heart
and St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also demanded that all Immaculate Heart employees be
allowed to keep their jobs at their current salaries. Madrid has
said that all church employees must reapply for their jobs, which
church members likened in their letter to the management style of
``an executive officer of a major corporation with no regard for
the personal lives of the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation also fears that Madrid will eliminate a host of
special Masses at Immaculate Heart celebrating Latin American
traditions like a girl's 15th birthday, mariachi Masses for Mexican
weddings and posadas in the Christmas season, which honor Joseph
and Mary on their journey to find an inn for the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said changes can be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theology of Saul (Madrid) is not that of Tony (Sotelo),''
Rodriguez said. ``Immaculate Heart is like a church in Mexico with
a lot of images and religiosity. But we also need to bring it into
the theology of the Second Vatican Council and make it a church
which is much more inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of Immaculate Heart attending a wedding Saturday
afternoon said that all the protests and angry words amount to
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get down to it, whoever is priest, we will go down
and worship,'' Anthony Jurado said. ``In the end, God is in
charge.''

<P>
   The folks at the VA hospital want to know why a news writer is
wandering around the place when Memorial Day is nearly a week past
and the extra flags have been taken down outside the building and
the TV trucks that fill up the parking lot once a year are long
since gone.
</P>
<P>
   It had to do with my old man's dog tags, I say.
</P>
<P>
   My boy, who's 7, asked me if he could wear them on Memorial Day,
``because Pap Pap was in the Army and this is the day for
remembering Army men.'' So I said OK.
</P>
<P>
   The tinny World War II tags dangled around his neck all day,
with him pointing them out to grocery store baggers and coffee shop
patrons and a clerk at the video store and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of the day, he took them off and set them down
and hasn't mentioned them since, which is how most of us treat
veterans, as a curiosity, for one day a year.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that right?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside me in a small office in the VA hospital,
listening, is Louise Ellis, a woman of proper Southern upbringing
who'd never think of telling the gentleman in her presence that
he's full of it. Not directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well my goodness, no,'' she says, her Mississippi accent
hanging like perfume on the words. ``We have over 1,000 volunteers
here. They aren't all as crazy as I am, coming in most every day.
But, they love it. If you stay home you may have a beautiful yard
and pretty flowers, but who is that helping?'' &QL; 
`I go where I'm needed' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On this day, as on most days, Mrs. Ellis arrived at the Carl T.
Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center shortly before 5 a.m. She
opens the offices in the hospital's gastrointestinal department,
where most of her volunteer hours are spent, then gets to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on I may do some typing,'' she says. ``But you never
know from day to day what you'll end up doing. I go where I'm
needed. I've probably been hired and fired more than anybody in the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise began volunteering at the VA hospital in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, B.C., was a patient at the time, and Louise decided
to help the nurses. After B.C. died, Louise stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   And on.
</P>
<P>
   And on.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of March, she'd accumulated a total of 38,179
volunteer hours. Which is roughly 1,583 days. Which is four years
and four months worth. Of 24-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gracious,'' Louise says. ``All that does is prove I'm old.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, that's not at all what it proves. It proves there
are people out there better than you and I, more generous, more
committed, and one of them is Louise Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   She actually took a few months off from volunteering recently,
but only because she fell and broke her kneecap in three places.
She came back with wire still holding the bone together, a little
slower but no less determined.
</P>
<P>
   Walking with her along a hallway, nurses and doctors stop to say
hello, along with a fellow who once helped her plant flowers
outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave a bouquet to every lady in the place, remember?'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why yes,'' she answers, hugging him. &QL; 
The human touch &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the ward where she spends most of her time, Dr. Francisco
Ramirez says, ``We have to do more and more things faster. We have
computers. Everything is fast. Sometimes, we lose the human touch.
Volunteers like Louise remind us about that. About the human
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   She often sits with patients during medical procedures, holding
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that what we're supposed to all do for one another?''
she says. ``Besides, I get a lot more out of it than the veterans
do. Anybody would.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been thousands of them over the years. They're part
of her family, now, like her two daughters and her relatives living
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, to Louise, there's really no such thing as Memorial
Day. A person who never forgets doesn't need a reminder. &QL;

SHERIFF (Phoenix) _ Sheriff Joe Arpaio rakes in a profit of nearly
$3 million a year by charging high markups to Maricopa County
inmates for phone calls and jail commissary goods, money that is
supposed to pay for inmates' ``education and welfare'' programs.
But Arpaio is spending much of the money to help run and build his
jails, including expansion of the sheriff's much-touted Tent City
housing, an examination of records by ``The Arizona Republic''
shows. Arpaio's spending practices are under review by the state
Auditor General's Office. And an inmate-rights group maintains that
the 6,500 inmates aren't being provided sufficient job training,
drug rehabilitation and other programs that could dissuade them
from lives of crime. Story by MIKE McCLOY. Will move in the ``A''

wandering around the place when Memorial Day is nearly a week past
and the extra flags have been taken down outside the building and
the TV trucks that fill up the parking lot once a year are long
since gone.
</P>
<P>
   It had to do with my old man's dog tags, I say.
</P>
<P>
   My boy, who's 7, asked me if he could wear them on Memorial Day,
``because Pap Pap was in the Army and this is the day for
remembering Army men.'' So I said OK.
</P>
<P>
   The tinny World War II tags dangled around his neck all day,
with him pointing them out to grocery store baggers and coffee shop
patrons and a clerk at the video store and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of the day, he took them off and set them down
and hasn't mentioned them since, which is how most of us treat
veterans, as a curiosity, for one day a year.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that right?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside me in a small office in the VA hospital,
listening, is Louise Ellis, a woman of proper Southern upbringing
who'd never think of telling the gentleman in her presence that
he's full of it. Not directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well my goodness, no,'' she says, her Mississippi accent
hanging like perfume on the words. ``We have over 1,000 volunteers
here. They aren't all as crazy as I am, coming in most every day.
But, they love it. If you stay home you may have a beautiful yard
and pretty flowers, but who is that helping?'' &QL; 
`I go where I'm needed' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On this day, as on most days, Mrs. Ellis arrived at the Carl T.
Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center shortly before 5 a.m. She
opens the offices in the hospital's gastrointestinal department,
where most of her volunteer hours are spent, then gets to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on I may do some typing,'' she says. ``But you never
know from day to day what you'll end up doing. I go where I'm
needed. I've probably been hired and fired more than anybody in the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise began volunteering at the VA hospital in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, B.C., was a patient at the time, and Louise decided
to help the nurses. After B.C. died, Louise stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   And on.
</P>
<P>
   And on.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of March, she'd accumulated a total of 38,179
volunteer hours. Which is roughly 1,583 days. Which is four years
and four months worth. Of 24-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gracious,'' Louise says. ``All that does is prove I'm old.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, that's not at all what it proves. It proves there
are people out there better than you and I, more generous, more
committed, and one of them is Louise Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   She actually took a few months off from volunteering recently,
but only because she fell and broke her kneecap in three places.
She came back with wire still holding the bone together, a little
slower but no less determined.
</P>
<P>
   Walking with her along a hallway, nurses and doctors stop to say
hello, along with a fellow who once helped her plant flowers
outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave a bouquet to every lady in the place, remember?'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why yes,'' she answers, hugging him. &QL; 
The human touch &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the ward where she spends most of her time, Dr. Francisco
Ramirez says, ``We have to do more and more things faster. We have
computers. Everything is fast. Sometimes, we lose the human touch.
Volunteers like Louise remind us about that. About the human
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   She often sits with patients during medical procedures, holding
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that what we're supposed to all do for one another?''
she says. ``Besides, I get a lot more out of it than the veterans
do. Anybody would.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been thousands of them over the years. They're part
of her family, now, like her two daughters and her relatives living
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, to Louise, there's really no such thing as Memorial
Day. A person who never forgets doesn't need a reminder. &QL;

NO SAVING RED SOX THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BRAVES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   Usually after nailing down a save _ and there have been many
over the past two years _ Tom Gordon looks to the heavens in praise
of God. Saturday, he couldn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   The unfamiliar scene saw Gordon walking off the mound with his
head down after a 6-5 Braves win before 32,793 at Fenway Park as
the Red Sox' first-place lead over the Yankees in the American
League East dropped to a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   As astonishing as it was to watch Pedro Martinez dominate the
Braves Friday night, there was no greater surprise to the fandom
than Gordon squandering a one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have been able to do anything different,'' said
Gordon, whose streak of 54 straight saves, a major league record,
ended. ``I think the last couple of times out I was getting behind
the hitters and I was trying to avoid that. I probably threw too
many strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning hit, a scorching two-out grounder down the
left-field line in the ninth by catcher Javy Lopez, was a case in
point. Lopez had been having a tough day _ 0 for 4 with a double
play and two strikeouts. He had been retired on curveballs from Sox
starter Brian Rose and Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   So Gordon threw the curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he was supposed to,'' said pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan. ``He threw the right pitch. He had very good stuff. This
is a team of excellent professional hitters on the Braves. They're
a fine club.''
</P>
<P>
   What hurt was not being able to beat Greg Maddux, the four-time
Cy Young Award winner, when they had such a good chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough pitcher, a great pitcher,'' said Brian Daubach of
Maddux, who won his first game since April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach gave the Sox the lead in a wild eighth inning, when the
Braves threw the ball around.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman (2 for 4) reached on a bloop single to center, and
after John Valentin struck out, Maddux tossed a wild pitch.
Offerman ended up on third when Perez's throw sailed over Bret
Boone's glove at second.
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch, Daubach delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept coming at (Maddux), but he does a great job of mixing
his pitches and keeping you off balance,'' said Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 4-2, against Maddux after Brian Jordan hit a Rose
changeup for a three-run homer in the fifth, the Sox tied it at 4
by scoring twice in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback began when Valentin stroked his second hit, a
single to center, with one out. He advanced to third on Daubach's
second hit, a double to right on which Jordan made a navigational
error, taking a strange route to a ball he had a chance of
catching.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Randall Simon made a nice diving grab of Nomar
Garciaparra's wicked grounder near the bag, which scored Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux thought he had Troy O'Leary struck out on a 2-2 pitch,
but plate umpire Tim Tschida did not call the low pitch a strike,
giving O'Leary life. He singled past Maddux into center to score
the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good-hitting ballclub,'' said Maddux. ``They don't
have too many guys who go up there and hack. They try to (take)
what the pitcher gives them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose left after five innings with a career-high six strikeouts,
issuing four walks and giving up four hits. He retired the first
two batters of the fifth and was sailing along until Bret Boone
singled off the wall and Chipper Jones walked. That brought
Kerrigan out for a chat. Then Jordan hit a low fastball 410 feet
over the screen in left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose got some key outs for us,'' said manager Jimy Williams.
``I thought he pitched real good. He really battled.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose was replaced by Lowe, who pitched three scoreless innings
and was outstanding with men on base.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hit an RBI single in the first, but Rose prevented
further damage by inducing Javy Lopez into a 5-4-3 double play.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra singled and stole his seventh base in the second
inning and scored on Jason Varitek's two-out triple to the
triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Presented a similar two-out opportunity, Darren Lewis failed to
get the go-ahead run in, watching a third strike on the outside
corner.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, there was an unusual feat against Maddux: the Sox
scored a two-out run. Valentin doubled off the wall and scored on
Daubach's wall single, giving the Sox a 2-1 lead. Daubach, however,
was gunned down at second by left fielder Ryan Klesko.

A MINOR MIRACLE IN PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 BRUINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ They had just struggled to a 4-4 tie with Saint
John after a 2-4 start to the season, and now the Providence Bruins
were experiencing one of the perks of American Hockey League life:
a seven-hour bus grind, New Brunswick to Rhode Island, through a
godforsaken October night, from backwater to border to boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, this is quality time for the self-pitying; the only
thing darker than his surroundings is the minor leaguer's soul. He
spends such trips whining and bellyaching and cursing the
ignoramuses who somehow have failed to realize that he should at
this very moment be enjoying a catered midnight snack aboard a
National Hockey League charter flight.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no kvetching on this wilderness tour; in fact,
sitting at the front of the bus, head coach Peter Laviolette and
his assistant, Bill Armstrong, were startled by the noise in the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, a survivor of eight minor league seasons, turned to
Laviolette, a veteran of 12, and asked, ``You ever had a guitar
player on one of your buses?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Me neither.''
</P>
<P>
   But when they looked behind them, they discovered this was no
hallucination. At the behest of teammates, Andre Savage, a
promising center and accomplished musician, had brought his
acoustic guitar on board. Also at the behest of teammates, he was
now performing an impromptu concert. Which quickly evolved into a
sing-along.
</P>
<P>
   Bon Jovi. Springsteen. Garth Brooks's ``I Got Friends In Low
Places.'' For the next four hours, the joyous cacophony echoed
through the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre did most of the singing because most of the guys didn't
know the verses and they'd just mumble along,'' recalls Armstrong.
``But they'd really go to town on the chorus.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the dissonance came a wondrous discovery: As a team,
these Bruins were in perfect harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a turning point, that was it,'' says former
University of New Hampshire center Eric Nickulas. ``After that, we
really started to jell.''
</P>
<P>
   The joyride hasn't stopped. Providence, the Boston Bruins' top
minor league affiliate, began the extended climax to its journey
with a 4-2 victory Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at the Civic Center against the
Rochester Americans in the opener of the best-of-seven Calder Cup
finals. For the uninitiated, that's the grail of the AHL, a trophy
that hasn't graced Rhode Island's capital since 1956, when the
Providence Reds claimed it on behalf of the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   This is not only the zenith of the Bruins' seven-year existence
here _ which ended a 15-year Providence AHL hiatus after the
Rangers pulled up roots _ it is also the culmination of a season
that long ago progressed from remarkable to astounding.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins led the league and set a club mark during the regular
season with 120 points, the product of a 56-16-4-4 record (the AHL
awards a point for overtime losses). Following that up with an 11-3
playoff run, they established an AHL record for combined victories
in a season _ just one of 38 league or team marks to their credit.
They boast the AHL's Most Valuable Player, center Randy Robitaille;
the two top-scoring defensemen, Brandon Smith (62 points) and Terry
Virtue (56); three first-team All-Stars, Robitaille, Smith, and
left wing Landon Wilson; a second-team All-Star, Virtue; a member
of the All-Rookie team, Savage; and the leading scorer in the
playoffs, Nickulas (19 points). They left the rest of the league in
their dust with a club-record 15-0-1 streak from Dec. 23 to Jan. 29
that included 11 straight victories.
</P>
<P>
   But what truly challenges the law of probability is that this is
the same core cast that last season fought its way to another club
record _ for fewest victories (19-49-5-7), a standard of ineptitude
that earned the Bruins their second straight last-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   There are differences, of course, some subtle, all vital. Most
prominent was the hiring of Laviolette _ a 34-year-old product of
Franklin, Mass., and Westfield State who owns the career record for
games played by a Providence Bruin _ to replace old-timer Tom
McVie. Last year's bewildered rookies are this year's mature
veterans. The team's savvy and psyche have been bolstered by the
addition of four former captains of AHL teams _ Smith, Virtue,
Steve Bancroft, and this year's leader, Dennis Vaske _ to the
defense, where they tutor former first-round draft pick Johnathan
Aitken, a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Says Laviolette, who was brought in after guiding the Wheeling
(W.Va.) Nailers to the East Coast Hockey League semifinals in his
first year as a coach, ``I think we have the perfect mix here with
our forwards, who are young, fast, and have tons of potential, and
if they make a mistake, the defensemen are there to bail them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   All those factors signal improvement. But a 70-point turnaround
in one season, the most dramatic in AHL history? Come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest dreams,'' says team owner Ed Anderson, who
transplanted Boston's Maine Mariners AHL farm here in 1992, ``I
never saw this.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who in their most sadomasochistic nightmares could
have envisioned last year?
</P>
<P>
   Virtue and his wife were strolling along Bellevue Avenue,
admiring the Newport mansions, earlier this spring when a man
approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, aren't you Terry Virtue?'' the stranger asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``An hour down the road, somebody recognized me,'' says Virtue,
still marveling at the recollection. ``That's pretty nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he acknowledged any connection to the Providence Bruins last
year, he probably would have been mugged.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever right wing Aaron Downey, the league leader in penalty
minutes and winner of the team community service award the past two
seasons, goes to fill up his silver Chevy Blazer, he receives an
enthusiastic greeting and $10 of free gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year they wouldn't even talk to me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he's fortunate that they didn't smash his windshield
last year and charge him for the use of the sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who was promoted late in the season _ one of 15
Providence players who spent at least some time in the NHL in
1998-99 _ and was a key contributor in Boston's two playoff series,
was aboard the team charter after Boston was eliminated in Buffalo
last month. Wearing an ice pack on his separated left shoulder, a
souvenir of Stanley Cup combat, he approached assistant coach Bob
Francis and asked if he was supposed to return to Providence. Told
that he was, Wilson offered no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they hadn't told me,'' he says, ``I probably would
have asked to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a similar order last year, he probably would have jumped
immediately off the plane without a parachute.
</P>
<P>
   As glorious as this season has been, that's how wretched last
year's experience was for Providence. The combination of
unsuspecting youth and discontented veterans bemoaning their
demotion created a poisonous environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a godawful year,'' recalls Armstrong, captain of the
'97-98 Bruins. ``It seemed like the harder you worked, the more you
buried yourself. I can remember driving down 95 with tears in my
eyes some nights. Some guys hated each other. There was some bad
blood there.''
</P>
<P>
   The venom was so pervasive that it even infected the corridors
of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take a lot of (expletive) from other mayors,'' says
flamboyant Providence Mayor Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci, waving his
hand in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   But the penance may have served a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through a year from hell like that is a learning
experience,'' says Boston assistant general manager Mike O'Connell.
``One thing you learn is that you never want to go through it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the Bruins brought in Laviolette, whom Anderson
has admired since his playing days, which included exactly 12 NHL
games with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a communicator,'' says the owner. ``I've always felt that
with his interpersonal skills, he would be successful regardless of
his career path.''
</P>
<P>
   That path has brought him full circle to the Civic Center, only
now as the boss. He professes to have no magic formula, but his
relationship with the players obviously has been essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our psychiatrist, our motivator, our playmaker,'' says
Downey. ``He's very hands-on. You can go in and talk to him about
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Laviolette is not is a petty bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sweat the small stuff,'' he says. ``Like if a guy is
wearing a mock turtleneck instead of a tie on the road. So what?
All I ask is that when you come to the rink, you do whatever is
necessary to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the alternative is intolerable to Laviolette, who
carries the buddy system only so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear that this was going to be a fresh start, that
he didn't care about last year, that all he was worried about was
winning,'' says Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took the returnees a while to rid their system of the
hangover from last season.
</P>
<P>
   While Armstrong observes, ``The good thing was that the kids who
came back all got along,'' newcomer Smith still noted some
reservations. At the start, the holdovers ``were still talking
about last year,'' he says. ``We didn't know what kind of team we
had. We knew we had the talent, but we didn't know how it would
come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Very nicely, as it turned out. After a sluggish 4-5-0-1 start,
the Bruins reeled off seven straight victories and didn't look
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All championship teams have great chemistry,'' says goaltender
John Grahame, who posted a 37-9-1 record this season after being a
frequent victim of opposing fusillades during last year's debacle.
``It's not something you can force.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the campfire atmosphere on the bus from Saint John
proved to be genuine sentiment. The Bruins found out they actually
like one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a team here that's very dedicated, very focused on
each other,'' says former University of Maine right wing Peter
Ferraro, who spent most of the season in Boston before being
demoted March 15 _ and buying right into the harmonic convergence.
``It's the greatest group of guys I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   If that smacks of pure saccharine, Vaske, a 32-year-old former
New York Islander whose NHL days may well be behind him, thinks it
passed the litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys got called up,'' he says, ``everyone else was happy
for them. Everyone's goal is to get to the NHL, and we do whatever
we can to help the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate goal is the Calder Cup, which may seem a pale
facsimile of the Stanley Cup _ except to the people playing for it.
Wilson, who was part of the Colorado Avalanche's championship
entourage in the 1996 NHL playoffs (though he didn't suit up),
doesn't accept that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be any consolation prize,'' he says. ``It's a chance
to be a part of something you might never do again. It's something
we've been shooting for all year. And we'll know we won it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The city also is profiting from the turnaround. Chamber of
Commerce president James G. Hagan estimates that the Bruins'
economic impact on Providence conservatively is $10 million-$15
million, and that last year's on-ice recession meant 33 percent
less in the coffers.
</P>
<P>
   This year's increased success and prolonged season have been a
boon to business. Joe Peixoto, manager of a sports gathering spot
near the Civic Center, the Player's Corner Pub, notices
substantially more business in his restaurant and foot traffic in
the area on game nights. Ray Ruggieri, president of the team
booster club, has seen its ranks grow by some 16 percent this
season, during which the patrons made an unprecedented 13 bus trips
to follow the Bruins on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins drew an average of 7,191 fans per game during the
regular season, fourth in the league and an increase of almost
1,000 from last year. During the playoffs, the average has been a
league-leading 6,811 _ ``and that's starting from scratch,'' notes
team publicist Dave Goucher, ``because there is no season-ticket
carryover to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   That number is getting a boost during the finals, when the
Bruins figure to draw at least 10,000 per home game. Those who
can't get to the Civic Center will be able to tune in Calder Cup
play on New England Sports Network, and cyberfans can get the games
on the Internet (www.providencebruins.com). Even better, the
success and exposure bode well for next fall; Bruins marketing
director Randy Scott says that in contrast to last season, sponsor
solicitations ``are happy calls now.''
</P>
<P>
   There also are intangible benefits for this hardscrabble city on
the rebound. Almost $1 billion in new infrastructure is in place in
downtown Providence, and Cianci believes the success of the Bruins
enhances the spirit of revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a presence, gives us a place,'' he says. ``It's
good for the city's self-esteem. Everyone loves to be associated
with a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   It's music to their ears.

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The race and the Triple Crown were gone, but now
Bob Lewis was in for something far worse.
</P>
<P>
   A few strides past the finish line Saturday, Charismatic had
pulled up lame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unbelievable feeling of devastation,'' sighed the
gentlemanly owner. ``I just stood there and virtually froze.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bob and Beverly Lewis, their thoroughbreds are not just meal
tickets. They are, let's say, family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Lewis said, ``this is the bad side of racing
you see on occasion. It does happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Lewis's next-to-worst fear was realized. The
X-rays were back in very rapid fashion. His championship horse was
going to live. He just wasn't going to race again. The 1999 Belmont
Stakes would be Charismatic's final race. Put it down that a
would-be Triple Crown winner gave it a magnificent shot, finishing
third in the Belmont behind Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and Verse
despite sustaining a _ are you ready? _ ``lateral condylar fracture
of his left front leg,'' not to mention a ``little crack in his
sesamoid bone,'' both of which add up to the horse becoming an
instant retiree and assumed stud rather than the 12th colt to win a
Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   So there will be no Hollywood ending to this charming tale, a
story so enchanting it drew a record Belmont Park crowd of 85,818
on this truly spectacular spring afternoon. The public was quite
obviously drawn to the story of the two-time claimer who had won
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness under startlingly different
conditions. The public knew all about the kindly owners, whose good
spirits and generosity have been trumpeted by every media
organization for the past six weeks. And the public also was taken
with the reclamation story of jockey Chris Antley, who had battled
substance abuse and weight problems in order to earn a chance to
become a Triple Crown jockey.
</P>
<P>
   What the public should know now is that the jockey had become
very attached to that horse. Those were real, live tears rolling
down Antley's cheeks while he tended to the stricken animal. They
were a true team. Assuming that Antley's career is now back on the
proper track, he will always have this wonderful horse to thank.
</P>
<P>
   Antley's only postrace concern was the welfare of Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very sad thing,'' he explained. ``It was a very
emotional thing. An awful lot of emotion went through my body when
he pulled up after we passed the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Chris Antley. Any jockey would have felt the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a horse injures itself, it hurts the rider.''
confirmed Pat Day, who was aboard Menifee. ``We love them. They
give their all for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley knew something was wrong at the eighth pole. Something.
What would have happened if Charismatic had stopped running, right
then and there? He'd probably be racing again; that's what. But
neither Charismatic nor any other championship horse was going to
stop just because he or she felt a twinge. In this regard,
thoroughbred horses are no different from humans. You play through
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave everything he had,'' Antley said. ``He ran as hard as
he could, but he couldn't give the people what he wanted. He is an
athlete and he ran through the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Antley felt what he described as a ``little dip'' at the
eighth pole, the race was going according to the plan concocted by
trainer D. Wayne Lukas and Antley. Charismatic was dueling
Silverbulletday. Charismatic was doing everything Antley was
asking. Antley had every reason to think he could win the race. ``I
was in a very confident position,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would he have won?'' inquired Antley. ``That's a very hard
prediction to make. But I was pleased and happy throughout the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened is part of the deal, pure and simple. It's even
happened to Bob Lewis before. He once had an Irish-bred horse named
Fatherland who was doing some great things when he went down at
Hollywood Park. That, too, said Lewis, was ``devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been down this two-thirds-of-a-Triple Crown road before
with Silver Charm only two years ago, Lewis was cautiously
optimistic, and no more. He knew better than to expect anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the race,'' Lewis said, ``Chris Antley looked me in the
eye and said, `Mr. Lewis, it's in God's hands now. If he wants us
to win, we'll win.' I said I could accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   What all this underscores is just how very difficult it is to
win these three particular races within five weeks in any given
year, and why those who win the first two legs get so pumped up
anticipating the Belmont. The Lewises may have had a saner outlook
than most people, but Lukas, for one, wasn't ashamed to admit how
antsy the whole thing was making him.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know that it just wasn't meant to be for Charismatic.
He's got a new role in life, effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought me a lot of joy,'' said Antley. ``It's been a great
road. It's too bad he couldn't give the general public what they
wanted. They won't see a Triple Crown this year. So, hopefully,
we'll see his babies running in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a great story, but there was no focus group to pass
judgment on the ending. There were no alternate takes. Charismatic
will race no more.

CHARISMATIC LOSES INSPIRED BID 
</HEADLINE>
 STAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The Belmont Stakes is a test of champions that
traverses 1 1/2 miles. The Triple Crown is one that only the truest
of thoroughbred royalty can _ and should _ wear. It is horse
racing's most difficult feat, to be tested as a champion and only
then to wear the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, who many doubted through the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness, gave his all and then even more before coming up short
in his bid to become royalty. Alas, Charismatic broke down at the
wire Saturday, fracturing two bones in his left foreleg, as he
exerted his last ounce of will to win the race that would have made
him the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic never will race again.
</P>
<P>
   What was to be his greatest moment as a racehorse before the
largest crowd ever at Belmont Park, some 85,000 fans, turned out to
be his last moment as a competitor on a race track. ``He's through
as a racehorse,'' said Larry Bramlage, a track veterinarian. ``We
expect him to be fine as a stallion.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Selway, another veterinarian, said Charismatic would
undergo surgery Sunday &UR;  &LR; at an equine hospital near Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   As Charismatic, who briefly took the lead in the stretch from
the filly Silverbulletday, faltered in the final yards, Lemon Drop
Kid swooped by, as did Vision and Verse, two of the longer long
shots in the race. At the end of this 131st Belmont, it was the
29-1 Lemon Drop Kid who held off the 54-1 Vision and Verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke down just after the wire,'' said a tearful Chris
Antley, Charismatic's jockey. ``It's sad that these things happen.
But he gave us a lot. He gave America a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Cleary, the chief examining veterinarian of the New York
Racing Association, described the injury as ``a lateral condylar
fracture of his left front leg. He is comfortable.'' But Cleary
added that it appears Charismatic ``is a surgical candidate.'' It
is not believed the injury is life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Within 2 minutes 27 4/5ths seconds, many of life's emotions _
both the highs and lows, the joys and distresses _ were
encapsulated for D. Wayne Lukas, Charismatic's trainer, and Bob and
Beverly Lewis, the colt's owners. The joy was growing as
Charismatic stalked Silverbulletday all the way down the endless
Belmont backstretch, and the joy was even brighter turning for home
as Charismatic took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Charismatic faltered near the 16th pole and the potential
for a Triple Crown was gone. But that was an athletic loss, a
racetrack defeat, painful because of its significance, but well
understood by all who ever led a horse onto a race track. But then
Charismatic took a bad step near the wire and, a 16th of a mile
past the finish line, Antley jumped off the colt and Charismatic
clearly was in distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we're feeling pretty low,'' said Bob Lewis. ``We're
devastated by the thought that anything could be wrong with
Charismatic. Our only concern now is with Charismatic. We hope to
God he's going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises and Lukas ``accepted the accolades in Louisville and
Baltimore,'' Bob Lewis went on, ``and (Saturday) was one of those
things that happen. What happened is history. We have been in this
position to win the Triple Crown twice (also in 1997 with Silver
Charm) and if we are lucky enough we will try it again someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, aboard Silverbulletday, was dueling head to head
with Charismatic for more than half a mile and was surprised to see
that it was Charismatic, a closer, running early with the filly.
But Bailey also noticed that Charismatic was ``rank'' down the
backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   Antley, meanwhile, recalled that Charismatic ``had let up a
little bit at the eighth pole.'' At that point, he went on, ``I
rode just enough to hang on for third. Heading to the finish he
dipped underneath me and I could tell he was in pain. He gave
everything he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was devastated. Saturday was to be a rare moment of
triumph for both the colt and himself, as the trainer never has had
a Triple Crown winner despite numerous attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week long, we'd talked about how maintenance-free this
horse was and how durable he was,'' said Lukas. ``In racing, these
things happen and we have to deal with them. It's not an easy part
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Santos, the jockey aboard the winner, Lemon Drop Kid, and
Scotty Schulhofer, his trainer, were aware of the injury to
Charismatic, the 8-5 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got our racetrack and we got a good clean trip,''
said Schulhofer, who also won the 1993 Belmont with Colonial
Affair. ``Jose gave him a great ride and Jose loves this horse.''
</P>
<P>
   In a little less than 2 1/2 minutes, 85,000 fans roared and
cheered. Until after the end, when racing's so-humbling nature once
again had humbled a would-be champion.

JONES UNIFIES LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ Roy Jones wasted little time wasting Reggie
Johnson Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Jones and Johnson sparred three times in Pensacola,
Fla., when Jones was a young professional and Johnson a top
middleweight contender. Saturday night was the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Each had since become a light heavyweight champion _ Jones
holding the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association belts
_ and they had come to the Mississippi Coast Coliseum for one of
them to leave as the first undisputed light heavyweight champion in
14 years. Little more than a minute into the fight it was clear who
that was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Jones dropped Johnson with a lead right hand that the
International Boxing Federation champion never saw coming. That was
the beginning of a long night in which Johnson would lose his title
the hard way _ by being turned into a heavy bag by the faster and
more ferocious Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy bags are resilient pieces of equipment, and so was
Johnson, who though outclassed fought bravely and tenaciously for
12 rounds in the hope he might somehow catch lightning in a bottle.
But he didn't, more often catching a fist to the face.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, judges Paul Sita, Cova Jesus, and Chuck
Hassock all had the fight scored 120-106, meaning Jones had pitched
a shutout, an opinion held by the Globe's card as well as
heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good,'' said Holyfield from ringside, referring to Jones.
``Can't nobody touch him. He's not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't for Johnson either. Jones's hand speed advantage was
clear from the outset and he used it to drop Johnson in the first
round and cut him in the second. In the third, he nailed him with a
string of heavy combinations to the face that had Johnson leaning
back on the ropes with his gloves by his cheekbones.
</P>
<P>
   These defensive tactics didn't help, however, because Jones
countered a Johnson left hand with a left-right combination to the
button with eight seconds left in Round 3 that dropped Johnson dead
in his tracks. Somehow he got up again, but had the bell not
sounded when it did, he would have been finished right then.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Johnson (39-6-1) was rocked again in Round 4 but he
remained upright this time, his right eye was now leaking blood and
late in the round he took a stiff uppercut to the face that snapped
his head back and propelled him 5 feet backward.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth was more of the same, with the only moment of note
coming when Jones landed a combination that backed Johnson into the
ropes. Jones then dug a left to the body and when it landed,
Johnson covered up and Jones stepped into a clinch and hollered to
Michael Jordan, who was sitting at ringside. It was almost as if
Johnson wasn't there, which in point of fact he really wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has superior hand speed,'' Johnson said. ``I tried to time
him, but I wasn't able to. He does a lot of things wrong but his
hands make up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the ninth round, Jones (40-1, 33 KOs) had visibly slowed his
pace and although Johnson threw a few more punches, it was clear
that Jones was carrying Johnson to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he figured he had to save his strength to carry out his
extra belt.

GRAF COMPLETES FRENCH REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A couple of very rare birds _ 29-year-old phoenixes _
were flitting about Stade Roland Garros Saturday, one in
nondescript baggy shorts, the other in a miniskirt.
</P>
<P>
   These phoenixes, sighted soaring from the crimson ashes of a
clay tennis court, were identified as two distinct breeds: Agassi
and Graf. Before an uproarious rain-spattered day at the French
Open had ended, both had reestablished faded careers.
</P>
<P>
   The oft-wounded and surgically carved _ yet ever-superb _ Steffi
Graf gave the sassy prodigy, Martina Hingis, a lesson in tennis and
style. Declaring, surprisingly, that it was her farewell to Paris,
Graf snatched away the championship after being pushed within 3
points of the abyss, pocketing her 22d major title, 4-5, 7-5, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have thought Graf was the reincarnation of Joan of Arc the
way the mob of 16,000 cheered her and lifted her as high as Gustave
Eiffel's nearby erector set tower. And that Hingis was a remake of
the haughty Marie Antoinette, as her gaucheries led the customers
to boo and whistle her to tears. If there has been a women's final
of such passionate clamor, I haven't seen it _ or one in which a
great player was nearly thrown out. Hingis came close, earning two
code-of-conduct violations, one short of ejection.
</P>
<P>
   The gifted Andre Agassi, seeming as busted-out as numerous
gamblers in his hometown, Las Vegas, had long been in the
wilderness, unable to attain a major final for four years. But now,
after blunting the thunder of the slugging Slovak, Dominic Hrbaty,
6-4, 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-4, he's on the brink of crashing a select
sanctum. By beating another retread, No. 100 Andrei Medvedev, in
Sunday's final _ which he should _ Agassi would become the fifth
guy to hold all four majors (Australian, French, Wimbledon, US),
following in the sneaker steps of Fred Perry, Don Budge, Rod Laver,
and Roy Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Agassi and Hrbaty were in their suspenseful two-act
drama, doused by a deluge Friday evening with Agassi leading, 6-4,
7-6, 3-6, 1-2, but declining, they were merely a warmup gig for the
Graf-Hingis duel that turned emotions inside-out and Court Central
into Bedlam revisited.
</P>
<P>
   As Act 2 began, Agassi had to sock his way out of two break
points (15-40) to 2-2, and another to 3-3 with a stunner serve.
That seemed to convince Hrbaty, nicknamed ``Quasimodo'' because his
name means ``hunchback'' in Slovakian, that the bells were clanging
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bells of Notre Dame couldn't have been heard within the
stadium for much of the time during the rancorous clash of
generations: a matchup of sturm und drang, Granny Graf overturning
Childe Martina. It became a morality play for the audience stacked
into the sunny stadium after more rain had delayed the start by an
hour, and nearly a tragedy in their eyes as the argumentative
Hingis stepped to the line to serve for the lone major title that
has eluded her, leading, 6-4, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting on the chair at the change,'' Graf recalls, ``I
thought this is my last time to sit here. Kind of defeatist. But
then hearing my name'' _ the incessant chanting, ``STEF-FEE!
STEF-FEE!'' _ ``I decided not to worry. Just go for my shots, go
after it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And go after the kid who had heisted No. 1 from her, and said
Graf was over that well-known hill, she surely did. Hingis knocked
a forehand winner to 15-0, so close to victory she thought it was
over. ``I am the better player,'' the kid insisted afterward.
</P>
<P>
   How could she suspect at that carefree, contented moment she had
reached her afternoon zenith, and that Graf's rage to win a sixth
French (one behind Chris Evert's record), would sweep her away?
Graf would do it with those bludgeons that baptized her ``Fraulein
Forehand,'' sliced backhands causing Hingis to bend so low that ``I
got tired'' _ and a heart to make a lioness jealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was against me, the crowd, the officials, the
umpire, the referee,'' Hingis complains. But mostly it was Graf.
Hingis's frequent moaning about line calls and appeals to umpire
Anne Ullrich disrupted the flow and won her massive disapproval.
Ullrich seemed exhausted herself, often coming down from her
highchair (following silly clay-court custom) to examine ball marks
at Hingis's insistence. But she slapped the intemperate kid with
one violation for breaking her racket in a pique, and the second
(and a point penalty) for invading Graf's court to point to an
alleged mark on the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we just play tennis, OK?'' Graf asked her in the third
set, confessing later that Hingis's deportment annoyed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wild, and I'm not even on the court,'' quipped John
McEnroe in the TV booth.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, last seen in a major final winning the US Open of 1996,
kept her cool throughout while applying the heat of her strokes and
superior athleticism, retrieving brilliantly, running the kid out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's young, she'll win it,'' Graf says. ``But for me, it was
my greatest victory. I came here without belief _ but the crowd
lifted me. At 1-0 in the third I knew the momentum was with me. She
got tight. Then at 3-0 I got tight and she almost caught me. It was
the craziest match. `Quit worrying,' I told myself. `Go for your
shots.' I did.''
</P>
<P>
   At match point, Hingis escaped momentarily with a playground
trick, an underhand serve. The crowd judged her underhanded, booing
and whistling fiercely. Graf says, ``It was a hell of a shot. She
won the point.'' But a pirouetting backhand drop and a bruising
forehand finished off the mad matinee. Both wept so profusely at
the conclusion that the grounds crew almost rolled out the tarp
again.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, France was Graf's once more, as it first was in
1987, when she was the kid tormenting an elder, another Martina
(Navratilova). And France may also be Agassi's Sunday as it wasn't
when he couldn't handle the 1990 and 1991 finals.
</P>
<P>
   For bird watchers, it was a great day for phoenixes.

KNICKS WIN A WILD ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their situation remains one of utter improbability.
An eighth seed two wins from the NBA Finals? Their captain and
franchise conscience out for the playoffs? Their season already
once miraculously extended thanks to a fortuitous roll and now,
well, what do we say about this?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to New York, where anything can happen and usually does.
Even a game-winning 4-point play with 5.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks took a 2-1 lead in the Eastern Conference
finals Saturday with a wild 92-91 victory over the still-in-shock
Pacers. Larry Johnson gave this city its version of The Shot with a
desperation trey, one of his specialties du jour. He also was
fouled by Antonio Davis before the shot _ there was a very creative
interpretation of continuation by referee Jess Kersey _ and then
calmly made the free throw amid the pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a bad call,'' said Pacers coach Larry Bird. ``The way
I see it, I was disappointed he didn't get the free throws. But
that's part of it. He made a great play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks then stuffed the Pacers on Indiana's last possession
_ Reggie Miller was a spectator in that sequence and for much of
the game _ and Madison Square Garden erupted. Johnson was hugged by
Spike Lee as well as his teammates. The Knicks can take a 3-1 lead
with a victory at home Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball left my hand,'' said Johnson, recalling The
Shot, ``I wasn't thinking about anything. I had been trying to stay
focused, stay square and a get a good release.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-point play gave New York its first lead since the previous
unorthodox trey from Johnson _ a 25-foot banker that he admitted
was lucky _ made it 75-71 with 10:49 to play. Indiana then
seemingly took over the see-saw game (16 ties and lead changes) by
putting together a 14-2 run, capped by a baseline pop from the
exhumed Rik Smits (25 points in 24 minutes). Indy still led by 8,
89-81, with 3:21 left after two Smits free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers then brought in Heathcliff Slocumb to close the
game. They managed only 2 more points the rest of the way _ a pair
of Mark Jackson free throws with 11.9 seconds left. The Pacers
missed shots. They turned it over. New York rallied behind Chris
Childs (9 points, 10 assists) and Marcus Camby (who was everywhere
with 21 points, 11 rebounds, and 2 blocks) before turning to
Johnson for the answered prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this game tough to swallow? I'm sure it will be,'' said
Miller, who finished with 12 points, none in the final 19 minutes.
``But we are a veteran team that understands we came here to get
one. We have another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Miller admitted, ``we've got to do a better job of
closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Knicks' magical run in the postseason continues. This
is a team that was dead three weeks ago, only to be revived by a
forgiving rim in Miami. It's a team trying to survive the loss of
Patrick Ewing (Achilles' tendon), who was Mr. Cheerleader Saturday
and will continue in that role indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   It's a team that has withstood inner turmoil and distractions
from above and beyond all season. It almost makes you wonder if
something else is at work.
</P>
<P>
   We can imagine Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy going over all the
options during his last timeout with 11.9 seconds to play and his
team down by 3, 91-88. We don't think he said, ``Go for the first
available 4-point play.'' He did want a quick 2 from Allan Houston
(15 points on 6 of 17) but that possibility was eliminated when
Jalen Rose tipped the inbounds pass. The ball ended up in Johnson's
hands and the rest is history _ if written with a decided New York
bent.

MCHALE HAS BEEN IN EWING'S SHOES 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin McHale saw what we all saw when he watched
Patrick Ewing limp up and down the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt me just to watch him,'' McHale said. ``I was saying,
`Look at him.' It was painful to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, quite familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is now officially gone from the postseason because of a
slight tear in his left Achilles' tendon. He tried to play through
the pain, but it no longer was practical. He thinks he has a few
years left, but he has no way of knowing whether he'll ever get
this close again to an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   McHale can relate. He already had three rings in 1987, but, as
he noted, ``Three doesn't mean a thing when you're going for the
fourth one. You forget about all the things in the past.'' During
those playoffs, it was discovered that he had a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   He had two choices, much like Ewing. Also, like Ewing, he
continued to play. The break worsened as each series progressed
and, by the Finals, McHale was visibly limping. The difference? He
was only 29. Ewing is 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, all you are thinking is, how can I help the
team?'' said McHale. ``You want to play. You want to be a part of
something special. You don't want to give it up. The pain is all in
your brain and you just shut it off. You get accustomed to it. And
then, after the surgery, you say to yourself, `What was I
thinking?' ''
</P>
<P>
   McHale, amazingly, averaged 21.1 points and 9.2 rebounds in the
1987 playoffs. The break actually had come in March, when Larry
Nance stepped on his foot going for a rebound. It was not confirmed
until the first round of the playoffs against Chicago. He missed
only two of the Celtics' 23 games in that postseason. In the Finals
against the Lakers, he averaged 20.5 points and 9.0 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure you've overcome a lot already to get there,''
McHale said. ``There's something in you. It's such a small segment
of people that get to play in the NBA. It's the competitiveness. I
think that's what makes us different from other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics lost the 1987 Finals in six games. McHale never made
it back that far; neither did Larry Bird. McHale clearly empathizes
with Ewing, who feels he is prolonging his career by not playing
rather than jeopardizing it by continuing to play.
</P>
<P>
   McHale had major foot surgery later that summer and admits he
was never quite the same. He now looks back on his decision 12
years ago with equal parts admiration and bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, you extend yourself and try to do it,'' he said.
``You make all these reasons to justify it, but in the end, it's
stupidity. It's like, `What was I thinking?' I look back and I
realize I've done some dumb things in my life. This was right up
there.''
</P>
<P>

   Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund made it clear last week that the
dismissal of Mike Fratello was not due to the team's boring style
of play. Well, that's only half right. Gund also met with players
after the season _ he does that every year _ and the message he got
was that it was time for a change. He also had done some polling of
season ticket-holders, who indicated they, too, found the Cavs
tedious to watch. Finally, attendance was at an 11-year low, and
with the Indians and Browns selling out every game, this was not
the time to have a boring product in Cleveland. Gund also knew it
would be suicidal to have Fratello return with one year left on his
contract (there was an option for 2000-01) so he pulled the plug.
Fratello said he was shocked, but his product was boring. He has
long insisted that he can coach an up-tempo, aesthetically pleasing
team, given the right personnel. Well, in his first year in
Atlanta, he had a young Dominique Wilkins, Dan Roundfield, Doc
Rivers, and Eddie Johnson and still finished last in the NBA in
scoring. In fact, in Fratello's 13 seasons as an NBA head coach,
his teams have finished among the top 10 in scoring only once (the
1988-89 Atlanta Hawks were ninth). The last three years, the Cavs
have been 28th, 29th, and 26th in scoring. The new head coach will,
in all likelihood, be the anti-Fratello, which means a player's
coach who probably is an ex-player. Dave Cowens comes immediately
to mind. Meanwhile, outgoing general manager Wayne Embry, who had
an on-again, off-again relationship with Fratello, will remain
active in the draft (Cleveland has two lottery choices) and will
tutor new GM Jim Paxson this season before becoming a consultant.
Embry is not unhappy about leaving, although, he, too, had to be
caught somewhat by surprise; 48 hours before the firing of Fratello
and the ascension of Paxson, Embry was on the phone with an Eastern
Conference general manager talking trades . . . Rivers, meanwhile,
was Orlando's first (and only) choice to succeed Chuck Daly and
also was in demand in New York, which was interested in him for
Ernie Grunfeld's post. He was interviewed Wednesday and Thursday by
Magic officials and hesitated to sign only because of a difference
on whether the fourth year would be guaranteed. Magic GM John
Gabriel said he ordinarily would be reticent about turning the team
over to someone who never had coached before, but not in this
instance. ``This guy is special,'' Gabriel said. ``I think there
are guys that are just ready. He's one. Of all the ex-players I've
been around, he's something.'' Look for Rivers to bring in Dave
Wohl as his top assistant . . . With Rivers in Orlando, that leaves
Washington, New Jersey, the Lakers, and Cleveland technically
without coaches. The latest name to surface in Washington is,
surprisingly, Isiah Thomas. Garfield Heard is also being mentioned.
Said Gabriel, ``Now that the money is good, you're going to see a
lot of ex-players getting interested in coaching.'' . . . The
Alamodome has been booked for a Baptist Youth Convention for the
weekend of June 25-26. That's only a conflict if both conference
finals end in five games. The director of the Alamodome, however,
is blaming the NBA and the lockout for the possible overlap . . .
The ever-secretive Jerry Krause, general manager of the Bulls, owns
the No. 1 pick in the draft. He ought to come out today and
announce whom he's taking _ because no one would believe him . . .
Everyone who's anyone _ at least in the coaching/general manager
world _ will be in Chicago this week for the annual predraft camp
Tuesday through Friday. No big-name draftees will be there, but the
Celtics could well find the 55th pick toiling away . . . Shaquille
O'Neal isn't alone in being swept four times in best-of-seven
series. However, since he entered the league, there have been eight
sweeps and he's been a part of half of them. In a quick run through
the NBA Guide, we found that the estimable Alton Lister also was on
teams that were swept four times (twice at Milwaukee and twice at
Seattle). Among those who've been swept three times are Paul
Mokeski, Earl Monroe, Wes Unseld, and Truck Robinson. Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar was swept three times while with the Lakers: 1977 (by
Portland), 1983 (by Philadelphia), and 1989 (by Detroit).

   Here's what Rick Pitino said when asked what he was looking for
at the recently concluded free agent camp: ``We're looking for
Michael Curry-type players _ tough, hard-nosed guys that can score
as well.'' Well, guess who's a free agent? None other than Michael
Curry. So expect the Celtics to inquire about him, although Grant
Hill already is pushing the Pistons to reacquire Curry, who played
1 1/2 seasons in Detroit before signing with Milwaukee in July
1997. The Celtics are also interested in _ surprise, surprise _
Tony Delk. Another player they might take a look at is Lawrence
Funderburke, who got lost in the shuffle during the Kings' playoff
series with Utah but was a big part of their regular-season success
. . . McHale on Ron Mercer: ``The only way the Celtics should be
worried about re-signing him is if there are teams out there who
will pay him what they won't pay him. I don't see any teams out
there who will give him $71 million.'' The unknown here is whether
Mercer wants to stay in Boston and keep playing for Pitino. If he
wants to test the waters, the Celtics may feel they have to move
him; they are offering Mercer and Kenny Anderson in a package
around the league. But money should not be an object simply because
there won't be many teams, if any, able to offer Mercer big dough.
And who's to say it would be a place he'd want to go? If it's about
the money, Mercer's best bet is to stay in Boston. If it's
something else, the Celtics will have to move him . . . NBA teams
have been given an extra five days to extend qualifying offers to
their restricted free agents (the Celtics have one, Damon Jones).
Under normal circumstances, those offers have to be made between
the end of the season and July 1. But with the season ending so
late, the deadline has been pushed back to July 5 . . . The Pacers
could face a financial hit courtesy of Dale Davis. He can opt out
of his already exorbitant deal and, given the way he's playing,
who'd blame him? Then again, he has four years left at $26.18
million, numbers he'd have trouble getting on the open market. The
only way he'd get more would be to hold up the Pacers _ again _ or
do a sign-and-trade. Davis has some pretty good company in the
opt-out department. Also eligible to do so this summer are Shaq,
Vin Baker, Penny Hardaway, David Robinson, Isaiah Rider, and
Dikembe Mutombo. If Hardaway, Shaq, Robinson, and Mutombo were to
opt out, they would be forfeiting a combined $152 million. Shaq
alone is owed a staggering $81 million and change over the next
four years . . . McHale feels the Timberwolves will re-sign Joe
Smith, also a free agent. Smith took a one-year deal with Minnesota
and it worked out well for everyone. ``The only teams out there who
have money are the Clippers and Chicago'' _ and Toronto _ ``and Joe
has already been there,'' McHale said. ``We have a good
relationship and we've worked well together.'' The downside: Smith
is represented by Eric Fleisher, who also represents Kevin Garnett
. . . Don Chaney, who works alongside Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy,
talked at length last week about the pressures on his boss. Asked
about a comment he once made that the job was eating away at Van
Gundy, coupled with the ongoing management intrigue, Chaney said,
``Just being a coach, it happens that way. Although you know it's
there, and you try to block it out and put it on the back shelf,
it's still there. And sometimes it manifests itself in different
ways. I've had stomach pains and heart palpitations. I don't know
what he's going through internally. But I do know he's that he's
done a great job with this team, considering all the
circumstances.'' Asked if he encouraged Van Gundy to externalize
his feelings, Chaney said, ``Yeah, but he won't do it. Sometimes we
encourage him to do other things _ walk away from basketball for a
while, go out, find a hobby, do something. But he's a basketball
guy. Personally, I'd like to see him pick up a hobby, for his
career. Because he's going to have a great career.''

ANOTHER DETOUR ON ANDRETTI'S ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Before Championship Auto Racing Teams went its separate
way from Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the rival Indy Racing
League in 1996, Milwaukee was always the date on CART's schedule
that followed the Indianapolis 500. Sunday, Michael Andretti will
arrive in Milwaukee for the Miller Lite 225 FedEx CART race on the
heels of a Memorial Day weekend victory in the Motorola 300 at
Gateway International Speedway in Madison, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   While he savored that victory, which coincided with the 30th
anniversary of his father's one and only Indy 500 triumph, it was a
bittersweet moment for Andretti. Deep down, Andretti would have
preferred that it came at the fabled Brickyard, where Kenny Brack
was received in Victory Circle as the winner of the 83d Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the ongoing rift between CART and the IRL, whose
crown jewel event of its all-oval series is Indy, Andretti instead
celebrated on a small podium at Gateway, where he was joined by
runner-up Helio Castro-Neves and third-place finisher Dario
Franchitti.
</P>
<P>
   Another year. Another Indy 500 missed. Another opportunity lost
for Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said the 36-year-old son of racing
legend Mario Andretti. ``It could've been Indy today, who knows?
But that's just the way it is. It's another year we'll have to deal
with it and, hopefully, the powers that be will get it figured out
and next year this time we'll be running this race on another
weekend, I hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like I'm driving my best right now. I'm in my
prime and I don't want to miss being away from there for another
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, whose 38 victories make him the winningest active
driver in the CART series, expressed the fervent hope that, with
all the buzz last weekend about ongoing dialogue toward a possible
CART-IRL reconciliation, the sides would reach an accord and
reunite next year at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we were there now, you know?'' Andretti said. ``But
then again I hope we are there next year, but we'll have to wait
and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, nodding toward Castro-Neves and Franchitti in the press
postrace conference, he added, ``I'm not sure that these guys have
ever really experienced it. They have to experience it. It's
special and we all want to experience it _ all of us there
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Andretti, Franchitti chimed in, ``I used to watch
this guy back at home in Scotland, watching the Indy 500, and he'd
be running away with the thing and then something would happen . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Andretti interrupted, a knowing smile creasing his
face, ``there's a lot of hard memories and I still feel like that
place owes me one. Hopefully, we'll be able to get back there and
be able to get one.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any reason Andretti still clung to hope for that
possibility, it was because of the emergence of NASCAR president
Bill France as a powerful advocate for peace between the warring
open-wheel series.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure,'' Andretti said. ``I'm hoping now with Bill France
being involved, and now owning a lot of tracks'' _ after the merger
of International Speedway Corp. and Penske Motorsports _ ``and
wanting our series to do a little better, hopefully, he'll be able
to get things worked out.''

   After a 1,100-mile marathon last Sunday, Sunday's MBNA Platinum
400 NASCAR Winston Cup race at Dover, Del., should seem like a walk
in the park for the indefatigable Tony Stewart, 28, who became the
first driver to complete both the Indy 500 (in Indianapolis) and
Coca-Cola 600 (in Charlotte, N.C.) on the same day. After finishing
ninth in the Indy 500, Stewart flew by private jet to Charlotte,
was taken by helicopter to Lowe's Motor Speedway, and finished
fourth after starting from the rear of the field. Amazingly,
Stewart even surged to the lead at Charlotte on Lap 67. But by the
time the race got down to the last 60-70 laps, an exhausted Stewart
was hanging on to finish. He might rethink his plans for Memorial
Day Weekend 2000. ``As much fun as I had, it wasn't fair to give
(the NASCAR team) 90 percent for the last few laps,'' said Stewart,
who had very little to eat that day (aside from two bagels and a
couple of Power Bars) and collapsed when he climbed out of his No.
20 Home Depot-sponsored Pontiac after the Winston Cup race. Asked
if he was thinking about pulling double duty again, Stewart said,
``I honestly don't know for sure, but most likely that's going to
be it (at Indy). It was definitely worth doing once. The crowd's
response at both places was the highlight of the day.'' . . . So
who had the most impressive run at Indy? Look no further than
rookie Robby McGehee. Overcome with grief after his crew chief,
Steve Fried, sustained serious injuries in a pit-row accident on
Lap 12, McGehee fought back emotions and pressed on to finish
fifth, good enough to win Rookie of the Year honors. ``The best
thing that could've happened was when they came on (the radio) and
said he was awake and he had given us the thumbs-up,'' McGehee
said. ``That meant everything to me. I would have traded my
Indianapolis 500 to hear that. That's when I went and kept my head
down and finished the race.'' Fried, who was admitted to Methodist
Hospital in critical condition with head, facial, and chest
injuries, showed signs of recovery the next day and was upgraded to
serious . . . Jack Roush was a big winner on Memorial Day Weekend.
The Winston Cup owner had Mark Martin win the Busch Grand National
race at Charlotte Sunday, then watched as the IRL Aurora engines he
built for car owner A.J. Foyt finished 1-3-6 in the Indy 500. By
the end of the night, Roush's cup had runneth over as he presided
over Jeff Burton's victory in the Coca-Cola 600 . . . And, finally,
leave it to Foyt to provide ABC television with the best line of
the Indy 500 when he attempted to express his elation over his
first triumph as a car owner. In his exuberance, Foyt gushed, ``I'm
so wonderful,'' when he probably meant to say, ``I feel so
wonderful.''

MILLOY CASE STILL ON PATRIOTS' DOCKET 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots have a contract proposal of
``more than four years'' from Lawyer Milloy's agent, Ray Anderson.
The deal would put Milloy among the top two or three highest-paid
safeties in the NFL, perhaps even make him No. 1. It would average
more than $4 million per year, including a huge signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The offer has been sitting in Foxborough for several weeks,
according to Anderson, as the Patriots scratch their heads trying
to figure out ways to get Milloy and Ty Law in the fold while
keeping the rest of the team intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyer wants to spend the rest of his career in New England,''
said Anderson. ``He's very fond of the Kraft family and he likes
the team and their chances of getting back to a Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wouldn't say whether Milloy was looking to be the
highest-paid safety, but he would like something to break before
the end of training camp so that Milloy won't be distracted when
the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played three years,'' said Anderson, ``and in that time
he's played in a Super Bowl and gone to a Pro Bowl. I'd say that's
pretty unique.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have options with Milloy. They could slap a
franchise label on him, making it difficult for another team to
sign him as an unrestricted free agent after this season. But they
have avoided franchise labels with their high-profile players,
feeling they cause resentment, and they're right.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy is a tough player who intimidates receivers going over
the middle, and the fear factor he creates is priceless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few players worth mentioning:
</P>
<P>
   --Scott Zolak: Why is it that so many ex-Patriots have to get in
a little shot at the old regime once they leave town? Zolak, now a
Jet, told the Newark Star-Ledger last week: ``It's great to be back
with Bill (Parcells). He's the only coach that really motivated me
over my eight years. He puts a little fire in you. He knows what
he's doing. He surrounds himself with good people. You see what
(quarterback coach) Dan Henning did with Vinny (Testaverde). The
last two years, with Bill and (quarterback coach) Chris Palmer
gone, we didn't have anyone teaching the fundamentals, all the
little aspects _ ball mechanics, footwork. I'm back to doing that
now and hopefully I'll get my control back and start being more
accurate with the ball.'' Without mentioning them, Zolak was
ripping Patriots QB coach Jack Reilly and former QB coach (now
tight ends coach) Carl Smith. Drew Bledsoe doesn't have a problem
with either one of them.
</P>
<P>
   --Carl Pickens: It may not be easy being a Bengal, but this
stuff about not showing up unless he's signed to a zillion-dollar
deal is ridiculous. Pickens is 29 years old and unquestionably an
excellent receiver, one who probably would have fit nicely in the
Dallas offense if a deal for Michael Irvin had come off last week.
But it didn't. Holding out at age 29 in a young man's business
isn't good business. The Bengals realize that, and they hope
Pickens will, too.
</P>
<P>
   --Barry Sanders: It's difficult to criticize one of the greatest
running backs of all time, but not returning phone calls from Lions
coach Bobby Ross, not showing up for one offseason workout, and not
muzzling his father (who said things about Ross and the Lions
organization that he can never take back) makes you wonder where
Sanders's priorities are.
</P>
<P>
   --Ryan Leaf: File him under ``Doesn't Get It.'' Leaf missed the
Chargers' voluntary workout last week to take part in the Cadillac
NFL Golf Classic in New Jersey. Leaf, whose QB rating was under 40
last season, already has little respect from his teammates and did
nothing last week to endear himself to them or new coach Mike
Riley. Jim Harbaugh, who is slated to be the Chargers' starter, was
there for the workout.
</P>
<P>
   --Terry Glenn: Having been a baseball and football beat writer
for the last 17 years, I find two players eerily similar: Glenn and
Jose Canseco. Both are enormously talented and have a tendency to
march to their own drummer. Both have trouble conforming to the
team concept, both are respectful of authority but tend to test its
limits, and both can carry their teams when not injured. Canseco is
well on his way to 500-plus home runs and perhaps the Hall of Fame,
though his career will be tainted by the perception that he didn't
get the most out of his ability. Glenn is headed in a similar
direction. Both players had their best years under authoritarians _
Canseco with Tony La Russa in 1988 and Glenn with Parcells in 1996
_ and both were happy never to play for them again.
</P>
<P>
   --Jamal Anderson: Falcons coach Dan Reeves is big on offseason
workouts, but Anderson doesn't show up for them. Anderson works out
on his own and apparently has been very successful doing it that
way. But Reeves is an old-school coach, and if there's one side
reason that he was shopping Anderson to the Patriots on draft day,
it was those differences. The sides still haven't reached agreement
on a new deal, even with the Falcons a comfortable $1.7 million
under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are finally doing what the Red Sox have done for
years, using former players to help with the development of young
talent. Former Patriots center Pete Brock was brought in recently
to help center Jason Andersen with his footwork and will work with
the centers in training camp at times. Brock, incidentally, is
president of the Patriots' new alumni association, a group that
will help the team promote various events and causes in the
community. Brock, who played for the Patriots from 1976-87, said,
``In the past we didn't feel a part of what was going on with the
organization. I'm very excited about our association and that the
players in this area can now feel they're still a part of the team
they once played for.'' Also on the alumni board is vice president
Steve Grogan, treasurer Halvor Hagen, and secretary Steve King.
Brock has representatives from each era in team history: Len St.
Jean from the '60s, Bill Lenkaitis from the '70s, Ronnie Lippett
from the '80s, and Brent Williams from the '90s . . . Sixteen-year
NFL center Jim Sweeney has seen a familiar face around Steelers
headquarters at Three Rivers Stadium for years: that of director of
football operations Tom Donahoe, who was Sweeney's football coach
at Seton LaSalle High School in Pittsburgh. ``He's been the same
since he was a junior in high school,'' said Donahoe. ``He's a lot
bigger now, probably meaner, at least on the field. But as far as
his character, personality, and work ethic, it has always been
excellent.'' . . . Former Patriots offensive line coach Paul
Boudreau, now in the same position with rival Miami, has been
hugely impressed with Syracuse and North Andover fullback Rob
Konrad in training camp. ``It looks like he's going to be an
excellent lead back,'' said Boudreau. ``I know Jimmy Johnson made
the comment that he's had Daryl Johnston in Dallas and that Rob can
do things even better than Moose, especially run the football. When
he learns his pass routes he's going to be a very effective H-back
guy.'' In camp, Boudreau will preside over 13 offensive linemen,
one more than the team's running back total. Another Miami
assistant said the Patriots shouldn't rush into signing a running
back off the next wave of cuts because at some point in camp the
Dolphins will likely let one loose. Karim Abdul-Jabbar could be the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Shula has been rumored to be joining the group seeking to
purchase the Jets. Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan and his
brother Larry were runners-up for the Cleveland Browns, and Shula
was part of their efforts there. Shula's interest in the Jets
wouldn't make much sense with Parcells running the show, unless
Parcells exercised a clause in his contract under which he could
leave without financial penalty. Shula and Parcells are friendly;
they did work out an Irving Fryar deal (New England to Miami) when
Parcells first arrived on the New England scene . . . Carolina
coach George Seifert had to be somewhat happy when the quarterback
he allocated to NFL Europe, Dameyune Craig, led the Scottish
Claymores to a 42-35 win over Frankfurt two weeks ago, throwing for
611 yards and completing 27 of 37 attempts with five touchdowns and
no interceptions. No NFL QB has ever thrown for that much yardage.
The record is Norm Van Brocklin's 554 yards on Sept. 28, 1951, for
the Rams. Craig, who leads NFL Europe with a 101.4 quarterback
rating and 15 touchdown passes, fell short of David Klingler's NCAA
record of 716 yards for Houston on Dec. 2, 1990, vs. Arizona State.
But where this gets Craig, a former Auburn star, is probably a big
fat nowhere. He is behind Steve Beuerlein, Jeff Lewis, and Steve
Bono on the Panthers' depth chart . . . Just ask Steve DeOssie
about the wonderful world of long-snapping. Another living legend
in that line of work is Dan Turk, who signed a one-year deal with
the Redskins to return for his 15th season. Turk will turn 37 this
month. He was drafted by the Steelers in 1985 in the fourth round .
. . Zolak said Parcells was still a factor with Patriots players
when they faced the Jets. ``It's a respect factor,'' Zolak said.
``It's not a thing to get his approval, but you wanted to do well
and see what his reaction was. A lot of guys got caught up in that.
Plays would happen during the game and (guys) would look over to
the sidelines and see what Bill's reaction was.'' Great.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is getting smart and starting its own youth development
program for kids 12-14 who have never played tackle football. The
eight-week program began last year in New York, and its founder,
Rhode Island native Scott Lancaster, met with Patriots coach Pete
Carroll last week to begin efforts to get a Boston-area program
going by next year. Lancaster hopes to expand to 10 major cities.
The program is geared toward instruction, but Lancaster claims it's
fun instruction geared to the attention span of kids that age.
There is a similar program emphasizing coaching development . . .
One NFL owner, still a little skeptical about instant replay,
offered this scenario: ``What if it's at the end of a game and a
team has no timeouts and their final play of the game is challenged
and overturned and they lose based on a call that's been
reversed?'' It's true, instant replay will have its own set of new
problems that are likely to rear their head as the season goes on .
. . Heath Irwin didn't sign his tender offer, which doesn't mean
much. Chris Sullivan and Tedy Bruschi both signed their $934,000
contracts for next year, but Irwin was tendered at $429,000, which
is lower than he would have liked. His agent, Jack Mills, doesn't
see it as a protest. ``It's just a sign that we have a different
direction in mind,'' said Mills. ``We would have liked a two-year
deal.'' . . . Dale Carter, the fine cornerback who signed a
four-year, $22.8 million free agent deal with the Broncos, raised
some eyebrows when he missed the first day of minicamp. But he did
show up for the second day, and after a meeting with coach Mike
Shanahan, all was supposedly well . . . Shanahan, who faces serious
salary cap issues now that his players feel they're worth more
after winning two Super Bowls, offered defensive end Neil Smith the
choice of taking an incentive-filled contract or being released.
Another veteran, Packers receiver Robert Brooks, who is returning
from a herniated disc in his back, took a pay cut in his
renegotiation to stay with Green Bay, fearing that if he were let
loose he wouldn't get anywhere near the $700,000 he'll average,
with incentives that could get him close to $1.8 million a year.
The Packers now have enough cap room to sign their rookies and no
longer anticipate any cuts . . . Now that the gibberish about his
buying the Patriots has been proven erroneous, Houston businessman
Bob McNair has a legitimate shot at getting himself the next NFL
franchise because Los Angeles may not get its act together before
the Sept. 15 deadline it was given. McNair would have a
Hartfordesque stadium deal in Houston and big-time support from the
business community . . . With the shelf life of Patriot running
backs being what it is these days, will anyone break Sam
Cunningham's team rushing record of 5,453 yards? Curtis Martin, who
is fourth on the list, fell far short at 3,799.

ATHLETES WANT TO BE PART OF PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The innocent bystanders in the International Olympic
Committee scandal _ the athletes _ were in full voice at last
week's initial meeting of the IOC 2000 reform commission in
Switzerland. They want not only 20 athletes (current or recently
retired) on the new version of the IOC, they also want two on the
powerful executive board.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not about the athletes, then what is it about?'' says
former Norwegian speedskater Johann Olav Koss, the 1994 triple gold
medalist.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes also want primary say about host cities instead of
having them picked by what former Algerian miler Hassiba Boulmerka
calls ``an institution of elderly men.''
</P>
<P>
   The reform commission, which will propose changes in everything
from site choices to member selection, will make its preliminary
report this month at the full IOC meeting in Seoul and its final
recommendations in December.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the frustrated Italians and Austrians, banned from
inviting the Lords to tour their bid cities, are planning cosmic
dog-and-pony shows at the IOC session, where the 2006 Winter Games
will be awarded. ``Virtual-visit'' videos, slick brochures, reams
of technical data, souvenir pins, and T-shirts _ but no first-class
plane tickets, calfskin luggage, Waterford crystal, or jeroboams of
champagne. ``It's difficult,'' shrugs Marco San Pietro, Turin's
international relations director. ``Practically everything is
forbidden.'' With the odds-on favorite being Sion, the Swiss resort
that is within commuting distance of IOC headquarters and was a
2002 also-ran, the other five contenders merely want to make the
two-city cut. ``Our goal is to get into the finals,'' says Olympic
downhill champion Franz Klammer, who is fronting Klagenfurt's
unprecedented three-country bid (Austria-Italy-Slovenia). ``It's
not over yet. We are still fighting.'' Under the new process, a
16-member panel (only 11 of them IOC members) will whittle the
field, which also includes Helsinki/Lillehammer, Zakopane (Poland),
and Poprad-Tatry (Slovakia) to two on June 18. Then the entire IOC
will pick the winner the next day . . . Those 1,400 boxes of
documents turned over to Congress by the Atlanta organizers show
that most of the same IOC bottom-feeders who were shaking down the
Salt Lake bidders were also looking for handouts or family junkets
in Georgia. Chief mendicant was the expelled Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Republic of Congo, who got more than $50,000 worth of favors,
including a soccer scoreboard, equipment, and uniforms and a couple
of enrollments at the pricey Bollettieri tennis camp in Florida.
Also on the freebie list were Western Samoa's Seuili Paul Wallwork
and Mali's Lamine Keita, who were booted out, and Finland's Pirjo
Haeggman, who resigned. The Atlanta folks, who insist that they
acted with ``integrity and honesty,'' also gave out 38 individual
gifts that exceeded the IOC's $200 limit, including a $940
carburetor kit to the man from Libya. Just Southern hospitality,
chief organizer Billy Payne shrugged. The Atlanta revelations are
another shot upside the head for IOC member Phil Coles of
Australia, who has already been censured for his Salt Lake City
escapades and was grilled for nearly three hours last week by a
peer panel about other alleged misdeeds. The Atlanta people say
that Coles brought two guests (one more than allowed) for a visit
that cost $13,000. No worries, mate, insisted Coles. ``These are
not my last few days,'' he declared . . . Spirited tiff between IOC
board members Richard Pound of Canada and Kevan Gosper of Australia
over whether president Juan Antonio Samaranch should resign before
his term ends in 2001. Pound has said several times that Samaranch
might consider stepping down early; Gosper called Pound's remarks
``rather unfortunate'' and ``unwelcome.'' ``It's a term, not a
sentence,'' countered Pound, who said that Samaranch is free to do
whatever he wants. The 78-year-old Samaranch, in place since 1980,
says he'll go right down to the final minute.

   As expected, the US Figure Skating Association said ``too late''
to the sexual misconduct grievance against Richard Callaghan, filed
14 years after the (alleged) fact by former pupil and coaching
partner Craig Maurizi. Maurizi, who has just taken over as skating
director at the New England Sports Center in Marlborough, still has
a grievance pending with the Professional Skaters Association.
Callaghan, meanwhile, apparently has changed his mind about
retiring from elite-level coaching. He'll keep working with Todd
Eldredge, Angela Nikodinov, Erin Pearl, and Stacy Pensgen, plus
Canadian champ Jennifer Robinson. Pearl, who comes from
Scarborough, Maine, is reaping the perks that come with placing in
the top five at this year's Nationals: She'll go to Germany and
Japan next fall for Grand Prix events . . . Sunday's inaugural
Track &AMP; Field Association pro meet on Long Island (live on ESPN) is
a model for the spectator- and TV-friendly circuit that's designed
to breathe life into a sagging sport. Eight events per gender,
eight athletes per event, a tight two-hour program, and a $100,000
jackpot for the winner of a random event (the women's 100 hurdles
Sunday). The only thing lacking Sunday is the marquee duels in the
glamor events. Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Mike Marsh
both pulled out of the 200, and Gail Devers begged off her planned
matchup with Marion Jones in the 100 . . . Heroine's welcome for
paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, who finally returned to Beijing
10 months after breaking her neck at the Goodwill Games on Long
Island. ``She's approached her problems like a superwoman,'' a
government official declared. ``She's the pride of all Chinese.'' .
. . No surprises among the first batch of US rowers qualifying for
this summer's world championships in Ontario: Scullers Jamie Koven
and Leslie Burns Rawley, lightweight sculler Sherri Kiklas, and the
lightweight double of Steve Tucker-Conal Groom all retained their
spots on the team. Second batch (men's and women's doubles and
men's lightweight quad) will be chosen this week in South Carolina.
Doubles favorites are Dan Protz-Phil Henry and Laurel Korholz-Jen
Dore. Not surprisingly, the American entries got hammered in last
weekend's World Cup opener in Belgium. Only the women's pair made
the final and Koven, the former world champ, was last in his semi.
Next regatta is in Vienna in two weeks.

   Inauspicious season's start by the US men's volleyball team,
which was swept by the Canadians in its three-match tour above the
border and faces a bumpy road to Sydney. Next up is a tour of
Japan. The women, who haven't played since March because their
domestic tour with the Russians was canceled, are sparring with the
Dominican Republic this week . . . Yet another milestone for beach
volleyball player Karch Kiraly, who can match the career record for
victories (139) by winning the Dallas Open Sunday with Adam
Johnson. Kiraly's former partner (and present rival) Sinjin Smith
holds the mark . . . After missing an automatic Olympic berth by
losing to the host Canadians in the World Cup last weekend, the US
women's water polo team will have to wait until next spring for a
second chance. The Yanks, who'd beaten Canada in the prelims,
dropped the payoff match by two goals . . . So where is the
international bobsledding federation holding this year's congress?
In Jamaica, of course, where the only ice is in the Planter's
punch. Cool runnings, mon.

   WEST POINT, Miss. _ There was much hoopla made over the fact
that the 1999 Masters went off without Jack Nicklaus, who was
recovering from hip replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Very little has been made of the fact that the US Women's Open
is being played without Pat Bradley. The pride of Westford, Mass.,
has played every one since her debut in 1975 and she deserves to be
here. She would like to be here, too, but was not offered an
exemption by the US Golf Association Women's Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, as the third round was played out, Bradley couldn't
watch. ``I'm sitting here, basically in shock,'' she said from her
home. ``It does not seem right. I gave 25 years of my life to the
United States Women's Open and felt I deserved better treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   She is right.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is the only woman to win all four of her sport's major
championships and, at 48, she still competes fulltime. When she
received her entry form for this year's Open, Bradley wrote on it:
``Former Open winner (1981) and member of the Hall of Fame.'' It
was not a request for an exemption, but a reminder of who she was.
</P>
<P>
   What she got back was a tee time for a sectional qualifer in
Tennessee. Saddened, Bradley chose not to go through a qualifier.
As it turns out, she couldn't have, anyway, because the funeral for
her brother Richard, who died after a long battle with cancer, was
that same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down in my heart,'' said Bradley, ``I feel I should be
(at Old Waverly Golf Club). ``I don't think (the USGA Women's
Committee is) looking at the big picture. My record speaks for
itself. I feel I deserve recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Exemptions into this year's tournament went to Nancy Lopez and
Jane Geddes. No argument there. Bradley and Amy Alcott received
them last year, and ``I thanked them very, very much,'' said
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Capouch, chairman of the USGA Women's Committee, said
``when Bradley's name came up (for this year), we looked at her
place on the money list (she's currently 85th with $33,619 in 10
events) and felt it wasn't high enough. It was tough. She's a great
champion and a great friend of the USGA.''
</P>
<P>
   Capouch said she wrote Bradley, explaining the Women's
Committee's thought process. ``We usually give past champions an
exemption the first year (that their window of exemption expires),
and that was last year for Pat.'' Great champions, she said, will
often get a second exemption, though rarely back-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine she will get another exemption,'' said Capouch.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that is the hypocrisy. Last year, Nicklaus was
given an exemption into the US Open at The Olympic Club, and at the
same time the USGA said he would be in the field in 1999 and 2000.
``Where is that for us?'' said Bradley, including the names of
Alcott and JoAnne Carner. They, too, are Hall of Famers, and
Bradley thinks deserving of at least offers to play.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Rich Beem. The question: Why are so many golfers out
there plugging along, trying to make it in this impossible game?
</P>
<P>
   Brett Quigley has always known the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
players out there who have got the physical game. It's getting into
a position to allow yourself the chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beem last week manufactured one of the best stories pro golf has
witnessed in some time. The 28-year-old went wire-to-wire to win
the Kemper Open, earning $450,000 and a two-year exemption on the
PGA Tour. Not bad for a guy who not long ago was playing
small-change tournaments in New Mexico, a guy who had quit the game
at age 24 to sell car stereo equipment, a guy who had made just
four cuts and $24,590 in this, his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Call it whatever you want. Quigley said it proves a point:
``Golf is a simple game when you play it well.'' Beem, said
Quigley, obviously was good enough to get through Qualifying School
(he finished ninth to earn his card), and at Kemper he seized the
opportunity. While he receives not a nickel of Beem's prize money,
Quigley does get some sort of satisfaction because he, too, is
waiting for a break.
</P>
<P>
   The Barrington, R.I., native finished 128th on the money list,
but only the top 125 are fully exempt. Quigley fits in behind those
125, as well as the Tour School graduates and special-category
players such as former champions. The first half of the season is
when players are most active, so Quigley's chances have been few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to sit back and watch,'' said Quigley. ``Then when
I do get out there, I'm trying too hard. I'm putting pressure on
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley has gotten into just eight of 22 tournaments, missing
five cuts, and earning just $76,910. There will be more chances, he
knows, in the second half of the season, but the truth is this: By
then he'll be looking up a money list at players tens of thousands
of dollars ahead of him. It'll be like trying to make up a six-shot
deficit on the back side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have weeks off,'' said Quigley, trying to look at
the bright side. ``I can get things in focus, step back, and tell
myself to not try too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He will carry that philosophy to the first tee Monday when he
plays in a 36-hole US Open sectional at Bear Lakes in West Palm
Beach, Fla. Perhaps he'll earn a trip to Pinehurst, perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may not be David Duval-Tiger Woods, but an intriguing rivalry
is shaping up on the LPGA Tour. Grace Park will turn professional
Monday and almost immediately will be compared to Se Ri Pak.
Whether it was coincidence or not, the Seoul natives were paired
Thursday and Friday at the US Women's Open, an engaging story for
the many Korean journalists here.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, a hero in her homeland at the tender age of 22, is the
defending champion, a money-making machine for IMG and Samsung, and
a powerfully built golfing talent.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Park, who is a few months beyond her 20th birthday but
carries herself like a veteran. Which, in a way, she is. A standout
on the American Junior Golf Association circuit, she has been
heralded in golf circles for quite a while, and there are those who
feel she will, in a very short time, become the premier player on
the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Do not think, however, that Park is cut from the same mold as
Pak. Park does not command as much attention in her homeland
because her parents sent her to Hawaii in 1991 and to Phoenix two
years later, which many in Korea resent. Park has been molded into
a golf phenom, a strong player who casually talks about her
300-yard drives and seems to notice nothing around her. She won
last summer's US Women's Amateur, smiled, then yawned. Same thing
with the recent NCAA championship, which she won.
</P>
<P>
   Nice, but just part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sources have reported that there is some resentment in the camps
of these young talents. Pak played her junior golf back home and
has received more attention in Korea, but her father is merely
wealthy. Park craves the attention, and her father, according to
sources, is wealthier than wealthy. ``Very, very expensive,'' he
said back at the 1997 US Women's Open when asked if he travels much
from Korea to visit his daughter. Not so expensive, however, that
he hasn't been able to make dozens of trips to the United States
each of the last eight years to watch his daughter develop.
</P>
<P>
   Soo Nam Park is very much in command of his daughter's career.
IMG need not apply, because father knows best. His daughter will
turn down sponsor's exemptions to LPGA Tour events and head right
to the Futures Tour and try to earn her card by being one of the
top three money-winners. Less glamour, of course, but Soo Nam has
determined that this is a business and it calls for a long-term
investment decision.
</P>
<P>
   Park should find the Futures Tour easy pickin's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Olin Browne avoided US Open qualifying with his victory at the
MasterCard Colonial two weeks ago, a victory that was quite a
surprise. ``When I got to 8 under (in the final round), I looked up
and saw that Greg Kraft was 10 under,'' said Browne. ``I was trying
to get to 10 under then promptly made a bogey.'' Browne got it to 8
under and Kraft lost three strokes coming home. It was the second
win in a calendar year for Browne (he won at Hartford last July),
and that was deemed worthy of a special exemption by the USGA.
Browne still has a lot of friends over at The Country Club, where
he played his golf one summer, and there is no one in the sport who
commands his respect more than longtime TCC head pro Don Callahan.
``He stands for all that is great about golf,'' said Browne, who
has earned another spot into the season-opening Mercedes
Championship. He missed last year's event after having elbow
surgery . . . During his induction into the World Golf Hall of
Fame, Seve Ballesteros related a story to reporters that goes a
long way in explaining his greatness. Living on a golf course in
Spain, Ballesteros's children naturally have access to the game.
Does he teach them? ``No, no,'' said Ballesteros. Instead, he gives
his youngest son, Javier, one club, an 8-iron, and says, ``Go play.
Go learn.'' One day, Javier notices his friends carrying bags with
many clubs. Perplexed, he asks why. The kids tell him that's what
you are supposed to do, and Javier says, ``No. My father says one
is all you need.'' Growing up poor, Seve had just one club, a
3-iron, which is what he used to develop his incomparable
shot-making skills.

NEW BOSS READY WITH HIS OWN CAPITAL IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Why does Ted Leonsis want to buy the Washington
Capitals?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I can,'' said the owner-to-be, the multimillionaire
executive with America On-Line.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey League's club of club owners continues to
change, almost on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Bill Davidson formally took control of the Tampa
Bay Lightning. Art Williams bailed out of the Bolts in less than a
year. In a little more than two weeks _ although the league would
prefer it happen sooner _ bankruptcy court in Pittsburgh will
determine who gets control of the debt-ridden Penguins. EMC
co-founder Roger Marino had to head to the courtroom when the red
ink got too deep.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Leonsis, a 1973 graduate of Lowell High School and
former head of public relations for Wang Labs, dreaming the dream
of propping up the Capitals in D.C. and making them a performing
and marketing force in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real left-brain/right-brain thing,'' said Leonsis, a
'77 Georgetown graduate whose family moved from Brooklyn to Lowell
in the late '60s. ``The left brain is the fan's point of view,
going to the game, and all the fun of it. The right brain says,
`Hey, this is a business like anything else _ and you can make it
work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals are a quirky fit. Based in a nontraditional hockey
market, they moved out of Landover, Md., last season with the
opening of the state-of-the-art MCI Center in downtown D.C. They
have a frighteningly low season-ticket base, believed to be no more
than 4,000, or about one-third of what the league demands of an
expansion franchise before it opens its doors. In a league of 27
teams, they also ranked 24th in paid attendance this past season.
In short, there is work to do, lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only afraid of what I don't know,'' Leonsis said in a
telephone interview last week when reminded of his challenges in
taking over the Capitals. ``I know all that.''
</P>
<P>
   To revivify the franchise, said Leonsis, he'll take a
three-pronged approach, which he identifies as 1. cosmetic; 2.
systemic; 3. cultural.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetically, there will be a whole new look, he said, including
new ticket pricing, new players, new offense.
</P>
<P>
   Systemically, Leonsis wants to break down what he believes are
existing barriers between fans and players and between fans and
ownership. Capitals business, from now on, will be from a
``fans-first'' perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make it more a Disney experience,'' he said. ``When
you're at the game, you'll have the feeling that every single
person is there to make your life better.''
</P>
<P>
   Culturally _ as in the corporate-ownership culture _ the Leonsis
approach will be to keep adding value to the franchise, to look at
it as a long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   Leonsis remembers the Bruins' heyday. His family moved to Lowell
in '69, the year before Bobby Orr and the Bruins won their first of
two Cups across three years. `` `Jesus Saves!' '' said Leonsis,
recalling a popular bumper sticker of the era. `` `And Esposito
scores on the rebound.' I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only days after arranging his deal to buy the Capitals, he came
to Boston as commencement speaker at Emerson College and made a
point of visiting the Vault to see the Bruins face the Sabres in
the playoffs. He'd like to see the same atmosphere and success in
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was screaming, and half the place was dressed up in
black-and-gold sweaters,'' said Leonsis. ``The Bruins haven't won
the Stanley Cup in, what, almost 30 years, yet the place was sold
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the 43-year-old Leonsis is energetic and confident.
Recent reports peg his wealth to be upward of $750 million. He is
everything the NHL wants, and certainly everything the Players'
Association loves _ a gregarious guy with bottomless pockets who
sees endless potential in the game. In hockey terms, he's ready to
take it for a skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution is everything,'' reminded Leonsis. ``We will be a
bolt of energy.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The late spring cleaning on Long Island saw Trevor Linden get
shoveled last weekend to Montreal, where the Canadiens committed
$15 million over the next four years to the former Canucks star.
The Islanders picked up Montreal's first-round draft pick, No. 10
overall, in the exchange. In the last three months, the Islanders
have ditched Scott Lachance, Robert Reichel, Sergei Nemchinov, Ted
Donato, and Tommy Salo. What's happening here? Simple answer:
Follow the money. The owners want Mike Milbury to run a young,
cheap franchise _ perhaps the only way to keep the boat afloat
unless Nassau County comes across with financial aid for a new
arena. Next to go will be scoring star Ziggy Palffy, who last
season came to terms on a five-year pact worth some $25 million.
What kind of deal will it take to land Palffy? The Bruins would
have to give up a Joe Thornton (forget it) or a Sergei Samsonov
(possibility). San Jose would have to cough up Patrick Marleau (a
chance). And the Kings would have to give up Olli Jokinen or Aki
Berg . . . No one in Toronto expects Mike Smith to end up back in
the Leafs' front office next season. In the moments following the
loss to the Sabres last week, Toronto boss Ken Dryden refused to
address Smith's status, saying the time wasn't appropriate. The
fact that the situation has lingered this long is essentially a
decision in itself. Look for Smith to catch on next month as a key
player in another front office _ possibly Minnesota . . . A sign of
the times: In days past, it was a guarantee that press rooms across
North America would fall silent when ex-Bruin coach Don Cherry
appeared on the tube for his Coach's Corner segment. However, when
the Leafs faced the Sabres last Monday night in Toronto, virtually
no one in the press box turned to catch the Grape One wax on with
partner Ron McLean. Cherry's act has lasted nearly a
quarter-century, and it has been worth millions to him, but even
his fellow Canadians appear to have grown tired of his jingoism and
Eurobashing . . . Nearly seven years after the swap, whom would you
rather have, Eric Lindros or Peter Forsberg? No doubt that L'Enfant
Terrible has sold a lot of tickets on Broad Street, but the two
best players in the game today are Forsberg and Jaromir Jagr. And
to think, the Flyers gave up not only Forsberg but also Steve
Duchesne, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, Ron Hextall, Chris Simon, a
pair of first-round picks and money. Lindros, by the way, agreed
last week to honor a handshake deal he made last year and will play
next season at $8.5 million. His father/agent, Carl Lindros, chose
not to talk about a long-term deal . . . Larry Robinson, back with
New Jersey as an assistant coach, will earn some $2 million in his
new five-year pact. The deal calls for the ex-Hab to be an
assistant coach for three years and then work as a club consultant
for two years, 2002-04 . . . Don't be surprised if the Oilers deal
away star forward Doug Weight this summer. He'll make $4.3 million
this season, which is about $6 million in Canadian funds. He's a
talent, but that's a little too rich for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>

   Some of the financial morass in Pittsburgh became untangled
Friday when bankruptcy judge Bernard Markovitz invalidated the
longstanding lease agreement between the Penguins and SMG Inc.,
landord of the Igloo. The decision should prove a major boost to
the bid by ex-Penguins star Mario Lemieux to buy the team _
possibly as early as June 24. Under the Lemieux plan, Marino would
remain a limited partner (at a cost of some $2 million). It was
Marino's decision to stop paying Lemieux and then to turn to
bankruptcy court for protection that ultimately led, in part, to
Friday's court decision to break the club's onerous Igloo lease.
``Roger and Mario met in the same room, face to face, about three
weeks ago,'' said Marino's Boston-based attorney, Harry Manion.
``And in the end, they shook hands. Roger just told him, `Look,
Mario, I didn't want not to pay you _ but there was just no more
money.' And Mario was great, saying, `I understand now what you
were up against, and I'd like you to be part of the deal.' '' The
SMG lease, set to run into the year 2007, was costing the Penguins
$7 million a year. For $24 million in up-front money to ownership
five years ago, SMG already received $35 million and stood to make
about another $56 million. The likely scenario now is for SMG and
Lemieux's group to work out a new lease that would keep the
Penguins in the Igloo until a new downtown arena can be built _ a
three- to five-year proposition. League VP William Daly said in
court that 20 of the league's 26 teams lost money in the '97-98
season . . . The Blues owe ex-Bruin Geoff Courtnall some $7 million
over the next two seasons, making him a likely candidate to be
exposed in the expansion draft that will stock Atlanta. Meanwhile,
Thrashers GM Don Waddell knocked down rumors last week that he
might be interested in giving up his No. 2 pick in the amateur
draft to acquire Palffy from the Islanders. He would be tempted to
pay $5 million a year only for a goalie, said Waddell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Corey unexpectedly stepped down as the Canadiens'
president last week, only hours after the Habs dished away their
first-round pick for Linden. On the job for 17 years, Corey said he
wants to spend more time with his family. The prevailing opinion
around Montreal is that Corey was pushed out, following another
disappointing season. Who's next? Ex-GM Serge Savard is expected to
be on the short list. Ex-Hab Bob Gainey, now the Dallas GM, said
he's not interested. ``Who wants to make a 50-cent buck and then
get nailed by the media?'' said ex-Hab Guy Lafleur . . . Michael
Peca, the Sabres' grinding center/captain, made $1.475 million in
1998-99. No fewer than 175 NHLers made more. It's tough to think of
a seven-figure salary as a bargain, but Peca rates as a blue-light
special in today's game . . . Rich Scimone, agent for former Bruin
Craig Janney, confirmed late last week that Janney has informed the
Islanders that he must retire. According to Scimone, extensive
medical tests show that Janney has a blood clot in one leg that
makes it impossible for him to continue playing . . . Don't look
for Ranger blue liner Jeff Beukeboom, hindered by a late-season
concussion, to resume his career. Consequently, the blueshirts will
scour the free agent market to come up with a right-side defenseman
_ possibly Stephane Quintal _ to play with Brian Leetch.

GORDON STILL COUNTING HIS BLESSINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-GORDON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ I want you to try something. Go to a computer and try
to log on to the Internet 54 consecutive times without failing.
Chances are you won't be able to do it (unless you are Cal Ripken).
You might punch in the wrong password. The phone line might be
busy. Maybe you forgot to pay your bill. Could be anything. It's
hard to do something 54 times in a row without making a few
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing when you think about it,'' Tom Gordon was
saying Saturday at Fenway Park. ``I never really thought about it
that much until now. Fifty-four in a row. Man, that's a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday, Gordon had gone more than a year without
blowing a save. The last time he did it was April 14, 1998, in
Oakland. Fifty-four times since then he had trotted out of a
bullpen in Boston, New York, Chicago, or Cleveland and preserved a
Red Sox win. Gordon is the only man in major league history to take
a regular-season saves streak over 50. Jose Mesa had the record, a
distant 43.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Stephen King wrote the book, ``The Girl Who
Loved Tom Gordon,'' a New York Times bestseller. Gordon means
safety. More than that, Gordon means victory. But the Braves were
in town Saturday and they became ``The Team That Slugged Tom
Gordon.'' The pitcher trotted out of the bullpen in the ninth
inning, the Sox holding a 5-4 lead. More than 32,000 people
cheered. A few minutes later, they were quiet as Gordon reminded
them why he points to the sky after he completes a job: Up there,
he believes, there is a higher power while here, Gordon is just a
pitcher. A pitcher who is human.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon got the first two outs of the ninth. But he couldn't get
by Chipper Jones, who singled. He had two strikes on Brian Jordan
before he also singled. And when Javy Lopez doubled to left,
driving in two runs, Gordon immediately got perspective. ``I
thought, `Man, I just blew a save,' '' he said. Shortly after, he
thought of The Streak.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates didn't let him dismiss his accomplishment as
frivolous history. Pedro Martinez approached Gordon in the
clubhouse and asked him to sign a baseball that said ``Tom Gordon _
54 Saves.'' Gordon appreciated that. ``The way he's been
pitching,'' Gordon said of his teammate, ``I might have to ask him
for a ball that says `30 wins in a row.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans would have been surprised to hear some of Gordon's
words Saturday. The first surprising statement was that he doesn't
consider himself a dominant closer, despite the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't call myself a closer,'' said the man who has been on
the job for one full season and parts of two others. ``I still have
a lot to learn. I think I'm one of the better relievers.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he can't call himself a closer because he still isn't
sure of the save rules. He was in New York and saw a save go to
Mariano Rivera and couldn't figure out why it did, because it
didn't appear to be a save situation. He asked Tim Wakefield to
explain it to him. He said Wakefield eventually told him, ``Flash,
I can't explain it to you anymore; you're going to have to figure
it out yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon laughed when he told that story. He laughed and smiled a
lot Saturday. He said he was blessed to have the streak and that he
``appreciated all the good things that were said in the
newspaper.'' He thanked his teammates, the organization, and the
fans. Fifty-four times in a row meant something to him. Newspapers
don't run mistake-free articles 54 days in a row. Sometimes you
write a check without incident and, say, on the 53d try, you forget
to sign your name. You tell your girlfriend that you love her 49
times in a row and on the 50th time you slip up and say something
like, ``I love me.'' Mistakes happen often.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8 of last year, Gordon blew a sizable lead against the
Braves in a game the Sox lost. He didn't see any similarities
between that game and this one. ``I was all over the place then,''
he said of the game at Turner Field. Not only that, but he hadn't
pitched in 10 days. Saturday, he said he felt better than he had in
his previous four outings. Really, the streak could have ended last
Saturday in Cleveland. He entered the game with a two-run lead, a
man on, and no one out. He walked the bases loaded, got a double
play, walked another man and then got a strikeout. How did he get
out of that one?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a miracle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon talked to his younger brother, Anthony, a few days ago.
Anthony Gordon was drafted by the Brewers (he's a pitcher, too) in
1988. As the brothers talked, Anthony told his older brother:
``We'll consider you a real closer when you get to 60.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make it to 60, but he's real. As a starter, he said he
had to look for things to do in the four days he wasn't pitching.
Now, he can pitch more often and stay busy. He was busy Saturday,
but for the first time in a year, in the regular season, he didn't
do his job. How many of us can say that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' he said of his run. The only thing that
compared to it was the day in 1986 the Kansas City Royals drafted
him. ``Well, now I've got to start a new streak,'' he said. ``I've
got to get to 60.''

GORTER, REVOLUTION PUT OUT FIRE

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution discovered a winning
combination Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. They switched to a 3-5-2 alignment,
returned Edwin Gorter to sweeper, and defeated the Chicago Fire,
2-0, for their first regulation-time home victory since last Sept.
19.
</P>
<P>
   The formation allowed the Revolution to field their
most-skillful players, and the result was more composure on the
ball, less predictability, and some better passing combinations.
Whatever the reason, the Revolution displayed the cohesiveness and
intangible traits of a successful team. And, they moved into to
fourth place with 11 points in 11 games in the Eastern Conference
of the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was also significant because it was accomplished
against the defending MLS Cup champions and before 21,313, the
largest home crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan McKinley set up the first goal with a sliding tackle on
Peter Nowak, then a penetrating dribble to the left side of the
penalty area. McKinley crossed for Joe-Max Moore, who converted his
first goal since May 1 and his first in the run of play since April
3. Moore, though, will miss the Revolution-Miami Fusion game next
Sunday to play for the US national team against Argentina in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tackle was lucky, and it was ideal because I got the ball
on my left foot,'' McKinley said. ``It was the finish (by Moore)
that made the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had been playing a 4-4-2 formation, but injuries
to Mike Burns (hamstring) and Richard Goulooze (knee) have caused
player-coach Walter Zenga to alter the defensive back line. But
this time, Zenga made a major change, returning Gorter to the
defense for the first time since last season. There were a couple
of miscommunications which led to Chicago chances, most of them
squandered by Ante Razov, but Gorter provided a calming effect and
even contributed to the first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, Gorter moved into the offense and took a pass
from Jair, who continued his run, drawing Chris Armas away from the
play. Gorter's left-footed shot was deflected by Fire goalie Zach
Thornton for a corner, and McKinley set up the goal as Chicago
attempted to clear.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago's Eastern European Connection _ Nowak, Roman
Kosecki, Lubos Kubik, and Jerzy Podbrozny _ continued to be
dangerous. Kubik advanced into attack in the second half as Francis
Okaroh marshalled the defense, but the Revolution clinched the
victory on McKinley's 76th-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley converted a header off a precise pass from John Harkes,
similar to the goal they combined on last week against the
MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, in his third Revolution start, again added leadership to
the right side of midfield, and allowed Jair to move to central
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Gorter, who had played only one complete game
this season, cannot be underestimated, since he raised the
Revolution's technical level several notches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just numbers,'' Zenga said. ``What is important in
soccer is the application of the players, staying together. When a
team wins one game, the team is compact and balanced. If Chicago
had scored in the second half, the questions would be different.
The one thing that is important in soccer is winning. The next game
will be harder. Every week is a different story.''

YALE LEAVES CRIMSON ALL WET

<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. _ The bulldog had bite for only the second
time in 14 years, but it was accompanied by a loud and clear bark:
Yale crew is back in business.
</P>
<P>
   Yale's heavyweight varsity crew put on a courageous show of
power and poise here Saturday evening on the Thames River as it
defeated Harvard by 1 1/2 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   The Eli covered the torturous 4-mile course in 20 minutes 45
seconds. Harvard was clocked in 20:51.
</P>
<P>
   The races were delayed more than three hours because of heavy
winds and a stronger than usual tide.
</P>
<P>
   Torturous? Yes. These crews row 2,000-meter races all year. Four
miles is 6,400 meters and a hair. That's like a heavyweight having
to fight 50-plus rounds instead of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Yale had played the bridesmaid too often in recent years in this
historic race, held for the 134th time since 1852. Before Saturday,
Harvard had won 13 of the last 14 races and 34 of 40. Harvard now
leads the series, 81-53.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's varsity led by two seats after a mile as both boats
slugged it out. It was Harvard by two seconds after 2 1/2 miles, a
seat after 3 miles, and three seats after 3 1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Then Yale cranked it up with a power 20 and took a three-seat
lead in a flash. That was it. The knockout punch was landed.
Harvard was stunned and couldn't recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes!'' bellowed Yale captain Jim Needham from his No. 6 seat
at the finish line, almost under the Gold Star Bridge. ``We wanted
it badly, we trained hard, and we rowed well as a team. We had good
senior leadership and we gave each other strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Needham, from Larchmont, N.Y., was one of seven seniors in the
big boat. The only underclassmen were sophomore Scott Proper
(recently promoted from second varsity) in the No. 5 seat and
junior Jim Donahue of Shrewsbury, Mass., in the No. 4 seat.
</P>
<P>
   Five Elis evened their record against Harvard at 2-2. Needham,
stroke Alex Reid, No. 7 Mark McCusker, No. 2 Hans von Trotha, and
coxswain Steve Pritzker were in the 1996 Eli freshman boat that was
part of a Yale sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this,'' said Pritzker of Alexandria, Va. ``We
practiced hard down here the past three weeks and it all paid off.
It was tough losing to Harvard the past two years, and this makes
up for it. This is the last race for most of us and it's the one
we'll remember most the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Yale coach Dave Vogel: ``Everything fell together nicely.
Our guys wanted it badly, they worked very hard all season, and I'm
proud of them. They got into a nice rhythm early and stayed
together. They'll always remember this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's undefeated freshmen, who will row at Henley, England,
later this month, were terrific as expected as they notched their
ninth victory with ease. The Crimson, the top seed and winner of
the Eastern Sprints, took command early.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson freshmen have won eight of nine contests by open
water.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard was timed in 10:36.97 and Yale in 10:47.14 for a 2
1/2-length margin.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard won the second varsity race in 16:17.4, while Yale was
clocked in 16:26.3.

COLEMAN MADE HISTORY FOR PAWTUCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On the day after, Michael Coleman wondered aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times,'' he asked, ``does a guy go 7 for 7 and hit
for the cycle?''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to verify, especially considering the murky way
in which minor league records were kept in the early part of this
century. But of the countless thousands who have played
professional baseball since 1900, the Pawtucket outfielder is the
first ever to go 7 for 7 while hitting for the cycle (home run,
triple, double, and single) in a game, according to minor league
historian Bill Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fantastic,'' Weiss said from his home in Northern
California. ``I've never heard of such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, batting leadoff for the PawSox Friday night, hit a
single in the first inning, a bases-empty home run in the second, a
two-run homer in the third, a two-run homer in the fourth, a single
in the fifth, and a double and triple in the seventh inning of
Pawtucket's 25-2 win over the Norfolk Mets at McCoy Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The single and the three home runs all came on first pitches,
evoking memories of Reggie Jackson hitting three home runs on
consecutive pitches against the Dodgers in Game 6 of the 1977 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hit three home runs in a game except in Little
League, and there it's easy,'' Coleman said Saturday from the
team's hotel in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's exactly how he made it look Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to feeling easy,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Only one major leaguer has ever had seven hits in a nine-inning
game. That was Rennie Stennett of the Pirates, who had four
singles, two doubles, and a triple in a 22-0 win over the Chicago
Cubs at Wrigley Field Sept. 16, 1975. Cesar Gutierrez went 7 for 7
for the Tigers in a 12-inning game June 21, 1970, and Rocky
Colavito of the Tigers went 7 for 10 in a 22-inning game June 24,
1962.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman became the first minor leaguer with seven hits in a game
since Neifi Perez, now the shortstop for the Colorado Rockies, had
seven hits in a 13-inning game Aug. 25, 1996. He is the first minor
leaguer to have seven hits in a nine-inning game since ex-Sox
outfielder Lee Tinsley, playing for Calgary in the Pirates' system,
went 7 for 8 in a 23-12 win over Las Vegas June 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, a statistician for 50 years who now serves as historical
consultant for Howe Sportsdata, provider of minor league stats,
said there has been an instance of a player getting eight hits in a
minor league game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three guys went 8 for 8 in the same game for Corsicana in the
Texas League back in 1902,'' Weiss said. ``They won, 51-3.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of those players, Corsicana catcher Nig Clarke, is
reputed to have hit eight home runs against Texarkana in that game,
according to ``Baseball: Doubleheader Collection of Facts, Feats
and Firsts,'' a Sporting News publication.
</P>
<P>
   But Weiss said there is reason to be skeptical about those
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rather peculiar game,'' he said. ``It was a
regulation Texas League game, but it was not played in a Texas
League park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the pitcher for the other team went the distance. The
story goes that A, he was a relative of the club owner, and B, the
club owner was mad at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's in the book as a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke went on to play 506 games in the big leagues, all during
baseball's so-called dead-ball era. He hit a total of six home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Coleman's seven hits came against pitchers who have
been in the big leagues. His first single and home run came off
Richie Lewis, who played for the Orioles and Marlins, among others,
and his second single came off Greg McMichael, who has pitched for
the Braves and Mets. And Norfolk came into the game with the best
record in the International League.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman hit his second home run off Johan Lopez, the third off
Dan Pontes. His first home run went over the left-field bullpen,
the second landed on the berm beyond the fence in left-center, and
the third landed in the right-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The hits that completed his cycle, however, came against a
5-foot-7-inch infielder, Todd Haney, who pitched the seventh
inning, when the PawSox scored nine runs. The double went into the
left-field corner. So did the triple, taking a bounce away from the
left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   The McCoy Stadium crowd of more than 6,300, which also got to
see parts of Pedro Martinez's 16-strikeout game on the video
scoreboard, roared its approval when it was announced over the PA
that Coleman had hit for the cycle, an event that in the big
leagues is almost as rare as a no-hitter. Coming into this season,
players had hit for the cycle 199 times since 1900; there have been
197 nine-inning no-hitters in that same span.
</P>
<P>
   The PawSox didn't score in the eighth, thus falling a run short
of the team record for runs in a game. Their 29 hits were a team
record. Coleman, who drove in seven runs, set club records for hits
and total bases (19) while tying club records for home runs and
runs (6).
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed was Joe Depastino, the ninth hitter in the PawSox
order, who went 5 for 5 with a walk and also scored six runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he got a hit, I got a hit,'' Coleman said. ``I was
following him.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago this spring, Coleman, 23, was touted as Boston's
center fielder of the future after a big-league callup the previous
fall. But when he didn't make the team out of camp and was sent
back to the minors, he went into a funk, hitting just .253 with 14
home runs in 93 games, and was benched after refusing Dan
Duquette's orders to undergo counseling. He eventually relented and
did see a Providence-based psychiatrist, but when the Sox promoted
a rookie outfielder this spring, it was Trot Nixon, not Coleman,
who talked about possibly qutting baseball and playing college
football.
</P>
<P>
   But after recovering from a knee injury in camp, Coleman has
seen his average climb steadlily, and his attitude no longer
appears to be an issue. On May 16, he was batting .237. Since then,
he is batting .359 (28 for 78), raising his average 62 percentage
points to .299.
</P>
<P>
   That average went up 34 points after the 7-for-7 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making a lot of progress at the plate,'' Duquette said
Saturday. ``He's done all of the work everyone has asked him to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Coleman was hoping to revive the team's interest in him, he
couldn't have done it better had he worn a flashing neon sign to
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it did,'' he said sleepily Saturday, having gotten just
three hours' sleep before catching the team's 6:30 a.m. bus to the
airport for the trip to Buffalo. ``We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not ready for them, I'm ready for somebody. I've heard
some trade rumors. I guess we'll find out at the All-Star break.
But only they can make that call.''

<P>
   BELGRADE _ Not once during NATO's onslaught on Serbia did
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic appear in public. He did not
walk in the streets of Belgrade. He visited no hospitals and
addressed no troops.
</P>
<P>
   He was silent. And now, in the twilight zone between war and
economic disaster, he remains silent.
</P>
<P>
   He had prepared for the worst. According to those who claim to
know his financial arrangements, the Milosevic family fortune was
transferred out of Yugoslavia long before NATO commenced its
bombardment, moved via Cyprus and Lebanon to an account in the
Shanghai free zone with the help of the president's personal
banker, Borka Vucic, the head of the Yugoslav bankers association.
</P>
<P>
   And his decision to accept NATO's ``peace'' terms was made by
May 28, a week before the end of the war. That was the day Russian
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin arrived in Belgrade for 10 hours of talks
with Milosevic and left _ though his words were largely ignored at
the time _ ``very pleased'' with the results.
</P>
<P>
   The president had sent Mirko Mirjanovic, the Serbian prime
minister, to meet Chernomyrdin at Surcin airport and, in the car en
route to the Beli Dvor Palace, the former Russian prime minister
asked Mirjanovic why the Serbs were being ``stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister understood the question, but said: ``It's the
boss who is taking the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chernomyrdin mentioned the exchange to Milosevic, the
president was incensed and refused Mirjanovic permission to return
to the airport with the Russian envoy. But ``the boss'' had already
made his decision to accept NATO's demands _ provided NATO troops
would not be allowed to travel outside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one day after the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The
Hague had published its indictment against the Serbian leader.
</P>
<P>
   And he had, according to those who know him, suffered another
shock: a minor stroke three weeks ago that affected his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, videotape of the Chernomyrdin-Milosevic meeting on May
28 shows the Milosevic greeting his visitor with a right handshake
rather than his usual two-hand grip. His left arm hung by his side.
</P>
<P>
   He already knew, of course, that his country was being
pulverized into the 19th century. An economic study just finished
in Belgrade showed that by May 21, annual per capita income in
Serbia had fallen from $1,000 to $450 _ about equal to the wealth
of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Did Milosevic also fear that a NATO ground offensive might bring
Western troops all the way to Belgrade?
</P>
<P>
   An opposition editor in Belgrade is convinced that it was the
indictment from Louise Arbour, the U.N. war-crime prosecutor, that
persuaded Milosevic to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided he had no other choice. Either he would remain the
boss in Serbia and lose Kosovo, or there would be a ground
intervention and troops in Belgrade and he would be sent for trial
in The Hague,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had 24 hours to think it over. He knew NATO was approaching
the moment of decision on a ground offensive, and that meant the
occupation of the whole country and the end for him. He did what he
always does: he took the worst decision in the worst conditions.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But NATO never had the courage to invade Kosovo, let alone the
rest of Yugoslavia. Besides, Milosevic has been threatened with an
indictment before _ and his colleagues in Bosnia, General Ratko
Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, have escaped NATO's arrest teams for
more than two years in a land controlled by American, British and
French troops.
</P>
<P>
   And when Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari arrived on June 2
along with Chernomyrdin, Milosevic put on a show of statesmanship
for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   There were no lounge chairs and sofas; the delegations were seen
facing each other across a conference table with Milosevic flanked
by two of the other Serb leaders indicted by Arbour: the army chief
of staff, General Dragoljub Ojdanic, and the Serb president, Milan
Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
   President Milosevic received his assurance that NATO troops
would be confined to Kosovo _ and that there would be no mention of
a ``will of the people'' mechanism to change the status of Kosovo
after three years (a key clause in the original Paris peace
agreement signed by the Kosovo Albanians).
</P>
<P>
   NATO could enter part of Serbia, but Serbia's claim to Kosovo
remained unchallenged. But would this be enough for Milosevic to
claim he had saved his nation from defeat? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Veselina, president of the Vojvodina Coalition in the
Serbian parliament and a professor of political economics, believes
there is no future for Serbia as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains
in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no peace in Serbia until Milosevic and his
government have gone,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Serbia will qualify for economic aid as long as
Milosevic is here. Milosevic and his government must go. But they
will not go willingly. Our population should be released from fear,
they should feel free and speak freely and organize freely.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that Yugoslav democrats will rise up to throw
Milosevic from power may well be vain.
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs, including Veselina, fear that right-wing
nationalists such as Vojislav Seselj, the deputy prime minister of
Serbia, leader of the Serbian Radical Party and the notorious White
Eagles militia, could take power, leaving Serbia in the hands of an
openly fascist government rather than the crypto-socialist
dictatorship of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Russians step in then to offer Milosevic sanctuary? A
Russian exile for Milosevic, while it would be anathema to NATO
countries, might be a price worth paying for Moscow's cooperation
in Kosovo and the willing participation of Russian troops in
Yugoslavia under a unified command.
</P>
<P>
   And from Russia, of course, President Milosevic could even
travel on to China, and to the city of Shanghai. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE _ Not once during NATO's onslaught on Serbia did
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic appear in public. He did not
walk in the streets of Belgrade. He visited no hospitals and
addressed no troops.
</P>
<P>
   He was silent. And now, in the twilight zone between war and
economic disaster, he remains silent.
</P>
<P>
   He had prepared for the worst. According to those who claim to
know his financial arrangements, the Milosevic family fortune was
transferred out of Yugoslavia long before NATO commenced its
bombardment, moved via Cyprus and Lebanon to an account in the
Shanghai free zone with the help of the president's personal
banker, Borka Vucic, the head of the Yugoslav bankers association.
</P>
<P>
   And his decision to accept NATO's ``peace'' terms was made by
May 28, a week before the end of the war. That was the day Russian
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin arrived in Belgrade for 10 hours of talks
with Milosevic and left _ though his words were largely ignored at
the time _ ``very pleased'' with the results.
</P>
<P>
   The president had sent Mirko Mirjanovic, the Serbian prime
minister, to meet Chernomyrdin at Surcin airport and, in the car en
route to the Beli Dvor Palace, the former Russian prime minister
asked Mirjanovic why the Serbs were being ``stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister understood the question, but said: ``It's the
boss who is taking the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chernomyrdin mentioned the exchange to Milosevic, the
president was incensed and refused Mirjanovic permission to return
to the airport with the Russian envoy. But ``the boss'' had already
made his decision to accept NATO's demands _ provided NATO troops
would not be allowed to travel outside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one day after the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The
Hague had published its indictment against the Serbian leader.
</P>
<P>
   And he had, according to those who know him, suffered another
shock: a minor stroke three weeks ago that affected his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, videotape of the Chernomyrdin-Milosevic meeting on May
28 shows the Milosevic greeting his visitor with a right handshake
rather than his usual two-hand grip. His left arm hung by his side.
</P>
<P>
   He already knew, of course, that his country was being
pulverized into the 19th century. An economic study just finished
in Belgrade showed that by May 21, annual per capita income in
Serbia had fallen from $1,000 to $450 _ about equal to the wealth
of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Did Milosevic also fear that a NATO ground offensive might bring
Western troops all the way to Belgrade?
</P>
<P>
   An opposition editor in Belgrade is convinced that it was the
indictment from Louise Arbour, the U.N. war-crime prosecutor, that
persuaded Milosevic to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided he had no other choice. Either he would remain the
boss in Serbia and lose Kosovo, or there would be a ground
intervention and troops in Belgrade and he would be sent for trial
in The Hague,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had 24 hours to think it over. He knew NATO was approaching
the moment of decision on a ground offensive, and that meant the
occupation of the whole country and the end for him. He did what he
always does: he took the worst decision in the worst conditions.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But NATO never had the courage to invade Kosovo, let alone the
rest of Yugoslavia. Besides, Milosevic has been threatened with an
indictment before _ and his colleagues in Bosnia, General Ratko
Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, have escaped NATO's arrest teams for
more than two years in a land controlled by American, British and
French troops.
</P>
<P>
   And when Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari arrived on June 2
along with Chernomyrdin, Milosevic put on a show of statesmanship
for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   There were no lounge chairs and sofas; the delegations were seen
facing each other across a conference table with Milosevic flanked
by two of the other Serb leaders indicted by Arbour: the army chief
of staff, General Dragoljub Ojdanic, and the Serb president, Milan
Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
   President Milosevic received his assurance that NATO troops
would be confined to Kosovo _ and that there would be no mention of
a ``will of the people'' mechanism to change the status of Kosovo
after three years (a key clause in the original Paris peace
agreement signed by the Kosovo Albanians).
</P>
<P>
   NATO could enter part of Serbia, but Serbia's claim to Kosovo
remained unchallenged. But would this be enough for Milosevic to
claim he had saved his nation from defeat? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Veselina, president of the Vojvodina Coalition in the
Serbian parliament and a professor of political economics, believes
there is no future for Serbia as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains
in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no peace in Serbia until Milosevic and his
government have gone,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Serbia will qualify for economic aid as long as
Milosevic is here. Milosevic and his government must go. But they
will not go willingly. Our population should be released from fear,
they should feel free and speak freely and organize freely.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that Yugoslav democrats will rise up to throw
Milosevic from power may well be vain.
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs, including Veselina, fear that right-wing
nationalists such as Vojislav Seselj, the deputy prime minister of
Serbia, leader of the Serbian Radical Party and the notorious White
Eagles militia, could take power, leaving Serbia in the hands of an
openly fascist government rather than the crypto-socialist
dictatorship of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Russians step in then to offer Milosevic sanctuary? A
Russian exile for Milosevic, while it would be anathema to NATO
countries, might be a price worth paying for Moscow's cooperation
in Kosovo and the willing participation of Russian troops in
Yugoslavia under a unified command.
</P>
<P>
   And from Russia, of course, President Milosevic could even
travel on to China, and to the city of Shanghai. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Victory in Kosovo is being celebrated Sunday morning. The deal
struck with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic will end the
bombing and allow the process of rebuilding to begin.
</P>
<P>
   After 74 days of war we are back where we were at the beginning
of March: at the negotiating table. That is good. This newspaper
applauds both Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin for their work as go-betweens.
</P>
<P>
   But the war isn't over yet. NATO has created a desert, and it
would be unwise to call it peace.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be unwise to talk of victory. For who has gained?
What has been won?
</P>
<P>
   The Independent on Sunday has opposed this conflict from the
beginning, and we see no reason to change our view now. The war has
been waged in defiance of international law. By no criterion can it
be described as just.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand we believe that NATO's motives were honorable.
Slobodan Milosevic is a ruthless and wicked man; his policy towards
the Albanians in Kosovo has been breathtakingly vicious.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the attempt by the alliance to avert a
humanitarian catastrophe in the Balkans has resulted in a
humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The world today, furthermore, is an infinitely more dangerous
place than it was on March 24 when the bombers went in.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who see the Serbians as Milosevic's ``willing
executioners'' and therefore legitimate targets of NATO's bombers.
We do not.
</P>
<P>
   It is of course true that the alliance was scrupulous in its
attempts to avoid civilian deaths _ almost as scrupulous as it was
in its (successful) attempts to avoid the deaths of its own airmen
_ but it nevertheless waged war against the civilian population of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The collateral damage was inevitable. Throughout Yugoslavia
thousands of innocents have been killed and maimed. Millions have
been terrorized _ tortured by the nightly scream and roar of the
raiders, deprived of warmth and light and security.
</P>
<P>
   Mistargeted bombs have hit an old people's home, a gynecological
clinic, a prison, a hospital, blocks of apartments, a refugee
convoy, neutral embassies, a KLA post, an Albanian village and the
capital of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo itself the bombs provided a smoke screen for the death
squads, accelerated massacres and precipitated the most savage
phase in a long history of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The land is now so wasted and stained that it is impossible to
imagine Albanians and Serbs living there together in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million refugees have escaped into stinking,
comfortless camps, from which hopes of quickly rescuing them are
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? The war in Kosovo is likely to enter a new phase _ a
grinding, guerrilla war between the KLA and nominally unofficial
Serb militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peacekeepers'' will get caught in the cross-fire. Ethnic
cleansing will almost certainly continue, edging Kosovo towards
partition, in what has become the standard Balkan pattern.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to rejoice at here. Consider, meanwhile, what
the peace deal actually says. Its first deficiency is that the KLA
is not a party to it. The ``end of violence and repression'' in
Kosovo cannot therefore be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambouillet accords have been effectively shredded: in
diplomatic weasel-speak, the promise that they will be ``fully
considered'' means that they will be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has succeeded in obliterating the promises he opposed:
the international force is excluded from Serbia and Montenegro; the
integrity of Yugoslavia is guaranteed; the prospect of independent
Kosovo is scotched; there is no room for a meaningful referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, NATO's hope that the KLA will
voluntarily disarm looks risible.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, no one can genuinely implement the withdrawal of all
armed forces from Kosovo. The KLA will remain _ probably mouthing
compliance while keeping trigger-fingers busy. Serb communities
will shelter fighters for the next phase.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it looks as though the U.N. force will enter an
active arena, in hostile terrain. Paramilitaries will operate out
of the buffer zone and areas policed by Russia, or make sallies
from Albania or under cover of returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has had to surrender control of the field. The interim
administration will be determined by the U.N. Security Council _ it
will have to suit Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The international force will be riven by ambiguities. The
Russians will have their own command structure. Other non-NATO
contingents will have the right to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's war aims have narrowed to clearing up its own wreckage
and returning the refugees whose expulsion it helped to provoke.
</P>
<P>
   It need never have come to this. If the allies had been more
conciliatory at Rambouillet, Milosevic might have signed the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO insisted that, as well as having free access to all
parts of Yugoslavia, its troops should be immune from criminal
prosecution. Had that clause not been included there could have
been a deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Milosevic could by now have broken the deal, as
he did the earlier peace deal last October. Then again, he may
break the deal that has just been brokered by Ahtisaari and
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The horrors are not over. When the peacekeeping force enters
Kosovo there is no knowing what they will find.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that they will uncover mass graves. There may be
tens of thousands of bodies waiting for them. That would still not
justify the war, however. That would provide the alliance with that
most miserable of all justifications: a postwar casus belli. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. has grown too weary of President Slobodan
Milosevic's promises to take his word at face value. But if initial
reports are borne out, and the Yugoslav parliament's vote suggests
for the first time in three months that they could be, nowhere will
the satisfaction be greater than at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton's war, often dismissed as a ``coward's
war'' and ridiculed as ``immaculate coercion,'' will have been
vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a ``coward's war,'' but it is perhaps the only sort of
war that a squeamish public will support. What is more, it has

   It was as British Prime Minister Tony Blair posed for the
``family photo'' with European leaders at Thursday's summit in
Cologne, that the news came through from Belgrade that the Serbs
had finally caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two days earlier in Berlin, the last time the fifteen
men had gathered together, the news was equally dramatic: it was
March 24 and the skies over Serbia were darkening with the shadows
of NATO's bombing squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Cologne wanted to speak too soon or display
triumphalism but inside the summit the confident mood quickly took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track had finally won the day, albeit with the
help of NATO's overwhelming military superiority. But if diplomacy
has indeed won out it has been a tortuous road... &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton has had an ambivalent relationship
with the military since his first presidential campaign, when
documents suggested he dodged the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely looks comfortable addressing military audiences and
his salute still looks unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, however, his lack of experience may have given him
something to prove, and he has resorted to force more than any
recent president _ helped by the end of the Cold War, which removed
the risk of precipitating a superpower conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed into advocates of limited force, the likes of Bill
Clinton have resurrected the just war, a concept their anti-war
campaigning qualifies them uniquely to embrace... &QL;

   They are under no illusions as to what they expect to find if

killed, a country without infrastructure where they will need

it away as his parliament voted to accept the G8 proposals to end
the conflict with NATO.

<P>
   The deal demands the total withdrawal of Serbian forces from
Kosovo within seven days and the deployment of a NATO-led peace
force. It is a bitter pill for Belgrade.

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. has grown too weary of President Slobodan
Milosevic's promises to take his word at face value. But if initial
reports are borne out, and the Yugoslav parliament's vote suggests
for the first time in three months that they could be, nowhere will
the satisfaction be greater than at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton's war, often dismissed as a ``coward's
war'' and ridiculed as ``immaculate coercion,'' will have been
vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a ``coward's war,'' but it is perhaps the only sort of
war that a squeamish public will support. What is more, it has
worked... &QL;

   It was as British Prime Minister Tony Blair posed for the
``family photo'' with European leaders at Thursday's summit in
Cologne, that the news came through from Belgrade that the Serbs
had finally caved in.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two days earlier in Berlin, the last time the fifteen
men had gathered together, the news was equally dramatic: it was
March 24 and the skies over Serbia were darkening with the shadows
of NATO's bombing squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Cologne wanted to speak too soon or display
triumphalism but inside the summit the confident mood quickly took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic track had finally won the day, albeit with the
help of NATO's overwhelming military superiority. But if diplomacy
has indeed won out it has been a tortuous road... &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton has had an ambivalent relationship
with the military since his first presidential campaign, when
documents suggested he dodged the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely looks comfortable addressing military audiences and
his salute still looks unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, however, his lack of experience may have given him
something to prove, and he has resorted to force more than any
recent president _ helped by the end of the Cold War, which removed
the risk of precipitating a superpower conflict.

Clinton have resurrected the just war, a concept their anti-war

it away as his parliament voted to accept the G8 proposals to end
the conflict with NATO.

   The deal demands the total withdrawal of Serbian forces from
Kosovo within seven days and the deployment of a NATO-led peace
force. It is a bitter pill for Belgrade.

 &HT;    ONCE THE BOMBS STOP, REBUILDING KOSOVO WILL BE SLOW, DIFFICULT
AND COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON When U.S. Marines first set foot as peacekeepers
inside Kosovo, perhaps as early as this week, they'll begin what
promises to be a long-term mission to try to nurse the ravaged
province back to health.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring security and rebuilding Kosovo, however, are only the
most urgent steps in an emerging plan to knit the war-torn Balkans
back together and somehow shepherd the bloodstained region into the
fold of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, which only in recent weeks has become central to the
ambitions of the United States and its European allies, will likely
cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and could take
a generation to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Even that prognosis assumes success in a region that has a way
of dooming the best of intentions to failure.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that as soon as NATO bombs stop falling on
Serbia, NATO peacekeepers will march in. When their job will be
finished, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking decades,'' said Kurt Bassuener, associate
director of the Balkan Action Council, a research and policy group
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent billions on this war, and we're going to have to
spend billions to prevent another one,'' said Bassuener. ``It's
going to take leadership, it's going to take money, it's going to
take attention and it's going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   After 74 days of NATO air strikes, Serbia, and Kosovo in
particular, was still being pounded with bombs early Sunday. NATO
and Serb military commanders were scheduled to meet Sunday for a
second day at a cafe along the Macedonian border to try to agree on
a plan for pulling all Serb troops, police and paramilitary forces
out of Kosovo over the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the withdrawal begins in earnest, U.S. and NATO
officials insist, will the air strikes end.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, some 2,000 Marines as well as French, British
and other lead elements of a NATO peacekeeping force that will
eventually be 48,000 strong will start moving into Kosovo. Next,
convoys would begin hauling food and medical supplies into the
province to an estimated half a million ethnic Albanians who have
fled their homes and are living off the land inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 800,000 or so living in refugee camps or scattered
throughout private homes in neighboring Albania and Macedonia will
likely have to wait weeks, if not months, to return to their homes,
as NATO troops and aid workers rebuild shattered roads, bridges,
water supplies and shelter to accommodate the returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain amount of security has to be established before it's
safe for them to go back,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
Saturday. ``I'm not positive that everybody will be able to get
back before winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Daunting as it is, the task of securing Kosovo and enabling
refugees to return is only the first step in an overarching scheme
unfolding in Washington and European capitals to try to resuscitate
a region wheezing from nearly a decade of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an enormous opportunity to be seized here, a chance
to shift our focus from defeating something evil to building
something good,'' President Clinton said Friday. He was laying out
the fresh challenge to American policymakers and the public at
large to invest billions of dollars to help the Balkans mature into
a democratic and economically viable part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a goal that has been worth fighting for over the last
weeks,'' said Clinton, ``a goal we must work for with steadfast
determination in the months and in the years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The wording was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton once promised, after all, that American troops would be
required in Bosnia for a single year. That was nearly four years
ago. There are still 6,200 U.S. troops in Bosnia, part of a larger
NATO peacekeeping force there of some 31,000. And they appear
certain to remain for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made clear this time that stitching Kosovo back
together will be neither quick nor easy.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows how much it will cost to repair the destruction
NATO bombs have rained down upon Serbia's bridges, factories,
railroads, power plants and refineries, not to mention its military
barracks, ammo dumps, tanks and warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has destroyed nearly 1,000 major targets or pieces of
military equipment in the field, and Belgrade has estimated the
damage at up to $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and European aid will begin pouring into Kosovo as soon as
NATO peacekeepers secure the province. The issue of massive
assistance will be near the heart of the agenda when Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright meets with her counterparts from the
so-called Group of Eight _ Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Russia and the United States _ in Europe sometime this week,
and when Clinton joins other G-8 leaders in Cologne later this
month for their annual summit.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the rest of Serbia, however, is more problematic.
Anything other than humanitarian aid is likely to be withheld so
long as Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted for war crimes by a United Nations tribunal, Milosevic
is blamed by the West for Kosovo's humanitarian nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   With Serbia in ruins, the outlook for broader Balkan recovery is
grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prospects are bad,'' said Daniel Serwer, a former U.S. envoy
to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could rebuild every house in Kosovo and still not have an
economy,'' said Serwer. ``Kosovo's economy is dependent on Serbia,
as are the economies of several of Serbia's neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is rimmed by Balkan states struggling along the road to
political and economic renewal. Democratic and free market reforms
have swept through Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Macedonia and even
Montenegro. All are tied economically to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got ideal conditions in the surrounding states and a
disaster, a black hole, in the center of the Balkans,'' said
Serwer, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute for Peace, a
government think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Brittle as his future may be, Milosevic has proven to be a
political survivor. Every day he remains on his last leg in power,
said Serwer, postpones Balkan renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region as a whole can't recover fully without a change,
not only in leadership, but in the kind of regime that Serbia
has,'' said Serwer. ``The last thing they want to do is be left in
a cage with a wounded bear.''

 &HT;    Teaching hospitals deserve helping hand from everyone
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Stephanie Laster, the teen-ager most seriously
injured in the Heritage High School shooting, was rushed to
emergency medical treatment, she was taken to Atlanta's Grady
Memorial Hospital, which offers the best trauma care in the region.
The surgeon who operated on her was from Morehouse School of
Medicine, which along with the Emory University School of Medicine
places top faculty and approximately 420 resident physicians at
Grady.
</P>
<P>
   Grady, in fact, has trained approximately 25 percent of the
physicians practicing in Georgia. But like other teaching hospitals
around the country, it's in serious financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons enough to fault Grady for inefficient
management, but fixing those problems won't save it. Like other
teaching hospitals, Grady is bleeding millions annually. Blame a
combination of factors, the most crucial of which is huge cuts in
Medicare. Medicare reimbursement formulas have always allocated
substantial funds for graduate medical education at the nation's
1,600 teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 turned that upside down. It
slashed funding by $6 billion over five years, $16 billion over 10.
Last year, Grady was $5 million short. According to Adolph Mallory,
Grady public affairs officer, the hospital will lose $42.2 million
in Medicare and $12.2 million in Medicaid medical training funds by
2001. Some of the nation's premier clinical research centers have
lost even more.
</P>
<P>
   Some policy makers shrug and declare that resident physicians
can be placed at other hospitals if the public teaching
institutions go under. But the patient load and variety that Grady
receives are crucial to developing doctors' competency in trauma
care and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), a long-time
champion of medical education, is fashioning legislation to restore
half of the funding cuts for teaching hospitals. Georgia Sen. Max
Cleland is a co-sponsor of three related bills. Two of them deal
with cuts that may have been inadvertent, caused by the failure of
managed care corporations to contract with teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Grady has also faced reductions in local government
reimbursements. Over the past five years, Fulton and DeKalb
counties have decreased their funding to Grady for indigent care by
$23 million. And 48 percent of all patients treated by Grady last
year had no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, private insurance subsidized hospital costs for
indigent care. Along came prospective reimbursements that
predetermine the maximum cost of every procedure. Then came
for-profit managed care, as beholden to stockholders as to
patients. It contributes almost nothing to indigent care.
</P>
<P>
   The old way may not have been fair, but the new way has
seemingly intractable problems. Bearing the brunt are our teaching
hospitals, the incubators of medical advances that have made U.S.
health care the envy of the world.
</P>
<P>
   There's been little public debate on the issue of paying for
medical education _ especially the training of resident physicians,
80 percent of whom leave medical school with individual debts
greater than $100,000. But every participant in the system should
pay a little. That means for-profit managed care companies, and it
means all of us.

 &HT;    OK, you tell us; what do we call decade to come?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Barrels of ink cling to our fingers as we sweat
out the impending drama. What will our computers do at the stroke
of 00?
</P>
<P>
   Not to denigrate a good crisis, but it seems no one has fretted
another matter sufficiently: When the century's clock strikes none,
what to call the decade begun?
</P>
<P>
   I posed this question to my 11-year-old the other day.
</P>
<P>
   It came after one of those typical father-son exchanges showing
how out-of-touch with a decade a father can be. It had to do with
Korn, one of the musical groups my son cited as hot these days.
(Rolling Stone describes it as an ``angsty rap-metal quintet.''
Whah?)
</P>
<P>
   When I asked whether Korn started with a K or a C, he reacted
with, ``Dad, get with it. It's the Nineties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to say that to me much longer,'' I said.
``What are you going to tell me to do when it's the 2000s?''
</P>
<P>
   That put the clamps on him for a second.
</P>
<P>
   Just what do we call the '00s? I've heard no candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Do we call them the Zeroes? Do we call them the Zips? The
Zilches? The Cheeri-Ohs? The Ooohs?
</P>
<P>
   Do we call them the Oughts? The Naughts? Shuddering thought. We
go from the Nineties to the Naughties (as if the Nineties aren't
naughty enough.)
</P>
<P>
   ``How about the Nothings?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Diddly Squats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I think that has potential. The Diddlies. The Squats.
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``What of significance happened in the decade of the
Diddlies?''
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Squat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to come to a definitive term for the decade to
come. Ross Perot could chair it. If anyone knows Diddly, it's H.
Ross.
</P>
<P>
   If you think about it, this is the real Y2K crisis. This has far
more consequence. After all, even with crashes and black-outs and
calves' blood flowing from our taps, eventually all those
high-priced geeks are going to fix our 00 computer problem. But
what if we go through the next decade without a name for it?
</P>
<P>
   We've already seen amateurish attempts to label decades. Someone
somewhere tried to call the '70s the Me Decade. They were close,
only 10 years off. That was OK, because we could name the '80s
(which trickle-down economics made sure was even more about Me) the
Me II Decade, the Me-Me Decade, or Me Too, or Me Times 2.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, maybe we'd better wait for the decade to happen
before nicknaming it. We've conditioned ourselves somehow to
believe the worst about the future, and to fear the worst about
succeeding generations.
</P>
<P>
   What became of the optimism of the New Frontier?
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd like to assume that the next generation to take
the baton will be OK, indeed, better than that.
</P>
<P>
   So should we still be alarmed? You bet we should.
</P>
<P>
   We should all be on alert _ stockpiling food, water, batteries,
copies of National Geographic (to remind us of what the world
looked like before) _ for our want of any inkling of what to call
the decade to come.
</P>
<P>
   What did they call the 1900s? We know all about the '20s, the
'30s and so on. That was easy. Naming this decade is going to
challenge humanity. As economist Ray Perryman recently pointed out
in discussing the 2000 computer barrier, like Alexander the Great's
troops, we are approaching the edge of our map and don't know what
to make of it.
</P>
<P>
   And we're supposed to march bravely now into the Diddly Squats?

   LIONBRIDGE _ ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. _ One person's treasured
historic landmark is another person's dangerous traffic bottleneck
in St. Augustine, where the graceful Bridge of Lions may soon be
torn down. Preservationists plan to make last-ditch pleas at a June
7 (Monday) public hearing before the Florida Department of
Transportation, which will decide later this year whether to
refurbish or demolish the 73-year-old structure, which is graced by
turrets, arches and stately lion statues. Both the DOT and the
Coast Guard say the two-lane drawbridge is a problem, tying up both
car and boat traffic. Thousands of residents who face daily long
waits to cross it agree, saying safety is more important than
history. (MWilliams, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   POPE-POLAND (Pelplin, Poland) Standing on Bishop's Hill, a
sacred site that was forced into the German Reich during World War
II, John Paul II reminded Poles that Christian martyrdom continued
well into this century. The 79-year-old pope, who arrived in nearby
Gdansk on Saturday for a 13-day visit to his homeland, is seeking
to tend to his Polish flock ten years after the fall of communism,
and also to underline the themes of his papacy as he prepares to

   TEX-LAW-REFORM (Houston) _ Over the last decade, sweeping
changes have transformed the legal system here in Texas and in many
other states. Under the banner of lawsuit reform, Texas has helped
lead the way, embracing one of the nation's most ambitious attempts
to hold down the cost of civil suits and limit the size of jury
awards. For years, Texas had a reputation as the ``lawsuit capital
of America'' because its juries in injury cases were said to be
overly generous. But starting in the late 1980s, the state began
adding restrictions, like limits on punitive damage awards, and
provisions that make it harder for injured workers to sue. Now
Texas is seen as one of the most aggressive states in efforts to
curb civil suits under the banner of ``tort reform.'' By William
Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   BIKES-EXTINCT (Hannibal, Mo.) _ These are exquisite days to ride
a bike in this all-American, middle-American boyhood home of Mark
Twain. Kids can ride to school, to the Tom Sawyer Cave three miles
south, to fish on the banks of the Mississippi, to play pitch and
catch in a park. They can and they did, but they don't anymore.
Hannibal's parks, river banks and schools are all but barren of
bikes. And as Hannibal goes, so goes the nation. In the shadow of a
long, slow decline in cycling generally, the bicycle as a
century-old symbol of childhood freedom and transportation is
nearly extinct. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOLS-GUNS-REACT (Washington) _ School-sponsored rifle teams
and officer-training programs have come under scrutiny in recent
weeks as administrators redouble efforts to rid their schools of
guns in the wake of the Columbine High School killings.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-CONNERLY (Miami) _ Ward Connerly, the man who campaigned
successfully to end affirmative action in government hiring and
school admissions in California and Washington state, has now aimed
his crusade at Florida, to the sound of slamming doors. By Rick
Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   SHUTTLE-RDP (Cape Canaveral) _ Seven astronauts were getting
their Earth legs back on Sunday after an unusual
middle-of-the-night space-shuttle landing capped their 10-day
mission to stock cupboards aboard the new international space
station. By William Dickey.

<P>
   MRSGORE-PROFILE (Washington) _ A profile of Tipper Gore. Mrs.
Gore, defined constantly in opposition to her husband, is supposed
to be the earthy, unguarded, effervescent one. Seemingly everyone
who knows her describes her this way, and the conventional wisdom
is that, in the coming campaign, she will serve as an essential
antidote to Al, the unlabored warmth to his unyielding chill. But
in a brief, stilted conversation late last week, Mrs. Gore seemed
ill prepared for that assignment. Her answers were fuzzy, cautious,
and, in a few instances, incredible. By Frank Bruni.

SOFTWARE AD BLOCKERS CHALLENGE WEB INDUSTRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wash.)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An emerging category of Web software that blocks advertising is
challenging the Web industry and rankling the nerves of some
Internet executives.
</P>
<P>
   Known by such names as At Guard, Internet Junkbuster Proxy,
Intermute and Web Washer, these programs work by blocking ads
before they appear on the user's screen. For Web users, ad-blocking
software can mean faster performance, because files that contain
ads laden with graphics and animation take far longer to load than
files with text.
</P>
<P>
   For Web site operators, though, ad blocking is anything but a
benefit. Many executives of Web-based businesses contend that ad
blocking, were it to catch on significantly, could clog their
revenue stream and challenge the fundamental structure of the
emerging Internet industry. Invariably, industry officials draw a
comparison to television: If users want free Web content they, like
network television viewers, will need to put up with the
advertising that pays for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ad blocking is freely available how will everyone's needs
be met?'' said Scott Mathias, managing editor at ITVWorld.com, a
producer of online programming who said that widespread adoption of
ad blocking would seriously damage his small but growing business.
``The audience already allows overt advertising in mainstream
media, so they must be tolerant in the context of the online model
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in the wake of complaints of that sort, the
multimedia software company Real Networks canceled plans to
continue distributing another company's ad blocker, At Guard. Real
Networks' primary customers, which operate Web sites that employ
its software for transmitting audio and video material, complained
that Real Networks had no business promoting a product like At
Guard that could threaten their advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a lot of money is at stake. Last year, advertisers
spent nearly $2 billion to reach online audiences. Most of that
spending was for so-called banner advertisements _ ads, often
flashing or otherwise animated, that appear at various spots on Web
pages and beckon users to click for further information. By next
year, barring a mass adoption of ad-blocking software, the Internet
research firm Jupiter Communications expects banner ads to
represent $4.4 billion a year in Web advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ad-blocking programs have been available for several years. But
only recently have significant numbers of people begun using them
as a way to speed up their Web surfing. While market analysts have
yet to begin tracking sales of ad blockers, individual companies
report sales are on the rise lately. Siemens AG, the German
electronics giant that produces Web Washer, estimates that roughly
a million people have begun using the program since it was released
in December. Internet Mute Inc., the Cambridge, Mass., company that
makes Intermute, has seen rising sales in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers may still be small, compared with the estimated 67
million Web surfers in the United States, but producers of
ad-blocking software predict that more people will adopt their
products, spurred by the increasing freneticism of the advertisers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that the number of people who click on banner ads
has dropped dramatically in the last year, indicating that people
are becoming desensitized to the ads. Nielsen-NetRatings, which
tracks Internet advertising, says the click rate is now about half
the level of 1.35 percent that surveys measured a year ago, meaning
people on average now click on a particular ad fewer than once in
100 viewings.
</P>
<P>
   But advertisers argue that ad banners help them build brand
awareness, even when consumers do not actually click on them. Web
site operators complain that when an ad is blocked it is not
downloaded from the advertising server computer, which means they
do not get paid for ``serving'' an ad to that visitor to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Clamoring for the attention of these increasingly jaded
consumers, advertisers are adding more graphics and sound to their
Web ads _ which, in turn, means that Web surfers end up waiting
longer and longer for the ad-supported pages to appear on their
screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a war going on for surfers' attention; it's spoiling
the Web experience,'' said Jason Catlett, founder and president of
Junkbusters Inc. Although his company's main revenue source comes
from consulting fees for helping companies and individuals find
ways to filter out junk e-mail, the company also offers an
ad-blocking program called Internet Junkbuster Proxy. Like many
other providers of ad-blocking software, Junkbusters offers its
program free for downloading from its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Several other new ad-blocking programs have recently appeared on
the market, including Web Washer from Siemens. Ad-blocking utility
programs are increasingly offered as standard fare in software tool
kits sold to individuals to speed up Web performance or enhance
consumer privacy, such as the $30 At Guard program, which also
includes a personal ``firewall'' for preventing intrusions by
hackers and a feature that prevents Web sites from collecting data
about a visitor's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens, after announcing its Web Washer program in January,
immediately received numerous complaints from publisher groups and
online advertisers, said Horst Joepen, an executive with Siemens'
computer systems business development operation in Munich, Germany.
But he said that Siemens was standing firm. The company, which
hopes to become a leader in Internet technology, wants to curb the
surfeit of information on the network and encourage the industry to
develop forms of advertising that are better tailored to the
medium.
</P>
<P>
   Like many ad blockers, the Siemens program is free, distributed
through the company's own site and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this paradigm shift _ in a significant part
initiated by Web Washer _ is widely recognized and irreversible,''
Joepen said. ``The demand for Web Washer indicates clearly that the
current form of online ads is not attractive for the users and does
not make use of the interaction capabilities of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Web site publishers, though, blocking ads is akin to
trying to get something for free. After all, they say, you would
never expect to get an ad-free version of an ad-supported magazine.
``It's like a shoplifter coming and taking your money away,'' said
Charles Arruda, a vice president of Channelseek, which offers an
online guide to live events on the Web. In fact, Arruda feels so
strongly that ad blocking is a form of thievery that his company
has written software code that prevents anyone using an ad blocker
from even logging onto the company's site.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of ad blocking say the comparison to television,
magazines and other media is misguided. ``The Web is the only real
medium that can take over your device,'' said Anne Marshall,
product marketing manager at WRQ Inc. in Seattle, which sells At
Guard. Compared with a Web advertisement, which ties up the
computer for as long as it takes the ad to download, ``a TV ad
won't lock up your set when an ad runs,'' Ms. Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   If a commercial comes on while you are watching television, she
points out, you are free to change channels. In television, Ms.
Marshall said, there are industry standards governing the length
and loudness of commercials. By comparison, the Web is a
free-for-all, and advertisers are taking full advantage of new
technology to make ads as attention-grabbing as possible.

UNDATED: as possible.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yahoo, America Online and many other Web sites have gotten the
message, and have imposed a memory size limit on banner
advertisements. Still, ad-blocking advocates argue, not all Web
sites make an effort to keep ad sizes down, and users should be
given a choice whether they want to endure the performance problems
that huge ads create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users want more control over their experience,'' Ms. Marshall
said. ``If Web sites kept ad sizes down to a reasonable level, that
would be a different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It might also be a different thing when Internet access speed is
no longer an issue. For people who surf the Web from work, where a
user is more likely to have high-speed access, banner ads have far
less effect on Web performance. But even though cable modems and
other fast links are becoming available to home users, most
households still connect to the network through relatively pokey
dial-up modems connected to telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Even if network speed were not a factor, privacy might be.
Besides blocking advertisements, most of these programs also
prevent the installation of ``cookies'' _ downloaded files that
install themselves on the hard drive of Web users' computers and
invisibly collect data about their Web activities, like which sites
they visit and which pages they look at.
</P>
<P>
   Some people employ ad blockers because they prefer to remove the
clutter of advertisements while they're trying to read text or
perform research.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't even more people using ad-blocking software? For
starters, according to some analysts and Web site operators, many
consumers like to view advertising _ particularly if it is aimed
specifically at them, as ads increasingly are on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But Catlett of Junkbusters, and many analysts, say that most
people simply do not want to bother with installing the software.
After all, American consumers are exposed to advertisements all day
long and many have learned to tune them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most effective ad blocker people have is the one right
between their ears,'' said Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Nail points out, advertisers might be better off not
spending money to reach people who do not want to see their ads.
``Most people aren't going to bother installing one of the
programs, but if they do, they're not who you want to advertise to
anyway,'' he said. ``They're a waste of money.''

NARROWING THE ELECTRONIC NEWS GULF  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was noontime on the East Coast on Thursday, and in one office
after another, workers headed to their usual lunch spots on the
World Wide Web _ abcnews.com, cnn.com, msnbc.com, nytimes.com,
usatoday.com, washingtonpost.com, yahoo.com. The special on all
these menus was peace.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, and
the Serbian Parliament had accepted NATO's terms was being served
up very differently. On CNN Interactive and msnbc.com, articles
with original material were offered, along with the promise of live
video and audio coverage of President Clinton's comments on the
agreement. On The Washington Post's site, posted at 11:42 a.m., was
an article by Candice Hughes, the Associated Press correspondent in
Belgrade. The New York Times on the Web also offered Ms. Hughes'
report.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, wire service dispatches are still the main
ingredient of 24-hour news coverage on the World Wide Web, as far
as newspapers are concerned. The television sites, meanwhile, have
become their own wire services, mixing wire material with their own
reporters' information, putting one report after another on the
counter, sometimes with audio and video on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, however, that great divide _ between the once-a-day
multicourse meal of original material served up by newspapers on
the Web and the quickly changing menus of original fare of the
cable and broadcast sites _ is beginning to narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are beefing up their staffs of online journalists and
getting into the multimedia business; on Thursday afternoon, The
New York Times on the Web featured audio clips from key spokesmen.
And they retain their goal of depth. The Web sites of newspapers
like The Times, The Washington Post, The San Jose Mercury News
(with its ``Kosovo Watch'') and The Star Tribune of Minneapolis
(with links to other news and Balkan-related sites and a plethora
of multimedia material, including a snapshot of the key weapons
involved) had large packages available to those who had the time to
explore them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the television sites are trying to provide the
depth that is the newspapers' stock in trade; CNN.com, MSNBC.com
and ABCNews.com all featured full packages with graphics, maps and
extensive background material on the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Joining them in the hunt for online news fanatics are wire
services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Bloomberg News, the
financial news service that has gradually added general fare. Of
all the news organizations, they can best adapt to the
instantaneousness of the medium and its 24-hour cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to be at Bloomberg is a hybrid,'' said
Matthew Winkler, editor in chief of Bloomberg News, which feeds its
dispatches onto the Web site bloomberg.com. ``The appetite for
information on a real-time basis is growing. So there has to be
something esthetically that appeals to the reader of a great
newspaper or magazine but needs the staccato delivery of a
real-time news service. That is the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Television news organizations, particularly 24-hour news
channels, are well suited to the business of staccato delivery.
``What we do on the Internet is what we do on television,'' Mark
Bernstein, the general manager of CNN Interactive, said. ``That is
to pull the most appropriate, the most relevant, the most accurate
content from all the sources available to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same way we'll rely upon Christiane Amanpour,'' he
continued, ``we'll also rely on what we can get from AP and Reuters
and other CNN correspondents.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN has about 110 writers who contribute their material only to
cnn.com, he said, and they put in at least 100 updates a day. The
operation works 24 hours, but the staff is largest during regular
working hours _ the period when the site receives 75 percent of its
visits because people have high-speed access to the Internet
through office computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately,'' Bernstein said, ``we inherited a culture of
putting out the news when it happens. Newspapers continue to
struggle with what to do _ if they get the story at 2 in the
afternoon, do they put it on their Web site?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not. By early Thursday evening, The Wall Street
Journal's interactive edition was featuring the same article,
written by a Journal newspaper staffer, about the peace agreement
that would run, in substantially the same form, in Friday's
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The site of The Chicago Tribune has 30 news staffers, but it,
like most newspaper sites, was running with Ms. Hughes' Associated
Press story Thursday afternoon. It is not that The Tribune has
decided to be shy about putting original material on its site
during the day. Witt and his colleagues simply believe that _ even
though more than 50 percent of their visitors come from outside
their Midwest circulation area _ what they can do best is cover
breaking Chicago news because that is where their resources are
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, a reporter for The Tribune's Web site went to the
meeting of the Chicago City Council along with a reporter for the
newspaper. The story was pure theater: Jerry Springer, the
television talk show host, was going head to head with elected
officials over the violence on his shows.
</P>
<P>
   That scene, Witt said, was superbly geared to the Internet. The
exchanges became increasingly quotable, so the Web reporter filed
two or three updates during the afternoon to a rewrite person back
at the office, who wrote the account that was posted and updated,
while technicians worked to put the audio recording of the event up
on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly back to the future,'' Witt said. ``The Chicago
Tribune used to have five or six editions. We had the classic
situation: `Hello, darling, get me rewrite.' All we're doing now is
putting this newspaper back in the business it used to be before it
became a one-edition newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   What do the readers want? Judging by the ratings compiled by
Media Metrix Inc., which measures Internet use, they prefer the
fast-food approach of the television sites. MSNBC.com and cnn.com
both have at least 80 percent more unique _ or different _ visitors
than usatoday.com, the most-visited newspaper site.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a story is developing,'' said Rich Jaroslavsky, managing
editor of The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition, the
principal interest of the visitor is, `` `Tell me what's happening.
Right now, I don't have the time to spend exploring all the bells
and whistles.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the perspective and depth that newspapers provide, he said,
do not necessarily have to wait until the middle of the night, when
many newspaper sites post much of the next day's paper.
</P>
<P>
   The once-a-day delivery of news, Jaroslavsky pointed out,
evolved after newspapers found they were unable to compete with
radio and television in the race to be the first to deliver
information. The publications then sought out a new niche, offering
depth, interpretation and context that broadcasters found hard to
match.
</P>
<P>
   The Web, he said, eliminates the rationale for that strategy.
``When newspapers ceased to be the source of actual news,'' they
sought depth, he said. ``The Web allows newspapers to do both _ to
be competitive on a time basis with television, and to provide
perspective as well.''

A `LABOR ASSISTER' AND OTHER ODDS AND ENDS FOR MOMS AND DADS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: China, Fla., Calif.)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the first forceps were invented in the 17th century,
childbirth has been a fertile field for innovation. In this
century, pregnant women have been helped _ or, some have argued,
hindered _ by an explosion in new gadgets and procedures, ranging
from epidurals to contraptions for exercising the pelvic muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Novatrix, &UR;  &LR; a small company in Carlsbad, Calif., hopes that its
``labor assister'' will be the biggest thing in the hospital
delivery room since the advent of the fetal heart monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The labor assister, for which Novatrix recently received its
third patent, was initially conceived by Dr. Minying Gai, a Chinese
obstetrician who trained at Columbia University and who now
practices in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was looking for a way to reduce the incidence of
C-sections as well as births that require vacuum-extraction and
forceps,'' said John R. Bason, president of Novatrix.
</P>
<P>
   The device essentially mechanizes a practice that has been used
for centuries by midwives during the pushing stage of labor. Using
this technique, known as ``fundal pressure,'' the midwife presses
down on the top of the abdomen as the laboring woman begins a
contraction.
</P>
<P>
   The labor assister is essentially an inflatable plastic belt
that straps around the top of a mother's belly and plugs into a
tocotransducer, a machine that normally reads and graphs uterine
contractions and also monitors the fetal heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   When the laboring woman contracts, the transducer records a
change in pressure. This causes a valve to open so that a bladder
within the belt inflates for 30 seconds, exerting downward pressure
on the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bason, a study of 160 patients in China in 1992
showed that the device reduced the incidence of instrument-assisted
delivery by 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The device has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, but Bason contends that the potential market for
the device is $300 million a year in the United States, Canada and
Europe. Novatrix, which has $7.2 million in venture capital, is
currently conducting a patient study at five sites in the United
States and Britain. It hopes to submit data from that study to the
FDA next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's patent for this device is 5,871,499. &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Helping Eliminate Stretch Marks
</P>
<P>
   Are stretch marks inevitable? Dr. Kamran Ghodisian, an
obstetrician in Newport Beach, Calif., thinks not.
</P>
<P>
   Ghodisian's solution to postpartum seersucker skin is a thin
sheet of adhesive-backed, breathable polyurethane that is stretched
over the belly midway through the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   This membrane ``effectively neutralizes the forces of the
elastic and collagen fibers of the healthy dermis areas and
prevents the impaired areas from being stretched out,'' according
to the patent.
</P>
<P>
   After the baby is delivered, the membrane is peeled off,
supposedly revealing a striation-free stomach.

   Multiple Crib For Multiple Births
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of fertility treatments, multiple births are on
the rise. In response to this trend, Robert A. Butnick of Newport
Beach, Calif., has patented a crib for more than one infant.
</P>
<P>
   Butnick's larger-than-normal twin crib features a plexiglass
divider down the middle so that two babies may occupy it. A triplet
crib features two plexiglass dividers so that it may accommodate
three babies. The plexiglass allows the babies to see, but not
jostle, each other, according to the patent.
</P>
<P>
   Butnick received patent 5.787,524.

<P>
   A Gift Pack For Fathers-to-Be
</P>
<P>
   Not all childbirth inventions are for moms. Ashley Svopa, a
special education teacher in Coral Springs, Fla., patented an
``expectant father system'' last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``New fathers never get anything,'' Ms. Svopa said. ``After I
delivered, the baby and I got all the attention. My husband felt
left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Svopa's ``system'' is a kit, containing items both useful
and frivolous, that is meant to accompany the Dad-to-be to the
hospital. It includes such items as eye drops, fresh underwear, a
book for phone numbers of relatives and friends, a personalized
phone card, candy bars and cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Svopa has sold about 50 of her kits through word of mouth.
She is hoping to license patent 5,908,108.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hot and humid air will surge toward the northeast coast as winds
from the west become gusty at times. By afternoon, abundant
sunshine will boost temperatures to near record levels from eastern
Pennsylvania and New York to southern New England. Over the
Appalachians, some puffy cumulus clouds will help keep temperatures
a few degrees lower, but daytime readings will average 10 to 15
degrees above seasonal values.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will remain strong over the southeastern states,
helping to suppress the typical pattern of scattered afternoon
thundershowers over much of the region. Nevertheless, some
thunderstorms will form near the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts
where converging winds from sea breezes help lift the sultry air.
Otherwise, most areas will have ample sun mixed with clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Heat and high humidity will persist from the southern Plains to
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley ahead of a weak cool front.
Scattered thundershowers will develop as the front makes slow
progress to the east in the afternoon. A few potent thunderstorms
will develop over western Texas and Oklahoma late in the day. In
the wake of the front, less humid air will arrive in the northern
Plains and northern Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of unseasonably cool air masses will
spread over the northwestern states. Areas of clouds and showers
will be common especially near the coast and over the higher
terrain from the Cascades to the northern Rockies. Meanwhile, the
Southwest will be sunny with seasonal heat.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Positive Lightning
</P>
<P>
   All lightning is dangerous, but the first strokes in a storm may
be the most powerful of all. Lightning results when a difference in
electric charge in the atmosphere overcomes the resistance of the
air. Most thunderstorms have positive charges near the top and
negative charges at the bottom. Strong high-level winds can cause
the thunderstorm to tilt, with the positive charges drifting to the
front of the storm. Thus, the first strokes tend to lower positive
charges to the ground. Measurement of electric currents show that
these positive bolts can be twice as strong as negative lightning.

U.S. PEACE NEGOTIATOR WAS ALWAYS A DIPLOMAT AT HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Conn.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1967, when Yale, like many other universities,
was in ferment over the war in Vietnam, James Reston, the columnist
for The New York Times, was in New Haven and ran into a 21-year-old
junior named Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   When Reston asked Talbott where he stood on the war, Reston
wrote in his column, this is the response he got: ``I do not want
to help pillory the present administration. I am interested to see
if there are new means and attitudes by which this university, and
hence the university community in general, can make discussion less
polemical and more meaningful and at the same time help the search
for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Talbott, now 53 years old and the deputy secretary
of state, spent his entire career as a journalist before he joined
the Clinton administration, he obviously thought and spoke like a
diplomat even as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   His diplomatic skills bore fruit last week. After negotiations
with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, Talbott and
Russia's envoy on Kosovo, former Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin, and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, who was
representing the European Union, achieved an accord to end the war
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Saturday, Talbott, who arrived home
Friday night, was wary of saying anything that might jinx the
endgame in the Balkans. ``The talks at the border are still going
on, and this isn't over,'' he said. ``I want to make sure my
comments aren't ahead of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the negotiations as ``a very complex example of
diplomacy and force coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth week out of the last seven that Talbott (he
pronounces it TALL-but) has been in Europe. On weekends, he flew
home to meet with President Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very intense,'' he said. ``It's had its ups and
downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said that becoming a diplomat was never his ambition.
``Journalism is the only profession I ever aspired to,'' he said.
``It was a biographical fluke that presented me with this
extraordinary opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The fluke was that he and Bill Clinton were roommates at Oxford
when they were Rhodes Scholars, and they remained close friends
afterward. When Clinton became president in 1993, he made Talbott
ambassador-at-large with responsibility for countries of the former
Soviet Union. The next year, he became deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations over the war in Yugoslavia allowed ``a couple
of aspects of my life to come together,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   One was his interest in Russia. He majored in Russian studies at
Yale, is fluent in Russian and translated and edited two volumes of
Nikita Khrushchev's memoirs in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He and Chernomyrdin spoke Russian when they talked one on one,
aides said. When all three negotiators were at the table, the talks
were in English, and they were translated into Russian for
Chernomyrdin,
</P>
<P>
   The other aspect Talbott mentioned was his interest in
Yugoslavia. His first job after he and his wife were married in
1971 was as Eastern European correspondent for Time magazine, based
in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he turned on the television in his room in
Bonn, Germany, this week and saw the Yugoslav Parliament meeting on
the peace agreement, he recalled that the first apartment he and
his wife had in Belgrade was only three blocks away from the
Parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Strobridge Talbott III was born in Dayton, Ohio, on April
25, 1946. His father was an investment banker. He began learning
Russian in prep school at Hotchkiss in Connecticut and wrote his
thesis at Yale on the 19th century Russian lyric poet Fyodor
Tyuchev.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Time magazine after his years as a Rhodes Scholar and
never worked anywhere else until he entered the government. He
began as an intern in the Moscow bureau and rose to become
diplomatic correspondent, White House correspondent, Washington
bureau chief and editor at large.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bosnia peace negotiations were under way in Dayton in
1995, he pointed out to the participants some landmarks of his
youth, and he was host of a dinner at the Dayton Racquet Club, to
which his parents had belonged when he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott's wife, Brooke Shearer, has long been a friend of the
Clintons. She worked on the 1992 campaign and is now an official at
the Department of Interior, where she helps developing countries
set up park systems. They have two sons, Devin, 22, who is entering
law school in the fall, and Adrian, 18, who just finished his
freshman year at Amherst College.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Amherst dedicating a Russian culture center last
year, Talbott described how he had been fascinated by Russia ever
since the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite when he was
11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found it useful,'' he declared, ``to have, programmed
into the software of my thinking and puzzling about Russia, a sense
of what a mixed bag that proud and insecure, rich and deprived,
confused and confusing country has been, what it is today and what
it can be someday.''

 &HT;    For Lecter fans, Harris serves up a worthy sequel
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hide the chianti and fava beans. Hannibal Lecter, the
cannibalistic psychiatrist from Thomas Harris' best seller ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' is back. And he's as hungry as ever.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, it's Dr. Lecter who's on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   A million copies of Harris' long-awaited sequel, ``Hannibal,''
arrive in stores Tuesday, and the novel is a stunner. (Dino
DeLaurentiis has already paid $9 million for movie rights.) The
novel picks up seven years after Lecter escaped from custody and
Clarice Starling, the feisty young FBI trainee, disposed of
``Buffalo Bill,'' the serial killer who skinned his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Clarice is a full-fledged agent now, but she has made some
powerful enemies in the bureau. When a drug raid goes sour and
Clarice is forced to kill five people, including a woman carrying a
baby, she faces dismissal. But just when it looks as if her career
is over, she receives a letter from Lecter, and the manhunt for one
of the most vicious killers in history resumes.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarice is not the only one who wants to find Hannibal.
Mason Verger, the doctor's sixth victim, has offered $1 million to
anyone who kills Lecter and $3 million to anyone who captures him
alive.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought Hannibal was a monster, just wait until you meet
Verger. Paralyzed from the neck down and kept alive with a
respirator, the one-eyed Verger is faceless and lipless _ a result
of a little drug experiment Lecter employed in which Verger allowed
his face to be eaten by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy sadist before he met Lecter, Verger plays mind games
with troubled children in a day care center in his mansion, feeds
crippled ornamental carp to the giant moray eel he keeps in an
aquarium and attempts to track his nemesis' movements via a
worldwide web. Verger plans to exact his revenge in a particularly
gruesome fashion by feeding Lecter slowly to a herd of omnivorous
pigs and filming his demise.
</P>
<P>
   Foiled for years in his efforts to capture the elusive
sociopath, Verger decides that the best way to draw Lecter out is
to set a trap with irresistible bait: Clarice Starling.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting manhunt is a thrill ride through a house of
horrors, from the scene of a nightmarish 15th-century murder in
Florence to the bizarre interior of Verger's Maryland estate.
Harris introduces a fascinating supporting cast that includes
Verger's sexually abused sister, a lesbian bodybuilder on steroids;
Barney, the hospital orderly who once cared for Lecter; and Paul
Krendler, a misogynist bureaucrat intent on destroying Clarice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Harris takes us into the mind of Lecter to
revisit the traumatic event in World War II that spawned Hannibal
the Cannibal. Like Clarice, who is tortured by the childhood memory
of slaughtered lambs screaming, Lecter has his own demons that he
deals with by retreating into his ``memory palace,'

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John Rasmus, the editor in chief of National Geographic
Adventure, introduced his magazine this spring, he was pleased to
include an article titled ``Trouble in Shangri-La'' about a
kayaking expedition in Tibet that ended in the death of a research
chemist from Salt Lake City. In the second issue, Rasmus had an
article investigating the deaths of cave-diving enthusiasts in
Florida. And in the coming issue, he hopes to have an article about
George Mallory, the explorer whose body was found on Mount Everest
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the literature of adventure tragedy, or the art of the
yuppie expedition gone wrong. Whatever it is called, this brand of
nonfiction writing not only makes writers happy _ because many of
the articles are transformed into books or movies, with concomitant
advances and options often accumulating into the millions of
dollars _ but it also sells magazines, publishers acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, mainstream magazines like Vanity Fair and even a spinoff of
Maxim magazine, Stuff, are taking a cue from their adventuresome
colleagues like Mariah Media's Outside, and Men's Journal, which is
published by Wenner Media, and are featuring more stories from the
pantheon of high-end tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Vanity Fair, which is published by the Conde Nast
Publications unit of Advance Publications, ran Bryan Burroughs'
``Death at Sea: Behind the Scenes at an Ocean-Sailing Race Gone
Terribly Wrong,'' while Dennis Publishing's Stuff magazine carried
a feature by a hiker titled ``Reality Bites: I Saw My Wife Get
Killed By a Bear'' in its second issue, which came out two weeks
ago. (The article reads in part: ``When its stomach was cut open,
they only found bits of Christine's clothing; he hadn't begun
eating her.'')
</P>
<P>
   The literature of the adventure-gone-wrong has been a popular
genre with readers since Homer, and was carried on by Jack London
and Hemingway, but in its contemporary incarnation it picked up
steam in 1996, the year that seven people died on Mount Everest.
The same year, Sebastian Junger, a then-struggling free-lance
writer in the East Village, decided to get book publishers
interested in his manuscript about a swordfishing boat that sank
with a crew of six in 1991 by selling it first as an article to
Outside magazine. A year later, the resulting book was on the
best-seller lists and Junger was on the ``Oprah Winfrey Show.''
Since then, a month rarely goes by when consumers cannot spot a
headline like ``Avalanche: A Survivor's Story'' or ``Murder of a
Mountain Man,'' both from recent issues of Men's Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Why are American readers suddenly so voyeuristic, and so eager
to participate in the extreme-sports version of highway
rubbernecking? The answer, Junger said, is the fat-cat American
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a culture, we're bridling at the amount of safety and
luxury we have,'' Junger said. ``The 1980s was about all this
wealth and opulence, and it seems we're sated with that. Now
there's a whole new esthetic of being fit and adventuresome and
everyone has to canoe down something.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Lapham, the editor of Harper's magazine and a longtime
cultural observer of the magazine industry, says that the
fascination with disaster sells magazines. Witnessing a tragedy
befalling another human being ``is traditional tabloid fare,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sells,'' Lapham said. ``And the glossier magazines are just
taking the tabloid notion and dressing it up in better product.''
</P>
<P>
   Sell it does. When Outside magazine published a long-hyped
article by Jon Krakauer about the deaths on Mount Everest, the
magazine doubled its average newsstands sales: The October 1996
cover featuring Krakauer's piece sold 150,000 copies on the
newsstand, compared with an average of about 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McDonnell, editor of Men's Journal, says sales jump when
the magazine runs a particularly chilling adventure article. For
example, the December/January cover featured ``Avalanche: A
Survivor's Story''; it sold 99,000 copies on the newsstand, about
12,000 more than the average of 87,820 for the preceding six
months, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus of National Geographic Adventure said: ``We are going to
do as many of those stories as we can.'' He added that the Tibet
piece generated a ``tremendous response.''
</P>
<P>
   And not only did readers respond to the article, but so did
other outlets: The writer, Michael McRae, signed a deal with Random
House's Broadway Books division, to write a book based in part on
the article. One of the expedition's survivors, Ian Baker, also
signed a book deal with Random House for $500,000. And ``National
Geographic Explorer,'' a companion television program to the
National Geographic Society magazines, ran a segment on the death
of the kayaker, showing the soul-chilling videotaped footage of the
moment he sank beneath the rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus of National Geographic Adventure sees the growing body of
literature not as voyeurism, but as a kind of warning device.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are important stories, and we try to make them
instructive in terms of what went wrong, what could have been
prevented,'' Rasmus said. ``Every time someone dies, there's an
automatic response: It was a freak accident. There's an
institutional form of denial about risk that we need to be aware
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see the growing trend as a degeneration of a once-great
art form. Mark Bryant, the former editor of Outside, said, ``I see
a lot of would-be adventure stories that are being published right
now that might not have ever been published if not for the success
of authors like Krakauer and Junger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure that we don't become ambulance chasers,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the ambulance chasing is evident. Earlier this year,
adventure-travel agencies across the country received phone calls
from a researcher at Outside magazine who was trying to unearth
unreported stories of tragedy on the adventure trail. Hal Espen,
the editor of Outside, explained that the researcher was asked at
the behest of an editor no longer employed by Outside to find a
guide who had dealt with some form of tragedy on a trip he or she
was leading. The article, which never materialized, would have been
a psychological profile of a guide who had led clients to their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a subject we're wrestling with,'' Espen said. ``We have
to measure the almost voyeuristic view of tragedy against our
obligation to be authoritative and a genuine voice and a genuine
source of reference for people.''
</P>
<P>
   And new outdoor-enthusiast magazines continue to appear. This
year alone, new titles include National Geographic Adventure, Women
Outside and Outdoor Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Madden, the editor in chief of Outdoor Explorer
magazine, which is published by Times Mirror Magazines, said that
the genre was already overextended and that for that reason he
would not run articles that end in death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fond of saying that nothing dies in Outdoor Explorer,''
he said. ``Fish don't die. Deer don't die. Climbers don't die. That
end of the category is incredibly crowded. There are way too many
of those stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about the mellower, more fun aspect of adventure. We're
not about the death march.''
</P>
<P>
   And Espen of Outside predicted that the trend would soon reverse
itself. ``Watch the sales of sports utility vehicles as an index to
when it will cease,'' he said.

 CRITICS SEE INTERNET BOARD OVERSTEPPING ITS AUTHORITY  (ART ADV: A
photo and graphic are being sent. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were mysteriously appointed, they meet behind
closed doors and they have questionable public accountability. Yet
members of the interim board of the Internet's new oversight body
are beginning to make decisions and shape policy that could
ultimately affect everyone who uses the global network.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the $5.9 million annual budget of the oversight body,
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann,
this temporary board has voted to levy a $1 a year tax on the more
than four million Internet addresses, or domain names, that end in
.com, .net and .org. The board is also planning to impose tens of
thousands of dollars in licensing and other fees on companies that
want to get into the business of dispensing Internet addresses.
Recently, the board endorsed controversial recommendations for
establishing a new global framework for resolving disputes over who
can and cannot use certain words in their Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, the chairwoman of the interim board, which was set
up last year, says the group is carrying out its
government-mandated charge to break up the current monopoly in
Internet name registration and to move Internet governance to the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the board is overstepping its authority and
ignoring another mandate _ to create a transparent, bottoms-up
organization. Instead, they say, the board is working behind the
scenes with powerful international corporate and government
interests to create a top-down hierarchy that flies in the face of
the free-wheeling, consensus-based spirit that built the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are but the latest chapter in yearslong sniping
fueled by international jealousies and myriad conspiracy theories.
What is different now, some observers say, is that the Internet,
which is built on a cooperative technology for routing data around
the globe is in less stable hands _ increasing the risk that angry
factions will in effect secede from the network, damaging its
integrity by splitting it into several smaller, disconnected
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Although such a split is considered unlikely, anxiety over who
is running the show could curb investments in the rapidly growing
electronic commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks are that Icann has a little bit of authority but
very little legitimacy,'' said Bill Whyman, an Internet analyst for
the Legg Mason investment company in Washington. ``This is an
awkward consensus-building process. If it pushes too far and causes
itself to lose support among key constituencies, Icann itself can
be undercut. Then you have a very bad situation with no one in
control. Then you have a very bad situation for e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Icann was created last year by one of the Internet's founding
fathers, Jon Postel, as the Clinton administration moved to
complete the privatization of the Internet. The U.S. government,
which financed the creation of the Internet over several decades,
had begun privatizing the network in 1995 by turning over
responsibility for domain name registration _ that is, the
assigning of Internet addresses _ to a Virginia-based company,
Network Solutions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But as Network Solutions' lucrative government-sanctioned
monopoly became increasingly controversial, the administration made
it a top priority to introduce competition into the registration
business _ while also transferring oversight of the Internet to a
private international body. While a Commerce Department report last
June mapped out the principles and goals for such a body, however,
there were very few specifics spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was set up as a nonprofit organization by Postel, a
computer scientist at the University of Southern California who for
years administered the address numbering system behind Internet
domain names. But he died unexpectedly shortly after the interim
board was named last fall, turning unanswered questions about how
he selected the members into something of an Internet mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its origins, the interim board now has nine members _
plus the corporation's temporary president, Michael Rogers. In
addition to Ms. Dyson, a well-known Internet analyst, publisher and
entrepreneur, the board includes telecommunications executives and
academics from the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Though the interim board had been expected to set up the
procedures for building up a broad-based Icann membership that
might elect a full-time board, the interim group has itself become
a policy-making body.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say Icann pushed too far last month in Berlin, when
it endorsed in principle recommendations of a report from the World
Intellectual Property Organization for cracking down on
cybersquatters, the speculators who register and then try to resell
popular domain names, and for resolving disputes over who has the
right to trademarks registered as Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The board referred the report to Icann's domain name committee,
which is to recommend ways to meet the goals. But to many, the deck
seems stacked in favor of big corporations and trademark holders
since a key part of that committee _ members representing
noncommercial name holders _ has not yet been appointed by the
board. Icann has yet to appoint the at-large members who will elect
half of the permanent board.
</P>
<P>
   Until a board is elected, Icann is largely responsible only to
the Commerce Department, which endorsed its creation and is pushing
for quick establishment of dispute-resolution mechanisms so that
Icann can set up full-scale competition in the registration
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure to introduce competition,'' said A.
Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor who was on
the panel of experts that advised the World Intellectual Property
Organization, an arm of the United Nations, in its drafting of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that pressure, Froomkin says, voicing a common
criticism, Icann is ``going fast on the decision making instead of
going faster on doing the setting up'' of an elected board.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson, however, says Icann is caught between special
interest groups: noisy critics crying for the board to slow down
and quieter interests with a large stake in the process, who are
insisting that the board move faster, particularly to resolve
disputes over domain names and trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to hear `Let's go slow; let's go fast,''' she
said. ``I just want to hear legitimate criticism of what we may or
may not do. Let's argue it on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among those leading the charge to put the brakes on Icann's
policy making is Network Solutions, which built the international
registry for top level domains like .com, .net and .org under its
exclusive government contract. It also controls the main server,
the so-called root of the Internet, for the global network and
built a $25 million shared registry system that is currently being
tested with five companies. The first of those companies,
Register.com, will begin competing with Network Solutions today.
</P>
<P>
   But Network Solutions is still negotiating with the Commerce
Department on terms for permanently opening up its registry, the
data base of all registered domains, to competitors. The company
has refused to apply to become an official Icann registrar when
full-scale competition is opened. The company says Icann's
licensing terms give the governance body too much regulatory
authority, including the ability to cancel a company's
accreditation _ and thus its business _ at whim.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions argues that the interim board should be doing
nothing more than setting minimum technical standards for the
competing registries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have turned what is supposed to be a standards-setting
body into a regulatory commission,'' said Donald L. Telage, the
company's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from Network Solutions have taken their case to
Capitol Hill, where they were working feverishly last week to
persuade key members to hold oversight hearings on the actions of
both Icann and the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson and Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department adviser
who is overseeing the formation of Icann, declined to comment on
Network Solutions' complaints, citing their continued talks with
the company.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Network Solutions has a great incentive to protect
the monopoly it has enjoyed since 1995. But the company is not
alone in questioning the interim board's authority for setting
permanent policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real tricky game,'' said Dave Farber, a professor of
computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and a board
member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Internet civil
liberties group. ``You may want an interim agreement, but I don't
think that the interim board should put in place anything that is
not revocable.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I believe that the mandate that they were given was
to form a stable organization representative in some way or another
of a community. I don't think they should be making critical
decisions that they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The elected board is not expected to be in place until next
spring, and Ms. Dyson said she expected that the decision on adding
new domains would be delayed until then. She and her board dismiss
much of the criticism as merely a continuation of the contentious
debate that has been part of this process for three years. But many
critics say the board has brought much of the skepticism on itself.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of details about how the interim board was created
has fostered an Internet conspiracy theory that the board is
carrying out a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson takes strong exception to such theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they asked me, they did not ask me to do anything in
particular,'' she said of her being asked to serve on Icann. ``I do
not represent corporate interests; I represent the little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mistrust, however, was the board's refusal to hold
open board meetings.
</P>

<P>
   IBM plans to announce an $8 billion technology sales agreement
Saturday with the Acer Group of Taiwan, representing another big
step in IBM's accelerating effort to market its leading-edge
technology to companies that are often its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Acer, spanning seven years, is the fourth
large computer parts deal for IBM in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo Inc. said last month that it would purchase $1 billion
worth of IBM's Power PC microprocessors to run its next generation
of video game machines. In March, the EMC Corp., an IBM rival in
storage systems for big computers, announced it would purchase $3
billion of IBM disk drives over five years. Also in March, the Dell
Computer Corp. said it planned to buy $16 billion of technology
components from IBM over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of recent deals are the result of the strategy
pursued by Louis V. Gerstner Jr., IBM's chairman, of increasingly
marketing the company's technology to other companies in the
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, IBM's famed research laboratories and its vast
network of manufacturing plants were dedicated to the single
mission of supplying Big Blue.
</P>
<P>
   But that tight vertical integration tended to make IBM insular
and slow-moving. Even before Gerstner arrived in 1993, the company
had taken some tentative steps to market its technology outside its
walls. But the push began in earnest in 1995 with the disk drive
business and then became a key element in IBM's plan for growth
last year, after Gerstner ordered a high-level rethinking of the
company's approach to outside technology sales.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-person task force spent six weeks on the study, which
was submitted to Gerstner last June. It concluded that IBM had a
``fantastic growth opportunity selling technology,'' but it also
cautioned that IBM should be selective as a technology supplier to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, the study said, must focus on sizable markets in which the
company has a clear technological advantage and where IBM's lead is
judged to be sustainable, to insure fairly high profit margins.
Such technologies, the study noted, include specialized disk drives
able to store more data in a smaller area; fast microchips that
consume less power; and advanced liquid-crystal displays used in
notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   This approach to the technology supply market has been called
``IBM Inside,'' a nod to the ``Intel Inside'' campaign and a
recognition that supplying crucial technology can be a lucrative
business _ as it has been for the Intel Corp., whose
microprocessors are the electronic brains of most personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, industry analysts say that IBM earns more profit from an
Apple Powerbook _ equipped with a disk, display screen and Power PC
chip from IBM _ than Apple earns from the same product.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, to step up the pace of technology sales, Gerstner
placed a handful of IBM's business divisions into what he called
the Technology Group and put James T. Vanderslice, former head of
the disk drive unit, in charge. Under the reorganization,
Vanderslice oversees the company's disk drive, semiconductor,
networking hardware, printers and display businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The technology group's mandate includes working closely with
IBM's research division to tap its know-how and quickly
commercialize innovations. ``The whole idea is to put IBM's
technology portfolio into the marketplace as soon as we can,''
Vanderslice, a senior vice president, said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Even before last year's reorganization and this year's deals,
the emphasis on selling the company's technology to outsiders had
helped fuel growth in those businesses. Since 1995, the businesses
now in IBM's technology group have grown 22 percent a year. And
Gerstner has said that the technology group, along with services
and software, is expected to be one of the engines of IBM's growth
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the technology supply deals is IBM's continuing
investment in research. The technologies that other companies are
buying today were nurtured in IBM's labs for years. Its pioneering
disk drive technology, for example, dates back to research on
``giant magnetoresistance,'' a phenomenon first discovered in 1988
by French scientists at Universite Paris-Sud in Orsay.
</P>
<P>
   But the phenomenon was thought to be mainly a scientific
curiosity, observed only at very low temperatures, until
researchers at IBM Almaden labs in San Jose, Calif., figured out
how to commercialize the technology to pack far more data on disk
drives than previously thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paradox is that to be good at bringing industry-leading
technology to market you need long-term research programs to pick
up new ideas,'' Paul M. Horn, senior vice president for research,
said recently. ``And then the speed comes from fuzzing the
boundaries between your labs and your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying ahead technologically is essential if its strategy is to
succeed. ``As long as IBM can be at or close to the leading edge,
the strategy makes sense,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard Business School, ``because it spreads its comparatively
high fixed costs of research and manufacturing over a much larger
customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Dell agreement, the Acer deal covers a broad set of
technologies including disk drives, liquid-crystal displays and
specialized microprocessors. IBM and Acer, a major PC maker,
already have an existing supply relationship, but the new pact
expands their arrangement considerably. In addition to the $8
billion in components that Acer is expected to purchase from IBM
over seven years, IBM will likely buy $1 billion in displays from
Acer, using technology licensed from IBM last year.
</P>
<P>
   Acer plans to use IBM's Power PC microprocessor to develop
Internet appliances, like handheld devices and set-top boxes, to be
marketed mainly in Asia during the next few years, according to
Acer executives.
</P>
<P>
   Such a broad technology supply deal with IBM, a rival in the PC
business, would have been unthinkable a few years ago, Acer
executives say. ``The mindset of IBM has really changed,'' said
Stan Shih, chairman of Acer. ``It is much more open-minded and
easier to partner with than it used to be.''

changes have transformed the legal system here in Texas and in many

lead the way, embracing one of the nation's most ambitious attempts
to hold down the cost of civil suits and limit the size of jury
awards. For years, Texas had a reputation as the ``lawsuit capital
of America'' because its juries in injury cases were said to be
overly generous. But starting in the late 1980s, the state began
adding restrictions, like limits on punitive damage awards, and
provisions that make it harder for injured workers to sue. Now

INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT IN CORSICA MAKES FRANCE UNEASY

   AJACCIO, Corsica _ A gentle breeze from the Mediterranean cools
the cafes along Napoleon Boulevard, which is named, of course, for
the island's most famous son. People are heading for the unspoiled
beaches. A happy springtime scene, perhaps, were it not for the
angry graffiti on Ajaccio's historic walls.
</P>
<P>
   They are code words left by separatists who are fighting to gain
independence or greater autonomy from France. For all the beauty of
its wild mountains and ravishing bays, the island gets more
attention in Paris for its bombings and killings.
</P>
<P>
   Corsica, France's most uneasy spot, is a place of
contradictions. Proud of their culture, the young people often
migrate to the mainland. With Corsicans largely dependent on
tourist income, the rebels regularly blow up villas and hotels
owned by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   And while 85 percent of Corsicans say in polls that they want to
remain part of France, the island's tumultuous politics are
dominated by the nationalists. Old Corsica had pirates, men with
bandannas and daggers. New Corsica has guns and firebombs. Its
unruly ways have exasperated France off and on since 1768, when it
bought the island from the city-state of Genoa.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the 25-year old nationalist violence has turned
particularly ugly. In February 1998, rebels killed Claude Erignac,
who as prefect was the French government's top official on the
island. Bernard Bonnet, his successor, was sent by Paris to impose
law and order. But in early May he was dismissed and arrested after
police under his authority burned down an illegally built beach
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corsica can drive people crazy,'' an official from mainland
France said. As Bonnet was jailed in Paris pending an
investigation, the French establishment was stunned. This was the
first arrest of a serving prefect, and for three weeks fights over
Corsica policy dominated the National Assembly. Such was the
atmosphere of crisis that Corsica was even overshadowing Kosovo in
national newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The cases involving the two prefects seem to have deepened the
distrust between Corsicans and most other French people. It has
convinced many Corsicans that France has lost all respect for them.
And it has tested the patience of mainland French citizens, whose
tax money seems to pour endlessly into Corsica without bringing the
island any closer to peace.
</P>
<P>
   But the mainland French also remain fascinated by that ``curious
mix of shepherds and bomb throwers,'' as the writer Jean d'Ormesson
called the islanders. The mainlanders love the island's haunting
music and medieval villages. But they rarely buy an island home or
business these days for fear of the nationalist bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Most Corsicans do not appreciate the image that a few militants
have created for them. ``We are not the savage hordes Paris makes
us out to be,'' said Jean-Guy Talimoni, a leader of Corsica
Nazione, an alliance of nationalist groups. ``The problem is that
the French haven't understood Corsicans. They just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``it'' varies, depending on who is articulating local
demands _ or throwing explosives. For the 250,000 inhabitants,
there are no fewer than 14 political parties or movements and at
least three clandestine armed factions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these groups agree that France should formally recognize
Corsica as a separate people, with its own culture and language, a
dialect of Italian. Some want the weak regional parliament to gain
more powers, including the right to adopt its own laws and spend
its own taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a mountain in the middle of the Mediterranean,'' said
Cesar Filippi, a hotel owner. ``So we need our own rules and our
own special tools to develop. But Paris wants to keep us poor, to
make sure we stay French.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not how the French government sees it. France's
centralized political system does disapprove of regional
aspirations. Even now, it lags behind the rest of Western Europe in
recognizing minority rights. But it has made some exceptions for
Corsica.
</P>
<P>
   To placate the nationalists, France has offered tax breaks and
sent more subsidies to the island than to any other region. But it
also asserts that much of this aid vanishes into the pockets of
corrupt politicians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bonnet's mission at the time of his appointment last year was
not only to find Erignac's killers but also to clean up corruption
and to restore the rule of law. More than $100 million of bad loans
were outstanding at a local government bank.
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence that organized crime was growing and hiding
behind so-called political and separatist attacks. Bonnet's orders
from Paris were to be tough.
</P>
<P>
   His hard-line approach quickly brought results: Bomb attacks
last year dropped to 96 from the recent totals of 200 to 400 a
year. Armed robberies were cut by more than half. Bonnet uncovered
close to 80 corruption scandals and had dozens of local politicians
and notables placed under investigation. With confidence returning,
the economy and tourism picked up.
</P>
<P>
   But the cleanup caused much resentment, even among the local
police. Operating on the premise that Corsica is a tight web of
clans and interest groups, Bonnet trusted few people and was
working with a specially created elite squad of security police.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of this squad have confessed to setting the fire in
April that burned down the illegally built restaurant. Such illegal
restaurants, of which there are a number, have regularly ignored
court orders to close.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, Corsica made new headlines when six men were
arrested and charged with killing the former prefect. They
apparently belonged to a new faction of hard-liners who say that
other nationalists have sold out. A seventh man, Yvan Colonna, the
suspected trigger man, is believed to be hiding in the wild
mountains that rise up behind his village of Cargese, some 30 miles
north of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad if this murder is solved, but there are many
others,'' said Fernande Pintrel, a member of a women's peace
movement. She was referring to the more than 100 unsolved political
killings of the last decade, among them that of her nephew, who was
shot dead while riding his motorcycle in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corsica cannot calm down,'' she said. ``We cannot have peace
until all the murders are investigated.''

WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATORS SET TO ENTER KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, France, Germany)  (mk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Investigators of the international tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands, are preparing to enter Kosovo with the
multinational peacekeeping force to insure that they can gather the
freshest possible evidence of war crimes, tribunal and Western
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The details of how they will travel and where they will go are
still being worked out, the officials said. But Louise Arbour, the
chief prosecutor of the tribunal, has received promises from NATO
headquarters that its forces will provide logistical support, such
as providing security and clearing mines at sites where
investigators need to work.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has offered to escort investigators as its troops enter
Kosovo to help them start their inquiries immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want to see tribunal investigators go into Kosovo hard
on the heels of NATO,'' Charles Haye, a Foreign Office spokesman in
London, said.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is followed, it will introduce a new and more urgent
approach to the court's work. In Bosnia and Croatia, where the
tribunal has recorded war crimes, court staff have also received
some help from the international forces once they were in place.
But the investigators often reached witnesses or burial sites
months or even years after the violent incidents they were
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour has said she expects Kosovo to be a turning point.
Her aim is now to do research on the ground as soon as possible
following the large scale Yugoslav military operations. She has
toured Western capitals to persuade governments of the need to work
in ``something close to real time'' in Kosovo. ``It is critical
that we enter at the earliest opportunity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries, including the United States, Britain, France
and Germany, have also pledged to send national teams to assist the
tribunal in the clearly enormous task awaiting it.
</P>
<P>
   A British government spokesman said that London had put together
a team of 15, most of them forensic specialists. In Paris, a
spokesman at the Foreign Ministry said that France was providing at
least a dozen ballistic experts, forensic doctors and police
photographers to assist inquiries. Tribunal staff will direct the
national teams.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the court already has considerable evidence of crimes
against humanity in Kosovo, part of which was used to support the
recent indictment of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president,
and four of his top officials. The indictment describes numerous
incidents of brutality as well as the mass execution of hundreds of
civilians and the forced deportation of 740,000 ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said much more work was needed to expand the
court's larger investigation, which will serve to bolster the
existing indictments and to bring future cases. Prosecutors have
said there will be other indictments relating to Kosovo. But they
say time is of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigators must be able to get in there as quickly as
possible to secure crime sites, to contact and protect potential
witnesses who may not have left Kosovo,'' said Graham Blewitt, the
deputy prosecutor. ``There is a lot of forensic evidence to be
gathered.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that evidence has already been tampered with, according
to NATO, which has provided U.S. spy satellite photographs showing
that Yugoslav forces recently opened up mass graves and reburied
bodies in individual graves.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's work in Kosovo, which began more a year ago, has
faced many obstacles. As the conflict there intensified last
spring, the court had to raise additional funds before it could
hire extra staff and translators.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers complained that in several villages court
investigators failed to question witnesses to massacres. But
tribunal officials said their investigators were being followed by
Serb police and they did not want to give away people's hiding
places by approaching them then. By September, Yugoslavia had
blocked the court's work by refusing to issue visas to its staff.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Microsoft Corp.'s power and influence in the
computer industry stems not only from its dominant Windows
operating system, but also from its office productivity software.
And on Monday, Microsoft will announce that it has begun retail
shipments of a new version of its office productivity ``suite,''
Office 2000, that all but eliminates the distinctions between a PC
document and Internet data.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000, which includes word processing, spreadsheet,
presentation, data base, e-mail, scheduling and other software
functions, has a long list of new features _ almost all of which
are intended to give PC users a set of software tools that deeply
integrate Internet capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the integration strategy is Microsoft's adoption
of the World Wide Web's basic document structure _ known as HTML,
for hypertext markup language _ intended to make it easy to publish
documents on the Web and perform what is known as ``round
tripping,'' or translating documents back and forth between Web and
traditional Microsoft Office formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at the standard in the corporate world,'' Amy
Wohl, president of Wohl Associates, a computer industry consulting
firm, said. ``The program has an enormous number of improvements in
terms of features and integration with Windows and the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   And, depending on one's perspective, the business strategy and
product capabilities of Office 2000 either underscore the urgency
of the federal antitrust trial that continues this week _ or make
that trial even more irrelevant. One of the issues in the trial is
whether Microsoft's hegemony in personal computer software has
enabled the company to dominate other parts of the software
industry to the point of exercising illegal monopoly power.
Certainly, Office 2000 represents Microsoft's clearest example yet
of subsuming Internet capabilities into one of the company's
dominant desktop products.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the arrival of Office 2000 on store shelves and in
corporate offices this week will very likely unleash a tidal wave
of revenue for the giant software publisher. Microsoft had already
begun to receive income as part of a commercial test of Office
2000, including $400 million in the last quarter, which the company
has said it will report as revenue once the product starts shipping
in volume.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said on Friday that they would not make any
public statements about preshipment sales. But Ms. Wohl said she
had been told that Microsoft had already received orders for 15
million copies of Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, each new major product generation represents a
crossroads for the software publisher, and industry analysts have
repeatedly questioned whether computer users will continue to have
an appetite for Microsoft's barrage of new features.
</P>
<P>
   With Office 2000, though, Microsoft executives said, they were
confident they had addressed such concerns by insuring that Office
2000 documents will be compatible with documents created using the
previous version of Office and by simplifying the program's control
panel, or so-called user interface.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to address the compatibility issue is by not
having to change anything,'' Steve Sinofsky, vice president of
Microsoft's Office business, said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinofsky said the company had not tampered with Microsoft's
existing file formats except in its Access data base program. And
in the case of Access, he said, the company had tried to make the
translation of data seamless to computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such efforts, some industry analysts said computer users
would be forced toward a new dimension of complexity by the shift
to Internet-compatible documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very sophisticated code and that's a troubling
direction when you think of the history of PC's as tools that
empower individuals,'' Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of the computer
industry newsletter Softletter, said. ``I'm not sure you're
empowering people when you turn a simple word processing document
into five pages of programming code.''
</P>
<P>
   The code, which controls the appearance of a document like a Web
page, is hidden from the user. The potential for problems arises if
a user wanted to manipulate the document in a way not anticipated
by Microsoft's programmers.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinofsky said adding computer code to documents was not
actually a new approach. He pointed to the popular Adobe Postscript
format, which has long incorporated similar hidden complexity to
give computer users control over the appearance of their documents.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives also took issue with the widespread opinion
among industry analysts that it would be corporate users, rather
than people who use PC's at home or in small offices, who would
find compelling reasons to upgrade to the new program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual user will find Office 2000 useful because you
can do things you just couldn't do before,'' Sinofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the ability to take pictures of one's children and
publish them on a Web site for viewing by grandparents as an
example of the kind of feature that would drive noncorporate users
to the new product.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This newest product rollout continues a process of integrating
application programs that Microsoft began in 1990, when it
introduced the first version of Office, bundling together its Word,
Excel, Powerpoint and Mail applications. By 1993, with the
introduction of Office 4.0, the integrated program had become the
primary product, as opposed to the individual application programs.
</P>
<P>
   That integration strategy proved to be the key competitive edge
in its battle to wrest the corporate market from companies like
Lotus and, at the time, Wordperfect.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Justice Department has largely ignored the
company's virtual office-suite monopoly position in the current
antitrust suit, the issue has come up in trial testimony given by
Avi Tevanian, the Apple Computer Corp.'s top software executive.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition last year, Tevanian testified that Microsoft
executives had threatened to cancel development of Office 98, the
Apple Macintosh version of the Office suite, if Apple did not adopt
Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its primary Web browser software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives responded that the government was twisting
the significance of its business negotiations with Apple.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite its control of more than 90 percent of the retail market
for office productivity software, Microsoft could find itself under
increasing pricing pressure from the Corel Corp., the feisty
Canadian software publisher. Corel, which acquired the Wordperfect
brand several years ago, in April began shipping a new product
known as Wordperfect Office 2000. The program has received strongly
positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Corel contends that it has 22 million users worldwide and said
it was focusing on its current customer base by simplifying and
adding Internet features to its new version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a massive installed base,'' Jimi Smith, director
of brand management for Wordperfect Office, said. ``These people
have stuck with us for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   The entry-level version of Wordperfect Office has been selling
for as little as $79 in major chains like Comp USA, Smith said. In
contrast, the standard version of Microsoft's Office 2000 has a
street price of $229.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANNIBAL, Mo. _ These are exquisite days to ride a bike in this
all-American, middle-American boyhood home of Mark Twain. Children
can ride to school, to the Tom Sawyer Cave a couple miles south of
town, to the banks of the Mississippi for fishing, or to a park to
play pitch and catch.
</P>
<P>
   They can and they did, but they don't any more. Hannibal's
parks, river banks and schools are all but barren of bikes. Plastic
riding toys cover the lawn of Ya Gotta Have It, a store that sells
secondhand toys, but the few bikes are stored in the back room. A
late-afternoon tour of a subdivision yielded two people on bikes
and four on riding lawn mowers.
</P>
<P>
   As vacation approached for the 350 pupils at Oakwood Elementary
School, only four bikes were parked outside. Kenneth Treaster,
principal of the 950-student Hannibal Middle School, said, ``I can
remember one kid riding a bike here in the three years I've been in
this building.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hannibal goes, so goes the nation. In the shadow of a long,
slow decline in cycling generally, the bicycle as a century-old
symbol of childhood freedom and transportation is nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biking as a form for children to get from one location to
another has become very, very rare,'' said Richard Killingsworth, a
health scientist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 percent of children ages 7 to 15 ride bikes to
school, Killingsworth said, a precipitous and accelerating decline
of 60 percent to 70 percent since the 1970s. Only 2.5 percent of
those who live within two miles of school ride bikes there, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For children, such analysts say, bicycles have been muscled
aside by parental fears of crime and traffic, tight scheduling of
organized play, television and computer games, and disappearing
sidewalks. This century's longest stretch of prosperity, with its
abundance of part-time jobs for teen-agers that have put
16-year-olds into cars, has conspired against bicycles, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking about it over the weekend,'' said Cathy Carver,
42, who was having coffee at the Mark Twain Dinette. At a garage
sale, she said, ``they had a black 10-speed for $2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thing of the past,'' said Greg Henderson, 43, a grain
inspector sitting at the counter beside Ms. Carver. ``Nintendo,''
he said. ``They'd rather do that than go out and ride a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carver has a daughter, 11. ``She's never had any desire to
have a bike,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my daughter did,'' Henderson said. ``She had two bikes.
But by the time she got to 12, she was done. She hasn't rode a bike
since.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that bicycles are disappearing. The industry reports
robust sales of mountain bikes to mostly adult riders, of
soft-saddled ``comfort'' bikes to aging baby boomers and of
recumbent bikes that let riders lie back to pedal.
</P>
<P>
   But over all, Huffy Corp., in Dayton, Ohio _ the United States'
largest bike maker _ reports that industry sales of bikes have
fallen from the levels of the 1970s and been flat at 15 million to
17 million for a decade. With the growth of the population, the per
capita decline is sharper.
</P>
<P>
   And fewer people use the bikes they have. Elliot Gluskin,
research director for Bicycling Magazine, said the number of riders
dropped to 43.5 million from 56.3 million just in the years from
1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in a much less friendly bicycle environment,''
said Tom Doyle, vice president for research at the National
Sporting Goods Association.
</P>
<P>
   There are few statistics on children who ride bikes. But no one
denies that the number of young bike-riders has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Diane Colbert, 38, and her husband, Jerry, 40,
were glued to their bikes. Growing up in Bowling Green, 30 miles
south of Hannibal, Ms. Colbert said: ``I had a 10-speed. I rode 15
to 20 miles a day. I was everywhere on my bike. You didn't have to
worry who was out when.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, safety is a big issue. The Colberts and their
son, Jaron, 12, were holding a garage sale at their small ranch
house in a sidewalk-free subdivision of Hannibal, and Jaron was
trying to sell his bike, which he has outgrown, for $15.
</P>
<P>
   He would like another bike but can live without one. ``I'd like
to ride to the place where I play baseball'' two miles away, he
said. ``But there's the traffic.'' So his mother drives him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Mardis, 9, who lives in another subdivision, has two bikes
_ one he uses and one he has outgrown that a friend comes over to
ride. His father, David Mardis, 45, said that as a child in Des
Moines, Iowa, he rode a bike a mile to school every day. ``I'd ride
all over town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan said, ``I ride, too, every day.'' But he is not allowed
off his own block, where his parents know all the residents. Mardis
said: ``Parents are so distrustful of what society has done to
children. Maybe that's paranoid, but it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Such parental concerns, widespread in Hannibal, may be
overdrawn. No one seems to know of statistics showing crime
involving bicycles, other than thefts, which have been declining
far more than the decline in bike riding. The FBI reports 318
bicycle thefts for every 10,000 Americans in 1980 compared with 165
per 10,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the growing use of helmets, fewer people are
dying on bikes. In a typical year, 2 percent of traffic fatalities
involve bicycle riders.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says that bicycle
deaths fell to 808 in 1997 from 965 in 1980, exceeding the fall in
bicycle sales. It says deaths involving riders under 16 have fallen
far more, to 31 percent of all bike-riding fatalities in 1997 from
55 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In Hannibal, too, accidents are far more common for automobiles.
The Police Department reports about 900 traffic accidents a year.
``We've had a couple involving bikes,'' Police Chief Albert Higdon
said. ``But they're few and far between.''
</P>
<P>
   But Higdon is leery, too, about his daughters, ages 9, 10 and
16. ``I won't let them go off on a bike without my knowing where
they're at. I don't like them crossing a major highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Janes, the principal of Oakwood Elementary, questions
whether safety is a big issue with many of his pupils' parents.
</P>
<P>
   Half his pupils live more than a mile from school, he said, and
are eligible for busing. Some who live closer walk. But so many are
driven by parents that he said he has had to start dismissing those
children five minutes early to avert congestion with the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Tight scheduling of after-school activities, for soccer,
baseball, horseback riding, piano lessons and dance classes,
precludes riding bikes from one to the other. Beyond that, Janes
said: ``Bicycles just don't seem popular. It might just be they
need too much effort. Or maybe Mom wants her kids to sleep later.''
</P>
<P>
   With vans now shuttling them to school and playgrounds, and
computer games to amuse them at home, children are getting fat.
Killingsworth at the Centers for Disease Control, said 22 percent
of American children are obese, twice the level of the mid-1980s.
Nutrition is a factor, but so is physical inactivity. With parents
taking children to school, he said, ``they're not even walking to a
bus stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Brownsepidemiologist at the School of Public Health
at St. Louis University, said, ``Technology has engineered physical
activity out of our lives.'' Highways and subdivisions have been
engineered to accommodate cars, not walking or bike riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to make our communities more friendly to
physical activity,'' Brownson said. ``Bring back sidewalks and
wider shoulders on the sides of roads and parks.''

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alana Theriault, who earns less than $1,000 a month
working part time as a benefits counselor, is back in school to
learn computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   Her instructors say she has a special aptitude, and when she
gets her certificate soon, she says, she expects to be offered a
programming job paying as much as $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But unless federal law is changed, Ms. Theriault, who is 32,
lives in Berkeley, Calif., and is severely disabled, may not be
able to take such a job and may have to forfeit the
self-sufficiency she longs for.
</P>
<P>
   That is because if she earns more than a pittance, she will no
longer be entitled to Medicaid, the federal-state medical insurance
program for the indigent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Theriault has a condition called spinal muscular atrophy.
She needs a rented respirator to breathe, which costs $2,900 a
month; a personal attendant more than eight hours a day, which
costs about $1,700 a month; a motorized wheelchair; and expensive
medication. She could never get private medical insurance on her
own, and without Medicaid, even with a good salary, she could never
afford what it costs her to live.
</P>
<P>
   Her pathway to independence may be a bill the Senate could pass
as early as this week. It would allow disabled people to retain
health benefits under Medicaid and Medicare, which covers disabled
people with financial assets that make them ineligible for
Medicaid, even if they go to work and earn too much to be entitled
to the federal disability benefits to which the health insurance is
tied.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Theriault says the bill would change her life. ``Here I
am,'' she said in an interview, ``32 years old, trying to plan for
my future, and as things stand now, I can't take a job. I can't buy
a house. I can't have any investments. I can't even really have a
savings account.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for disabled people say that the bill, which has 79
co-sponsors in the Senate, would be the most important measure
since the Americans With Disabilities Act was approved by Congress
and signed by President Bush nine years ago. That legislation
outlawed discrimination against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Friday, President Clinton said the effect
of the current law forcing people to choose between work on the one
hand and Medicare or Medicaid on the other was to ``deny
opportunities to millions,'' and he urged Congress to approve the
changes quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The broad bipartisan support for the legislation, which has also
been approved by the House Commerce Committee without opposition,
is a testament to the considerable and growing political influence
of the disability-rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Another example arose earlier this year when disabled people
across the country mobilized to persuade state politicians to drop
their support of Georgia's appeal to the Supreme Court of a federal
appeals court ruling that the state must provide alternatives to
institutionalization for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In the Georgia case, Olmstead vs. L.C., which the
disability-rights movement equates with Brown vs. the Board of
Education, two women whose disabilities included mental retardation
and mental illness and who were confined to a large state
institution, argued that the state had the obligation under the
Americans With Disabilities Act to offer them placement in a less
restrictive setting like a supervised group home.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled last year that the
state did have such an obligation, and Georgia appealed. At various
times, 26 states filed briefs in the Supreme Court supporting
Georgia's position. In the last few months, all but seven of those
states have withdrawn their support, a highly unusual turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of what led some of the other 19 states to
change their minds: In Pennsylvania, protesters in five cities
camped out in offices of the state attorney general. In Maryland,
with demonstrations threatened, Gov. Parris N. Glendening ordered
the state's lawyers to withdraw the state's support.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, an aggressive telephone campaign led Gov. Kirk
Fordice to abandon the case. In California and Nebraska,
representatives of the Protection and Advocacy System, federally
financed agencies in each state that act as advocates for the
disabled, persuaded the politicians not to support Georgia's
position.
</P>
<P>
   Career lawyers in the various state governments had filed the
briefs on Georgia's side. The politicians overturned them, once
they got wind of it.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Allen, managing deputy attorney general in West
Virginia, explained the situation in her state. ``I can say with
some understatement,'' she said, ``that the attorney general went
through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the seven states that still back Georgia's side is Texas,
and advocates for the disabled say they will hold this against Gov.
George W. Bush in his race for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Bush's position, Attorney General John Cornyn said:
``The Olmstead decision would take from the citizens of Texas the
ability to decide how best to address the needs of the disabled and
would give this power to the federal courts.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Those were fighting words to many disabled people who argue that
their cause is one of civil rights. ``This is pretty much what
George Wallace said when he stood in the schoolhouse door,'' said
Bob Kafka, who lives in Austin, Texas, and represents Adapt, a
national organization of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court heard arguments on the case this spring,
hundreds of demonstrators organized by Adapt came to Washington for
a rally in front of the Court. But there is little the advocates
for the disabled can do to affect the Supreme Court decision, and
they are concentrating on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious measure they are pushing would require states
to give disabled people the money that states pay nursing homes to
care for them, so the people could use the money, if they chose, to
pay for care outside the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would
cost the government $10 billion to $20 billion a year. Advocates
for the disabled challenge this cost projection, but it has been
enough to scare off support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way Congress is going to approve another $20
billion entitlement,'' said a senior Senate staff member who has
worked on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the lack of enthusiasm is the strong
influence of lobbyists for nursing homes. The federal government
spends about $50 billion a year for long-term institutional care
for disabled people, and the nursing homes will not give up the
money without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1998 congressional elections, nursing home interests
donated nearly $3 million to candidates, parties and political
committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan institute that monitors campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But the much more modest bill now before the Senate seems to
face smooth sailing. Called the Work Incentives Act, it would
encourage states to provide Medicaid to the working disabled, free
in most cases and in return for a modest premium payment in the
case of workers with substantial salaries like the one Ms.
Theriault hopes to earn.
</P>
<P>
   It would also extend the number of years that disabled people
who work could continue to receive Medicare benefits without paying
premiums. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the
measure would cost the government $800 million over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the president's position and strong bipartisan support
in Congress, the measure has run into one snag after another. Most
recently, for example, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, blocked the
legislation just before the Memorial Day recess because it would
offset the $800 million five-year price tag by adjusting the way
international businesses could credit the foreign taxes they pay
against their U.S. income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm does not disapprove of the disability provisions or even
the tax measure, his staff said. But he objects to any tax increase
that is used to pay for more government spending.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in the Senate was that a way would be found around
Gramm's objection and that the measure would be passed soon after
the Senate returns this week.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many people would take advantage of the new
benefits if they became available. In Oregon, where disabled people
have been allowed since February to retain Medicaid if they take
jobs, only 75 people out of more than 80,000 disabled people now on
Medicaid have signed up so far.
</P>
<P>
   But for the few who have gone to work, the change has been a
blessing. One of them, Scott Lay, 47, who has been a quadriplegic
since he broke his neck in a diving accident 30 years ago, was
hired to coordinate the program for the state and is paid about
$42,000 a year. It is essentially the first job he has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important elements of working is the self-esteem
it provides, Lay said. ``What I pay in federal and state taxes is
almost as much as the government pays for my attendant care,'' he
added. ``So I'm paying back almost as much as I'm costing them.''

   TEX-LAW-REFORM (Houston) _ Over the last decade, sweeping
changes have transformed the legal system here in Texas and in many
other states. Under the banner of lawsuit reform, Texas has helped
lead the way, embracing one of the nation's most ambitious attempts
to hold down the cost of civil suits and limit the size of jury
awards. For years, Texas had a reputation as the ``lawsuit capital
of America'' because its juries in injury cases were said to be
overly generous. But starting in the late 1980s, the state began
adding restrictions, like limits on punitive damage awards, and
provisions that make it harder for injured workers to sue. Now
Texas is seen as one of the most aggressive states in efforts to
curb civil suits under the banner of ``tort reform.'' By William
Glaberson.

   BIKES-EXTINCT (Hannibal, Mo.) _ These are exquisite days to ride

catch in a park. They can and they did, but they don't anymore.
Hannibal's parks, river banks and schools are all but barren of
bikes. And as Hannibal goes, so goes the nation. In the shadow of a
long, slow decline in cycling generally, the bicycle as a
century-old symbol of childhood freedom and transportation is
nearly extinct. By Peter T. Kilborn.

MICROSOFT TO OFFER REBUTTAL   ON IBM EXECUTIVE'S CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corp. is expected to
introduce documents this week intended to contradict testimony by
an IBM executive who said Microsoft would offer the computer maker
a favorable price on its Windows operating system only if IBM
agreed to ``eliminate or drop'' its competing operating system,
OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation was made last month by Garry Norris, a manager
who negotiated with Microsoft for IBM's personal computer business,
is scheduled to take the stand Monday as witness for the
government. In a pretrial deposition in May, Norris testified that
Microsoft managers repeatedly made a proposal linking the price of
Windows paid by IBM's personal computer division and its agreement
to drop OS/2 from its machines. He specifically mentioned the
proposal being made by Mark Baber, who oversaw Microsoft's
relationship with IBM's P.C. business.
</P>
<P>
   But Baber, who has since retired from Microsoft, said Sunday
that it was ``absolutely not the case'' that Microsoft proposed a
lower Windows price in return for an agreement by IBM to drop OS/2
from its PC's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Baber said he worked on the Microsoft effort in
1994 and 1995 to try to repair the strained relationship between
the two companies. That effort, he said, included drafting a
document in 1994 called the ``IBM-Microsoft Alliance Proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   That document, he said, called for IBM to promote Microsoft's
software on IBM personal computers, but specifically included
language that noted any Microsoft-IBM agreement did not exclude IBM
from also offering and promoting ``products offered by other
divisions of IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined to comment on documents it may introduce in
court during the cross-examination of Norris. But Mark Murray, a
Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe that we will be able to
show convincingly in court that the Microsoft-IBM discussions
leading up to the introduction of Windows 95 were normal, though
complicated, business negotiations, and that Microsoft did not try
to get IBM to drop or eliminate OS/2. Yes, we have documents that
we believe show that.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to forge a closer relationship with IBM, which would
have included a more favorable price for Windows, foundered mainly
because IBM balked at close cooperation with Microsoft, according
to Baber.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony and cross-examination of Norris will focus on a
crucial allegation in the antitrust suit against Microsoft by the
Justice Department and 19 states _ that Microsoft uses the price it
charges PC makers for its industry-standard Windows operating
system to insure that they promote Microsoft software over
competing software. Microsoft fiercely denies the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was the last major PC maker to sign a Windows 95 license
agreement with Microsoft and, Norris said in his deposition that
IBM did pay significantly more for Windows 95 than did a major IBM
rival in the PC business, the Compaq Computer Corp. He also
testified that its Windows price rose very sharply, with IBM paying
$9 a copy for the earlier version, Windows 3.1, and more than $45
for Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Baber said IBM's price for Windows 3.1 was unusually low
because, dating back to their days of close cooperation in
software, IBM had shared in the development costs. Compaq's price
for Windows 3.1, he noted, was about $20 a copy.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 95 price paid by Compaq, Baber said, was several
dollars lower than IBM's price. But that, he insisted, was mainly
because Compaq had made a broad agreement with Microsoft, which
included providing customer support for Windows and writing
software to make printers and other hardware work well with
Windows.

ANALYSIS: SOME ISSUES STILL NOT RESOLVED IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright flew to
Europe on Sunday night for what she hopes is something of a victory
lap. In fact, it is a risky mission, and could be rather muted.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo peace pact is not yet a done deal, with several
issues outstanding that Albright will confront over the next few
days as she meets her fellow foreign ministers, confers with ethnic
Albanian leaders and perhaps visits several countries affected by
the misery of the war.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright left Washington on Sunday night, the European allies
and Washington were still divided over the necessity of winning a
U.N. Security Council resolution that would give a mantle of
authority to the NATO security force and the civil administration
planned for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And it was unclear how the ethnic Albanian leaders, in
particular the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, whose representatives
Albright plans to meet in Germany, would accept the sketchy
document that is the basis of the pact with President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, beneath the buoyancy about the end of the war
appearing to be in sight, questions lingered about whether the
original goals of the air campaign had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Some, both inside and outside the administration, recalled the
objectives set out by President Clinton in his televised Oval
Office speech on March 24, the first night of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said then that the mission was to show the ``seriousness
of NATO's purpose,'' to ``deter an even bloodier offensive against
innocent civilians in Kosovo,'' and to ``seriously damage the
Serbian military's capacity to harm the people of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the air campaign was intended to keep stability in
the fragile neighboring countries of Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton's first goal of demonstrating the
seriousness of NATO's purpose was achieved: Under great strain and
differences of opinion, the alliance stayed together.
</P>
<P>
   But in essence, asserted Ivo Daalder, a former member of the
Clinton administration's National Security Council, NATO unity was
achieved at the expense of the other objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs were extraordinarily high to do this,'' Daalder
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first several weeks of the air campaign, Milosevic's
forces expelled hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians over the
border of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, more than 850,000 Kosovar Albanians, the population
NATO had wanted to protect, were squatting in tents or crammed into
the homes of relatives, friends and strangers in Macedonia and
Albania, with many of their identity papers destroyed, their homes
in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of others were left wandering around
homeless inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal of maintaining stability in the region also went
by the boards, Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate ethnic situation in Macedonia between Macedonians
and ethnic Albanians was thrown out of balance by the huge influx
of Albanian refugees. The weak economy has been thrown into
disarray by the cutoff of trade with Yugoslavia and by the costly
burden of maintaining the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, a weak political equilibrium was unsettled by the
new refugees and the growing numbers of Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas training in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
   To try to reverse these outcomes, the United States and European
nations will be entrenched in Kosovo maintaining the peace for
years, administration officials and their critics said. The
financial costs could extend for a generation, Daalder predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of maintaining NATO credibility was achieved. The
alliance followed through on the threats to bomb, got Milosevic to
accept a deal on its terms and has not yet stopped bombing in the
absence of final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But that goal was not entirely cost-free, either.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the deal with Milosevic sank in at NATO headquarters,
a senior NATO official said the alliance had hung together by
stumbling along, rather than by smart decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful whether NATO will ever venture into another
Kosovo-style campaign, he said. After 50 years of drawing up white
papers, analyzing and preparing, NATO's first war may well be its
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This showed the incredible difficulty of a
humanitarian-military action by an alliance,'' the official said,
speaking on condition that his name not be used. ``I personally
believe this is never to be repeated. NATO got in way over its
head, stumbled through, didn't know how to get out, was scared to
death by what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the internecine battles of the last 10 weeks, the
official said, ``This has left a bitter taste, of tilting within
governments, between governments, between NATO headquarters at
Brussels and the military headquarters at Mons. This has been a
searing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those questions will come up as Albright visits Germany
and the devastated countries that adjoin Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Her first order of business is a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the seven richest industrial countries and Russia, in
Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Moscow suggested that the Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov, might not come until the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
stopped. The approval of Russia, as well as China, is needed for
passage of a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were not counting on the
Russians and the Chinese to quickly agree to a resolution. Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy who helped win Milosevic's
acquiescence to the pact, came under heavy criticism when he
arrived back in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government, embittered by the mistaken bombing of
their embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was unlikely to veto a
resolution. But officials said the Chinese would probably delay
their approval to seek concessions from the United States on other
fronts in exchange for not vetoing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Washington puts much less stock in a U.N. blessing than
the Europeans do. First, the State Department argues that it would
be dangerous to leave a vacuum in Kosovo as Yugoslav forces
withdraw by waiting for a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Second, these officials assert that planning for interim
administration and the future political landscape of Kosovo can go
ahead without a resolution. But the document Milosevic agreed to
stipulates that the ``interim administration'' for Kosovo will be
established within ``substantial autonomy'' of Yugoslavia ``to be
decided by the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the detailed 44-page accord reached in Rambouillet,
France, that Milosevic rejected in March, provoking the NATO
bombing, the document he agreed to on Thursday leaves the future of
Kosovo vague.
</P>
<P>
   While the ethnic Albanians eventually signed the Rambouillet
pact after extracting a promise of a referendum on Kosovo's status
in three years, the present document does not make clear whether
Kosovo remains part of Yugoslavia, or eventually will have the
chance of becoming independent, as the ethnic Albanians want.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns have been raised that with protracted negotiations
among the United States, the Europeans and the Russians, these
political questions will be held hostage by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Almost certainly the Russians will try to circumscribe Kosovo's
autonomy and will try to limit the chances for eventual
independence, a move that promises to antagonize the Kosovar
Albanians on whose behalf largely the war was fought.

   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Washington) _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Ablright flew to Europe Sunday night for something of a victory
lap: to meet with her fellow foreign ministers on Kosovo, confer

Kosovo and Albania, forcing some 1,000 people from a northern
Albanian town on Sunday, many of them refugees fleeing from
fighting yet again. Military and aid officials said the surge in
fighting seemed not to endanger any peace plan but appeared to be

` THE REDHUNTER:' THE `NICE GUY' WHO TOUCHED OFF MCCARTHYISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) &HT;    (DW) 
 By GEORGE STADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes chutzpah to attempt a rehabilitation of Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy. Most Americans, after all, take it for granted that he
was guilty of McCarthyism, or witch hunting, a species of virus
that erupts on the lips of the body politic in times of stress. But
rehabilitation is precisely the goal of William F. Buckley Jr.'s
new novel, ``The Redhunter.''
</P>
<P>
   We should not be surprised: Buckley has long had the courage of
people who never doubt their own convictions. The particulars of
``The Redhunter'' are organized by the conviction that ``atheistic
Communism'' is unqualified evil; to those dedicated to the ``noble
cause'' of eradicating this evil, it follows, nothing can be
forbidden, certainly not McCarthyism. The mitigations of historians
and the waffling of liberals are irrelevant to anyone whose
peripheral vision does not extend to the gray areas that surround
all secular issues of importance.
</P>
<P>
   As the novel opens, in June 1991, Harry Bontecou, pretty much
Buckley's stand-in, is sitting in a London pub, reading a
newspaper. He is reading about the capture of Pol Pot, who is
alleged to have executed one to two million Cambodians, from 20 to
40 percent of the population. Such numbers lead Bontecou to reflect
on the 25 million thought to have been shot or starved to death by
Stalin. This sampling of Communist atrocities helps to prepare us
for all that follows: starting with the arrival of Bontecou's host,
one Alex, Lord Herrendon, a former Communist spy.
</P>
<P>
   By way of atonement Herrendon is writing a book on which he
wants Bontecou to collaborate, its subject ``the Communist scene in
the West.'' He wants to sort out ``the history of Soviet suffering
and to analyze compliant responsibility for it by the West.'' Above
all he wants to answer ``the great question raised by the 20th
century,'' the attraction to totalitarian movements, especially
Communism, of not only ``multitudes of people, but of
intellectuals.'' These interests lead Herrendon to the question of
``the delinquency of the loyalty/security practices of the federal
government'' and therefore to McCarthy, and therefore to Harry
Bontecou, the senator's closest aide and speechwriter.
</P>
<P>
   After this introduction to the issues, Buckley skillfully
alternates chapters devoted to the biographies of Bontecou and
McCarthy, until the former writes the latter for a job. ``The
highest calling of our time is to contribute to the anti-Soviet
cause,'' Bontecou writes. McCarthy wastes no time in hiring him.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way there are constant references to the advances of
Communism along the road to world domination (``the loss of
China,'' for example), the growing influence of Communism within
the United States (the presidential campaign of Henry Wallace), the
subversions of its agents (Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs and a
lengthening list of ``Communist front'' organizations), the
ineptitude or worse of our leaders (who let us down at Potsdam and
Yalta, who lost us ``Poland and Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia and
Romania and East Germany''), and so much more, all of it aided by
pinkos and fellow travelers and abetted by dupes like Protestant
clergymen (``the largest single group supporting the Communist
apparatus in the United States today''), by ``professors,
scientists, artists, critics,'' by ``liberal Commie-smoochers'' in
general.
</P>
<P>
   In Buckley's view, the threat was dire enough not only to
explain but to justify the emergence of Joe McCarthy. His fame (or
infamy) began with a speech in 1950 in Wheeling, W.Va., to 275
members of the Ohio County Women's Republican Club. ``I have here
in my hand,'' he is reported to have said, a list of 205 known
members of the Communist Party who are still shaping policy in the
State Department. (He later said he had spoken of 57 ``loyalty
risks,'' not 205 Communists.)
</P>
<P>
   Buckley is at his best in serving up the resultant brouhaha,
hearings and behind-the-scenes maneuverings, the meat of the novel,
the rest mere condiment and garnish by comparison. Certainly he has
done his homework, mostly way back in 1953 when he was working on
the hard-hitting ``McCarthy and His Enemies,'' written with L.
Brent Bozell and published in 1954. Passages from that book are
carried over verbatim to ``The Redhunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley deserves praise for giving equal time to McCarthy's
enemies, if only to dismiss them. Through various spokesmen he
derides the notion that ``there never was any reason for a Red
scare,'' scoffs at the claim that ``McCarthyism is a greater threat
to America than Communism,'' and ridicules Joseph Welch's memorable
rebuke _ ``Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have
you no sense of decency?'' _ which finished off McCarthy and in
fact made him a liability to other Red hunters.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of McCarthy that emerges is of an essentially
``nice guy,'' generous and loyal, even honorable, utterly without
malice or rancor when offstage, ambitious, hyperactive, indifferent
to money, admittedly capable of the occasional stretcher, of
jumping to conclusions, of fudging evidence, goaded into
intemperate rejoinders, hounded into alcoholism and an early death.
</P>
<P>
   At the end he is undone by Commie-smoochers, by vengeful
Democrats, by blowhard journalists, by the machinations of
Eisenhower, by his own ``foibles,'' by his 5 o'clock shadow, above
all by his quixotic loyalty to the sinister and sleazy Roy Cohn.
Thus a righteous crusade gets stuck in the muck. If Buckley's
McCarthy were entirely a fictional character, one would feel sorry
for him.
</P>
<P>
   But Buckley's McCarthy does not quite square with the McCarthy
who appeared on the tube back there in the early 50s. Worse,
Buckley's McCarthy, although he has a style and a mission, has no
psychology or inner life. We never learn what drives him. To the
end he remains only an assortment of traits. As much may be said
about the other characters, including Bontecou, for Buckley has no
interest in subjectivity, no free-floating curiosity of any kind.
Everyone and everything is subsumed under a
moral-political-theological idea.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why Buckley, like Herrendon, has no idea as to why
an American intellectual might have become a Communist in the '50s
or 10 or 20 years earlier. Similarly he has no clue as to why an
American who abhors Communism might want to accord sympathizers the
usual rights under the law.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the novel's single sympathetic intellectual tells a
story about an ``old colored gentleman'' who asks whether it is
true that ``there's people who want to overthrow the government by
force and violence?'' When assured that there are, he says, well,
``Why don't we just run them out of town?''
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual then tells his fellow members of the Columbia
political science department that the old gentleman ``has a more
sophisticated understanding of democratic theory than any of you
gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley likes this story well enough to have repeated it from an
earlier novel, ``Tucker's Last Stand'' (1990), where, however, the
interlocutor is ``an elderly Negro lady.'' But Buckley has no
inkling that the tenor of this story is _ to use a word of the time
_ profoundly un-American, in law and spirit, if not, alas, always
in practice.
</P>

   George Stade, a professor of English at Columbia University, is
the author of the novel ``Confessions of a Lady-Killer.''

STARS WILL GLADLY TRADE `SCONES BOWL' FOR THAT CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hockey protocol being what it is, after the ear-throbbing cheers
and the hugs and the handshakes, there was a trophy to be presented
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Clarence S. Campbell Bowl looks like something the queen
would use to keep her day-old scones in. But as newly crowned
Western Conference champions, it now belongs to the Stars, and
captain Derian Hatcher had to report back to the ice to pose for
photos with it.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher did. The Reunion Arena crowd roared appropriately. But
then Hatch did an odd and very un-90s thing.
</P>
<P>
   He turned and skated off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't skate a victory lap with the big silver prize hoisted
high over his blonde locks. He didn't even hoist the thing and
shout, ``We da man!''
</P>
<P>
   At least somebody remembered to bring the Campbell Bowl into the
Stars' locker room. But once there, it was placed on a table
normally reserved for the Gatorade and went conspicuously
unnoticed. The ugliest girl at the party.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs and on the sidewalks around Reunion, there was a Mardi
Gras breaking out. But the Stars' quarters were oddly quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into that dressing room, their focus is four more
games,'' head coach Ken Hitchcock had promised after the Game-7
victory over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The journey is not done, the Stars were reminding us. When a kid
in Canada or upper Michigan is on a pond, dreaming about the day he
wins a hockey championship, he isn't skating around the ice with an
imaginary Clarence S. Campbell Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was such an stark contrast to the first time the
baseball Rangers clinched their first division title in 1996.
Champagne flowed in the Rangers clubhouse that night. Players broke
out foot-long cigars.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, thanks to the Yankees, the season was over and
Rangers management was wondering where all the champagne stains
came from.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano was right when he said that the Stanley Cup may be
the most difficult trophy to win in team sports. There are four
rounds to survive, for one thing. The winner will play for more
than two months. In the NHL's West, at least, there are time zones
to cross and long late-night flights to squirm through.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it was an arresting series. Seven intriguingly contested
games. Great players, making great plays, on both sides.
Game-saving goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   If the world didn't know as much as it should about the Stars'
Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk or Jere Lehtinen, it does now. The
series proved to be a baptism, of sorts, for a rising star named
Jamie Langenbrunner _ and an absolution for the veteran Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team deserved to lose. By Game 7, though, and with their
frequent flier mileage at Defcon Five, the Avalanche finally seemed
to run out of legs. Their nearly shotless second period Friday
night suggested that they were weary of the battle in the neutral
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The series with the Avs left Stars fans limp. The contrast of
styles and clash of wills had produced enchanting hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the hockey literati did not seem to be overly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   In writing why Hitchcock should not be the next coach of Team
Canada, Chris Young of the Toronto Star wrote, ``The Stars are like
the baseball manager who walks Mark McGwire with the bases empty .
. . They're a lay-up on a par five . . . Yes, the Stars are the
straitjackets of this Stanley Cup semifinal. Next to them, the Avs
look like one of \RPat\S Riley's Armani suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh. That tired argument again. One last time, therefore, for the
Toe Blake-impaired:
</P>
<P>
   The Stars finished eighth in the NHL in scoring this season (236
goals) and scored just nine goals less than that acknowledged
red-light machine, the Detroit Red Wings. The Maple Leafs scored an
NHL-high 268, yet only posted the Eastern Conference's fourth-best
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored 68 more goals than they allowed. They kill
penalties. They seize opportunities. They don't take foolish
chances, except perhaps in Game Fives of conference-final series,
in which case even a 7-5 result is entirely possible.
</P>
<P>
   They may have seemed a joyless lot to the Canadian and Eastern
media, but you probably wouldn't be giddy, either, if the door
prize was the queen's scones bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The journey is not done, the Stars reminded us last Friday night
in mid-Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   The next trophy is a dreamboat.

   HOUSTON _ A father in a small Texas town won a verdict of
$250,000 against a hospital after his daughter was decapitated by
an inadequately medicated former psychiatric patient. But in 1996
the Texas Supreme Court overturned the decision and the hospital
paid nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In a Houston case, a judge agreed last fall with lawyers for a
9-year-old girl that lax security made it easy for her to be raped
by three teen-agers in a vacant apartment. It was the kind of
ruling that used to bring multimillion-dollar awards. But the
company that managed the property did not have to pay anything.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, a jury set damages at $42.5 million after
finding that an oil company's indifference to safety had caused the
death of a worker in an explosion. But in March the judge reduced
the amount to $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, sweeping changes have transformed the
legal system here in Texas and in many other states. Under the
banner of lawsuit reform, Texas has helped to lead the way,
embracing one of the nation's most ambitious attempts to hold down
the cost of civil suits and limit the size of jury awards.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Texas had a reputation as the ``lawsuit capital of
America'' because its juries in injury cases were said to be overly
generous: After a prize bull died as as reaction to insecticide, a
rancher won a jury verdict of $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in the late 1980s, the state began adding
restrictions, like limits on punitive damage awards, and provisions
that make it harder for injured workers to sue. It even enacted a
measure, originally drafted by the tobacco industry, aimed at
barring suits by smokers against cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now Texas is seen as one of the most aggressive states in
efforts to curb civil suits under the banner of ``tort reform.''
More than 30 states, including Alabama last week, have passed laws
since 1995 aimed at reining in what critics call rampant lawsuit
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Given its former reputation, Texas' experiment with
civil-justice changes would draw notice under any circumstances.
But because Gov. George W. Bush is closely associated with the
movement, his record on civil justice in Texas is likely to be an
issue if he runs for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing you and I can do to improve our
economy and create jobs in Texas is to reform our civil justice
system,'' Bush said in his first state of the state message in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not the architect of the movement to change the law,
and the legal system here had already begun to make sharp changes
before he took office. But he seized on lawsuit abuse as a potent
political issue, and he has benefited from its ability to attract
campaign contributions from businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Curbing lawsuit abuse was one of just four issues Bush
emphasized in his campaign for governor in 1994. And he delivered.
Leaders of the movement here to change tort law, which deals with
injury cases, say Bush helped bring their most impressive
successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of one to 10, he's a 10. There isn't any question
about it: He helped tremendously,'' said Ralph Wayne, president of
the Texas Civil Justice League, one of the leading business groups
in Austin, the state capital, lobbying for limits on lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Bush championed a package of bills that swept the Texas
Legislature in 1995, including the measure that imposed a new
formula capping punitive damages, and provisions that stopped
plaintiffs' lawyers from selecting sympathetic courts in which to
file their suits.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills passed that year with the governor's support
included provisions that made it more difficult for people to sue
professionals like engineers and real estate agents, and a new law
that made it harder for people to recover damages when their
injuries were caused by more than one wrongdoer.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the changes are reintroducing fairness in a legal
system gone haywire. But critics in Texas and across the country
say the ``reform'' label is being used to force the most extensive
cutback in the legal protections for citizens in this century.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the direction of the legal system has divided
voters, legislators, lawyers and even judges. The Texas Supreme
Court, an elected body that was once controlled by Democrats, is
now entirely Republican. The court itself, its critics say, has
been reshaped by the movement to limit suits; many of its members
have received political contributions from groups urging limits on
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Bush's election, the court had been propelling civil
justice changes in scores of opinions that overturned jury verdicts
and cut back on legal rules that favored plaintiffs. The court,
which decided about 70 percent of its cases in favor of plaintiffs
in the mid-1980s, now rules against them three-quarters of the
time, according to a study by a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's role in the movement to limit suits has
provoked bitter criticism even inside the judiciary. Phil
Hardberger, a Democrat who is chief justice of Texas' District
Court of Appeals in San Antonio, said the changing attitudes in the
legal system here are veiled efforts to undermine the jury system
as a democratic institution. The reason, he said, is that jurors
are often sympathetic to plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Hardberger said in an interview, ``is jury
verdicts are meaning less and less. There is an inherent distrust
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's chief justice, Thomas Phillips, once a
lawyer at a firm that represented major corporations, said in an
interview that his court is part of a broad conservative trend in
American civil law. His court's opinions, he said, showed a
``realization across America of the limits of the tort system.''
</P>
<P>
   But both sides here agree that, 10 years after the movement to
change civil law began, the legal culture here in Texas is
profoundly changed.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer personal injury lawsuits, down by about 10,000
annually statewide from a high of 65,000 in 1995. The Bush
administration said that consumers have saved more than $2.2
billion in insurance premiums because the 1995 legal changes have
meant insurance companies are paying out less to people claiming
injuries. But consumer advocates say all that has happened is
windfall profits for insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Southwest Insurance Information Service, an
industry group, said a typical Texas driver's automobile liability
premium rose to $789 in 1997, up from $727 in 1994. The group said
that the full effects of tort reform have yet to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Insurance said there were many reasons
that insurance profits were high, including the fact that cars were
safer and there has been less drunken driving. Tort reform was not
necessarily responsible for the fact that they were paying less to
claimants. A spokesman said the profit rate for automotive insurers
in 1996, for example, was 19 percent return on net worth. In
contrast, the department's rate was about 12 percent and the
national rate was 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pervasive changes in attitudes by lawyers and jurors have meant
that the dollar amounts of lawsuit settlements are sharply lower
across the state, lawyers on both sides of the issue said. Some
studies suggest that plaintiffs' lawyers earn less on average than
they did before the movement to change the laws began.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, it is now accepted political wisdom that the
once-powerful trial lawyers no longer have the influence they
wielded here for decades. ``They have won,'' acknowledged Hartley
Hampton, the president of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association.
``We're just trying to keep them from bayoneting the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The tort reform movement has supplied the first potent challenge
nationally to the trial lawyers' political power. Heavily supported
by business, the campaign has pressed for changes in the law in
virtually every state legislature in recent years. This year there
have been proposals in Florida, Pennsylvania, New York and other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Battles over the measures are playing out in scores of state
courts across the country, including Illinois and Ohio, where some
judges have ruled that newly enacted changes violate fundamental
rights of citizens to have access to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in many states, proponents of changes in the law,
including many in the business community, say the courts had bent
too far toward plaintiffs. ``The more you learn, the more ludicrous
the whole system becomes,'' said Richard Weekley, a leader of one
of the state's best-financed groups, Texans for Lawsuit Reform.
Weekley's family owns a major Houston home-building company that,
like most businesses, has faced liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the people affected by the changing legal rules and
attitudes here say the Texas legal system had grown harsh because
of the changes. In the small central Texas town of Kerrville, James
Clark, a retired government ammunition inspector, said he was
shocked when the Texas Supreme Court overturned the jury verdict
and said the hospital did not have to do anything to compensate for
his daughter's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's son-in-law, a violent psychotic, had threatened his
daughter and set fire to her car. But he was released by the state
hospital without being given an intravenous shot of anti-psychotic
medication. Seven days later, he killed her.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital declined comment. But the message from the courts
in his case, Clark said, was that psychiatric hospitals will not be
held to account for carelessness. ``If they can get by with that,''
he said, ``they can get by with anything. If that can happen, what
good is your court system?''

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The list is as chilling as it is detailed,
and Steve Fried is fortunate that his name will not be added to it.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six people have died at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
since 1909, a list divided into various categories: drivers (39),
mechanics (14), racing personnel (4), spectators (8) and
miscellaneous (1).
</P>
<P>
   Fried, the chief mechanic and right front tire-changer on the
pit crew of Indianapolis 500 rookie of the year Robby McGehee,
suffered head and chest injuries when struck by the wheel of a car
tossed back into his team's pit stall during last Sunday's race.
While awaiting word of Fried's condition, officials of the Pep Boys
Indy Racing League collectively held their breaths. And prayed some
more.
</P>
<P>
   IRL officials have been praying a lot since May 1, when a wheel
and other debris from a three-car crash flew over a 15-foot-high
fence into the grandstands during the VisionAire 500 at Lowe's
Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C. Three spectators were killed and
eight injured, including a 9-year-old girl. The tragedy occurred
only nine months after three spectators were killed and six injured
by a wheel that flew off a car after it had struck a wall during
the Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series' U.S. 500 at
Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Either mishap by itself might have been dismissed as a fluke but
together they placed all of open-wheeled racing under a heightened
level of security heading into Texas Motor Speedway for the
Longhorn 500 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freak things happen,'' said Billy Boat, winner of the IRL
night race here a year ago. ``Racing has never been 100 percent
safe. The problem is that we saw a bit of a pattern developing, and
we had to do something to fix that.''
</P>
<P>
   All motorsports sanctioning bodies _ from the IRL and CART to
NASCAR to the National Hot Rod Association _ are locked in an
ongoing debate: how to balance the need for speed vs. driver and
fan safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took 30 horsepower from them now, and they'll get it
back,'' said IRL executive director Leo Mehl after announcing a
serieswide engine revs reduction last week. ``And I'll get 'em for
50 \Rhorsepower\S next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have basically in racing ... most people are obsessed
with this thing \Rspeed\S. If your job is to make the race car go
faster, and you've got a guy working 8-to-5, you'll fire him and
get somebody who won't sleep until he makes it go faster. That's
their job. At the same time, it's our job to think about the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   IRL driver Greg Ray said, ``You want to be safe for the fans.
But there has to be some edge you can walk up to and balance on _
or even go beyond and come back to _ to differentiate yourself from
other teams and drivers. Speed is the easiest way to do that. I
race because I love the speed. There's no such a thing as `too
fast.' That's a driver's prerogative.''
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances have made today's varied race cars safer
than ever for the drivers, despite the advances in speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back at the cars I drove 15 years ago, I must have
been out of my mind,'' said Eddie Cheever, the 1996 Indy 500
champion who also has raced in CART and Formula One. ``And yet at
that point, that was the safest car you could get into.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers voluntarily assume a degree of risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't expect to hurt fans,'' said Houston's A.J.
Foyt, the first four-time winner of the Indy 500. ``A race driver,
we're no different than the people that sit up there. But none of
the race drivers ever want to see where they hurt a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehl said the IRL has been operating in a goldfish bowl since it
ran its first race in January 1996. Many of the major issues facing
founder Tony George's all-oval series have dealt with driver
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crisis situation in Charlotte was different than previous
situations,'' Mehl said, ``where the driver was the one being
hurt.''
REACTING EN MASSE
</P>
<P>
   In the five weeks since the incident at LMS, sanctioning body
officials and track managements swiftly implemented a series of
improvements designed to protect drivers and fans.
</P>
<P>
   CART's teams were required to compete with tethered suspensions
and front wheels for the first time during the Motorola 300 at
Gateway International Raceway on May 29. On Friday, CART announced
it will require tethers on the rear wheels of its Champ Cars before
the July 25 U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway, the next oval race on
the CART schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The 83rd Indy 500 last week saw the debut of the IRL's
``suspension-and-wheel energy-management system'' that uses
restraining cables made with Zylon _ a high-tech fiber reportedly
with the strength of five tons. The system costs approximately
$2,500 per car.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the race in Fort Worth, IRL engine revs will be
limited to 10,000 RPM, down from 10,300 RPM. The reduction is
expected to trim 25 to 30 horsepower and approximately 3 mph off
speeds around the 1.5-mile quad-oval.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials _ mindful of their position as the nation's
fastest-growing spectator sport _ reacted by making ``cable
restraints'' available for the front wheels of its Winston Cup and
Busch Grand National cars at LMS last weekend. Made of braided
steel cable, the restraints are the sanctioning body's equivalent
of tethers. The entire 43-car field in the BGN Carquest 300
voluntarily used the restraints on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Speedway Motorsports Inc. are raising the front
stretch grandstand fencing at each of its four tracks that play
host to IRL events. The fences at Lowe's, Texas Motor Speedway,
Atlanta Motor Speedway and Las Vegas Motor Speedway are being
raised from 15 to 21 feet. Overhangs at the top of the fences also
are being increased from three feet to six feet to better contain
debris.
</P>
<P>
   For first time in the track's three-year history, TMS management
has decided not to sell seats in the first 10 rows during the IRL
race. ``It probably is a terribly conservative, cautious approach
to take,'' said Eddie Gossage, TMS' executive vice president and
general manager. ``But particularly for this event, we need to be
ultra-careful.'' The seating ban will be in effect whenever IRL
cars are on the track.
</P>
<P>
   The spectator deaths at Lowe's, formerly known as Charlotte
Motor Speedway, were the first in the 40-year history of the
1.5-mile track, owned by Bruton Smith and run with flair by
president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really has been a tough thing for our company
emotionally, the moral obligation that you feel,'' Gossage said.
``We wanted to do everything we could possibly do, and then call on
the IRL to make changes to the cars. Combined, we feel like that
makes these cars very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to reduce engine revs is a prelude to the IRL's
downsized 3.5-liter engine program scheduled to debut in 2000. It
will feature a loss of approximately 50 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, speed is a result of tires, aerodynamics and
horsepower,'' Mehl said. ``The engine companies started looking at
the situation right away. Our goal was to have our
suspension-energy-management system in place for the Indy 500, in
addition to an engine \Rrev\S reduction by the Texas race.''
WHAT ABOUT FENDERS?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in what would rank as a radical departure, Mehl said
the IRL is studying the viability of putting fenders on Indy cars.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, who must decide if the IRL will return to LMS next
season, was a proponent of such a change long before the crash at
his track. But even as a safety device, the notion largely has been
met by skepticism from open-wheel traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenders? Why? What are you going to gain?'' said Mario
Andretti, a former Indy 500, CART and Formula One World Driving
Champion. ``The Indy-car is a single-seater, open-wheel car. It's
the purest form of a race car. You shouldn't deviate from that.
This thing about wheels flying around, I think it'll be handled by
the tethers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rahal, a three-time CART champion and current team owner,
said he believes talk about adding fenders bordered on the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cars really can't be much safer than they are,'' said
Rahal, the 1986 Indy 500 winner. ``The gains that you're going to
make are infinitesimal. I mean, they may not look it, but they're
far safer than a Winston Cup car or anything else because of the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   John Menard, who fields Ray's IRL team and is part-owner of
Robby Gordon's CART team, said one of the obvious results of adding
fenders to Indy cars is increased speed via aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest aerodynamic drag on these cars is the wheels,''
said Menard, who lost top driver Scott Brayton to a fatal crash
during practice at Indy in May 1996. ``If we put fenders on them,
we would pick up I don't know, 30 mph. I think tethers go a long
ways to serving the same purpose as fenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehl said one of the considerations on fenders is increased
downforce. Another is increased debris after a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in any of these things, you've got to be extremely careful
you don't make the situation worse,'' said Mehl, who has been
involved in major-league motorsports since 1965. ``Covering the
wheels up in some manner to retain them, it's probably not going to
work for our form of racing. What we're trying to offer is a
different form of racing. The skills required to drive an
open-wheeled car 20 or 30 mph faster are different than the skills
required to run a stock car. We certainly would be reluctant to
give up that tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt, the embodiment of open-wheel tradition, scored his first
Indy 500 victory in 1961, the year Tony Bettenhausen was killed in
a crash on the front stretch during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt scored his second Indy 500 victory in 1964, a race marred
by a fiery, front stretch crash that killed popular veteran Eddie
Sachs and rookie Dave MacDonald at the end of Lap 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Victory Lane photo from that day shows Foyt standing next to
his wife, Lucy, and the Borg-Warner Trophy. He is holding a dummy
newspaper with the headline, ``Foyt Winner in 500; Sachs, MacDonald
Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said death in a race car apparently was more accepted in
that era, when the event was restarted and run to its conclusion.
And A.J. wound up celebrating in Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said after the race, it's not the kind of win I like,'' said
Foyt, 64. ``It was a sad deal, and I expressed my sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a good friend of mine once told me, `A.J., there's no
guarantee in life. The only square deal you got on earth is ``He
put us here, and He can come and take us.'' ' Stop and think about
that.''

MARIO ANDRETTI ENDORSES SAFETY PRECAUTION THAT GOES WALL-TO-WALL 
RISKS OF RACING PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of drastically altering open-wheeled cars via the
addition of fenders, Mario Andretti suggests that available
technology be directed at another element of the speed vs. safety
equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the 21st century, maybe it's time for the \Rtrack\S
operators to look for energy-absorbing walls,'' said Andretti,
former Championship Auto Racing Teams and Formula One World Driving
Champion. ``By that, I mean you don't get rid of the concrete walls
that you have, but you put something in front of them. We've been
talking about that for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil they have it, and I assure you that can be so
beneficial to stock cars and open-wheel cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a system is in its second year of development at the
2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Last Sunday's 83rd Indy 500
was the first race run with the new PEDS-2 Barrier, an enhanced
version of the revolutionary energy-aborbing system installed last
May.
</P>
<P>
   The new Polyethylene Energy Dissipating System (PEDS-2) Barrier
is located on the inside of Turn 4 at the Speedway, the same site
as the original. Two-time Indy 500 champion Arie Luyendyk struck
the original PEDS Barrier with a stock-car style Pontiac Firebird
during the inaugural International Race of Champions event at IMS
last August. Luyendyk suffered a concussion in the heavy crash, but
credited the system with preventing more severe injury.
</P>
<P>
   Since that crash, a new, 12-inch-diameter secondary polyethylene
cylinder has been placed inside each of the existing 16-inch
cylinders in the barrier modules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wall will now better accommodate the safety needs of all
the vehicles that compete at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,''
said designer John Pierce, retired engineer from GM Motorsports who
serves as a safety consultant to the Pep Boys Indy Racing League.
In addition to Indy-cars, IMS also will play host this year to
NASCAR's Winston Cup stock cars and the IROC machines. In September
2000, Formula One cars also will race counter-clockwise on a
portion of the front stretch at IMS _ near the barrier system.
</P>
<P>
   Each module contains overlapping polyethylene impact plates
fastened to 16-inch-diameter cylinders, with the new 12-inch
cylinders inside each of the larger cylinders. The upper portion of
the impact plate is folded over the top of the cylinders. Each
module is anchored to the concrete wall with the original vertical
steel cables and new horizontal cables.
</P>
<P>
   When the system was introduced last year, Speedway officials
said they were confident it might someday be applied around the
walls of entire racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the oval track operators put their minds to it,'' said
Andretti, the 1969 Indy 500 champion, ``I assure you they'll come
up with something that will be relatively inexpensive and will help
not only open-wheel cars but stock cars. We've got to look at
making those walls more painless. There's a way to do it that makes
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we figure this out?''

PUTTING INDY-CARS ON BANKED OVALS QUESTIONED 
RISKS OF RACING PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 24-degree banked turns at Texas Motor Speedway admittedly
were designed to accommodate full-fendered stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the best racing around the 1.5-mile quad-oval in Fort Worth
arguably has been put on by the open-wheeled cars of the Pep Boys
Indy Racing League the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've run very, very competitively at 220-plus mph here,''
said Eddie Gossage, executive vice president and general manager of
TMS. ``That's a show you don't want to take your eyes off of. I
kind of feel guilty selling fans a seat because they're standing up
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the wisdom of racing Indy-cars on high-banked ovals has
come into question since the tragedy at Lowe's Motor Speedway, TMS'
sister track in Concord, N.C., on May 1. Three fans were killed and
six injured when a wheel and assorted debris flew over a
15-foot-high catch fence and into the grandstands in the Turn 4
area after a three-car crash.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL is limiting engine revs to 10,000 RPM beginning with the
Longhorn 500 at TMS on Saturday night. That is expected to delete
approximately 25 to 30 horsepower from the normally aspirated
Oldsmobile Aurora and Nissan Infiniti V-8 engines.
</P>
<P>
   But should Indy-cars continue to compete on high-banked tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Open-wheel icon Mario Andretti and three-time NASCAR Winston Cup
champion Darrell Waltrip were among the most prominent figures to
raise that question in the Lowe's aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a big difference racing on this racetrack \RTMS\S
vs. any other racetrack,'' said IRL driver Greg Ray of Plano. ``If
you have an impact and a piece flies off the car, why does it
matter if it's a banked track or not. ... Somebody's going to have
to show me a calculator with scientific measurements and physics to
say what's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti is a former Championship Auto Racing Teams champion
whose son, Michael, won an active-series-leading 38th race on the
Gateway International Raceway oval in Madison, Ill., on May 29.
Mario Andretti said there that his comments immediately after the
Lowe's tragedy were misinterpreted. He said he was not targeting
IRL facilities. Andretti also has a problem racing Indy-type cars
at Brooklyn, Mich., and Fontana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the speeds there _ 240 mph,'' Andretti said. ``I mean,
incredible. And they're still lifting \Rthe accelerator\S. On a
high-banked track \Rlike TMS\S, they'd run 250 mph. That's the part
that seems to be unreasonable. We're almost victims of the
technology that we know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have seen those tracks, where they spent
so much money, to have been a flat track where it could have been
so viable and so versatile going into the 21st century. We'd
\RCART\S love to be in Dallas-Fort Worth. It makes your heart bleed
that we're not there. It really does. But the tracks are built, the
money's been spent _ and nobody wants to hear some realities.''

 HOUSTON: court system?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle over once-obscure portions of the civil law has
become a permanent part of the political system here. It is a
battle of big money and bruising fights. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars have flowed from self-styled reformers mostly into
Republican campaigns, including Bush's. Proponents of the legal
changes say they are merely trying to counter the large political
contributions that have been given mostly to Democrats for years by
the state's trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Texans for Lawsuit Reform is now one of the largest political
action committees in the state. It contributed more than $1 million
to candidates in state races in each of the last two elections and
succeeded in making civil justice changes a decisive issue in some
legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   In political races, trial lawyers have been demonized across the
state, sometimes literally: In a state Senate campaign in the Rio
Grande Valley, one candidate won after he had a photograph
distributed of his opponent, a trial lawyer, doctored to show
devilish features.
</P>
<P>
   And the battle has included extensive public relations campaigns
across Texas by local groups called Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse,
funded by small businesses and concerned individuals.
</P>
<P>
   For years before Bush's election boosted the movement statewide,
heavily funded media campaigns across Texas have drilled in
messages like: ``Lawsuit abuse: We all pay, we all lose.'' Jurors
sometimes cite such messages when they return verdicts for
businesses that have been sued.
</P>
<P>
   The change in political attitudes has been so dramatic that some
politicians now seem to view measures protecting businesses from
suits as uncontroversial ``pork'' projects for their districts. Not
long after a 15-year-old girl was thrown to her death from a
carnival ride in Austin, a liberal Democrat from El Paso introduced
a bill in the Texas Legislature this year that would have helped
amusement park owners fight suits by injured riders.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the liberal Democrat, State Rep. Norma Chavez,
acknowledged that she had introduced the measure at the request of
an El Paso amusement park owner who runs the same ride that killed
the teen-ager in Austin. ``I wasn't even aware that it was a big
tort-reform bill,'' she said. After a public outcry, the bill was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups here have countered the onslaught with campaigns
of their own. Reports from watchdog groups, like Texans for Public
Justice, an Austin-based group that tracks political financing,
regularly point out that many of the ``reformers'' are Texas
businesses that might simply want to limit their losses in suits.
</P>
<P>
   The business view of the court system is clear: It has to be
brought under control. Otherwise, investors and executives said,
investment dollars will flee to places that offer more protection
from unpredictable verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Entoven, a Dallas real estate investor, said a statewide
chain of coin-operated laundries that he owned until recently had
closed some of its locations partly because his business was sued
for providing inadequate security. In eight cases, he said, suits
were filed after members of the public were attacked and, in one
case, murdered on his property.
</P>
<P>
   Entoven said legal rules made it easy for juries to impose
damages on businesses but did not take account of the fact that
such verdicts discourage investment. Jurors, he said, can be moved
by sympathy for injured people far more than by the consequences of
driving investment dollars away from areas that need business
activity. The result, he said, is that business people make fewer
investments in blighted areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like me,'' he said, ``are not going to be there to be
sued because of some poor person who gets shot in the parking lot.
The world doesn't see that. The world only sees the poor person who
is shot in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   One business contributor to Texans for Lawsuit Reform, James
McIngvale, a Houston furniture store owner who advertises heavily
on television as ``Mattress Mac,'' agreed. He said he had donated
$25,000 to the cause. He had learned from experience, he said, that
the state's reputation as a haven for lawsuits hurt business.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I became more successful,'' McIngvale said, ``I became more
and more of a target for frivolous lawsuits.'' He acknowledged,
however, that at least one suit had not been frivolous. In 1987, he
settled a case after a 300-pound African lion that was on a chain
as an attraction at a flea market he owned mauled an 8-year-old
girl who was walking by with her parents. The lion, it was later
learned, had mauled two children the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But some Texans who have found themselves involved with the
courts here recently said they were more concerned with whether the
system was still helping to protect ordinary people from injuries
than with the safety of investment dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Wilda Hosch, a retired secretary who was a juror
in the case of the burned refinery worker, said too much protection
for business could send a dangerous message. Jurors were angry, she
said, when the judge in the case used the law Bush had signed
limiting punitive damages to cut back the $42.5 million verdict.
</P>
<P>
   She said the evidence showed that the company, Ultramar Diamond
Shamrock, could have prevented the death of Charles Hall, a
52-year-old refinery worker, if a small sum had been spent
uncovering safety valves that had been left buried for years.
</P>
<P>
   Hall lingered for nine days with burns over half his body. In an
interview, his widow, Donna Hall, said she pursued the suit because
``I thought, maybe this will make the refineries stop and think.''
The company did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hosch, the juror, said the valves would have given Hall a
warning and a chance. Cutting the damages back so sharply, she
said, undermined the message the jurors wanted to send. The award
of ``$200,000 is just pocket change,'' she said. ``They'll just
write this off.''

<P>
   A look at some of the most notorious accidents in racing
history, and changes that resulted: June 11, 1955: 24 Hours of Le
Mans, France
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Bouillion Levegh's Mercedes 300 SLR, racing at
approximately 130 mph, hits another car, becomes engulfed in flames
and launches over a barrier into the crowd. More than 80 people are
killed and more than 100 injured. Race organizers refuse to cancel
the race, saying a mass exit of fans would have hindered rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the wreck, several races were canceled around
Europe. An international outcry went out against auto racing, with
some politicians calling for its outright ban. Slight modifications
of the track and pit areas were made the following year.
May 24, 1964: Charlotte Motor Speedway
</P>
<P>
   Glenn ``Fireball'' Roberts is seriously injured in a fire when
his car hits the wall and the fuel tank explodes. Fellow drivers
pull him out of his car. He dies in July as a result of injuries
suffered in the crash. In the wake of the accident, the fuel cell
becomes commonplace in stock cars. Ironically, Roberts' car had a
more sturdy lining around the gas tank earlier in the season,
designed by car owner Ralph Moody. But NASCAR officials told him to
remove it because it was not an approved part. The tank held 22
gallons, was oval and made of fiberglass. After the wreck, NASCAR
permitted Moody to use the fuel cell.
May 24, 1964: Indianapolis Motor Speedway
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald are killed in a fiery fourth-turn
crash on the second lap of the Indianapolis 500. The wreck prompts
several changes in Indy-car racing, including:
</P>
<P>
   Firestone creates a fuel cell with an outside casing of either
steel or aluminum that has a thick rubber bladder and a low-density
plastic foam. The fuel tank capacity is also limited to 75 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Auto Club bans the use of gasoline in race
cars and switches to methanol, the same fuel used today. Methanol
is cleaner burning and does not ignite as quickly as gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   USAC also institutes a minimum weight rule of 1,250 pounds for
Indy cars. Today, IRL cars must weigh at least 1,585 pounds.
Fall of 1970: Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Drag racer Don Garlits loses part of his foot during an accident
with his front-engine Top Fuel Dragster. While recuperating,
Garlits designs the first rear-engine Top Fuel machine. He
introduced the design late in the 1970 season. Early in 1971, he
became the first driver to use a rear-engine car and win a National
Hot Rod Association event. All professional Top Fuel dragsters now
have their engine mounted in the rear of the chassis.
May 28, 1973: Indianapolis Motor Speedway
</P>
<P>
   Salt Walther is badly burned, 11 spectators are injured and 11
other cars damaged when Walther crashes down the front straight at
the start of the race. Rain red-flags the race until a restart on
May 30, when more tragedy occurs. On Lap 58, Swede Savage crashes
in Turn 4 after leaving the pits. Blazing fuel brings out a red
flag for 1:15. On July 2, Savage dies of injuries suffered in the
wreck.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the crashes, rule changes were made that
decreased the amount of fuel. Also, fuel tanks were switched to the
left side of the race cars, away from the retaining wall.
</P>
<P>
   Changes to the track included removing seats that were at track
level, with a second safety fence put up in front of the new first
row of grandstands. The inside and outside retaining walls were
raised to a uniform height of 32 inches, and the pit lane was
widened.
</P>
<P>
   1980-1982: Knoxville (Iowa) Raceway
</P>
<P>
   The half-mile dirt track known as the ``Capital of Sprint Car
Racing'' witnesses five fatalities in non-winged Sprint Car
competition during a three-year span. After the fifth fatality in
1982, Knoxville officials mandate the use of a 25-square-foot wing
on all sprint cars. The wing helps the cars ``stick'' to the track
and, if the car flips, acts as a shock absorber and preventing the
car from rolling.
May 1987: Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Allison's Buick becomes airborne and flies into the catch
fence at the 2.66-mile banked superspeedway. Allison escapes
unharmed. This was the same event where Bill Elliott set a one-lap
record for a stock car at faster than 212 mph. Allison's wreck
prompts NASCAR officials to slow the speeds of the cars on the
series' two superspeedways _ Talladega and the Daytona
International Speedway _ with the introduction of a carburetor
restrictor plate. The plate is placed in between the intake
manifold and carburetor. By restricting the amount of air taken
into the engine, it reduces horsepower from more than 700 to
approximately 420.
November 18, 1990: Atlanta Motor Speedway
</P>
<P>
   A crewman for Bill Elliott is hit and killed on pit road at the
Georgia track. Another crewman is injured in the same incident. For
the 1991 season, NASCAR mandates a maximum speed limit on pit road,
which varies with each track. That speed typically is at 55 mph.
July 1993: Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bonnett's car becomes airborne and hits the catch fence.
This incident, combined with other similar crashes, results in
NASCAR making roof flaps mandatory on stock cars.
Sept. 1, 1996: Indianapolis Raceway Park, Indianapolis, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Talented Top Fuel driver Blaine Johnson is killed in a wreck at
the quarter-mile asphalt dragstrip during the U.S. Nationals. In
the wake of the wreck, the National Hot Rod Association mandates
that all entrances and exits must be closed and flush all the way
down the drag strip. The height of the concrete barrier is raised
to 48 inches.
</P>
<P>
   July 26, 1998: Michigan Speedway, Brooklyn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Three spectators are killed and six injured after a tire off of
Adrian Fernandez's Champ Car launches into the stands over the
catch fence during the Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series'
U.S. 500. Later in the year, the fencing from the fourth turn to
the first and second turns in front of the main grandstand is
raised from 141/2 feet to 17 feet. The overhang on the fence is
also extended by four feet.
</P>
<P>
   May 1, 1999: Lowe's Motor Speedway, Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Three spectators are killed and eight injured after a wheel and
suspension pieces created by a three-car crash clear a 15-foot-high
fence and enter the grandstands during a Pep Boys Indy Racing
League event. An investigation of the incident by IRL and track
officials determined that a wheel off the car of Stan Wattles was
punted into the grandstands by the car of John Paul Jr. The
management of Speedway Motorsports Inc. subsequently announces that
the fences at SMI tracks playing host to IRL events, including
Texas Motor Speedway, will be raised to 21 feet and the overhang
increased from 3 to 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, both the IRL and CART mandate the use of tethers to keep
wheels and suspension parts connected to the open-wheeled cars
during a crash.

 HOUSTON: this off.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In scores of interviews across Texas with business executives,
lawyers, judges, legislators, lobbyists and ordinary people
involved in lawsuits, it was clear that the movement to change the
law has left people deeply divided over what the function of the
courts ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Some said the courts had to assure that businesses were
protected from frivolous claims. But in Houston, a laboratory
technician, Kingsley Agbor, said the courts ought to be open to
powerless people to try to take on a big institutions. But his own
experience in a suit, he said, made him think that was no longer
true here.
</P>
<P>
   During birth, his son Dikeh was injured and left with one
useless arm. The boy, he said, cannot tie his own shoes. Agbor sued
the doctor who attended the birth. The doctor settled.
</P>
<P>
   But Agbor also sued the hospital for permitting the doctor to
practice here. He said he did that because he did not want another
family to suffer as his has. It turned out that the hospital had
allowed the doctor to practice even though she had been sued for
malpractice numerous times before and had no Texas insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Half the states allow people to sue hospitals if they believe
the hospitals were negligent in giving doctors credentials. But in
1997 the Texas Supreme Court, overruling an intermediate appeals
court in Agbor's case, said it would not permit such suits here.
</P>
<P>
   After a request from a reporter, the hospital, St. Luke's
Episcopal, issued a statement saying the Texas Supreme Court
``struck a proper balance.'' Agbor said his case taught a different
lesson. ``I don't think the court is for the little man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agbor's case is sometimes cited by consumer advocates here as an
example of what they say is an obvious shift away from injured
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   One analysis by a consumer group in Austin, Court Watch, showed
that individual people involved in suits like Agbor's have won only
18 percent of the cases before the Supreme Court since the 1995
legal changes were passed. Manufacturers, hospitals and other
businesses won more than 76 percent of the time. Four of the
current members of the nine-member court were first appointed by
Bush to fill vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   A study by Texans for Public Justice found that more than 68
percent of the money raised by the current Supreme Court justices
in their last elections came from corporation lawyers or people
identified as supporters of groups pressing for civil justice
changes. Only 4 percent came from plaintiffs' lawyers or consumer
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Justice Phillips defended his court as one
that simply decided each case on its merits. And he said the
reports suggesting that the justices use their decisions to advance
the cause of the so-called lawsuit reformers were nothing more than
partisan ``adjuncts of campaigns'' to unseat the incumbent judges.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, civil litigation is measured in dollars. In that
cold language of personal injury law, injuries are simply worth
less here than they were before. The case of the 9-year-old rape
victim, her lawyers say, illustrates the changing legal culture of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old was raped by three youths in an unlocked and
vacant apartment in the complex where she lived. Later, prosecutors
convicted three teen-agers of the sexual assault. At the civil
trial against the company that managed the apartment complex, there
was a dispute about whether the boys had dragged her into the empty
apartment. The company's lawyers argued that she had gone along
willingly.
</P>
<P>
   Before that trial, the girl's lawyers settled their claims
against the absent owner of the building for $250,000. But they
hoped for more from the management company.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Gillaspie, a Houston lawyer who represents the girl, said
that in the early 1990s, before the biggest successes of the
movement to limit suits, similar cases brought verdicts of $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   After the legal changes, the civil jury in the case of the
9-year-old found that, if she was entitled to damages at all, they
would be limited to $100,000. Since the girl had already received
more than that from the owner of the complex, the judge ruled last
fall, she would receive nothing from the management company.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides in the suit saw the case in starkly different
terms. After weeks of interviews here, those different views
sounded like summaries of the sharply different opinions about the
legal system across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the girl's mother, a school secretary, said the
courts had let her down. After lawyers' fees were deducted, the
$166,000 she received from the owner went quickly toward therapists
and medical care. But she said the girl, now a teen-ager, has
slipped further into depression every year since the assault and
needed help that her family could not afford. In her view, the
management company could and should have paid because it had
provided the place where her daughter was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   But Brock Akers, a lawyer for the management company, said it
was only fair that the courts were not holding his client
accountable. The courts, he said, were right not to impose
liability simply because a defendant had deep pockets and something
awful had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be responsible for what these children do,'' he
said. ``If they were intent on having their way with this child,
they could just as easily have taken her into the woods.''

NASCAR SAFETY RECORD NOTEWORTHY 
RISKS OF RACING PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rookie Casey Atwood was traveling 180 mph down the front stretch
at Daytona International Speedway in his Busch Grand National car
when he was tapped from behind. The car of Atwood, 18, went
sideways. Air began rushing under his car, and lifted it up. It
went airborne, landing on its roof. The car slid upside down for
about 200 yards in front of the main grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Then he hit the grass, and the car began to flip. Once, twice,
three times, four times he barrel-rolled before coming to a rest on
the roof.
</P>
<P>
   It was a frightening crash, and spectators gathered for the
season-opening NAPA Auto Parts 300 feared the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, though, climbed out of his Chevrolet Monte Carlo, waved
to the crowd and walked to a waiting ambulance. At the infield care
center, he was treated for superficial bumps and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   He raced the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Wrecks are a part of virtually every NASCAR race. That's part of
racing in close quarters at speeds approaching 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Stock-car drivers know the risks, and still don't hesitate to
climb behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought about it, you wouldn't do it,'' said Ron
Hornaday, reigning champion of the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
that comes to Texas Motor Speedway this week for a race Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the inherent danger of the sport, NASCAR's safety
record is noteworthy. Major injuries happen but are rare. In
Winston Cup, stock-car racing's top series, there hasn't been a
fatality since 1994, when Neil Bonnett wrecked at Daytona
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main focus is to protect the drivers,'' NASCAR
representative Tim Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   That's primarily done with the welded steel rollcage that
surrounds the driver. The rollcage protects drivers when cars flip
out of control, as Atwood's did.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike open-wheel cars, which are built to break upon impact to
disperse energy, stock cars are designed with crumple zones that
cave and protect the integrity of the rollcage.
</P>
<P>
   Although safety measures lessen the risks of stock-car racing,
they don't eliminate them. Most serious injuries occur when a car
crashes into a concrete wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going faster and faster, and the walls aren't getting
any softer,'' said two-time Busch Grand National Series champion
Randy LaJoie.

DRAG RACING'S RAW POWER POSES OWN HAZARDS 
RISKS OF RACING PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An amazing number of things can happen during a four-second pass
down a quarter-mile drag strip, some of it out of control of even
the most experienced or bravest professional driver.
</P>
<P>
   That's because nowhere in motorsports is the release of raw
horsepower more instantaneous and more violent than in drag
racing's premier classes _ Top Fuel and Funny Car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have many crashes in our sport, obviously, because
we're racing in a straight line,'' said Kenny Bernstein, the only
driver to have won National Hot Rod Association Top Fuel and Funny
Car championships. ``If you're going to crash at any speed, it's
bad. At 320 mph, it's of a pretty good magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern, rear-engined Top Fuel Dragster and front-engined
Funny Car are powered by nitromethane-burning, 500-cubic-inch
engines that produce 6,000 horsepower. Top Fuel cars, which weigh a
minimum of 2,100 pounds, are the quickest-accelerating vehicles on
the planet _ capable of traveling from 0 to 100 mph in 0.8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each car has its own, what I call, hiccups,'' said Bernstein,
the winner of four Funny Car titles and in his 10th season of
wheeling the Budweiser King Top Fuel car. ``In Top Fuel, if the
front wings don't work right, the car has a tendency to fly over.
The Funny Car has a problem with fire. And both have problems when
they, at speed, hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The start of a drag race _ when all that horsepower is unleashed
through the transmission and drive line to the rear end and wheels
_ is a critical moment. A loss of traction off the line _
accompanied by the wrong split-second decision by the driver with
the throttle _ can send him or her into the wall or across the lane
into the path of the competing car.
</P>
<P>
   Top Fuel cars also get into trouble when the engine or
supercharger blows and stray metal cuts into the huge rear slick
tires like shrapnel. A flat rear tire on a Top Fuel car almost
invariably sends it into the wall. The same problem can occur if
the rear wing collapses under pressure, causing a loss of downforce
and steering control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Top Fuel car looks flimsy, but it's made that way to
transfer the power to the rear tires. It can't be stiff,''
Bernstein said. ``In a crash, these cars are built to absorb a lot
of impact. They keep the driver in the shell, the cocoon, to keep
him safe. The front end is capable of folding up and tearing away,
and the rear end is made to come apart and break away from the
driver.''

<P>
   This is what you need to know about Michael Peca:
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 181-pound Buffalo Sabres captain might well be,
pound for pound, the toughest player in the NHL. And last week, he
refused to carry around the Prince of Wales Trophy, the prize that
went to the Sabres for winning the Eastern Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't grow up working as a kid to hold the conference
trophy over your head,'' Peca said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   And for just about everything you need to know about the Buffalo
Sabres, who will be at Reunion Arena on Tuesday night to start the
Stanley Cup finals with the Stars, you can find in Peca.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the hero of the Sabres is Dominik Hasek, the all-star
goalie whom Wayne Gretzky called the greatest player in the world
this season. Hasek, the two-time defending league MVP will get the
chance to square off against his old Chicago Blackhawks teammate Ed
Belfour as both fight for their first Stanley Cup championship.
Indeed, the battle of goaltenders will loom large as experts try to
dissect the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Hasek is the Sabres' poster boy, Peca is their
conscience. Peca is the work behind the flash. Peca is the
blue-collar captain. In fact, the Sabres have built a team of Pecas
_ players who are tougher than they should be, who work harder than
opponent, who continue to surprise the NHL with every game of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They're even surprising their coach a little as they find
themselves with an NHL-best 12-3 record in the postseason despite
being the seventh seed in the East at the start of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see more grit, more speed and more determination, that's the
big difference in our team,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``Last
year, I didn't think there were a lot of times when we dominated.
Throughout the playoffs \Rthis year\S, there have been periods
where we have dominated play. Last year, we survived. Now, we just
keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock has noticed the change and said his
team already has an idea of what the Sabres can do. Yes, Buffalo
finished with a 37-28-17 and 91 points _ 23 behind the Stars _ but
Hitchcock said that was due more to injuries than to lack of
talent. In the past two playoffs, the Sabres have gone 22-8,
advancing to the Eastern Conference finals last season before
bowing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got kicked really hard in Buffalo \Rduring the regular
season\S, and we left there thinking that they're basically a
younger version of ourselves,'' Hitchcock said of a 2-1 loss to the
Sabres on March 5. ``Of all the teams we played against in the
East, the two best teams, we felt, were New Jersey and Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres proved that by sweeping the second-place Ottawa
Senators in the first round of the playoffs, overcoming a groin
injury to Hasek in the second round against the Boston Bruins and
taking out the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games in the Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   While talk of Western Conference domination already has started
_ the West has swept the past three Stanley Cup finals _ Eastern
Conference coaches are warning the Stars that the Sabres are no
patsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in first place in January and then they had a lot of
injures,'' Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn said. ``I think they were
underestimated by a lot of people, but they're playing great
hockey. The Joe Juneaus, the Geoff Sandersons, they've never
finished a check in their lives. But they're doing it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Juneau and Sanderson, skilled forwards with the Capitals and
Hurricanes, respectively, were late-season adds. But while they
were asked to bring in their goal-scoring skills, they were told
they couldn't do it in a soft manner.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Stars have turned Brett Hull and Mike Modano into
tough checking forwards, the Sabres have created a crew of
aggressive forecheckers. That's paid off in the playoffs, where the
Sabres average 3.3 goals per game and have an army of players who
can put the puck in the net. Curtis Brown has seven goals, Dixon
Ward six, Vaclav Varada five and Peca and Stu Barnes four apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view Buffalo as a carbon copy of us,'' Hitchcock said.
``They do a lot of the same things we do. And for us to be
effective, we need to be able to play four lines 5-on-5 and
forecheck well.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Stars will try to follow a similar game plan
that beat the Avalanche. The Stars want to avoid penalties, get the
puck deep, work it behind the Sabres' net, and play team defense by
not letting the talented players get possession of the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of quickness, a lot of guys who can scoot
around,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``That, and they've got
a great power play. What we have to do to combat that is stay
disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   And the first part of that discipline seems to be the mental
preparation to take on a Sabres team that will paint itself a huge
underdog. Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy said he thought the
Stars-Avalanche series might have been the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up in Buffalo, they're going to be reading a lot of statements
from players that they don't have a chance,'' Modano said. ``And
I'm sure they'll be using that as motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Modano said the Stars have time to get ready for the Sabres
and their sneak attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no better team that prepares better for a game
than us and our coaches,'' Modano said. ``The way it's broken down
to minute details, there will be no overlooking anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Start with Michael Peca.

   MORINI, Albania _ The intention may be peace, but war raged as
fiercely as ever Sunday along the rugged border of Kosovo and
Albania, forcing some 1,000 people from a northern Albanian town _
many of them refugees fleeing from fighting for at least the second
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that maybe the fighting would end'' with the
declared peace agreement between NATO countries and Yugoslav
leaders, said Xhavit Ibrahim, 46, as he packed his wife, parents
and seven children into a tractor wagon to escape the shelled town
of Krume. ``But we're still waiting _ just waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Military and aid officials said the surge in fighting seemed not
so much to endanger any peace plan but was driven by a simple logic
for all three warring parties _ NATO, the Serbs and the rebel
group, the Kosovo Liberation Army. That logic: to destroy as much
as possible before a final peace agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, NATO B-52 bombers dropped what appeared to be
cluster bombs along hillside Serb positions near the border
crossing here. The bombs exploded with such force that curtains
fluttered in a cafe several hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombs fell _ along with thousands of propaganda
leaflets _ amid the roar of continued fighting between Yugoslav
soldiers and the Kosovo Liberation Army, whose members are massing
along the border waiting to enter Kosovo once Yugoslav forces
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Serbian soldiers stepped up their shelling of
Albanian border towns, dropping at least 10 shells into the town of
Krume, where hundreds of ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo have
been living. The shelling, just before midnight, prompted a mass
exodus Sunday of scared refugees to the town of Kukes, some 10
miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
   Bjoern Kuehne, head of the Krume office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors fighting along
the border, said Serbian shells had started falling now on
settlements not known to harbor any KLA fighters, such as Golaj,
Perollaj and Nikoliq, where two 14-year-old girls were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Before, he said, the shelling was contained to towns, like
Krume, where the guerrilla army is active.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much more indiscriminate than anything we ever had
before,'' Kuehne said. ``They seem to be trying to do as much
damage as possible as long as they are there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO officials warned the Serbs not to continue the
shelling, even as NATO has promised to continue its own air
campaign until there is hard evidence that Yugoslav forces are
withdrawing from Kosovo. Officials also reported looting in some
Kosovo towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, officials with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said they had no evidence that Serbian
soldiers were withdrawing from their border positions.
</P>
<P>
   But an official with the KLA, Masar Shala, said that five buses,
with mostly Serb civilians on board, left from the southern city of
Prizren toward Kosovo's capital, Pristina. Other trucks, some of
them military, left on the road toward Brezovica, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO planes appeared to strike the Kosovo border town of
Gorozhupe, which the Kosovar Albanian rebels claim to occupy in
part. The town was burning through much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The planes also dropped leaflets with a photograph of the son of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, saying in Serbian that
he was sunbathing and ``dancing in his own disco'' as regular
Serbian troops suffered in the ``dust and blood of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fighting, the number of refugees crossing from Kosovo
through this border post, where the shelling is in plain sight,
slowed to only 82 people Sunday, according to the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. The men said they had been held prisoner
and interrogated in the northern Kosovo town of Smrekovnica, near
Mitrovica. In the past two weeks, nearly 3,000 men who have said
they were held there have crossed into Albania here.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of deaths in any of the shelling in
Albania, though several houses were destroyed. But the refugees
left Krume all the same, stacking up mattresses and suitcases in
wagons as they fled for a second or third time to what they hoped
would finally be safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running just to save my life,'' said Zize Bozhdari, 74,
who was leaving Krume with her 29-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   An aid official said that some of the men leaving Krume faced
another obstacle: rebels from the KLA ``harassing'' them to join
the guerrilla force. In recent weeks, there have been several
reports of aggressive recruiting among the refugees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the fighting is expected to die down in the coming
days, many refugees express a more long-term uncertainty about
NATO's plans to send them home.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that most of the NATO and other foreign troops
entering Kosovo will do so from Macedonia, rather than from
Albania, where the border with the Serbian province is mountainous
and roads narrow and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Military and aid officials are wondering what exactly that might
mean for the orderly flow of refugees back home, where they face
dangers from land mines, booby traps and a rough life with houses
and all amenities, including water supplies, destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   One major worry is that if few NATO troops arrive in Albania,
there will be little to stop the refugees from picking up and
leaving any time they deem it safe.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials say they are planning education campaigns to
dissuade refugees from leaving early, but many worry that once NATO
is in Kosovo very little will hold people back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go alone if I know NATO is there,'' said one refugee,
Emine Berisha, 31, who left her 11-year-old daughter in Kosovo and
is worried about her safety. ``I will not wait for anyone to say,
`OK, you can go now.'''

STARS' HITCHCOCK PLANNING TO CHANGE THE PRACTICE PACE BETWEEN
GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars made a mistake by giving players too
many days off between Games 6 and 7 of the Western Conference
finals, coach Ken Hitchcock said, and they've learned a lesson from
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one mistake we made is our players were really achy
because we gave two skates off for a lot of the players,''
Hitchcock said of not skating either Wednesday or Friday. ``We
didn't get rid of \Rthe lactic acid\S, so we're going to skate at
least twice before Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have scheduled practice today and tomorrow, and
Hitchcock will probably again make Tuesday's morning skate
optional. Ironically, only three regulars participated in the
morning skater _ Mike Keane, Joe Nieuwendyk and Blake Sloan. Keane
and Nieuwendyk were two of the Stars' best players Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, whose team has been resting since
defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs in Game 5 on May 31, said he
doesn't expect the Stars to be tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into the finals, I don't think anybody is
tired,'' Ruff said. ``They're going to have three days to recover,
the excitement is going to be there. I don't think you can even use
having played a seven-game series to say that they are going to be
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will have home ice advantage because of their best
record (51-19-12) in the NHL during the regular season. The Stars
are 7-2 on home ice in the playoffs. The Sabres are 5-3 on the
road.
PICTURE PERFECT
</P>
<P>
   When Stars general manager Bob Gainey made the trade-deadline
deal that shipped Todd Harvey and Bob Errey to the New York Rangers
for Mike Keane and Brian Skrudland, Gainey knew that he was getting
playoff toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is a competitive player,'' Gainey said of Keane, who had
three goals in the Conference finals, including two in Game 7.
``When you get into a tug-of-war, like we have in this series, I
think you could use his play as a good instructional video. Not
only that he scored goals, but his shot blocking, his penalty
killing and his play along the boards. He had a terrific series,
his competiveness is clear for everyone to see.''
CENTER ICE
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said the battle of the Stanley Cup finals could
come down to a war at center ice. The Sabres' quartet of Mike Peca,
Curtis Brown, Brian Holzinger and Keith Primeau is as competitive
as the Stars have played, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as deep at center ice as any team we've seen,''
Hitchcock said. ``We never felt that we started with the puck the
last time we played them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Stars answer with a tough quartet of their own in
Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk, Guy Carbonneau and Brian Skrudland.
And Hitchcock said he will study the option of using the speedier
Tony Hrkac or Derek Plante to possibly replace Skrudland.
\Nsubheds:Special event
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said he felt best for Brett Hull after watching
the Stars celebrate the Western Conference championship Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a kid in a candy store,'' Hitchcock said. ``I've
never seen a guy with such genuine excitement in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who signed with the Stars as a free agent in the summer,
played his first two games as a rookie in the 1986 Stanley Cup
finals with the Calgary Flames. In 11 years with the St. Louis
Blues, however, he had not advanced past the second round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes you reach a mental state where you don't
believe anymore,'' Hitchcock said. ``You think you do, but in your
heart you really don't. But when this happened, I've never seen
anyone so happy in all my life.''
NOT SO BORING
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano kind of likes this role he's adjusted
to as a two-way forward. While critics have said the Stars are
boring for sapping the offensive light out of players like Modano,
he said yesterday that he's getting more and more used to defensive
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of exciting being out there killing penalties or
being out there for the last minute of the game taking faceoffs,''
Modano said. ``I think I get a lot more out of that nowadays.''
ALL'S FAIR
</P>
<P>
   During the final handshake with the Avalanche, Stars center Guy
Carbonneau made peace with Peter Forsberg and Sandis Ozolinsh _ two
of his most heated opponents in the series. Carbonneau said both
teams had yelled at each other and taken some liberties with sticks
and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I battled hard and I expect them to do the same, but
it's all in the heat of battle,'' he said. ``After the game is
over, you have respect.''
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher celebrated his 27th birthday in
Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. Stars center Mike Modano
will celebrate his 29th on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other birthdays during the finals include: Rob Ray of the Sabres
on Tuesday at Game 1, Grant Marshall of the Stars on June 9
(Wednesday) and Darryl Shannon of the Sabres on June 21.
OLD PALS
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour and Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek each
were members of the Chicago Blackhawks from 1990-92 and even played
together in the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals. That's the only finals
experience for either goalie.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only connection between the two teams. Stars
defenseman Darryl Sydor and Sabres defensemen Alexei Zhitnik each
were members of the LA Kings from 1992-95. Both were members of the
1993 Kings team that lost in the Stanley Cup finals to the Montreal
Canadiens. Ironically, Zhitnik and Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov
(Sydor's partner) also were teammates, but that was on CSKA in
Russia in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Pat Verbeek and Sabres winger Geoff Sanderson were
teammates on the Hartford Whalers 1990-95. Stars center Brian
Skrudland and Sabres defensemen Jason Woolley and Rhett Warrener
were teammates on the Florida Panthers team that lost in the 1996
Stanley Cup finals. Sabres defenseman James Patrick and Stars
defenseman Craig Ludwig were on the 1982 NCAA championship team at
the University of North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sabres winger Paul Kruse was coached by Ken
Hitchcock on the Kamloops Blazers in 1988-89 and Stars winger Grant
Marshall and Sabres center Mike Peca were teammates on the Ottawa
67s from 1991-93.

   TEXAS-LAW-REFORM (Houston) _ Over the last decade, sweeping
changes have transformed the legal system here in Texas and in many
other states. Under the banner of lawsuit reform, Texas has helped
lead the way, embracing one of the nation's most ambitious attempts
to hold down the cost of civil suits and limit the size of jury
awards. For years, Texas had a reputation as the ``lawsuit capital
of America'' because its juries in injury cases were said to be
overly generous. But starting in the late 1980s, the state began
adding restrictions, like limits on punitive damage awards, and
provisions that make it harder for injured workers to sue. Now
Texas is seen as one of the most aggressive states in efforts to
curb civil suits under the banner of ``tort reform.'' By William

A FANTASY BLUEPRINT, IF YOU DARE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wednesday night, the Los Angeles Dodgers plan to
walk out 3-year-old Rex Sjpute to sing the national anthem, which
will supposedly earn him a place in the Guinness Book of World
Records.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if Rex can actually walk the walk. Then there's the
chance day care might not wake him up from his nap in time.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's a fit end to the ``Think Blue'' week, the Dodgers'
attempt to make people forget about the other Fantasyland run by
the Disney competitors down the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you wanna drag the infield or take a drag off Kevin
Malone's cigar, the Dodgers can accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, almost.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate that the homestand isn't any longer. Otherwise,
some of the good ideas that got passed over could have been added
to this year's list of activities. Ones like:
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy clean-up crew: Stay up with the gang until 3 a.m. as
they first sweep up, then hose down, all the stands. Learn the
secret of scraping nacho cheese off the bottom of the plastic
seats. Don't tip over that cup that looks like there's still some
beer left in it. And remember to turn into lost and found all the
loose change you collect _ wink, wink.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hurry down to the dugout and pick up each sunflower seed
shell. By hand.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy organ donor: As part of Fox's move to play more recorded
music, you rent a U-Haul and take Nancy Bea Heffley's prized organ
down to Goodwill for a donation _ and a nice tax write-off for
Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy member of Kevin Brown's family: Fly in on the jet from
Georgia, have ``Dad'' show you how to bust up a locker room toilet
after he ignores the media, then let him take you on a Toys R Us
shopping spree after the game. (Two special fans get to light $100
bills on fire with Brown in a pregame ceremony).
</P>
<P>
   Smell your favorite Dodger's game-used sliding pants: No
explanation necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy official scorer: A grounder to third goes off Adrian
Beltre's glove. So call it a hit. Except that'll mean Darren
Dreifort is charged with an earned run. So now what do you do?
Experience the dilemma that faces the Dodger Stadium official
scorekeeper each night.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy sportscaster: Sit in the Dodger Stadium working press
box with Stu Nahan, who'll show you how to openly root without
getting ejected. (See: Fantasy freeloader).
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy parking-lot attendant: Direct cars to the full lot way
down the Pasadena Freeway instead of that empty one right behind
the left-field pavilion held for season-ticket holders who aren't
coming anyway. Call in the tow truck for those double-parked morons
along the beltway. And if you want, start your own ``valet
service'' and see how many actually leave their prized car with
you.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy construction worker: When the season ends, you and five
friends get to help rip out a bunch of the blue seats on the
reserve level behind home plate and build a new press box for those
overworked sports writers. (Please bring proof of health
insurance).
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy translator: Listen closely to a postgame interview as
Rick Monday quizzes Chan Ho Park about the latest grand slam he's
given up _ then do your best to let the rest of us know what the
heck was just said.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy clubhouse kid: No worry about sorting out uniforms or
scraping mud off cleats or handing out canteens of creatine. The
most important task: Learn how to forge the entire team's autograph
on a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy umpire: Forget about working that fantasy softball game.
You put on the mask and chest protector and get to work an actual
inning of an actual game. Determine the strike zone. Feel free to
use the rule book as a reference.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy freeloader: Spend the day eating with Tommy Lasorda _
breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus a late-night snack. And you'll
never see the bill!
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy footrub: While you fill out the Dodgers lineup card,
Davey Johnson files down your corns.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy Farmer John pitchman: Can you convince us as well as Vin
Scully that a shank and butt portion of a pig is really succulent?
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy concessionaire: A little kid comes up and asks how much
for that Dodgers inflatable bat. Five bucks? 150 bucks? You make up
the price as you go along.
</P>
<P>
   Just go easy if it's Rex Sjpute trying to score one of those
dope blue caps with the silver bill. He'll probably be spent from
missing his nap to sing.

   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parenthesis, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   June 7, 1982: The Dodgers' Steve Garvey is the fifth
major-leaguer to play in 1,000 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   June 8, 1968: Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale has his record
scoreless-innings streak snapped at 582/3 innings when
Philadelphia's Howie Bedell drives in Tony Taylor in the fifth
inning. (27)
</P>
<P>
   June 8, 1982: The Lakers beat the Philadelphia 76ers 114-104 at
the Forum in Game 6 of thball standout John Elway is
drafted in the 17th round by the Kansas City Royals. He decides to
pursue a football and baseball career at Stanford (and, later, to
play for the New York Yankees).
</P>
<P>
   June 9, 1985: After losing nine NBA championship series against
the Celtics, the Lakers prevail 111-100 in Game 6 of their series
to beat Boston on the Boston Garden parquet. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is
the series MVP with 29 points in the final game, James Worthy adds
28 and Magic Johnson chips in a triple-double (14 points, 14
assists, 10 rebounds). (11)
</P>
<P>
   June 9, 1982: Vin Scully's star is planted on the Hollywood Walk
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   June 9, 1973: UCLA scores in seven events and piles up 56 points
to trounce Steve Prefontaine and his Oregon teammates and capture
the NCAA track and field championship for coach Jim Bush. It's the
Bruins' third title in a row. (70)
</P>
<P>
   June 10, 1938: Hollywood Park track opens in Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   June 12, 1943: With just a four-man contingent _ sprinters Jack
Trout and Cliff Bourland, long jumper Edsel Curry and javelin
thrower Doug Miller _ USC wins its ninth straight NCAA track and
field championship. Coach Dean Cromwell didn't even make the trip
during World War II to Evanston, Ill. (73)
</P>
<P>
   June 12, 1948: At Riviera Country Club, Ben Hogan wins the U.S.
Open with a record 276. For Hogan, it's his first of four Open
titles.
</P>
<P>
   June 12, 1973: USC comes back from a 7-0 ninth-inning deficit
against Minnesota pitcher Dave Winfield, who struck out 15 at that
point, and pulls out an 8-7 win to take the College World Series.
It's USC's fourth straight CWS title under coach Rod Dedeaux and
ninth overall for the school. (67)
</P>
<P>
   June 12, 1981: The Dodgers (36-21) have a half-game lead over
Cincinnati (35-21) as major-league baseball goes on strike. That
extra win becomes important because when the season resumes, the
eventual World Champion Dodgers are declared first-half winners.
</P>
<P>
   June 13, 1973: The Dodgers start Garvey at first base in place
of Bill Buckner. It isn't any big deal at the time, but with Davey

becomes an infield that would play together for 8{ years.
</P>
<P>
   June 13, 1998: It's Dodger Stadium's first triple play _ the
Dodgers' Darren Driefort, Eric Young, Jose Vizcaino and Bobby
Bonilla do it.

<P>
   Birthdays: Today: UCLA volleyball coach Al Scates (60).
Wednesday: U.S. soccer star and Westlake Village native Eric
Wynalda (30). Sunday: Former Angels manager and L.A. native Marcel
Lachemann (58).

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The world's fourth most populous country,
freed from the grip of its longtime dictator, marked a new era of
political freedom Monday with its first free election in four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Across the 13,000 islands of this Southeast Asian archipelago,
some 130 million people cast their votes in a parliamentary
election that will start a complicated, months-long process of
choosing a new president.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the stage-managed elections of President Suharto,
who was forced to resign one year ago after 32 years in power, the
outcome of Monday's vote is utterly unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is an experiment, from the electoral laws to the
competitive campaign to the formation of coalitions to the voting
process itself, and the watchword among optimists is that Indonesia
may manage to ``muddle through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to bear with us,'' said Smita Notosusanto, who heads
a leading poll-watching group called Unfrel. ``This is our first
so-called free and fair election. We have never experienced this
before. We are like a little kid who just started their first day
in school.''
</P>
<P>
   At 300,000 polling places, from high-tech cities to remote
jungles, voters are electing 462 representatives who will join 38
military delegates to form a 500-member Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In August that Parliament will join 200 unelected members chosen
by provincial parliaments and by social and professional groups to
form an electoral assembly. Unless the timetable is shortened, the
assembly will choose the next president in November.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the parliamentary vote is only the start of a long struggle
for power in which closed-door deal making and money politics will
supplant democratic openness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesian election is really a five-month process, a
five-month continuous election day with ups and downs, with some
parts more public and some parts more private,'' said Adam Schwarz,
the author of ``A Nation in Waiting'' (1994), a political history
of modern Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   For many people here this messy process, with all its unknowns,
amounts to a battle over the soul of a future Indonesia, pitting
what are known as the forces of reform against the forces of the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The status quo is represented by Suharto's party, Golkar, which
still holds power and is fielding his former vice president, and
interim successor, B.J. Habibie, as its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The leading symbol of reform is Megawati Sukarnoputri, the
daughter of Suharto's predecessor, Sukarno. She is the candidate of
the conservative, nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party of
Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Her party seems prepared to form a coalition with the moderate
Islamic party of Abdurrahman Wahid. A secular party with a large
Islamic base, headed by Amien Rais, could emerge as a swing group.
</P>
<P>
   But around these big-name players, the country's politics, with
its 48 competing parties, swirls and surges with factions,
rivalries and hidden agendas.
</P>
<P>
   With Indonesia suddenly free to redefine itself after the
stultifying rule of Suharto, who took power after a military coup,
old struggles and suppressed conflicts are boiling to the surface,
sometimes dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them is the role of Islam, here in the world's
largest Muslim country, with a population of more than 200 million.
On the eve of the vote, Muslim preachers around the country called
on their followers to reject ``secular'' parties, notably that of
Mrs. Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   If her party manages to form a winning coalition that excludes
the less-moderate Muslim groups, it may be sowing the seeds of
future tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the military will, as always, be key in Indonesia.
Since Suharto's resignation it has agreed, under reformist
pressure, to reduce its bloc in Parliament by half and is in the
process of redefining its place in the political scene.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear which way it will throw its weight in the
post-election coalition-building. It is also unclear to what degree
it will continue to withdraw from politics, particularly at this
time of national instability.
</P>
<P>
   The new government also will face the task of building a real
democracy that goes beyond an election into the construction of
working, independent legislative and judicial branches and
nongovernmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts agree that the country's loose and
outdated Constitution must be revised. There is talk of instituting
direct presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia must also address increasingly intense questions about
the relationship between the central government in Java and the
distant, sometimes resource-rich provinces. Since Suharto departed,
separatist movements in East Timor, Aceh and Irian Jaya have become
newly demanding and violent.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins power, the question will remain as to whether the
momentum of reform that has been transforming the country in the
last year will continue or stall.
</P>
<P>
   There is still no firm legal foundation for the newly open
press, no guarantee that freed political prisoners will not be
replaced by newly arrested ones and no assurance that the many
contentious new political parties will remain free to jostle and
shout.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how differently a new power structure may behave
from the old one. The battle cry of the reformist students who
helped bring down Suharto was an end to ``corruption, collusion and
nepotism.''
</P>
<P>
   After decades of one-man rule, these are ingrained traits in the
Indonesian power structure that will not disappear simply with a
change of personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the power groups realigning themselves, the temptations
for graft for the new government will be intense,'' a Western
diplomat said. ``It will take a pretty principled group to resist
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It will also be up to the new government to decide how
vigorously to pursue the hidden billions of Suharto and whether to
put him or any of his six wealthy children on trial for their
financial abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This urgent demand of student demonstrators and other reformists
is a particular challenge for any government because of the large
number of prominent Indonesians who are tainted by their corrupt
ties to the old regime.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all the challenges and pitfalls for the country's
next leaders is Indonesia's debilitating economic collapse in the
last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is in for continued difficult times,'' said Jack
Bresnan, an expert on Indonesia at Columbia University, who is
observing the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of categories of data in which there has
been a modest upturn in the last couple of months,'' he said, ``but
a tick does not make a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many structural problems that were
unattended to last year. The destruction of the banking system is
by far the most serious. I ask myself whether Indonesia will ever
return to the level of social and economic welfare it had in
1996.''

AS SERBS HESITATE ON PEACE, NATO ISSUES WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ As Yugoslav military negotiators raised new
objections Sunday night to a NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo,
the alliance warned that it would intensify the bombing, now in its
75th day.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic agreed in principle last Thursday
to withdraw his 40,000 troops from Kosovo and to let in an
international peacekeeping force, when the Serbs approved a
two-page draft agreement. But an allied diplomat said that Yugoslav
commanders meeting with NATO officers in Macedonia were objecting
to letting in peacekeepers unless the U.N. Security Council
authorized them first, a condition that some allies view as
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air campaign will continue,'' a senior NATO official said,
as the Yugoslav officers met into the night with the British
officer who would command the international peacekeeping force, Lt.
Gen. Sir Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we don't come to a conclusion down there,'' Maj.
Gen. Walter Jertz, the spokesman for the allied military command,
said, ``the operations will be intensified.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The aircraft are in the area, the pilots are still
there and all the assets are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the bombing would not stop until the Serbs
started moving troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain why Yugoslav and Serb commanders could take
more than two days to accept withdrawal terms that Milosevic had
appeared to agree to, a senior diplomat here said, ``They were
trying to water down what they agreed to last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that allied field commanders
were refusing to negotiate the terms, which officials said require
the Serbs to shut down their anti-aircraft defenses within 48
hours, to pull all of their military, police, and paramilitary
forces out of Kosovo by designated routes within seven days, and to
let in 45,000 international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If those terms are met, the allies then expect about 1.5 million
ethnic Albanians to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to bar the peacekeeping force without express
Security Council approval strikes at the weakest link in the recent
chain of events that the allies are counting on to result in a
diplomatic and military victory.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain agree with France, Germany and
other European allies that the peacekeeping force should have the
Security Council's authorization. But they are concerned that if
approval were delayed for some reason, and if the Serbs were
withdrawing troops, NATO should be ready to move in to prevent a
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   France and most of the European allies do not see things that
way, and neither does Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats hope that Russia would be willing to approve a
Security Council resolution sending in peacekeepers whether
Milosevic wanted them or not, under Chapter Seven of the U.N.
Charter. Russia might also join the peacekeeping force on its own
terms, but Russia would certainly not approve of NATO troops
entering Kosovo without a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   So Milosevic's military negotiators have raised a thorny issue
just at the time when the foreign ministers of Russia and the seven
largest industrial democracies, the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan, are about to meet near Bonn to
discuss a draft resolution on Kosovo, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been insisting that the allies stop the bombing
before the Security Council votes, but the weekend snags appeared
to put off any pause in the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is to continue, Shea said on Sunday, ``until the Serbs accept
the detailed military agreement that has been outlined to them by
NATO commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get it right, we want to pin down all of the
detail, we want to make it watertight, and if that takes two extra
hours, it will save us many days of agony subsequently,'' Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the dispute over a resolution, the Serb commanders
are reportedly pressing NATO to keep the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army from attacking the withdrawing Serb forces.
Fighting between them continued Sunday along the border with
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz, of the allied command, said that most of the bombing runs
among the 431 missions that NATO planes flew from Saturday to early
Sunday, had targeted Serb forces battling the ethnic Albanian
rebels there. That number was more than a hundred below that of the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs know that one of the most dangerous moves for any
military force is disengagement and retreat from battle.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have long said they did not want to become the Kosovo
Liberation Army's air force, and they still insist that NATO has no
direct contact with the rebels. But for the past few weeks, allied
planes have been bombing Serb tanks and artillery positions that
were firing at the rebels along the Albanian border. NATO planes
hit 14 Serb tanks and artillery pieces at the border from Saturday
to early Sunday, the allied military command said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeepers would have to see to it that the Kosovo
Liberation Army, now believed to have between 6,000 and 10,000
fighters in the Balkans, is disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate that we are going to have a lot of trouble
with the KLA,'' Jertz said. ``The KLA want their people to go back
home to their own country, and that is one of the reasons why we
think that they will be following the guidance which they will get
from us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the allies have been surprised by the Kosovo Liberation Army
before. Last winter its leadership balked at the terms of a
proposed peace agreement during talks at Rambouillet Castle outside
Paris. At the end of the talks in February, the Albanian side
insisted that its field commanders would have to be consulted
before it could agree to the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, on March 14, the Albanian side signed an
accord that would have required all the Kosovo forces to disarm and
disband, provided that Milosevic also accepted the accord and that
NATO peacekeepers would move in to ensure that all fighting
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Milosevic refused, and the allies started bombing on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serb forces do carry out Jackson's terms, the allies seem
to be disposed still to see no problems on the Kosovo Albanian
side. Shea said, ``As the Serb forces pull out and the NATO forces
move into Kosovo, we expect the KLA to exercise restraint and not
to attempt to take advantage of the situation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Among the allies, except for the British, public opinion in
European countries is impatient to see the bombing stop. Leaders in
the United States and Britain have warned that Milosevic might be
up to his old tricks, trying to sow confusion among his enemies by
appearing to accept surrender, and then trying to renegotiate by
haggling over details.
</P>
<P>
   As allied planes continued to pound targets in at least six
areas of Kosovo on Sunday, according to Yugoslav news reports, the
allies stepped up preparations for the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 British and German soldiers arrived in Macedonia on
Saturday, joining the 15,000 mostly European troops already there
as part of the planned peacekeeping force, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said the allies had received reports of Serb shelling of
areas near Mitrovice where ethnic Albanian refugees had taken
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said they had also heard reports of ``mass
looting'' by Serb military and police forces in Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo, on Friday and Saturday. ``This gives indications
that troops may be trying to help themselves as they prepare to
leave Kosovo,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied reconnaissance also spotted a military train moving from
Urosevac, in southern Kosovo, to the north toward Serbia and heard
reports of convoys of civilian vehicles headed north, allied
spokesmen said. But they had no confirmation that this meant that
Serb forces were already pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   Although fighting had slowed down in the northern and central
parts of the province in the past few days, they said, it had not
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb forces will not halt their operations until the senior
commanders give them the order,'' Jertz said. ``Let us hope this
will happen soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also told the Yugoslav military leaders that the allies
expect all Serb forces to withdraw to Serbia, not to be transferred
to the other constituent republic of Yugoslavia, Montenegro.
</P>

   NATO wants to forestall any outbreak of fighting in Montenegro,
the one part of Yugoslavia that has been trying to come to terms
with the new Europe. The allies have warned that any Serb attack on
Montenegro would be viewed with the utmost seriousness _ just as
President George Bush warned about Kosovo a decade ago.

A SENTENCE   THAT ECHOES   AND ECHOES   THROUGH A DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This is part of an occasional series, ``Writers on Writing,''
in which American writers explore literary themes. Previous
contributors have been John Updike, E.L. Doctorow, Ed McBain, Sue
Miller, Jane Smiley, Annie Proulx and Kurt Vonnegut Jr.) (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   How do I write? Why do I write? What do I write? This is what I
am writing: I am writing ``Mr. Potter.'' It begins in this way;
this is its first sentence: ``Mr. Potter was my father, my father's
name was Mr. Potter.'' So much went into that one sentence; much
happened before I settled on those 11 words.
</P>
<P>
   Walking up and down in the little room in which I write, sitting
down and then getting up out of the chair that is in the little
room in which I write, I wanted to go to the bathroom. In the
bathroom Mr. Potter vanished from my mind; I examined the tiles on
the floor in front of me and found them ugly, worn out. I looked at
the faucet and the sink in front of me, but not too closely; I did
not examine those. I flushed the toilet and I thought: Will the
plumbing now just back up? Does the septic need pumping? Should I
call Mr. A. Aaron?
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. A. Aaron's name is not that at all. His real name is
something quite far from that. His real name is something like Mr.
Christian or Mr. Zenith, though I cannot remember exactly. He only
calls himself A. Aaron so he can be the first listing in the
telephone book under the heading ``Septic Tanks &AMP; Systems _
Cleaning.'' I come back and look at Mr. Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Potter,'' I write, and I put clothes on him, even though I
do not see him naked, for he was my father, and just now he is not
yet dead. He is a young man, and I am not yet born. Oh, I believe I
am seeing him as a little boy; as a little boy he has clothes, but
he has not shoes. I do not place him in shoes until he is _ I have
not decided when exactly I shall allow him to wear shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Then after many days of this and that and back and forth, I
wrote, with a certainty that I did not necessarily intend to last,
``Mr. Potter was my father, my father's name was Mr. Potter.'' And
Mr. Potter remained my father, and Mr. Potter remained my father's
name for a long time, even up to now.
</P>
<P>
   And then? I grew tired of that sentence and those 11 words just
sitting there all alone followed by all that blank space. I grew
sad at seeing that sentence and those 11 words just sitting there
followed by nothing, nothing and nothing again. After many days it
frightened me to see nothing but that one sentence and those 11
words and nothing, nothing and nothing again came after them. ``Say
something,'' I said to Mr. Potter. To myself I had nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking no longer to Mr. Potter, speaking no longer to myself
in regard to Mr. Potter, I got up at 5 o'clock in the morning and
at half-past 5 o'clock went running with my friend Meg and a man
named Dennis Murray; he builds houses of every kind in the city of
Bennington in the state of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is dead,'' I said to Dennis one morning as we were
just past the Mahar funeral parlor on Main Street. I never make an
effort to speak before the funeral parlor. I despise death and
consider it a humiliation and in any case much overdone and so plan
never to do it myself and plan never to have anything at all to do
with it, for it is so contagious. I have noticed that when you know
people who die, you catch it and end up dead, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is dead,'' I said to Dennis, but he could not hear
me for he was far ahead. He runs at a faster pace than I do, and he
thought I was agreeing with something he had just said about the
weekend he had just spent hiking into the woods and spending the
night and fishing with a friend whose name I cannot remember and
catching many trout and cooking them and eating them and going to
sleep in a tent while there was a great downpour of rain outside
and waking up the next morning and having the best pancakes and
fishing again and doing everything again and all of it as perfect
as it had been before and then coming home to his wife who loves
him very much.
</P>
<P>
   And the perfect narrative of Dennis' life, uninterrupted by any
feelings of approaching and then leaving behind the Mahar funeral
parlor, did not make me envious or make me grieve that Mr. Potter's
life remained frozen in the vault that was his name and the vault
of being only my father.
</P>
<P>
   The days then rapidly grew thick into all darkness with only
small spaces of light (that is autumn) and then remained solidly
all darkness with only small patches of light (that is winter), and
then the darkness slowly thinned out (that is spring), but the
light was never as overwhelming in its way as the darkness was
overwhelmingly dark in its way (that is summer). So, too, was the
night dark except for when the moon was full and the day bright
with light, except for when clouds blocked out the sun. And Mr.
Potter remained my father, and my father's name remained Mr. Potter
for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   One day when I seemed uncertain about which foot to put first,
the one in front of the other, my husband said to me, ``Mrs. S.,
Mrs. S., how are you doing?'' and ``Are you OK?'' The first letter
in his family's chosen name is S. Our children go to school every
day on a great big bus that was painted yellow and driven by a
woman named Verta. A man named Mr. Sweet came and picked up our
rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   In the American way we have much rubbish, and Mr. Sweet is hard
of hearing. Saying to him, as I feel I must if I see him, I must
say to him, ``Hallo, Mr. Sweet.'' And since he cannot hear me, he
is deaf, he looks at me and then holds his ear forward, cupping it
in the palm of his hand, as if it were a receptacle, for he wants
it to receive the sounds that I am making.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' says Mr. Sweet. ``Hallo,'' I say again, and Mr. Sweet
is then very nice and sincerely so, and he asks if I could pay him
for the eight weeks he has picked up the rubbish without being
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no,'' I say to him, and then I explain that I am not
allowed to write checks because I never put the debits and balances
in their proper columns, and I make a mess of the household
accounts. Mr. Sweet says, ``Yep, yep,'' and then Mr. Sweet says he
will see me next week. Mr. Sweet does not know about Mr. Potter,
not in the way of my writing about him, not in the way of Mr.
Potter as a real person.
</P>
<P>
   And one day, after all sorts of ups and downs and many travails
that are interesting, especially to me, Mr. Potter was driving a
motorcar and dressing in a way imitative of men who had enormous
amounts of money. And of course Mr. Potter was right to imitate the
wardrobe of men who had enormous amounts of money, for without the
existence of Mr. Potter and people like him, working very hard and
being paid a mere pittance, there can be no enormous amounts of
money. And I am Mr. Potter's daughter, so I know this.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that ``and one day'' left me bereft and exhausted and
feeling empty; and that ``and one day'' is just what I want when in
the process of encountering a certain aspect of my world.
</P>
<P>
   And then that one day, that one day after Mr. Potter's life
advanced and exploded on the page, I had to have my lunch, but I
could not eat too much of anything, not even plain green leaves. I
could only eat very small amounts of anything, for I wanted to fit
into my nice blue (tilting to lavender) silk taffeta skirt, a skirt
that has box pleats. And I so love my nice blue (tilting to
lavender) silk taffeta skirt with the box pleats and will not eat
too much of anything, even just plain green leaves, for I look very
beautiful in it. I look most beautiful in it when I am in room all
by myself, just alone with only my reflection, no one at all there
to observe me.
</P>
<P>
   In the early afternoon, just after I have eaten my lunch, I look
at Mr. Potter, in my own way, a way I am imagining, a way that is
most certainly true and real. (His name really was Roderick Potter;
he really was my father.) He cannot look back at me unless I make
him do so, and I shall never make him do so.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rings, and I do not answer it. The telephone
rings, and I do not answer it. The telephone rings, I answer it,
and on the other end is someone employed by one of my many
creditors asking me to satisfy my debt. I promise to do so in a
given time, but I have no money. I like having no money. I do not
like having no money. I only like to have contempt for people who
have a great deal of money and are unhappy even so, or are happy
with money in a way that I find contemptible.
</P>
<P>
   Driving past a sign that says ``Yield,'' driving past the house
where a dentist lives, driving past the house where the
chiropractor I see from time to time lives, swiftly I pass by a
sloping moist field that in spring is filled up with marsh
marigolds. Swiftly I go past the home for delinquent children.
Swiftly I go to await my children getting off the bus with Verta.
</P>
<P>
   My children will soon get off the school bus, the one painted a
harsh yellow, and it is driven by Verta. ``Mr. Shoul,'' I say to
myself, for I am all alone in the car having driven so swiftly.
``Mr. Shoul,'' I say, for I now can see that I have saddled Mr.
Potter with this personality, Mr. Shoul. And Mr. Shoul is a
merchant, an ordinary merchant, specializing in nothing particular;
he sells anything. Mr. Shoul sells everything. Mr. Shoul might sell
Mr. Potter; on the other hand he might draw the line at selling Mr.
Potter. And I have saddled Mr. Potter with Mr. Shoul.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Potter does not know the world. He is produced by the world,
but he is not familiar with the world. He does not know its
parameters. Mr. Potter was my father, my father's name was Mr.
Potter. My children pour out of the bus. My daughter (she is 14)
hurls an insult at my son (he is 10). His small self (the self that
is not seen) crumbles to the ground; I rush to pick his self that
is not seen but has fallen to the ground and bring it back together
again with his self that I can see.
</P>
<P>
   I look at her, my daughter. What should I do? For her selves
(one or two or three or more) are not all in one bundle, tied up
together either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Shoul,'' I say to myself, for I am at the bus stop and can
tell no one what I am really thinking. ``Mr. Shoul,'' I say. What
to tell Mr. Potter about Mr. Shoul, where to begin?
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Shoul!'' I shout at Mr. Potter, but Mr. Potter cannot hear
me. I have left him at home on the page, the white page, the clean
white page, all alone with Mr. Shoul. ``Mr. Shoul,'' I will write,
``Mr. Shoul,'' I will tell Mr. Potter, ``Mr. Shoul comes from
Lebanon.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Connecting directly with its fans is what the
Women's National Basketball Association wants to be all about, and
with its official league Web site (http://www.wnba.com) it
continues to fulfill its mission statement.
</P>
<P>
   For a pro league that will likely be slighted by most mainstream
media, the redesigned site constructed and maintained by ESPN
Internet Ventures takes advantage of its interactive elements by
including a chat and mailbox area to e-mail players and teams, as
well as a sign-up for weekly e-mail from the league. The Sparks'
Ukari Figgs has the weekly e-mail responses up now.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the first time an audio season pass, which, for $8,
gives you access to every game's radio feed through RealAudio. A
game of the week will be broadcast free.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a link to the Los Angeles Sparks' official site
(www.wnba.com/sparks).
</P>
<P>
   _Responding to suggestions that it let people know when its
games are on TV, the United States Soccer Federation site
(http://www.us-soccer.com) offers a program where it'll send you an
e-mail reminder two weeks before a telecast and then two to three
days before. Register for the ``Turn Us On'' program on the site,
which should come in handy when the Women's World Cup begins June
19.

3 NEIGHBORS, 3 VIEWS OF THE WAR IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end of NATO's war on Yugoslavia seems to be in sight, but
among a group of Americans who discussed the news, there is little
exultation.
</P>
<P>
   Dilia Theodosakia, a retired secretary who long ago abandoned
her initial support for the bombing, sees no winners, only losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all criminals in their own way, not just Milosevic,''
she said, lumping in the leaders of NATO countries with Slobodan
Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia. ``They are all responsible
for escalating suffering. The Albanians in Kosovo had problems
before, but once the bombing started the killing got worse and the
Serbs suffered terribly, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mrs. Theodosakia, Martha McCauley has remained steadfast
in her belief that only military force could stop Yugoslav violence
against the Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO cause is just, she said, but the bill will be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the refugees go back, and their houses are all gone, what
will we do?'' said Mrs. McCauley, a retired IBM employee and busy
grandmother. ``Who is going to pay for the rebuilding of that
country? I think Milosevic and Yugoslavia should pay for that. It's
their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the NATO bombing campaign against the
Yugoslavs, Mrs. Theodosakia, Mrs. McCauley and several of their
neighbors in White Plains, N.Y., which is in Westchester County not
far from New York City, have been asked regularly to discuss their
impressions and opinions about the war.
</P>
<P>
   None has relatives or friends in the military. So without a
personal stake in the conflict, they have been paying less and less
attention to what has been happening in Yugoslavia. They all
expressed relief that the Yugoslav leadership appears to have
accepted NATO's terms for ending the bombing, but they are
skeptical about whether NATO's aims have been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Theodosakia, who describes herself as a conservative, has
come full circle in her views about the war.
</P>
<P>
   At first mistrustful of President Clinton's motives, she came to
rally to the NATO cause, believing it a moral mission to save the
Kosovo Albanians. Then, as civilian casualties mounted in the NATO
bombing, so did her sympathies for the Yugoslavs as victims of
equal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Theodosakia, who at age 57 is about to start a new
career as a nutritionist, is once again deeply suspicious of the
motivations of NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every war, there's something behind it _ politics or
selfishness on somebody's part _ and yet civilians are the ones who
suffer,'' she said. ``I'd really like to know the truth, why they
were doing this just in Yugoslavia when there are people suffering
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   From reading several newspapers, listening to radio talk shows
and having discussions with relatives, Mrs. Theodosakia said she
had reached her own conclusions about what the situation in Kosovo
was before the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a holocaust in the making, as portrayed by President
Clinton, but a conflict between the Yugoslav government and the
Kosovo Albanian separatists, ``who used force and terror because
they wanted a piece of the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did not resolve that conflict by bombing. ``What did they
accomplish?'' she continued. ``What I say is this: Send the leaders
to war. Let them feel the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clark, an employee of the Westchester County Board of
Elections, tuned out weeks ago to the war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just fed up with it,'' he said, after hearing that a peace
accord had been reached. ``We have exhausted our stay over there,
as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a trim 58-year-old, served in Vietnam as a Marine and
that experience still marks his views. He looks with a skeptic's
eye at any war, no matter how noble-sounding its goals, and
recalled his own war days as a time when he ``saw kids dying like
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   During the more than two months of the Kosovo war, he has had
very little patience with what he sees as the bombast of military
commanders, and a great deal of faith in the old adage that truth
is the first casualty of war.
</P>
<P>
   So when NATO missiles began occasionally to go astray, killing
Yugoslav civilians and in some cases Kosovo Albanians, Clark
considered his natural cynicism well founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many civilian casualties,'' he said.
``Friendly fire _ I told you that was going to happen. Once you go
to war, even if you have all these high-tech weapons, as long as
you're human, you're going to have errors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the NATO bombing, Clark paid close
attention to the war news, almost in spite of himself. ``In the
beginning I was interested,'' he acknowledged. ``But after it got
so prolonged, I just wasn't interested anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way he could explain his indifference was, again, to
reach back to his own memories as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what the outcome was going to be before it happened,''
Clark said. ``I knew no one would really win. I knew innocent
people were going to die. Been there. Done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCauley's interest, on the other hand, never flagged. An
avid reader before the war, she added an extra daily newspaper to
her morning regime to stay informed.
</P>
<P>
   At 69, she is old enough to remember her father serving in the
Army in World War II. Moved and angered by the Serbs' expulsion of
Kosovo Albanians, she saw the NATO war against Yugoslavia as an
echo of her father's good fight. And while the casualties and the
destruction wrought by NATO bombs saddened her, they never dented
her pride that the United States ``helps people''
</P>
<P>
   So was it worth it? she was asked after Yugoslavia accepted
NATO's terms for ending the bombing last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCauley did not like that question. ``It was war,'' she
said, ``and you never think of anything as being worth war. But I
just don't think Milosevic would have done anything without this
war. He would have just gone on with his ethnic cleansing.''

CISCO AND MOTOROLA AGREE TO BUY WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Canada, Texas)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to deliver high-speed Internet links without wires, Cisco
Systems Inc. and Motorola Inc. plan to announce Monday that they
have agreed to acquire a subsidiary of the Robert Bosch Corp. of
Germany that is developing advanced wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco and Motorola do not plan to disclose terms of the
agreement, but executives close to the deal said the price would be
substantially less than $1 billion. That would be in line with
other recent acquisitions by Cisco, which has made a string of
deals but none for more than $265 million since 1996, when Cisco
acquired Stratacom Inc. for $4.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, the No. 1 maker of data networking equipment, and
Motorola, a big maker of cellular phones and equipment, plan to buy
a Bosch unit based in Richardson, Texas, that has between 100 and
200 employees. The unit is trying to make products to transmit
large amounts of data between stationary fixed antennas using a
wireless technology called local multipoint distribution services.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest battlegrounds in the communications industry
has become the battle to offer high-capacity data links to
consumers and small and medium-sized business customers. The AT&AMP;T
Corp. has bet more than $90 billion that it can offer advanced
communications packages using cable television systems, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   The Baby Bell local phone carriers, MCI Worldcom &UR;  &LR; and others are
focused on so-called digital subscriber lines, a new technology
that increases the data capacity of normal phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The dark horse technology in this race has been wireless.
Wireless mobile telephones have become popular, but no company has
yet succeeded in broadly and profitably delivering torrents of
Internet data using wireless links _ whether mobile or stationary.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bosch deal, Motorola and Cisco want to make high-speed,
stationary wireless data delivery possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really strengthens our position in high-speed Internet
access,'' said Donald J. Listwin, a Cisco executive vice president.
Referring to digital subscriber line technology, he added: ``We
have leading technology in cable. We have leading technology in
DSL, and we have leading technology in the fixed-wireless space. We
have leadership in high-speed access, which is the future of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring the Bosch unit, Cisco and Motorola intend to form a
new company called Spectrapoint Wireless. Motorola will own 81
percent of Spectrapoint while Cisco will own 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco began developing technology in cooperation with Bosch
about a year ago, but found that potential customers wanted not
only technology, but also financing and help in deploying wireless
equipment. Partly to address those needs, Cisco turned to Motorola
and in February Cisco and Motorola announced plans to jointly spend
$1 billion for a period of up to five years to develop wireless
products.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge to Spectrapoint in the United States could be in
finding customers. (Cisco's first wireless customer is in Canada.)
Teligent Inc. and Winstar Communications Inc. were the first two
U.S. companies to attempt to broadly deliver voice, video and data
services using stationary, or fixed, wireless technology. But
Teligent has committed to use mostly wireless equipment from the
Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada while Winstar is working closely
with Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Potential new customers, including Nextlink Communications Inc.,
which is backed by Craig O. McCaw, the cellular phone pioneer, are
on the horizon, however.

HOT CAKES TAKE THE EARLY-MORNING CHILL OFF A PAPER BOY'S ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent trip to Europe re-established the fact that storks
deliver babies to French, German and Dutch families.
</P>
<P>
   What we mainly have in our neighborhood are crows. And they
deliver newspapers, not babies. At 4 in the morning there is no
newspaper on the doorstep. But just about dawn, when the crows
begin to stir, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer arrives with a
mysterious thunk.
</P>
<P>
   There is no other explanation. If we are on a motor route, we'd
hear a car or truck engine, right?
</P>
<P>
   I prowled what we called Skid Row in Great Falls, Mont., on my
paper route. Can you imagine parents today sending their kids into
the roughest part of town at 5 in the morning? No, you can't. But I
supplied the morning papers on Skid Row and what I got from the
residents in return were smiles, waves and an occasional invitation
to partake of a free hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, that is not completely true. One ancient
hotel on the route was dark, creaky and contained only one Tribune
subscriber. After a month I determined that his room fronted on the
street. And he usually left his third-floor window open. After
three or four unsuccessful tosses, I usually was able to throw the
rolled-up paper through the window. Until the morning when my
three-point shot produced a roaring growl and the specter of a
hairy head protruding from the open window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey kid,'' he yelled. ``That newspaper lands right on my bed.
You've given me like maybe seven heart attacks in the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   I apologized and resigned myself to dark, creaky walks up the
hotel stairs. That wasn't all bad. As rundown as they might be,
hotels offered some respite from subzero temperatures during a
Montana winter.
</P>
<P>
   The offer for a free hamburger came from the fry cook at an
all-night eatery. I declined with thanks because, to tell the
truth, I had to hold my breath when I delivered to that address.
The hash house smelled like 40 years of fried grease, which was
exactly the history of that establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I invariably finished my paper route with a two-bit
stack of hot cakes at a slightly more hygienic diner on the fringe
of Skid Row. They tasted almost as good as these.
</P>
<P>
   Paper-route Pancakes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One and one-half cups milk
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons melted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely chopped apple
</P>
<P>
   Mixture of half-cup cup sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   Mix all the dry ingredients except the last two. Stir in the
milk. Beat the eggs and dump them in, too, along with the melted
butter and the apples. Mix just until everything has been
incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot griddle brown the pancakes on both sides. When ready to
serve, top with a dollop of butter, sprinkle with the mixture of
sugar and cinnamon and serve with a slice of low-fat ham on the
side.
</P>
<P>
   I understand paper boys (and girls) are an endangered species.
However, if you are serving these hot cakes to a famished delivery
kid, throw in a free cup of cocoa. Well, don't throw it. Carry it
to him. Up the stairs and down the hall, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The kindly chef in the Skid Row hash house could have used this
recipe for his early-morning customers. It doesn't require any
grease to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   Skid Row Souffle
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs (or egg substitute)
</P>
<P>
   half-cup Bisquick
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup sour cream (non-fat is OK)
</P>
<P>
   One and one-half cups milk
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   one-half teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces ham, cubed
</P>
<P>
   Beat the eggs, add the Bisquick, sour cream, milk and
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the ham into small cubes.
</P>
<P>
   Spray the bottom and sides of two individual oven dishes with
oil. Scatter the ham cubes over the bottoms of the dishes. Pour in
the egg mixture and bake in a 350-degree oven for about 35 minutes,
or until a toothpick stuck in the middle comes out clean.
</P>
<P>
   You can substitute small pieces of smoked salmon or smoked
chicken in place of the ham. You can also top each ramekin with
grated cheddar cheese before baking, but the dish doesn't really
need it.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you cook too many hot cakes in the first recipe,
give the leftovers to the crows. Otherwise they are liable to drop
your newspaper in the middle of your bed at 5:30 a.m. and give you,
like, a heart attack.

   PELPLIN, POLAND _ Visiting a part of his homeland that was
annexed into the German Reich during World War II, John Paul II
reminded Poles Sunday that Christian martyrdom continued well into
this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred and three pastors were taken from the land of
Pelplin, and at the cost of their lives heroically testified to the
message of hope in the dramatic period of war and occupation,'' the
pope told 300,000 people gathered on a hill outside the small town
of Pelplin. ``If today we remember these martyred priests, it is
because it was from their lips that our generation heard the word
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope, who arrived in nearby Gdansk on Saturday
for a 13-day visit to his homeland, is tending to his Polish flock
10 years after the fall of Communism and is also underlining the
themes of his papacy as he prepares to usher the Roman Catholic
Church into the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   His persistent theme of reconciliation and a new evangelization
are the core of his message. But as a Pole who studied for the
priesthood underground during the Nazi occupation and witnessed the
deportation of priests and of his own university professors, he has
long sought to remind the world of the persecution of Catholics
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The region around Pelplin was particularly hard-hit: 46 percent
of its priests died in concentration camps, the highest rate in
Poland. Next Sunday, the pope is planning to beatify 108 Catholics
who were killed by the Nazis and who have been declared martyrs for
their faith.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's focus on Catholic suffering has angered many Jewish
groups, which complain that the Vatican is seeking to
``Christianize'' the Holocaust and to deflect attention from the
many instances of Catholic collaboration with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has sought throughout his papacy to reconcile Jews and
Christians. He visited Auschwitz on his first papal visit to Poland
20 years ago. Last year, the church issued a long-awaited document
on the Shoah, a public act of contrition for some Catholics'
failure to resist the Nazi persecution of Jews. But many Jewish
organizations maintain that his legacy is still mixed.
</P>
<P>
   While in Warsaw, the pope will pay his respects to the Jews who
perished in extermination camps during the war by praying at a
newly erected monument to the victims of the Holocaust in central
Warsaw. Shortly before his arrival, the Polish government removed
the hundreds of crosses that had been erected at Auschwitz by
Catholic militants, in defiance of the Polish bishops and the
Vatican; the crosses had long been a source of conflict between
Jews and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The pope evoked World War II and its aftermath more than once
Sunday. He also held an evening prayer service in Elblag, a small
town near the border with Russia. Among the 200,000 people who came
to see him were Roman Catholics from Lithuania and also from Russia
_ mostly from Kaliningrad, which was German for 700 years, was
absorbed by the Soviet Union after the war and remains, edgily, a
part of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a small delegation of Russian Orthodox believers.
The pope has sought to mend the schism between the Roman
Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, but Patriarch Alesky II of
Russia has so far resisted rapprochement. When the pope welcomed
the Orthodox visitors by name, the crowd applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all dreaming of the day when the pope can come to
Russia and set foot on Red Square,'' Bishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz,
the apostolic administrator of Moscow, said before the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, basking in a warm sun and the applause and cheers of
fellow Poles, the pope also dwelled on happier memories. He
departed from his prepared text toward the end of both appearances.
At one point in Elblag, he playfully told the crowd that was
shouting ``Niech zyje papiez!'' or ``Long live the pope!'' that
their chant reminded him of a time when a follower mistakenly cried
out, ``eupiez,'' which in Polish rhymes with ``papiez,'' but which
is actually the word for dandruff.
</P>
<P>
   He grew nostalgic in Pelplin, where he long ago kayaked in the
Brda River. ``I adore the beauty of this region,'' he told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience could remember seeing the pope when he was
a vigorous outdoorsman. Sunday, they could not help but notice how
age and illness have taken their toll. Though his mood was often
ebullient and he spoke clearly, his body was stooped and his left
hand trembled uncontrollably _ a symptom that may be caused by
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop of Pelplin, Jan Bernard Szlaga, made a rare public
mention of the pope's suffering. ``The faithful came here to be
together with you, Holy Father, who have been bearing a cross every
day,'' he said.

`BRIDGET JONES' STRIKES A UNIVERSAL CHORD, SURPRISING WRITER A
BIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Helen Fielding, best-selling British author, was
ensconced on a couch in the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel in Seattle,
chatting amiably about her comic creation, Bridget Jones, the
desperately single thirty-something who is an international
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   And Fielding was the very picture of relaxed confidence, in
stark contrast to the mass insecurities and foibles that bedevil
her heroine. Until the writer's hand happened to toy with the top
of her black crew-neck sweater.
</P>
<P>
   And what should Fielding discover as her fingers ran along the
sweater's front neckline but the tags of the manufacturer. Yes, she
had her sweater on backward. And yes, this was the day after she
had appeared on American television wearing a T-shirt that she
later discovered had been inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget Jones,'' Fielding finally conceded Friday, ``does
reflect a part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   And a part of millions of other women around the globe, as
Fielding has discovered firsthand while promoting the paperback
release of her book. ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' (Penguin, 271 pages,
$12.95) has become a beloved compatriot of single women everywhere
who fight daily, often losing, battles with their weight, their
habits, their aloneness and their self images.
</P>
<P>
   As Bridget catalogs in one of the daily entries in her diary:
``123 lbs., thigh circumference 18 inches (honestly, what is bloody
point), alcohol units 0, cigarettes 25 (excellent, considering),
negative thoughts: approx. 445 per hour, positive thoughts 0.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielding has met women who claim to be ``just like Bridget'' in
Britain, America, Sweden, France, Italy and Japan. And Fielding has
met women who claim to be ``just like Bridget'' despite being women
of considerable accomplishment and social aplomb, television
anchors, attorneys, teachers, artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that women who have achieved a huge amount
are still haunted by images of perfection,'' Fielding observed.
``We are all expecting to look like swimsuit models who have been
airbrushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Bridget muses: ``I am a child of `Cosmopolitan' culture,
have been traumatized by supermodels and too many quizzes and know
that neither my personality nor my body is up to it if left to its
own devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielding's book, at first glance, might seem merely a Xerox copy
of a year in a single woman's real life with its acutely observed
minutiae, the useless pantyhose crumpled in drawers, the late-night
snacks devoured amid guilt pangs, the annoying ``Smug Marrieds''
who think nothing of inquiring, ``How's your love life?''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' is actually a careful literary
construct, exaggerated for effect, laced with high-octane irony and
zeroing in on painful life truths amid the host of hilarious
one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   As Bridget observes, ``When someone leaves you, apart from
missing them, apart from the fact that the whole little world
you've created collapses, and that everything you see or do reminds
you of them, the worst is the thought that they tried you out and,
in the end, the whole sum of parts adds up to you got stamped
REJECT by the one you love.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Jones began life as the subject of an unsigned weekly
column in a London newspaper, which started slowly and built a
loyal following over three years. Fielding's modest goal was for
every column to have two or three lines to make her laugh out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing,'' the former Oxford University student
recalled, ``was not so much making it funny as battling fears that
it was such light fare that I often wondered: Why would anyone want
to read this?''
</P>
<P>
   Any such thoughts now seem eons away. The 40-year-old Fielding
has been subject of a media frenzy (from writing Amazon.com's
``favorite book of 1998'' to being named one of People magazine's
``most intriguing'' newcomers). She has gone on to become a Bridget
Jones Factory.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding has turned reported millionaire on the strength of the
book's million-plus sales, an upcoming film version (which she also
wrote) and a much-delayed book sequel in which the quirky, yet
resilient ``singleton'' heroine finds herself confronting the
challenges of actually being in a relationship with a man and later
perhaps even in (although still uncertain now) a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Jones' life may be an open book, but not Fielding's. The
former BBC journalist is a charming interview subject who instantly
turns insistent whenever asked personal questions. She declines to
confirm her age, declines to provide details of her social life
(other than to say she is still ``not married''), declines to pose
for any more newspaper photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to keep a fence around my life,'' Fielding explained.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding had long dreamed about being a writer, had dreamed
about having a best seller, had dreamed even of being interviewed
on TV about her book. All that has now happened, and more, which
makes every morning feel like Christmas for Fielding except there
still remains an undercurrent of disbelief and wariness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I can't believe this happened _ that it was my book
and that so many people liked it,'' Fielding said. ``It has been a
wonderful thing to have happened, but very strange.''

CHARISMATIC `WILL BE FINE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Charismatic got on the road to recovery _ and a
future at stud _ in a white-and-blue horse ambulance that backed up
to within 30 feet of his Belmont Park stall late Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   With two of trainer D. Wayne Lukas' assistants guiding him, with
a pained expression about his eyes, Charismatic walked haltingly
into the van, which flashed its yellow roof light as it made the
slow five-minute drive along tree-lined lanes to the Belmont Equine
Surgical Clinic at the corner of Affirmed Road and Secretariat
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted there by a man in green surgical garb and another who
sponged off the three hooves that weren't encased in a plastic
``air cast,'' Charismatic took a few more ginger steps up a short
incline and through double doors to the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 2{ hours, Dr. Stephen Selway inserted four screws in
the left front cannon bone, one of two bones Charismatic fractured
as he finished third in the Belmont Stakes while chasing a Triple
Crown on Saturday in a race won by 29-1 shot Lemon Drop Kid.
</P>
<P>
   After the surgery, Selway said the injury ``was not the worst of
this kind I've ever seen, but it was a nasty one. He'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Selway said Charismatic's left leg was fitted with a cast, and
if he is shipped by airplane, he should be ready to travel in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas left no doubt the 3-year-old colt, a son of 1990 Preakness
winner Summer Squall and a great-grandson of Secretariat, would be
retired to a lucrative career in the breeding shed. Owners Bob and
Beverly Lewis have made no announcement about his destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not thinking about (racing),'' Lukas said. ``He wouldn't
come back at the same level as what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   So ends an unusual career for Charismatic, who was purchased
privately as a yearling for $200,000 and went on to earn $2,038,064
by winning 5 of 17 races. Along the way, he won twice in his first
13 starts, the second victory coming by disqualification in a
$62,500 claiming race at Santa Anita, before blossoming to win the
Kentucky Derby (at 31-1) and Preakness (at 8-1) during a hot
stretch of five races in nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was thriving on the way he was raced,'' said Dr. Larry
Bramlage, acting as spokesman for the American Association of
Equine Practitioners, trying to deflect speculation the heavy
schedule led to the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Charismatic became evident when he bobbled while
running third a couple of strides from the end of the 1{-mile
Belmont and jockey Chris Antley pulled him to a stop yards past the
wire. The disappointment of the record crowd of 85,818 at not
seeing a Triple Crown winner turned to hushed concern for the colt.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries were not unusual for racehorses, although Bramlage
said serious injuries are not as common as the 1990s' spate of
breakdowns in major televised events might lead some to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Bramlage said a study at Kentucky racetracks concluded that the
incidence of injury serious enough to require an ambulance is about
1 in 1,000 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was asked what he'd say to people who were upset by what
they saw Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to animal-rights ``purists,'' Lukas said: ``These
horses are probably getting more care than their own children. They
get more upset when a horse like this gets hurt, or when we have a
Go for Wand (break down in the 1990 Breeders' Cup Distaff), than
when a guy hits the wall at Indy and he's killed. You can only
educate them that we're doing all we can.''

HBO'S `THE SOPRANOS': WHERE `GOODFELLAS' MEETS `THE SIMPSONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Few television series manage to hit a high note
consistently without getting a hernia.
</P>
<P>
   Even the long-running ``Law &AMP; Order,'' which routinely delivers
taut, believable drama, checks in with the occasional clunker.
(Case in point: This season's May-sweeps publicity grabber
featuring Julia Roberts.) And the recently canceled ``Homicide:
Life on the Street,'' possibly the best dramatic TV series of the
`90s, was straining a bit as it struggled to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, there's just no telling where a quality show might end
up after a promising first season. For me, ``Ally McBeal'' quickly
went south in its sophomore year, while ``The Practice,'' now three
seasons old, seems to get better and better, with richly drawn
characters who defy David E. Kelley's penchant for silliness.
</P>
<P>
   So, take this with a dash of caution, but in the glee club of
life there may never be anything quite like ``The Sopranos.'' Many
critics already consider it the best thing since individually
wrapped cheese slices. But, since it airs on HBO, the audience is
limited to those with enough discretionary income to afford extra
cellophane with their cheese and extra lines on their cable bill.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have HBO and you don't have a
friend/relative/neighbor who has HBO and you're just waiting for a
legitimate reason to have HBO, ``The Sopranos'' is probably it.
Shoot, the performance of James Gandolfini alone is worth the cost
of subscribing.
</P>
<P>
   Gandolfini plays the fleshy, flashy Tony Soprano: husband,
father, mob boss. And not always in that order, which is what makes
``The Sopranos'' so special. It's about a wise-guy crime figure
who's got the same middle-class problems that none of us bothered
to read in the fine print of the American Dream contract.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Tony is probably upper middle class, though it's hard
to quantify because most of his assets weren't earned the Dean
Witter way.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Tony Soprano is a fascinating specimen worthy of
further research, and HBO this week graciously begins a reprise of
the first season of ``The Sopranos'' (9 p.m. Wednesdays, 12:30 a.m.
Saturdays).
</P>
<P>
   Launched in January and played out over 13 weeks of winter, the
continuing story arc of the Soprano family _ make that families _
was as irresistible as a shot of hot fudge on anything. Think of
``Goodfellas'' meeting ``The Simpsons.'' Violent, funny, profane,
funny, poignant, funny.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, Tony's problems are eminently relatable: His
wife is restless, his teenage daughter is insolent, his son is a
chip off the old delinquent. And then there's his other family. He
and his uncle are in a power struggle for control of organized
crime in northern New Jersey, one of his lower-echelon gofers
(Michael Imperioli) an inveterate idiot, and his mother _ widow of
the recently deceased head of the family _ is, well, a real mother.
</P>
<P>
   If Nancy Marchand doesn't win an Emmy Award as the mother of all
mob madres, we may have to convene a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' is the creation of David Chase, whose writing
resume includes such noteworthy fare as ``Northern Exposure'' and
``I'll Fly Away.'' If the first 13 weeks of his latest project are
any indicator, Chase has nothing to worry about in the area of
future employment. But let's hope he doesn't kill off too many of
the Sopranos prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Fabulous characterization is what makes ``The Sopranos'' work,
and there's so much more to know about Tony's wife, Carmela (Edie
Falco), and his uncle, Junior (Dominic Chianese). And let's not
forget his psychiatrist, Jennifer Melfi, played with exquisite
understatement by Lorraine Bracco. (Billy Crystal played a
mobster's analyst for laughs in ``Analyze This''; Bracco plays it
for keeps.)
</P>
<P>
   There's still no telling if the second season of ``The
Sopranos,'' due in January, will be spectacular or hopelessly
off-key, but for the next three months anyway, it's reason to sing
the praises of HBO.

SERB REFUGEES LOOK BACK IN BITTERNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ For five years they have lived, four
adults in a single room, in this drab compound of makeshift huts on
the outskirts of Belgrade. The Sehovac family, Serbs who fled
Sarajevo in 1994, are sunk in a world of depression and bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Sehovac, 21, is in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the chest
down since a bullet shattered his spine when he was 16. He is a
hulking man now, spilling out of his battered wheelchair, but his
muscles are flabby. His father, Kosta Sehovac, bare-chested in the
heat of a Sunday afternoon, slumps by the table, a sullen anger in
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our misery as refugees,'' he says, gesturing around
the cramped room lined with bunk beds. There is a table, a chair, a
refrigerator and a television set. In Sarajevo, they had an
apartment, a house and a car. Even the garage had central heating,
Sehovac said. ``We lived well before the war,'' he said. ``Now
there is no way back.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they have a bathroom of their own. Others in the
compound, invalids among them, have to share three toilets among 20
families.
</P>
<P>
   Nevenka Sehovac, Kosta's wife and Goran's mother, is the
family's only breadwinner. She works in the central market in
Belgrade, where she sells cheap T-shirts and shorts. She has a soft
face and tearful eyes, but her jaw is set hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any better. Every day is more difficult,'' she
says, standing by her stall. ``I can buy food with my earnings, but
milk is almost a luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sehovac family is part of a huge dispossessed community in
Serbia. There are half a million Serb refugees from the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia, and 177,000 in Belgrade alone, according to the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. undersecretary general and the
emergency relief coordinator, who met with some of the refugees
during a recent visit to Serbia, described their living conditions
as ``subhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been joined by 11,500 refugees from Kosovo, most of
them Roma, or gypsies, and ethnic Serbs, who have fled Kosovo over
the two months of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees live all over the country in disused army barracks,
workers' camps, holiday homes and hotels. They are stateless, with
no citizenship, no valid passports, no vote and few rights. If they
work, they do so illegally, ``on the black,'' as they call it.
</P>
<P>
   Kosta Sehovac is unemployed, his wife explained. ``There are no
jobs for the people here, let alone for refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government, enduring a failing economy hit by years
of war and sanctions, helps the refugees by providing some free
food, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   And now government officials and local aid organizations are
bracing for a new wave of refugees: Serbs from Kosovo. Many are
expected to flee as NATO takes control and Albanians return to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   If Albanians come back in large numbers, NATO forces may be
unable to control revenge killings, aid officials warn. That in
turn could precipitate a wave of new refugees, on a scale similar
to the exodus of Serbs from Krajina in 1995. Then 170,000 Serbs
fled their homes in two days. Many of them arrived in Belgrade in
tractors and horse-drawn carts and today still occupy most of the
public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At Krnjaca, there are already two families of refugees from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Mrdalj is a refugee twice over. He fled with his wife and
tiny daughter from Krajina, a part of Croatia where Serbs were
living, in 1995. They were given a room in a disused military
barracks in Urosevac in Kosovo where they lived for four years.
Then when NATO began bombing, they fled once again, with few
belongings, and came to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has left Kosovo because his 6-year-old daughter needs
hospital treatment. His own expectations were zero. ``There is no
future here,'' he said looking around at refugees sitting slumped
outside their rooms in the afternoon sun. ``They are more or less
all unemployed and without money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is also without prospects,'' he said. ``No one knows
which is better.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kosta Sehovac has no doubts in his mind. Unemployed for five
years, sitting at home looking after his disabled son while his
wife works every day in the market, he does not try to hide his
frustration. He says he fought for two months near his home village
before his son was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was two months in the trenches; we were like cattle, and for
what?'' he said. ``I feel so sorry for the Serb people who are
still down there'' in Kosovo. ``But maybe it is better to stay
there and get killed. I think it would have been better for me to
stay behind and get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   His words hang in the room. His younger son walks out of the
room and goes outdoors without a word.
</P>
<P>
   In a room across the compound, Marija Bardak, 41, jokes with her
neighbors, sitting beneath a clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bardak, mother of three, says she is finally leaving after
six years in Krnjaca and going home to Republika Srpska where she
has managed to reclaim her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She had no advice for the Serbs in Kosovo, she said. ``My wish
was never to leave my house. People do not understand what it is,
to have to leave your home. It is like someone cuts off your legs,
it is like losing some part of you,'' she said. ``But when you have
children, you have to leave.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If family and friends had taken a poll when Christian
Leigh Curry joined the Wall Street powerhouse Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in the summer of 1997, they might well have voted him black
banker most likely to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Born to a wealthy New York family, Curry was raised to blend
fluidly into social and business elites. He attended several of
America's best schools. His striking good looks and incandescent
smile smoothed his way with the black and white women he dated. He
devoted himself equally to basketball, classical piano, the study
of finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt that Christian would be more Morgan Stanley
than 95 percent of the people at Morgan Stanley,'' said Dr. William
Curry, Curry's father. ``I mean his dress, his writing, his
education. No one was better prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not work out that way. Just nine months after joining the
firm, Morgan Stanley abruptly fired him. He struck back with a big
discrimination suit, claiming that racism and homophobia run
rampant at one of the finance industry's most admired firms. Both
Morgan Stanley and Curry found themselves in legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Christian Curry? The answer is still somewhat
obscure. But his own gaffes and indiscretions are part of the
story. The strapping 6-foot-2 25-year-old posed nude in sexually
revealing shots for a fashion photographer a few years ago, and has
watched helplessly ever since as photos of him found their way into
gay pornographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   He also fell into a trap set by police last year, when they
arrested him for conspiring to break into Morgan Stanley's computer
system. Charges were eventually dropped, but the question still
dogs him: Is he a victim or a rogue _ or a little of both?
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain. Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street
firms will not soon forget his name. The firm responded
aggressively to Curry's threat of a lawsuit and is now under
criminal investigation for a payment it made to an informant
involved in a police sting operation against Curry. Morgan Stanley
also suspended two in-house lawyers who orchestrated its handling
of the Curry case.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began a year ago, when Morgan Stanley dismissed
Curry, who had worked for nine months as an analyst in the firm's
real estate finance department. Morgan Stanley said he abused his
expense account. But his dismissal came just days after an issue of
Playguy, a gay pornographic magazine, hit the newsstands with a
beaming Curry on the cover and an eight-page photo spread inside.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, police arrested Curry in a small park on
East 43rd Street, where he had handed $200 to an undercover police
officer posing as a computer hacker. He was charged with five
felony counts, including conspiracy and trespassing. His idea,
police said, was to plant fake e-mail messages to buttress a
planned discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Curry denies the police account and maintains that he was
framed. True or not, the Manhattan district attorney announced last
month that he would not be prosecuted. The office cited Morgan
Stanley's $10,000 payment to a police informant and college
acquaintance of Curry named Charles Joseph Luethke, without whom
police could not have arranged the sting operation. Both Morgan
Stanley and Luethke are under investigation in connection with the
$10,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, Benedict P. Morelli, Curry has filed an
attention-grabbing $1.35 billion lawsuit. But his real mission
seems to be to show that his own ``mistakes'' _ the nude
photographs, the e-mail scam, his liaison with Luethke _ are
relatively minor, compared with Morgan Stanley's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The firm not only tolerates a virulent strain of racism and
homophobia, he said, but also has no qualms about trying to destroy
the life of an employee who fails to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not Jesus,'' he said. ``But under no circumstances should
I have been crushed like this.'' Morgan Stanley declined to comment
in detail for this article. But it says that Curry's claims of
discrimination and intimidation are without merit.
</P>
<P>
   Curry's parents saw to it that their son became seamlessly
integrated. He attended elite private preparatory schools. At
Columbia University, he was the only black member of his
fraternity, Kappa Delta Rho, a haven for basketball players on
114th Street near Columbia. He was on the varsity basketball squad.
He played classical piano seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I can tell you about Christian Curry is that this is
not a guy who plays the race card,'' says Daryl Conti, who
supervised Curry's fraternity as a student dean. ``I think in many
ways he's more comfortable with whites than blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would his family, in all likelihood, encourage him think in
black and white terms. William Curry Sr. is a surgeon at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Wealthy and well connected, he
lives in a Adirondacks Lodge-style mansion atop a high hill in
Chappaqua, N.Y. He counts David Dinkins, the former New York mayor,
among his patients and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The family spends summers in Sag Harbor, a haven for wealthy
blacks on the Eastern tip of Long Island. When the nearby
Shinnecock Hills Country Club, one of the most exclusive in the New
York region, faced pressure to open it doors for the first time to
blacks in 1992, it turned first to the Curry family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Christian had a temper he could not always control.
After matches on the family tennis court, he sometimes smashed his
racket in frustration. He was once suspended from junior high
school after cursing at a teacher for assigning him a bad grade.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles followed him to high school. Both he and his elder
brother, William Jr., who is now a surgical resident at
Massachusetts General Hospital, attended the Lawrenceville School,
an elite boarding school near Princeton, N.J. Curry, unlike the
brother whom he refers to as ``the son with the Midas touch,'' did
not thrive there.
</P>
<P>
   He attended between 1987 and 1989, then pulled out and attended
Horace Greeley High School, a public school in Chappaqua. He
returned to Lawrenceville a year later but left again, this time
for disciplinary reasons, people familiar with his record there
said. Lawrenceville lists him as ``withdrawn.'' (He eventually
received his high school degree from Northfield Mount Hermon, a
Massachusetts prep school.)
</P>
<P>
   But it was shortly after Curry arrived at Columbia that he made
what he calls ``my first really stupid mistake.'' His father agrees
with that assessment, saying that Christian Curry let his good
looks go to his head. ``So many people told him he was a beautiful
male, his ego just started working overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dating a woman with connections in the modeling world, Curry
decided that he needed a portfolio. As Curry explains it, a
photographer offered to waive his usual $1,000 fee if Curry would
agree to take off his clothes and pose in playful, provocative
positions. Curry seems not to have thought twice about the matter,
even signing a consent form that relinquished control over the
photos.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Curry did take modeling seriously, in part to gain
some independence from his parents' money. He appeared in ads for
Hugo Boss and Gucci and did runway shows at Fashion Cafe in
Manhattan. He earned enough to buy himself a green BMW 325i
convertible.
</P>
<P>
   But that Curry had made an error was clear even before he
graduated from Columbia. The photo series he had posed for showed
up in a pornographic magazine called Black Inches, which soon came
to the attention of house mates at Kappa Delta Rho. Friends said he
had a falling out with some fraternity brothers, several of whom
smashed the windows of his BMW.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those pictures, I let down my friends, my frat brothers,
and my family,'' Curry said. Then, quoting Pat Riley, coach of the
N BA's Miami Heat, he said, ``You can't unscramble scrambled
eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   The job at Morgan Stanley seemed like a fresh start. The firm
had recruited him heavily, and he arrived with a burst of
exuberance. But things went wrong early on. Curry got the feeling
that many people at the firm, even when they appeared friendly,
were trying to squeeze him into a racial straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some vice president would walk by a white guy's cubicle and
say, ``Hey, Chris, how are you?'' Curry says. ``Then they would
come by mine and say'' _ Curry does his best imitation of street
talk baritone _ ``Yo, Christian, wah s'up, dude. Y'all goin'
ballin' tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Curry says he threw himself into the job. He had no
vacation days in nine months. Work many days began at 9 a.m. and
ended near midnight. All-night sessions churning out paperwork for
real estate deals were common.
</P>
<P>
   Some Morgan Stanley bankers who spoke on the condition of
anonymity remember it differently. Several said Curry sometimes
skipped out early, brought friends to the office during hectic work
sessions, and never seemed to thrive in the obsessive,
all-consuming investment banking culture that some compare to army
boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   Work relations clearly grew tense. Curry blames it on racism.
Some accusations are detailed in his 25-page lawsuit, which named
11 Morgan Stanley executives as defendants. Among the accusations
is that one of his bosses, Robert Weaver, excluded him from a team
of bankers making a presentation to the Mid-America Realty Co.
because white executives there were not accustomed to seeing black
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   At a Christmas party, Curry also said he was asked to put on a
curly wig and a large pair of false lips in order to poke fun at a
senior black executive at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   When Curry revealed his upper-class roots, he said, white bosses
lashed out at him. He recalls one day wearing a necktie bearing the
logo of Shinnecock Hills to work. A banker spotted it and told him:
``That's a very exclusive club. Are you a caddy there?''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Curry said his banking group excluded him
from a deal-closing celebration at the upscale Manhattan restaurant
Le Cirque. That was despite the fact that it was Curry who made a
reservation and arranged payment for the dinner when the Morgan
Stanley name was not enough to secure a table on a busy night.
</P>
<P>
   Curry was a college friend of Mauro Maccioni, a member of the
family that owns Le Cirque. Maccioni confirms Curry's account.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley declined to respond to specific allegations in
the lawsuit except to say that it has reviewed the charges and
considers them baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his accusations of racism, Curry says he feels certain
he would still be at Morgan Stanley were it not for the June 1998
issue of Playguy. The magazine was widely available at newsstands
around Times Square, near Morgan Stanley's neon-wrapped skyscraper.
Within hours, copies were circulating around the office. Someone
ripped a page from the magazine and stuck it in the men's bathroom
with ``faggot'' scrawled on it, Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit cites Curry's dismissal, which came shortly after
the magazine appeared, as evidence of discrimination based on
perceived sexual orientation, which is illegal in New York. Curry
denies he is gay, but says that his colleagues at Morgan Stanley
thought he was.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley reiterated that he was dismissed for expense
account abuses. A person close to the firm cited some specific
violations, including bills from upscale Manhattan strip clubs like
Flash Dancers. Curry once bought compact discs and submitted the
expense as a work dinner, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Curry admits that he was warned about expenses once. But he said
that he has evidence that his violations were minor and routine and
that he looks forward to exposing his former colleagues' expense
accounts in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just pray that that's their defense,'' Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was shortly after his departure from Morgan Stanley that
Curry got himself in trouble again. He said he was furious, even
inconsolable, about losing his job. Though he drove cross-country
to Los Angeles to start anew, he soon returned to New York with the
idea of filing a discrimination suit.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Curry reconnected with an old friend, Charles Joseph
Luethke, the middleman who would soon bring grief to both Curry and
Morgan Stanley. The two had met in 1994. Luethke, who at 29 is four
years older than Curry, was a part-time student at Columbia who
often regaled people there with tales of heroism in the Delta
Force, the U.S. Army commando unit.
</P>
<P>
   Curry has repeatedly called him a bum. Still, Luethke became a
regular visitor to Curry's room at Kappa Delta Rho. The two later
had a falling out and lost touch. They reconnected when Luethke
approached Curry after his dismissal. What they said remains in
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said that Luethke claimed to have access to some
anti-black and anti-gay e-mail messages from Morgan Stanley's
computer system. Luethke said that it was Curry who brainstormed
about ways of shoring up his lawsuit. Whatever the truth, Curry
says he was duped. ``Like a fool, I fell for it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Luethke recorded one of their scheming
sessions on tape. In mid-July, he took copies of the tape to the
police and to Morgan Stanley. The New York Police Department,
working closely with both Morgan Stanley and Luethke, then set up
the sting operation against Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Curry claims he was framed, arguing that he intended only to
retrieve messages that were already on the firm's computers.
Lawyers close to the investigation say otherwise _ that the
tape-recorded evidence clearly shows that Curry conspired to plant
the e-mail messages. The district attorney's office has not
released the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It was Morgan Stanley's own blunder that rescued him. Shortly
after Curry's arrest, the firm secretly paid $10,000 it thought
would benefit Luethke. The district attorney's office, which said
it belatedly learned of the payment, said it diminished the chances
of winning a conviction of Curry in a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even after his arrest, Curry did not sever his ties to
Luethke, the man who betrayed him. In September, Marissa Wheeler,
Curry's fiancee, filed harassment charges against Luethke. But
Curry nonetheless continued a clumsy dialogue with his antagonist,
who was an occasional drinking buddy.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Curry said, was that for a second time he could not
resist Luethke's entreaties. Luethke once again claimed to have
evidence, that would bolster Curry's lawsuit _ this time showing
how Morgan Stanley conspired to put him in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several complaints in the lawsuit are derived from
Luethke's view of events. These include allegations that Morgan
Stanley colluded with police to entrap Curry, including offering
police detectives jobs if they agreed to stage the sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit's assertion that Philip J. Purcell, Morgan Stanley's
chairman and chief executive, had a direct role in Curry's arrest
is also a contention held by Luethke and denied by Purcell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, so I'm an idiot,'' Curry says when asked about recent
contacts with Luethke. But he adds, a bit half-heartedly, ``This
should really be about Morgan Stanley, not about me.''

MEETING SPAWNS THOUGHTS ON FUTURE OF MCI WORLDCOM  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as legal concerns began to percolate last
Wednesday about whether MCI Worldcom Inc. misled investors as it
negotiated its deal to buy Skytel Communications, the company
convened its first meeting for analysts and investors in more than
two years.
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed in the telecommunications industry in two
years that MCI Worldcom, the No. 2 long-distance carrier behind
AT&AMP;T, did not even exist in 1997. Back then, an acquisition of MCI
may not have even been a gleam in the eye of Bernard J. Ebbers,
formerly chairman of Worldcom and now chief executive of the
combined company, which was formed when Worldcom acquired MCI.
</P>
<P>
   So the four-hour series of presentations last week in Manhattan
offered a useful update on a company that continues to grow far
faster than AT&AMP;T, even if AT&AMP;T has recently gotten more headlines
through its move into cable television.
</P>
<P>
   And even if MCI Worldcom seemed to try hard not to make any news
at the meeting, at least three salient points emerged:
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T-MCI RIVALRY IN DECLINE
</P>
<P>
   Ever since William G. McGowan took over MCI three decades ago,
the company has defined itself as anti-AT&AMP;T. With AT&AMP;T starting off
with 100 percent of the long-distance market, and MCI angling for a
share, the two companies focused on many of the same corporate and
residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last year, their strategies have significantly
diverged. AT&AMP;T, fearful that the Bell local phone giants could soon
ransack its stronghold in the consumer long-distance market, has
agreed to spend more than $90 billion to become a cable television
powerhouse. Thus, AT&AMP;T hopes to counterattack the Bells in local
arenas.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, by now, is far less dependent on residential
customers, and so it has not had to respond to the Bell threat as
has AT&AMP;T. As MCI discussed its investment plans at the meeting, the
focus was not on household telephone service but on Internet and
overseas expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Before acquiring MCI, Worldcom served hardly any residential
customers, and none of the top former Worldcom executives seem
particularly enthusiastic about consumer markets now. They have
that luxury largely because they have Uunet, the No. 1 Internet
service provider, which mostly serves businesses and other Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is far behind Uunet. According to Boardwatch magazine, a
trade publication, MCI Worldcom has 2,952 backbone Internet
connections to AT&AMP;T's 382.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is beefing up its business-services unit, and MCI Worldcom
may one day propose a broad plan to offer communications bundles to
consumers. But for now the two giants seem to be focusing most of
their attention in separate directions.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T CALL IT A TAKEOVER
</P>
<P>
   The polite word for what Worldcom did with MCI is ``merge,'' but
the real term is ``takeover.'' It is obvious that except for the
sales and marketing operation (which is, to be sure, the unit that
brings in business), former Worldcom executives are running the
show and setting the strategic direction.
</P>
<P>
   After Ebbers opened Wednesday's conference, he was followed by
three more Worldcom veterans: Scott D. Sullivan, chief financial
officer; John W. Sidgmore, vice chairman and Internet czar, and Ron
Beaumont, executive vice president for operations and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent rumors that Timothy F. Price, MCI's legendary
marketing chief, is not getting along with his Worldcom brethren,
no friction was obvious on Wednesday. In the somewhat tribal
culture of the old MCI, Price generated more loyalty than perhaps
any other MCI executive after the now-deceased McGowan.
</P>
<P>
   And it may speak to Price's value that he is the most senior MCI
executive who still appears publicly engaged in running the
combined company. Price and two of his subordinates gave
presentations at the meeting. So did Fred M. Briggs, the chief
technology officer, who came from MCI and reports to Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   But Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's former chairman, who is now
chairman of the combined company, was not even at Wednesday's
meeting. Perhaps even more telling, his absence did not seem to
surprise anyone in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINT SPECULATION ABOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   In comments made in the aisles and corridors, it became clear
that at least some analysts and investors believe that MCI Worldcom
ought to wind up acquiring the Sprint Corp., the No. 3
long-distance carrier. ``I've already built it into my model,'' an
analyst joked.
</P>
<P>
   There would be two main benefits to such a deal. First, Sprint
would give MCI Worldcom a nationwide wireless phone network. (MCI
has no cellular business.) Second, Sullivan and his financial
engineers could surely wring billions in costs from a combined MCI
Worldcom-Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies do not appear to be in negotiations. But based
on some aisle discussions Wednesday, it is clear that top MCI
Worldcom executives have thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   They fear, though, that regulators would balk on antitrust
grounds at the prospect of the top four long-distance carriers of a
couple of years ago _ AT&AMP;T, MCI, Sprint and Worldcom _ becoming
only two. But once the Bells jump into the long-distance market,
those regulatory concerns may ease.

AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS DRAWING MIXED-RACE SUPPORT

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ It was just an Election Day spat between a drunk
who was harassing voters and a cranky fruit-juice seller, but it
encapsulated the split in the ``colored'' vote, the crucial bloc in
the Western Cape province, which contains lovely, touristy Cape
Town, its vast suffering townships and dozens of fishing and
farming villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're voting ANC?'' shouted the drunken New National Party
supporter. ``The ANC's going to throw you out of your house and put
a black man in it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aah, go back to work for the white man,'' retorted the juice
seller, a supporter of the African National Congress. ``He threw
you out here in these bushes with all this sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument, conducted in Afrikaans, took place in Mitchell's
Plain, home to 800,000 descendants of a fabled colored, or mixed
race, neighborhood in Cape Town that was bulldozed in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Results still trickling in from last Wednesday's elections show
that the mixed-race voters of the Western Cape are no longer a
bulwark of the Afrikaner-dominated New National Party, formerly the
National Party. One startling outcome of the election is how well
the African National Congress fared in all nine of South Africa's
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The Nats, as they are commonly known here, got 53 percent of the
Western Cape vote in South Africa's first free elections in 1994
and ruled the province. This time, they got only 39 percent, while
the ANC climbed to 42 percent from 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Voting patterns are still being analyzed, and no figures are yet
final, but it's obvious that the congress, which preaches
multiracialism but gets almost all its votes from black South
Africans, picked up support from the mixed-race people who mostly
speak Afrikaans. In 1994, those of mixed race tended to vote for
the National Party, which created apartheid, apparently reasoning
that while white government treated them badly, black government
would treat them worse.
</P>
<P>
   In Western Cape, the switch in mixed-race votes seems to have
been sufficient to drain away the National Party's majority.
Elsewhere, too, the African National Congress fared spectacularly
well.
</P>
<P>
   It got 85 percent of the vote in Mpumalanga, which contains
Kruger Park, up from 81 percent, even though local government is
riddled with scandal and its popular premier was ousted by the
central party.
</P>
<P>
   It got 67 percent in Gauteng, which contains both Johannesburg
and Pretoria, up from 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It got 65 percent in the Northern Cape, a large, desolate area
with a few rich diamond mines, up from 50 percent. (The Nats had
boasted that they would win there, and polls had predicted a dead
heat; they faded to 24 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   More important, in the two provinces the congress failed to win
in 1994, the Western Cape and KwaZulu/Natal, it did well enough to
force everyone to seek coalition rule.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the African National Congress lost KwaZulu/Natal to the
Inkatha Freedom Party. Inkatha had 50 percent of the vote to the
ANC's 32 percent. This year, the ANC got 39 percent while Inkatha's
lead was whittled to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said it appeared that Inkatha, the Zulu
nationalist party dominated by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, had hung
onto its rural supporters, who generally vote as their chiefs
instruct. But it lost ground in districts bordering Xhosa territory
and in cities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, urban whites were drawn by Inkatha's conservative
stance, support or free enterprise over what was seen as ANC
socialism and a certain respect for Zulus among the British who
fought a bitter war with them in 1870s. However, some of
Buthelezi's chief white supporters have since quit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite peace talks that had cooled the political killings for
which the province was famous, KwaZulu/Natal was poorly run and
Inkatha itself was riven by infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Several Sunday newspapers, quoting anonymous sources in the
African National Congress, reported Sunday that a grand deal was in
the works under which Buthelezi would be offered the deputy
president's job, the same one president-elect Thabo Mbeki held
under President Nelson Mandela. In return, the reports said, the
congress would get to name KwaZulu/Natal's premier, the equivalent
of governor.
</P>
<P>
   Joint government ``will help stability,'' said Shaun MacKay, a
political analyst at the Center for Policy Studies, a think tank.
``The violence will settle down more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Cape, the Nats had assumed they would hang on to
their lead. A pillar of the Nats' national campaign, besides their
demand for the return of the death penalty, was their claim that
the Western Cape was the country's best-run province.
</P>
<P>
   They said that 80 percent of 12th graders graduated, as opposed
to a national average of 50 percent; that crime was lower except in
neighborhoods where drug gangs and Muslim vigilantes were battling
and that tourism was up. In reply, their opponents pointed out that
they had a head start _ most working class and poor people in the
Cape are mixed race, and the old government always treated them
slightly better.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to push either the African National Congress or the
New National Party over 50 percent resides in the Democratic Party,
which got 12 percent of the vote. That party, once a small white
liberal voice, quadrupled its support this year, mostly from
Afrikaners.
</P>
<P>
   Hennie Bester, its provincial leader, was talking with the Nats
and refusing to form a coalition with the ANC, saying, ``We're
suspicious of too much power being in any one hand.''
</P>
<P>
   District results suggest that the mixed-race vote deserted the
Nats in droves, voting ANC in areas where white farmers still
oppress farm workers, and voting Democratic Party in cities where
black government is in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of a monolithic `colored vote' bothers me,''
said Sipho Maseko, an analyst from the University of the Western
Cape. ``The colored community now votes any party that meets its
interests.''

 &HT;    Labonte fuels 'em at Dover
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Bobby Labonte topped off a remarkable weekend at
Dover International Speedway on Sunday by winning the gas mileage
war and, consequently, the MBNA Platinum 400.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was running sixth when he made a pit stop under caution
to top off his fuel on lap 293 of the 400-lap event. The only
contender to pit at the time, Labonte fell to eighth after getting
gas, but it proved to be a decisive stop.
</P>
<P>
   He was still running strong the final 107 miles, and when race
leader Jeff Gordon pitted for a 2.34-second splash of gas with six
laps to go, Labonte cruised to the front for his first victory of
the season, by 22.071 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin was a distant third. Labonte's teammate, Tony
Stewart, turned in another strong performance by leading for 127
laps and had the third fourth-place finish in his last four races.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, the pole-sitter, led only five times for 44 laps,
including the final six. ``But I led the most important ones,'' he
said. ``The first one, the middle one and the last. I really don't
care about the rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Jimmy Makar made the critical call, bringing Labonte
in twice during the six-lap caution period (laps 290-295) after
Kenny Wallace smacked into the backstretch wall in the No. 55
Chevrolet. The last time was for the fuel top-off.
</P>
<P>
   The extra gas enabled Labonte to stay out on the track when
Martin had to pit for fuel with 12 laps to go and Gordon pulled in
with six remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're wrong, you're looking for a rock to hide under,''
Makar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good top five car, that was obvious, and we could
have come in with everybody else and finish in the top five,''
Makar said. ``Sometimes you just get a hunch and you decide, well,
we're here to win the race, we're not here to just finish. We took
a small gamble, it wasn't a huge gamble. It was something we
thought we could do and capitalize on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never look at them gauges, anyway,'' Labonte joked. ``Right
there, I had to look at that. It was down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, rebounding from three finishes of 31st or worse in the
last five races, may have had the strongest car at the end. But
communication problems with crew chief Ray Evernham frustrated his
decision to pit for fuel or not to pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the heat of the moment, you don't know exactly
what the strategy is,'' Gordon said. ``I was having a lot of
trouble with the radio. Ray told me to ease up. I thought he meant
to ease up to stretch it.
</P>
<P>
   We pretty much knew 18 (Labonte) could go all the way. We were
just going to hope for a caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a driver, you just want to just stretch it. But when you
look at all the numbers, we couldn't have made it. I would have
looked like an idiot if I had tried to make it and run out of
gas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bum radio connection made it all the more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray was having to talk and my spotter was have to relay it to
me,'' Gordon said. ``I asked several times, `can we make it, can we
make it?'
</P>
<P>
   I kept getting this total fuzz and the radio breaking up. I kept
going a little bit further. Finally, Ray said something and the
spotter relayed to me, no we can not.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin seemed frustrated in trying to explain fuel efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you don't understand racing,'' Martin said to a reporter.
``If you can't run that many laps, then you can't run that many
laps whether it's 108 or whatever it was. If you can only run 100,
and it's 108 to go. There's no gambling to it. Man, you're eight
miles short. That's the way it is. Bobby Labonte could run that
far. And we could run a couple laps less than Jeff Gordon, and Jeff
Gordon couldn't make it. It wasn't close.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Labonte's first win of the season, though he'd put
together two seconds and four thirds. And he was chagrined that he
could win on a day his car wasn't the best while he's lost some
with a better machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd had been second on the race track, if we'd had a
better car, we might not have been able to win,'' Labonte said.
``We wouldn't have pitted if we were running second or third.
Instead, we were sixth or seventh on that restart and decided to
come in.''

U.S. MAY AGREE TO BRIEF EXTENSION FOR YUGOSLAV WITHDRAWAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States might be willing to agree to a
brief extension in the timetable for the withdrawal of Yugoslav
forces from Kosovo as part of a peace deal with Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic, military officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated that Washington
would consider a Yugoslav request made in the ongoing talks with
NATO to take 10 days to pull out their troops, rather than the
seven demanded by NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials stressed that the NATO bombing campaign would
continue until there was concrete evidence that Yugoslav forces
were moving north out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on ABC's ``This Week'' news program on Sunday, Cohen
said the ``time frame'' requested by the Yugoslavs was ``not
significant.'' Yet he cautioned that ``what we have to be concerned
about is, no slow rolling here. We're not going to allow a kind of
deliberate policy of delaying day by day.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same show, Shelton agreed that the three-day extension
requested by the Yugoslavs might be so insignificant that NATO
could accept it. ``But we in fact want to make sure that the extra
time is for a good reason. We want to get the Kosovars back in as
soon as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements came as the United States and its NATO allies
were scrambling to prepare for a postwar period that seemed to be
nearing much more quickly than they had anticipated. Even though
talks between NATO and Yugoslav military leaders at the
Macedonia-Kosovo border dragged on and seemed to turn sour on
Sunday, American and allied officials acknowledged that the shape
of NATO's involvement in a postwar Kosovo _ and its relationship
with Milosevic and his government _ remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   With the military plans stalled, NATO bombing of Yugoslav forces
in the field in Kosovo continued Sunday. The Pentagon said
warplanes hit an anti-aircraft site, 14 armored personnel carriers,
13 artillery pieces, a battalion-size staging area, five mortars
and several fixed positions, including ammunition dumps and
early-warning radar sites.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign, which had shown such little promise of
achieving NATO's goals in its first few weeks, became far more
successful once the Yugoslav army was forced to come out into the
open to fight the Kosovo Liberation Army, Shelton and other
officials said Sunday. By cooperating with NATO's air armada, the
KLA in effect acted as the ground force that NATO itself had been
reluctant to insert into the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Yugoslav forces massed to do battle with the KLA,
``that requires you to come out of hiding, move your tanks out and
get your artillery in position,'' Shelton noted. ``Whenever that
happens, needless to say, they make better targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and Cohen also echoed the sentiments of European
leaders, who again Sunday called for the prosecution of Milosevic
for war crimes. Milosevic is now indicted as a war criminal.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that Yugoslavia had
no future with Milosevic at the helm. ``It must be in the interests
of people in Serbia to have him go,'' he told BBC Television's
David Frost.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana agreed. ``It's not NATO's
aim to depose Milosevic, it never has been, but I think all
citizens of good faith, not only in Europe but all over the world,
would like Milosevic to give up power in Serbia,'' he told the
Spanish television station Telecinco.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached with the Yugoslav government, however,
does not give Kosovo independence from Yugoslavia, but autonomy
with a civil administration _ even under a Milosevic-led
government. That leaves the KLA short of its goal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the peace agreement also requires the KLA to
lay down at least some of its arms, and NATO officials have not yet
explained how they plan to accomplish that. Several rebel leaders
have said they do not trust the peace agreement or the Serbs'
compliance with it, and some have suggested that the guerrillas
will not disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton was careful to note Sunday that the peace deal would not
require NATO forces to disarm the KLA, but only to ``demilitarize''
the rebel force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said that we're going to disarm the KLA,'' Shelton
said. He added that demilitarization means ``no longer having
organized units, getting rid of the uniforms, the heavy weapons,
things of this type. To our knowledge today, they (the KLA) still
intend to comply with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia's role in a Kosovo peacekeeping mission also
remained unclear Sunday. Russia, Yugoslavia's most important ally,
played a critical role in forcing Milosevic to accept a deal, but
Washington is now resisting Moscow's efforts to play a peacekeeping
role in Kosovo independent of NATO control. Cohen insisted Sunday
that the Russians would have to serve under a NATO-led command.
``Ultimately, NATO has to be in charge,'' Cohen noted.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton conceded Sunday that the situation was in such an
uncertain state that it was almost impossible to tell what kind of
conditions the NATO peacekeeping force will face inside Kosovo.
``Given the type of environment that they are going into, the
hazards will abound,'' Shelton said on CNN's ``Late Edition.

AGASSI MAKES HISTORY IN WINNING FIRST FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Andre Agassi played the first two sets of the most
important match of his life like a petrified pretender Sunday.
Then, when the shock and embarrassment failed to destroy him, he
gathered his wits about him and played like someone who deserved to
be in the company of Rod Laver, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson and Don
Budge.
</P>
<P>
   By capturing the French Open singles title with a 1-6, 2-6, 6-4,
6-3, 6-4 victory over Andre Medvedev, Agassi became the fifth man
in tennis history to win all four Grand Slam events and completed
the latest and most significant turnaround in a career marked by
occasional flashes of brilliance amid unfilled promise.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 1 in the world for 30 weeks in 1995, Agassi went into
a spiral that saw his ranking fall as low as 141st in November
1997. He took a 70-day hiatus that year, during which he married
the actress Brooke Shields, and began to resurrect his career,
returning to the top 10 last year.
</P>
<P>
   His personal life hit a bump in March, when his marriage to
Shields ended. But after his victory Sunday, his tennis ranking
will rise from No. 14 to No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost feels like it was just sheer destiny,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   But this was destiny abetted by will and mobility. When he puts
his mind to it, there are few hurdles in tennis that the
29-year-old Agassi, a professional since 1986, cannot clear.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first Grand Slam tournament at Wimbledon in 1992,
even though he has never had the serve-and-volley power game that
that tournament favors. When he won the 1994 U.S. Open, he was
unseeded. And he collected his third Grand Slam title, at the 1995
Australian Open, on his first visit there.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi is the only man to win the four Grand Slam events on
three different surfaces. When Laver, Perry, Emerson and Budge
captured the tournaments, the French Open was played on the clay of
Roland Garros and the other three were played on grass. Now the
Australian and U.S. Opens are on hardcourts while Wimbledon remains
on grass.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent Sunday, the No. 100-ranked Medvedev of the Ukraine,
was the lowest-ranked man to play for the French Open championship.
He played the most inspired tennis of his life to gain his first
Grand Slam final, defeating second-seeded Pete Sampras along the
way, but ultimately gave way to a force beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm human,'' Medvedev said. ``I left my heart and soul on the
court, I played 110 percent of my human abilities. But you have to
remember on the other side of the net is Andre Agassi.''
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev added: ``When we went to the third set, he wasn't yet
the greatest player of our decade. Now he has an argument to be the
best player. He's making the history; he has the right to say now
that he's a greater player than, let's say, Pete, by winning all
four Grand Slams.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the 29-year-old Steffi Graf's comeback victory over Martina
Hingis in the women's final on Saturday, Sunday's theatrics by
Agassi, a loser in French Open finals in 1990 and 1991, seemed the
stuff of fairy tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a proven war dog,'' Agassi said after extricating himself
from a two-sets-to-none deficit for the third time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Although I could have lived with it, losing would
have been devastating to me. The truth of it is that anything can
happen if you keep working, but you also fear the worst. That's the
nature of competition. There's always battles in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Apprehensive but optimistic, that was the Agassi who strutted
onto center court and, dwarfed by the 6-foot-4-inch Medvedev and
the power tennis clinic he conducted, lost the first set in 19
minutes and surrendered the second 33 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   With flashbacks of his failed voyages in his first three Grand
Slam finals, two of them in Paris, forcing him onward, Agassi
buckled down. Spurred by some terse advice from his coach, Brad
Gilbert, during a 20-minute rain delay after the first game of the
second set that interrupted the final, he stopped playing out of
panic and began pacing himself like a pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pulling triggers I shouldn't have pulled in some
cases,'' Agassi said. ``He assured me that he felt shot for shot I
was better, if I would just work hard, hustle, move my feet, and
strike the ball effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   While his fans exhorted him with the wave, Agassi finally began
to make inroads on Medvedev's serve in the third set. He broke him
with a forehand line drive for 4-2 and then, with rain sprinkling
the court, immediately gave back the break with a love game. After
double-faulting to break point at 4-4, he held for 5-4 and broke
Medvedev at love for the set with a perfectly timed backhand drop
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Greedy about maintaining his momentum, Agassi broke for a 2-0
lead in the fourth set and never let Medvedev back into it. By the
final set it was the 24-year-old Ukrainian who was doubting himself
and rushing his shots. Agassi, a veteran of some 30 five-setters,
closed in like a bloodhound and broke for a 3-2 lead. Medvedev
saved 3 match points, the first of them with his 23rd and final ace
of the 2 hour 55 minute match, when he served at 3-5. But when
Agassi secured a fourth match point as he served at 5-4, Medvedev
sailed a forehand return long.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi immediately dropped his racquet as if it had burned him
and mouthed, ``I won,'' in the direction of Gilbert and Gil Reyes,
the fitness trainer and spiritual guru Agassi has called a best
friend for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   From somewhere in the stands, a French fan shouted, ``The king
is back!'' And then Agassi, whose honed-down physique has earned
him the nickname Rock from his entourage, ascended the podium to
receive his fourth career Grand Slam trophy from Laver, the man
known as the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed I would see this day,'' said Agassi. ``This
was the greatest thing I could ever do, but I certainly have a lot
more belief that if I can do it here, I can do it again in a few
other places.''

SHUTTLE LANDS AFTER CREW REPAIRS SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Seven astronauts were getting their earth
legs back on Sunday after an unusual night space-shuttle landing
capped their 10-day mission to stock the new international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   For only the 11th time in 94 flights, a shuttle swooped out of a
star-filled sky to land. The black-bellied spaceship was visible
only seconds before its wheels touched pavement at 2:03 a.m., but
it announced its presence four minutes earlier with a pair of sonic
booms that rousted sleepers, rattled windows and activated car
alarms in and around Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness was no challenge for Discovery's commander, Kent
Rominger, who found the space center's marsh-bound 15,000-foot
runway bathed in bright xenon light as he glided the shuttle to a
touchdown after 153 orbits.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle, with a crew of four men and three women from the
United States, Canada and Russia, spent six days docked at the
space station. Astronauts unloaded two tons of supplies for the
first permanent occupants, due next year.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the station, the crew fixed a communications system,
replaced defective battery packs and installed foam mufflers around
noisy fans. Outside, two astronauts made a seven-hour 55-minute
space walk, the second-longest space walk in the shuttle program to
mount American and Russian construction cranes.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the astronauts released a 19-inch mirrored
educational satellite called Starshine. It is designed to twinkle
from space so student volunteers can track its motion to learn
principles of physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a flawless mission,'' NASA administrator Daniel
Goldin told reporters on the shuttle runway.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts skipped a traditional walk around the shuttle on
the runway, bypassed a microphone set up for a statement and
departed about two hours after touchdown in their crew transport
vehicle _ a modified airport people-mover equipped like an
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   The flight director, Linda Ham, and other NASA officials at
Mission Control in Houston referred questions about the astronauts'
health to public affairs officers at Kennedy, who said they had no
information, but added that the astronauts would appear at a news
conference at Kennedy on Monday morning before returning to their
training base in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Robert Cabana, deputy director of flight crew operations
at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said that the ``crew is in
great spirits and doing fine'' and had decided to forgo the walk.

IN CITY'S BALLET'S FOOTSTEPS, STUDENTS EXHIBIT THE JOY OF DANCING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Young dancers who can surmount the pressures of the
annual School of American Ballet Workshop Performances can probably
survive anything. The highly competitive atmosphere of what is a
combination graduation, audition and professional performing
experience can show in somewhat grim, stiff, do-or-die dancing.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood was mostly joyous and even playful in workshop
programs on Saturday afternoon and evening at the Juilliard
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The four ballets, an inspired selection, came from the repertory
of the New York City Ballet, with which the school is affiliated.
These young dancers came surprisingly close to matching the level
of dancing in the senior company.
</P>
<P>
   The accent was on graciousness of manner in George Balanchine's
``Tombeau de Couperin,'' which opened the programs. Kiyon Gaines
stood out at the matinee in this luminous homage to the classical
corps de ballet for the warmth and stylishness of his dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Amar Ramasar and Megan Pepin were a well matched couple in the
matinee performance of the Balanchine-Glinka ``Valse Fantaisie,''
lyrical yet full of daring appetite for space and for technical
challenge. Ramasar, who popped up in nearly everything on both
programs, was the great find of the day, a comfortable blend of
long-limbed prince and endearing goof and a dancer who seems
refreshingly aware at all times of his ballerina and of others on
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ricard was the evening's ballerina, dancing with charm and
polish. A nervous-looking Andrew Veyette pushed very hard,
diminishing the impact of his strong technique and neglecting his
ballerina. Both men need to land more softly. The cast was
completed by Elizabeth Ford, Danielle Giordano, Davena Scott Gross
and Abi Stafford in the afternoon and by the extra-stylish quartet
of Gwyneth Muller, Lisa Platt, Lauren Toole and Amy Watson in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Wheeldon's ``Scenes de Ballet,'' set to the
Stravinsky score, is a knowing, delicately rapturous celebration of
ballet itself and of child dancers at all levels. Ms. Ricard was
the radiant matinee ballerina. Faye Arthurs danced the ballerina
role in the evening with the exciting quality of a sleek racehorse
that may bolt at any moment. Craig Hall, an elegantly finished
classical dancer and a gifted partner, was their cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   The programs ended with impressively authoritative, amusing
performances of Jerome Robbins' ``Fanfare,'' set to Benjamin
Britten's ``Young Persons' Guide to the Orchestra.'' Ramasar,
Philip J. Spencer and Jonathan Porretta (matinee) and Sean Suozzi
(evening) nearly stole the show in the percussion trio, with Igor
Burlak just as funny as the doleful matinee tuba. Other standout
performers included Ms. Giordano, Jordan Pacitti, Carla Korbes,
Seth Orza and Veyette at the matinee and Charlene Cohen, Mary Glenn
Keenan and Ms. Pepin in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The fine lead casts were completed by Jung-Min Lee, Chiaki
Yasukawa, Katherine Daines, Ms. Gross, Orlando Canova, David
Schneider, Ms. Ford, Hall, Ms. Arthurs, Ms. Stafford, Ms. Ricard,
and Gaines. Richard Moredock conducted.

JAZZ AND CLASSICAL FLIRT BUT GET SERIOUS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``A Tribute to Duke Ellington,'' the New York City
Ballet's latest collaboration with Jazz at Lincoln Center, swings.
</P>
<P>
   The program's three works, with two world premieres performed
over the weekend at the New York State Theater, gave the company a
chance to let its hair down. Never mind that most of the women wear
their hair up, either in 1940s upsweeps or in ballet chignons.
</P>
<P>
   The not so irreconcilable gap between jazz and classical ballet
becomes, eventually, the unannounced theme of the evening. There is
even a bodice-ripping finale in which Maria Kowroski as a Degas
ballet girl and hilarious odd woman out among flappers, tears off
her tutu and joins the party in Susan Stroman's choreography in
``Duke!'' That work also has two equally inspired sections by two
other choreographers, Robert La Fosse and Garth Fagan.
</P>
<P>
   It may be startling to see how feverishly the wonderful City
Ballet men throw themselves to the floor in Ms. Stroman's zoot-suit
finale. But the real surprise is ``Them Twos,'' a new ballet by
Peter Martins and Wynton Marsalis.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to expectations, the music Marsalis has written for
Martins is not, strictly speaking, a jazz composition; it is his
first orchestral score to be performed publicly, and at the
program's premiere on Thursday night the music was played by the
City Ballet orchestra under Robert Sadin's baton while the music
for ``Duke!'' the other premiere, as well as the opening piece, the
1993 ``Jazz,'' had music provided by the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Them Twos'' Martins has choreographed a neo-classical
ballet about the uneven course of love. Serene, witty and
pugnacious, it builds toward a supremely haunting image of loss: A
blind lover carries his angelic beloved at a tilt across his
shoulder as her tresses stream down to one side.
</P>
<P>
   Darci Kistler and Jock Soto gave this strange, surreal image an
evocative power in all its asymmetry and finality. Marsalis has
titled this last of six movements in his score ``Loss'' and he and
Martins are, in their second joint venture, more than ever on the
same esthetic and emotional level.
</P>
<P>
   Consisting of an overture and five duets, ``Them Twos'' is
sophisticated and subtle, with the quirky choreographic image
meshing perfectly into a score of symphonic aspirations that knows
how to keep its commissioned dance pulse in the forefront. In
short, a great success.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan and Ms. Stroman, the guest choreographers, and La Fosse,
of City Ballet, are no slouches. They have produced the crowd
pleaser on this three-part program, to be repeated on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them Twos'' will be performed on other mixed bills on Thursday
night and at two matinees, on Saturday and on June 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them Twos'' continues Martins' serious and pioneering
collaboration with major American composers. The ballet is
presented jointly by two member organizations of Lincoln Center.
Martins is City Ballet's artistic director, and Marsalis is the
artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which is devoting its
entire season to the Ellington centenary.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see this program _ with Ellington music in
``Duke!'' and Marsalis music in ``Jazz,'' the first
Marsalis-Martins collaboration, and ``Them Twos'' _ as still
another ploy to attract new audiences.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more accurate to see Marsalis as an American
composer commissioned by Martins. The ballet world has been slow to
recognize the significance of Martins' choices, but the music world
knows that he has selected leading American composers (Charles
Wuorinen, John Adams and Michael Torke). Marsalis' score lends
itself less to the leotard-ballet abstraction that the other
composers inspire. But its lyricism, as Marsalis has shown in the
past, does not exclude dissonant bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   The overture is a light waltz for strings and flute, invaded by
brass. The rhythm turns lickety-split in a shift of sound that has
a wide range of intensity. ``Forever,'' as the overture is titled,
yields to ``First Love,'' a title that embodies the first danced
section. Janie Taylor is the fresh young thing in a frilly tunic
who emerges with Sebastien Marcovici from between the pillarlike
panels that Alain Vaes has designed as a simple, effective set that
Mark Stanley's lighting codes with emotional effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The music is quiet, and the choreography is deceptively simple
but packed full of steps. Marcovici's dynamically executed brises
voles, a series of flying leg beats to each side, superbly
telegraph his puppy love exuberance. Ms. Taylor is refined and
pure, with legs flicked back or swung around her partner. Like the
couples to follow, this pair separates, but dances mainly together;
they are playful but deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost'' introduces Nilas Martins as a partner to a sensual
Miranda Weese in one of Vaes' idiosyncratic costumes. Martins was
superb in the one-armed partnering and Ms. Weese, spooling out from
his arms, had a touch of mystery. Ms. Kowroski, in long black slit
dress, showed plenty of leg as Charles Askegard, in brown street
clothes, made ``Horror,'' the next duet, a witty battle of the
sexes. Marsalis added a frequent whistle, but no one cried foul.
The dancers gave their ingeniously updated apache dance a
contemporary thrust: yanks and splits, lifts and twists told the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Borree, in black bikini, and Nikolaj Hubbe, somewhat
Tarzan-like in a red wrap top, gave ``Sex'' a genteel eroticism in
a wraparound duet ending in an embrace. The music moved aptly from
oozing strings and brass to a buzzing sound that died down. The
choreography is intricate and inventive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loss'' is the dramatic climax. Ms. Kistler, in long gown and
loose hair, bourrees out from behind the panels, a vision
accompanied by a violin. Soto, groping like a blind man or
sleepwalker, finds her rarely in his grasp although they link arms.
She glides along with the music. Like a fugitive from one of George
Balanchine's ballets of the 1930's, Ms. Kistler is here to visit,
not to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them Twos'' is danced behind a scrim, which makes the action
look dim onstage. But ``Duke!'' is as bright as its costumes by
William Ivey Long.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment, ``Rockin' in Rhythm,'' is a spiffy parade of
swing dancing, stylized but close to the real thing. La Fosse has
created the equivalent of a cakewalk led by the jiving Askegard and
Helene Alexopoulos, strongly seconded by Jenifer Ringer and Arch
Higgins. With its basic Lindy hop for an ensemble, the whole thing
has the welcome bounce of a distilled movie musical. David Berger
conducted the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra seated onstage
throughout the ballet. La Fosse's Ellington selections were the
title piece, ``Old King Dooji'' and ``Echoes of Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, whose ``Griot'' with Marsalis was one of modern dance's
best pieces in recent years, won a Tony for his choreography in
``The Lion King.'' Unsurprisingly, his segment, ``Ellington
Elation,'' is the most original and subtle. His women are on toe
and the men wear gold jazz shoes with their blue outfits. The
ensemble's five couples are led by Kathleen Tracey and Albert Evans
and Ms. Weese and Nilas Martins. Ellington's ``Ad Lib on Nippon''
from his ``Far East Suite'' has drops of sound and fast tempos to
which Fagan adds his own dimension.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers are like night birds in the sky. Entrances and
exits, with lifts and arabesques and fast turns, make for a
changing spatial composition. The two main couples swap partners,
and for all the flexed feet, the partnering is classical, ending in
lifts. A ballet to see again.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blossom Got Kissed,'' Ms. Stroman, who has won her laurels
on Broadway, has given us a perfect balleticized musical in
miniature. The music is ``It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got
that Swing'' and ``Lotus Blossom.'' She uses toe for her flappers
and Ms. Kowroski, who can't get groovy until taught by La Fosse,
portraying a musician. (He plays the triangle.) The conceit is slim
but sensationally realized.

DISCOVERY CREW ENDS 10-DAY TRIP TO SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery and its multinational crew of seven swept
to a rare nighttime landing in Florida early Sunday, ending a
successful 10-day flight to the fledgling international space
station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle touched down at Kennedy Space Center at 2:02 a.m
EDT, only the 11th time in 94 missions that a shuttle has landed in
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The crew members were to fly back to Houston on Monday. The
arrival of the astronauts was tentatively scheduled for 2:30 p.m.
EDT at Ellington Field, and NASA has scheduled a brief public
welcoming ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew spent most of its flight docked to the first
components of the new space station. The astronauts left two tons
of supplies for the first resident crew that is scheduled to arrive
in March. The astronauts also made minor repairs to the satellite
communications and power systems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NASA planned to transport the shuttle Columbia to a
coastal launching pad at Kennedy for a possible July 20 liftoff
with the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory. The Chandra
mission has been delayed for nearly a year by a succession of
difficulties with the spacecraft and its propulsion system.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent setback involved the failure of a Boeing booster
on an Air Force Titan launched April 9 with a Department of Defense
satellite. The massive Chandra observatory is fitted atop a similar
booster that will be carried into orbit in Columbia's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is hopeful that a Pentagon probe into the April failure
will conclude there is no reason to believe the Chandra booster is
flawed as well, said space agency shuttle program manager Ron
Dittemore.
</P>
<P>
   If Chandra cannot be launched by mid-August, it will face
another lengthy postponement.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of the shuttles, Columbia is scheduled for major
refurbishments and structural inspections at its California
production plant. None of the other shuttles is configured to
launch the large observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's commander for the five-day mission is Eileen Collins,
a veteran astronaut and the first woman to command a space flight.

 &HT;    HOPES FADE FOR QUICK PEACE AS KOSOVO WITHDRAWAL TALKS NEAR
COLLAPSE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ Hopes for a quick withdrawal of Serb-led
forces from Kosovo faded Sunday after Yugoslav military commanders
refused to sign an agreement putting the peace plan into action.
</P>
<P>
   As marathon talks edged into a third day early Monday in a
camouflage tent at this hot and dusty air field, NATO officials
were uncertain when _ or even if _ a so-called ``military technical
agreement'' would be signed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Yugoslav military commanders had agreed to
only six of the 20 conditions in the 6-page document, which lays
out conditions for the withdrawal of Serb military and police units
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do not sign the documents in their entirety, the air
campaign continues,'' said Maj. Trey Cate, a spokesman for the
American delegation to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the talks became snagged Sunday, NATO used U.S. B-52
bombers to pound Serb troops along Kosovo's border with Albania.
And early Monday morning, air raid sirens sounded in Belgrade,
warning of possible resumed NATO attacks in the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the Yugoslavs' reluctance
to sign the agreement was a stalling tactic. Pentagon officials
have said in recent days that Serb forces may want more time to
cover up evidence of atrocities before they are forced to withdraw
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There also were NATO reports Sunday of Serb forces looting the
towns of Prizren and Pristina inside Kosovo. Meanwhile, Serb forces
and pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas engaged in
heavy fighting Sunday along the Kosovo-Albania border.
</P>
<P>
   The snag in the Kumanovo talks came as a surprise because the
Serb parliament had overwhelmingly approved the peace settlement
last Thursday. When the talks on implementing the settlement began
Saturday, NATO officials assumed Yugoslav military commanders would
quickly sign the agreement specifying the timetable and routes for
the rapid withdrawal of Serb-led forces.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the talks resumed Sunday morning, it became
apparent there were problems. After several breaks requested by the
Yugoslav delegation, Cate told reporters they had made ``very
little progress.'' About the same time, Col. Carmine di Pascale,
head of the Italian delegation, reported ``all kinds of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Finnish President Marti Ahtisaari, who had brokered the
peace plan, abruptly cancelled a planned trip to discuss it with
Chinese leaders in Beijing amid speculation he might be asked to
resume his negotiating role.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and other allied officials said late Sunday that the
Yugoslav military commanders raised a number of objections to the
agreement. Among them, they:
</P>
<P>
   _ Could not withdraw all of their estimated 40,000 forces within
the specified 7-day period because they didn't have enough gas and
many of their vehicles were damaged. They reportedly wanted up to
ten days. They also reportedly said that many of their forces could
not quickly reach the three NATO-designated withdrawal routes from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opposed withdrawing their forces from a 15-mile buffer zone
between Serbia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Were unwilling to withdraw Serb police officers who are
residents of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Objected to the virtual simultaneous entry of NATO troops into
Kosovo at the same time that Serb-led forces were withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday in Washington, Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on ABC-TV that the withdrawal
deadline could be extended a few days, but only for ``good
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, also appearing on ABC, warned:
``We're not going to allow any deliberate policy of delay day by
day.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was confusion Sunday about whether the KLA would
disarm, as called for in the peace plan. Shinasi Rama, a KLA
spokesman, told CNN that ``we see no reason'' to totally disarm,
arguing that guerrilla fighters should be permitted to retain small
arms like those Americans ``can buy in a K-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, aid workers at the main Stankovec refugee center in
Macedonia on Sunday attributed a near-riot and bloody attack on
five ethnic Roma, or gypsy, refugees three of them children to
mounting tensions over the talks. They also worried the incident
previewed how ugly relations may become in Kosovo among ethnic
Albanians, Serbs and other minority groups once the refugees do get
home again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad sign for any kind of ethnic tolerance inside Kosovo
when they go back,'' said Nancy Shalala, spokesperson for the
Catholic Relief Services. ``People are looking for some face to be
responsible for what happened inside Kosovo. This time the face was
the Romas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic agency's volunteers and international staff dragged
a Roma father and son from a crowd that was battering them Saturday
night around 7:30 p.m. Some ethnic Albanian refugees believed the
two men had been collaborators with Serb forces and were
responsible for killing some Albanians, Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers took the Romas, who are also considered gypsies, to
an agency office for protection. But the crowd built until some
angry refugees stormed the office and beat the two men nearly
senseless.
</P>
<P>
   The attacking refugees finally were driven outside, but then set
upon three Roma children and tried ``to rip them limb from limb,''
Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   All five were rescued and taken for medical treatment, but only
after U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill came to the scene and
quieted the teeming crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more tense now,'' said refugee Musa Govori, 32, who
said he witnessed part of the melee and Hill's intervention.
``These people have already learned a lot from the Milosevic's past
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees not only are afraid the talks may not bear fruit, but
also now must confront the uncertainty of what destruction and loss
they will find at home if the talks do succeed.

GYPSIES ATTACKED BY REFUGEES, SPARKING FEARS OF CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>

   STANKOVEC I REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ For a moment, it seemed as
if the mob of Albanian refugees would literally tear the 7-year-old
Gypsy boy apart, limb from limb, said three aid workers who saw the
attack on Saturday night. Minutes earlier, 15 to 20 enraged Kosovo
Albanian refugees had beaten the boy's older brother and father,
whom they accused of collaborating with the Serbs and killing
Albanians inside Kosovo last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The look in their eyes when they tried to tear this boy's arms
out _ there was just fire in their eyes,'' said Ed Joseph, of the
Catholic Relief Service, one of the aid workers who pulled the boy
from the mob. ``I was just grabbing them and shouting `No! No! You
won't!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was part of a chaotic and terrifying four-hour siege
here as a mob of several thousand Kosovo Albanian refugees tried to
seize and beat the Gypsy family.
</P>
<P>
   The attack illustrated both the chaos NATO forces could face in
Kosovo when hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees return home
to the shattered province _ and NATO's reluctance to get involved
in such conflicts. Many of the Albanians could arrive home intent
on exacting revenge on former Serbian and Gypsy neighbors who
attacked Kosovo Albanians or destroyed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   While most Serbs, and Gypsies have who allied themselves with
the Serbs, are expected to flee the province before any Kosovo
Albanians return, some elderly people could remain. Before the NATO
bombing campaign, Serbs made up roughly 10 percent of Kosovo's
population and Gypsies about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsies attacked on Saturday had been in the camp for weeks
after crossing the border from Kosovo. While refugees have reported
that Gypsies in some Kosovo cities have allied themselves with the
Serbs, it was unclear whether this family was among them.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack, the refugees, chanting and screaming for blood,
tore down the fence surrounding the Catholic Relief Service's main
office here, kicked in the front door, tore bars from its windows
and used a metal gutter as a battering ram.
</P>
<P>
   The violence was only defused after hundreds of Macedonian riot
police arrived, and Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to
Macedonia, addressed the mob at midnight and promised that justice
would be done in the case. Relief workers spirited the Gypsy family
and other Gypsies out of the camp and took the men who were beaten
to a Skopje hospital, where they remained hospitalized Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man's face was the color of an eggplant and his eyes were
swollen shut,'' said Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. ``The other had been beaten with a stick
and had a very large wound on his head. It was very clear that if
they had been caught they would have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has been tense since refugees started pouring in from
neighboring Kosovo after NATO began its bombing in late March. But
it was the worst violence in Macedonia since Serbian protesters
ransacked the American Embassy at the outset of the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary authority NATO carries with the refugees and
the political sensitivity of its mission was shown during the
siege. The mob repeatedly demanded that NATO troops come to take
the Gypsies away to be held as war criminals. But officials of the
U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees, in consultation with NATO
officials, decided it was not part of NATO's mission in Macedonia
to carry out such an operation.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how NATO troops respond to similar situations inside
Kosovo could be crucial in their success. NATO officials are
already emphasizing that they will enforce any peace accord
``evenhandedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Trey Cate, a NATO spokesman, said that if they fire their
weapons, for instance, Serbian soldiers, as well as members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist Kosovo Albanian rebel group,
could potentially be fired on by NATO soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, NATO's only other peacekeeping mission, whether or
how NATO troops would intervene in such situations was the focus of
fierce debate. At the outset of that mission in 1996, NATO
commanders insisted they would not be involved in carrying out what
they saw as ``local police actions'' and instead delegated much
responsibility to local police forces controlled by Bosnia's three
ethnic factions. NATO officers feared being progressively drawn
into a larger and larger role in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics assailed the approach, saying it undermined NATO's
authority and allowed local Muslim, Serb and Croat authorities to
act in the sectors they controlled to thwart efforts by refugees
from other ethnic groups to return to the homes from which they
were expelled from during the war. Most refugees in Bosnia have not
returned to their homes more than two years after the Dayton Peace
Accord guaranteed that they could.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo represents a vastly different mission, but NATO is also
likely to face difficult decisions over the scope of its mission.
After NATO forces enter Kosovo, refugees now in the sweltering
camps here may grow tired of waiting for an organized return to
their homes and simply decide to head into Kosovo on their own.
</P>
<P>
   A chaotic scenario could develop in which NATO forces would be
in the awkward position of potentially blocking refugees from
returning to their country, a right they are guaranteed under
international law.
</P>
<P>
   A far larger problem could be revenge attacks. The Saturday
night attack here illustrates how intense the desire for vengeance
may prove.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, who was still shaken by the attack Sunday, said the
attack seemed to him to be a grim omen for what could happen in
Kosovo when the refugees return. ``I think it's a very bad
harbinger for any kind of reconciliation or easy peace,'' he said.
``Any Serb still there has to be packing his bags.''

</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the refugee camps here are sweltering cauldrons of
hate, where increasingly frustrated Kosovo Albanians can
commiserate about their mutual victimization at the hands of the
Serbs. As might be expected, peer pressure is exerted in the camps
to hate Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cegrane camp here, which holds 40,000 refugees, children
recited poems to a crowd of refugees last Thursday that glorified
the Kosovo Albanian rebel soldiers and listed massacre after
massacre believed to have been committed by Serbs as their Albanian
teachers looked on approvingly. And most refugees interviewed here
Sunday said they believed the Gypsies who were attacked did commit
war crimes and applauded the mob's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the Hague for them,'' said Afrim Ademi, an Albanian
refugee, referring to the international war crimes tribunal in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of what sparked the attack on the Gypsies were already
rampant Sunday. Nancy A. Shalala, a spokeswoman for the Catholic
Relief Service who was trying to piece together what occurred
Saturday night, said that she repeatedly heard that a newly arrived
ethnic Albanian refugee said he recognized the Gypsy teen-ager
because he was wearing a piece of jewelry stolen from the refugee's
mother. The refugee reportedly said the Gypsy had killed his father
and then robbed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsy teen-ager and his father were then beaten in separate
attacks and brought at about 7:30 p.m. to the Catholic Relief
building by Kosovo Albanians who work for the aid agency. A group
of 15 to 20 Albanian refugees stormed the building an hour later
and beat them two men even more fiercely. The aid agency's staff
staff finally pushed the group out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   A large crowd then began forming around the building, led by a
group of 150 to 200 men, Ms. Shalala said. The badly beaten father
and son were moved to the building's bathroom to prevent them from
being seen by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agency workers also went to the family's tent to try to
retrieve the mother and three younger children before they too were
set upon by the Albanian refugees. When they arrived at the relief
agency's building, the 7-year-old boy was grabbed by the mob, but
then wrestled free by aid workers. With other Gypsies in the camp
being ``hunted like dogs,'' aid workers said, the aid workers tried
to hide them to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The mob continued to grow. Efforts by Joseph and other aid
workers to use megaphones to get them to disperse failed. The crowd
repeatedly rushed the building, ripping bars from the windows. At
one point, Joseph said, he stood on a window ledge, imploring the
crowd to stop. At other times panicked aid workers stacked cots
against the chain link fence surrounding the building to prevent it
from giving way. They failed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ghedini, the refugee agency spokeswoman, said that at one
point her agency considered evacuating all foreigners from the
area. But when it became clear that the refugees' real hostility
was toward the Gypsies, she said, 17 Gypsies were evacuated from
the camp.

   HOUSING-WORKERS (Seattle) _ Joe Soroka survived the move from
the moderately priced and stable housing market of Cleveland to the
increasingly pricey housing market in the Seattle area. All it took
was a ``sizable salary increase to be motivated to come out here,''
the banker says _ and a willingness to commute 30 miles each day
from North Bend, Wash., to downtown Seattle. High prices,
especially for housing, haven't stopped people from coming. But
costly housing is making it increasingly difficult to recruit
employees to the region, employers say.

WEST COAST CHAMPION OF ENDING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AIMS AT FLORIDA

<P>
   MIAMI, Fla. _ Ward Connerly, who campaigned successfully to end
affirmative action in government hiring and school admissions in
California and Washington State, has now aimed his crusade at
Florida, to the sound of slamming doors.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders here, Democrats and Republicans, blacks,
whites and Hispanic, do not want Connerly, a conservative black
businessman, in Florida, and they definitely do not want his
initiative on the ballot in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who has managed to draw together the political elite
in this racially diverse and often discordant state, said Florida
political leaders were behaving like ostriches, ``with their heads
in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Black political leaders and many Hispanic ones around the
country see Connerly as a pariah, a traitor who plans to amend the
Florida Constitution to stop preference programs based on race, sex
or ethnicity in government hiring and contracts and college
admissions, robbing them of one of the spoils of the civil rights
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders, in Florida and elsewhere in the country,
have another reason for turning their backs to him. Connerly has
brought his divisive issue to the doorstep of Gov. Jeb Bush just as
his older brother, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is preparing to
enter the race for the Republican Presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could, political experts say, create cracks in the
national Republican Party's ranks, just as the Bush brothers are
working to unify them, and hamper efforts to draw in disaffected
Democrats in time for the election.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of his campaign was no coincidence, concedes
Connerly, 60, the chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute
and a regent of the University of California system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can bring Florida into the win column, we will have
brought a major player in the national scene into the family,''
Connerly said in a recent telephone interview from his office in
Sacramento, Calif., ``and will be well on our way to declaring
victory in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better forum'' for debating affirmative action, he
said, ``than a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who ignored pleas from Republican leaders and black
officials to keep his crusade out of Florida, said that he needed
the street-level voters, not their leadership, to pass his
initiative, and that he was confident that working people in
Florida would vote for it as they did in his home state,
California, four years ago and, a year later, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, pollsters and political experts agree that he has a
good chance of getting his initiative approved, if he succeeds in
getting the question on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, Connerly must gather the signatures of about 430,000
registered voters. Political experts in Florida say the effort can
cost $1 to $2 a name, money that would probably come from
supporters of the proposition. The battle against affirmative
action in California cost about $6 million, with the Republican
Party putting up $2.5 million and other backers raising $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it gets on there, it will pass,'' said Dario Moreno, a
professor of political science at Florida International University
who has studied this state's political makeup.
</P>
<P>
   But at stake in the battle, Moreno said, may be more than a
program that has opened doors for minorities and women in business,
government work and universities.
</P>
<P>
   While it would certainly not be the deciding issue in the 2000
campaign, the initiative could create political problems for the
Bush brothers, say political experts and Connerly himself.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers ran campaigns that ``reached out to people'' other
than to the white, conservative Republicans, even as they tried to
retain the party's core supporters, Moreno said. If the proposition
gets onto the ballot in Florida, he said, it would ``undermine the
Bush message, by both brothers, at the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   But Connerly said: ``I want this to be part of the presidential
debate. It scares the hell out of Jeb Bush, because he doesn't want
it on the ballot when his brother runs for office.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the brothers are snubbing Connerly. But Jeb Bush, who
counts on conservatives as a major pillar of support, has written
Connerly, saying: ``Dear Ward, I oppose rigid quotas and
set-asides.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush went on to say that ``a bitter political campaign that
divides Florida by race or ethnicity'' would keep the state
political leadership from focusing on ``more pressing issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said that he expected to battle the state's black
leadership but also asserted that the Republican leadership was
being hypocritical, accusing it of playing politics while ignoring
many Republican voters' opposition to affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why that is controversial,'' he said of his
position.
</P>
<P>
   But affirmative action is an issue that people argue from the
head, and heart, and he has become its lightning rod.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, perhaps one of the best-known black conservatives in
the United States, besides Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme
Court, has provoked the disdain and outright dislike of many blacks
and political leaders by asserting that affirmative action has gone
too far. He has been called an Uncle Tom and had rocks hurled by
protesters at his office. Instead of correcting the prejudices of
the past, he says, affirmative action has become just another form
of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly has the support of Florida's builders' associations,
which are weary of rigid affirmative action requirements in Florida
contracts, but there was no grass-roots anti-affirmative-action
movement in Florida, political experts say, until he began his
drive for an initiative just a few weeks ago. Since then, he has
been featured in newspapers and television programs, and black
newspaper columnists have criticized his plans.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the opposition Connerly has found among the
political leadership and others, polls in Florida have shown that
many voters believe that affirmative action has crossed the line
from an advantage to reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kane, editor in chief of The Florida Voter, a polling
service based in Fort Lauderdale, said a recent poll showed that 84
percent of more than 600 voters surveyed by telephone would vote
for a ban on affirmative action similar to the measure that was
passed in California in 1996, Proposition 209, if it was worded
similarly. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The California initiative said ``the state shall not
discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to'' anyone
based on race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida survey found that when residents were asked
whether they would support an initiative that would ``prohibit
affirmative action'' for women and minorities, only 42 percent said
they would vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be stronger support in the state for another
statement in The Florida Voter poll. The poll said: ``Irish,
Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and
worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special
favors.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked for a response, 52 percent strongly agreed and 29
percent somewhat agreed.
nn
</P>
<P>
   Countering the arguments of his opponents, Connerly says
affirmative action creates a society in which those who get an
unfair advantage will live their lives doomed to feelings of
inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got 30 percent of the black vote on 209,'' he said. ``I
want black kids and Latino kids to believe they are 10 feet tall
and made out of steel, believing that they can navigate this system
and come out on top. If you walk around believing that everybody is
a racist who knocks you down, it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly is ignoring the realities of racism, his critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minority communities across the nation are reeling in poverty,
disinvestment and red-lining, and racism is still deeply imbedded
in our minds and manifested through a lack of educational and
professional opportunities,'' said Alicia Hughes, a second-year law
student at the University of Miami and president of the Black Law
Student Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is a slanted scale,'' Ms. Hughes added ``it
is necessary that there are programs like affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Another second-year law school student there, Dolly Hernandez,
said she wanted to feel as if she could compete equally, regardless
of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's race, religion, sex or creed should be the deciding
factor,'' Ms. Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly expects more hurdles to get his proposition on the
ballot, including state election guidelines that insist that such
initiatives be on a single subject. Calling for an end to
affirmative action on the basis of race and sex, for instance,
could violate that guideline.
</P>
<P>
   But those are just details, for a true believer.

5 in the morning? No, you can't. But I supplied the morning papers
on Skid Row and what I got from the residents in return were
smiles, waves and an occasional invitation to partake of a free
hamburger.

   TEXAS-LAW-REFORM (Houston) _ Over the last decade, sweeping
changes have transformed the legal system here in Texas and in many
other states. Under the banner of lawsuit reform, Texas has helped
lead the way, embracing one of the nation's most ambitious attempts
to hold down the cost of civil suits and limit the size of jury
awards. For years, Texas had a reputation as the ``lawsuit capital
of America'' because its juries in injury cases were said to be
overly generous. But starting in the late 1980s, the state began
adding restrictions, like limits on punitive damage awards, and
provisions that make it harder for injured workers to sue. Now
Texas is seen as one of the most aggressive states in efforts to
curb civil suits under the banner of ``tort reform.'' By William
Glaberson.

EDDIE STANKY, 83, SPARK PLUG ON 3 PENNANT-WINNING TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ala., Texas, Mo., Pa., La., Tenn.)  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Stanky, the combative infielder whose inspired play helped
bring pennants to the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Boston Braves and the
New York Giants, died on Sunday at a hospital in Fairhope, Ala.
Stanky, who had homes in Mobile, Ala., and Fairhope, was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, according to the University of
South Alabama in Mobile, where Stanky was formerly the baseball
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Stanky, known as the Brat, was a baseball player with so many
intangible assets, most of them aggressive, that Branch Rickey once
was moved to observe: ``He can't run, he can't hit and he can't
throw. But if there's a way to beat the other team, he'll find
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanky found ways not only to beat but also to enrage other
teams in 11 years in the National League with the Chicago Cubs, the
Dodgers, the Braves, the Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals, and as
a manager with the Cards, the Chicago White Sox and, for one
memorable day, the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   He was frequently a leadoff batter, always a hustler, often a
needler, and he managed to draw bases on balls so relentlessly that
an opposing pitcher complained, ``First you lose Stanky, then you
lose your temper, then you lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanky was small but pugnacious, and one of the more inventive
ballplayers of the 1940s and early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey traded Stanky, from the Dodgers to the Braves in 1948,
partly to make room at second base for Jackie Robinson, who played
first base the year before, when he broke the major league color
barrier in Brooklyn's pennant-winning season. The season Stanky
joined them, the Braves won their first pennant in 34 years. After
two years in Boston, he was traded to the Giants, who won their
``miracle'' pennant against the Dodgers in the final inning of the
final playoff game in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Raymond Stanky was born in Philadelphia and for a time
favored boxing and soccer, which he played at Northeast High
School. But he never stood more than 5 feet 8 inches nor weighed
more than 160 pounds, so he stuck to baseball. He was signed in
1935 by the Philadelphia Athletics' organization and played in the
minor leagues for eight years before joining the Cubs in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, he was traded to the Dodgers and began
a long and tumultuous association with Leo Durocher, his manager in
Brooklyn and then with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three and a half years, Stanky served as the
``holler guy'' at second base. He set a National League record by
drawing 148 walks in 1945, led the league's second basemen in
double plays for three years, and in 1947 played in the All-Star
Game and the World Series, against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   After a salary dispute with Rickey, he was shipped to Boston.
Stanky fractured an ankle in July, but he returned to help the
Braves win their first pennant since 1914, hitting .320.
</P>
<P>
   But he came to be considered one of the team's leading rebels
against Manager Billy Southworth and again was traded, this time to
the Giants. Durocher was managing then at the Polo Grounds, and
Stanky still blamed him for a lack of support during the dispute
with Rickey in Brooklyn. But they resolved their differences. In
1951, with Stanky at second base and Alvin Dark at shortstop _ the
1948 Braves' double play combination, too _ the Giants won their
legendary pennant victory over the Dodgers on Bobby Thomson's home
run. Stanky's feistiness was underlined in the 1951 World Series,
when he kicked the ball out of Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto's
glove.
</P>
<P>
   The following season, he became a playing manager with the
Cardinals. He ran the team from 1952 until 1955, though his playing
career ended in 1953, then managed the White Sox from 1966 through
1968. He never finished higher than third place.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he began a new career as the baseball coach at the
University of South Alabama, but for one June day in 1977, he was
drawn back into the major leagues as manager of the Texas Rangers.
After that day, he abruptly quit and left for Alabama, saying only
that he was homesick. In his 14 years at South Alabama, he built
the team into a national power.
</P>
<P>
   Stanky is survived by his wife, Dickie, the daughter of Milt
Stock, the minor league manager who had helped develop Stanky's
talent before becoming his father-in-law; a son, Mike, of Dallas;
three daughters, Beverly Corte of Fairhope; Kay Flarity of
Covington, La., and Marianne Page, of Memphis, Tenn.; a sister,
Dorothy Peirce, of Bethel Park, Pa., and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In his long career, as a player and manager, Stanky seemed to
revel in his hard-nosed image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is not a game to me,'' Stanky once mused. ``It's a
business. And a bloodthirsty business, at that.''

TEXAS POLICE LOOK FOR POSSIBLE LINK IN RECENT KILLINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ky.) 
 
By STEPHEN JOHNSON 
and LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The bludgeoning deaths of a southeast Houston woman
and an elderly woman in Fayette County over the weekend were under
investigation Sunday by officials trying to determine if they are
related to recent slayings in West University Place and Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, authorities suspect the victims were killed by
intruders who broke into their homes after possibly arriving in the
area by freight train.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into that (the similarities),'' Houston homicide
Lt. Ronald Walker said. ``There are some slight similarities in
those cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walker would not go into details, saying only that they had
not ruled out anything.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent slaying is that of Noemi Dominguez who
authorities would only say was struck a fatal blow to the head. Her
body was found by her brother Saturday in the bedroom of her
southeast Houston home, but investigators believe she had been dead
since late Thursday or early Friday. A Houston Belt and Terminal
Railway Co. line runs behind her home.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he believed Dominguez was an inner-city school
teacher and a graduate of Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   Police also are looking for Dominguez's missing 1993 white Honda
Civic, Texas license JJH 57N, with a black and white bumper sticker
printed with Japanese writing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fayette County Sheriff's Department investigators,
assisted by Fort Bend County deputies and the Texas Rangers, are
working to determine who killed 73-year-old Josephine Konvicka, who
was found bludgeoned to death Friday in her Weimar-area home.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar is about 90 miles west of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Someone attempted to steal Konvicka's car but failed to locate
the keys that Konvicka left in a drawer, according to Sheriff Rick
Vandel. The killer and would-be car thief had cut the electrical
connection to the car's dome light to keep it from coming on while
he was inside the car, Vandel said.
</P>
<P>
   Vandel said he was told by Texas Rangers of the Dominguez
slaying and that efforts were being made to determine if the
Konvicka and Dominguez slayings could be linked since both women
were bludgeoned to death and the homes of both were located near
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   A mere 3 1/2 miles east of Konvicka's home was the residence of
the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife Karen 47, who
were both discovered bludgeoned to death May 2. Their killer
apparently had used a sledgehammer on the couple after entering the
rear of their home behind the Weimar Church of Christ, where Sirnic
was pastor. A car belonging to the Sirnics was also taken.
</P>
<P>
   Similarities between the killings of the Sirnics and the Dec.
17, 1998, slaying of Dr. Claudia Benton at her West University home
prompted the Weimar Police Department and West University police to
compare notes on the crimes in their respective cities. Benton also
lived near railroad tracks and a car was taken from her residence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Benton and Sirnic cars were located in San Antonio
after being abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   A suspect in the slaying of Benton is Rafael Resendez-Rameriz
whose criminal history spans two decades. A transient, Rameriz is
suspected of riding freight trains and is described as 5-foot-7 and
weighing 150 pounds. Resendez-Rameriz's fingerprints were found
inside a Jeep Cherokee stolen from Benton's home.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is also considered a possible suspect by
Lexington, Ky., officials in the unsolved 1997 slaying there of
University of Kentucky student, Christopher Maier. Maier, 21, was
beaten to death and his girlfriend was assaulted as the couple
walked along railroad tracks.

 &HT;    Lopez delivers late again
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Safe to say the Fenway faithful had about enough of
Javy Lopez for one weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, Lopez mustered a game-winning hit
to spoil another sunny afternoon for a sold-out Red Sox crowd. This
one was a two-out single in the 10th inning Sunday. It came after
he fouled off a couple two-strike pitches and lined a Jim Corsi
curve into left-center to score Otis Nixon from second for a 3-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``A (curveball) was the only thing I was looking for,'' said
Lopez, who yanked a Tom Gordon curve down the third-base line in
the ninth on Saturday to drive in two runs for a 6-5 victory. ``I
told myself if I'm ready for the curveball, I can make an
adjustment to hit the fastball in. That's what he'd been throwing
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves managed only four hits in the first nine innings and
two runs, both knocked in by designated hitter Keith Lockhart.
After failing to manufacture a run in the ninth after a leadoff hit
by Andruw Jones, the Braves buckled down an inning later. Walt
Weiss singled, Bret Boone moved pinch-runner Nixon over with a
sacrifice, and Chipper Jones was intentionally walked. A Brian
Jordan flyout brought up Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   After they were dominated by Pedro Martinez Friday, the Braves
scraped together back-to-back wins and headed home up 2-1 in
interleague play after facing the top team in the American League
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, especially the way we did it,'' Boone said. ``We're
not hitting on all cylinders. Fact is Milly (Kevin Millwood)
pitched a great game again. That's six or seven in a row now. Only
one pitch hurt him all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood had a no-hitter going into the seventh before Boston
took care of that, along with the shutout and the Braves' 2-0 lead.
John Valentin singled sharply to left on the first pitch of the
seventh, and then with two outs, Troy O'Leary drove a fastball for
a two-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   That's the pitch that had been working for Millwood most of the
day, but he left it over the plate instead of off the plate inside
like he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a lot sharper,'' said Millwood, who failed to get a
win for the first time in five starts. ``But that's what pitching
is all about, you have to make adjustments and find ways to get
people out. I was able to locate (my fastball) in and out. Got away
with all but one.''

COMMENTARY: LESSONS OF KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Sentences in boldface should be italicized.) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Kosovo, the Western world did the right thing in
the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   The right thing was to place humanity's resistance to barbarism
above national sovereignty. When a nation commits a mass atrocity
against a segment of its own people, other nations have just
asserted their right to intervene with force.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the current deal breaks down, this is historic.
International moral standards of conduct, long derided by
geopoliticians, now have muscle. The world can put together a
police force to punish internal aggression.
</P>
<P>
   We will not always be able to do the right thing everywhere. But
we have set a precedent of doing the right thing somewhere, and
once the right thing becomes possible, it tends to become probable.
</P>
<P>
   What are the lessons the West is learning in trying to stop
national criminality?
</P>
<P>
   1. Never tell the criminals what you will not do. This is a sign
of lack of confidence in your own people and your allies, and
diminishes your ability to lead. ``I do not intend to send ground
troops'' encourages the criminals and prolongs the war. Only when
NATO ground forces became a live option, and when KLA guerrilla
forces made a foray that flushed out Yugoslav tanks and made them
targets for air destruction, did the criminals begin to cave in.
</P>
<P>
   2. When you decide to strike, strike decisively. As Napoleon
told his hesitant generals, ``If you are going to take Vienna, take
Vienna.'' We should have turned out the lights in Belgrade and
destroyed telecommunications the first day. Slow, steady escalation
invites propaganda exploitation of ``collateral damage,''
highlights mistakes like the Chinese Embassy destruction and in the
long run costs lives.
</P>
<P>
   3. Do not place a higher value on the lives of warriors than on
the lives of civilians. Members of armed forces are trained and
paid to risk their lives; civilians are not. By bombing from 15,000
feet, we avoided NATO casualties but failed for over two months to
stop the murder, rape, pillage and mass deportation that was a
mission of our military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do not overestimate the courage of an army and paramilitary
that kills the unarmed. Just as the vaunted Iraqi army, adept at
gassing civilians, cracked and ran at the first sight of firepower,
the Serbs who destroyed villages in Kosovo are apparently unwilling
to die for Milosevic. Committers of atrocities are rarely brave
professional soldiers and should not intimidate well-armed
rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   5. Remember that in any alliance, some allies will be more
allied than others. Britain emerged as NATO's leader and France was
stalwart. The United States provided the air punch and moral
rhetoric but temporized on a ground threat and unwisely insisted on
a Russian intermediary. Germany, Italy and Greece were the weak
sisters. Consensus should be sought, but no member of NATO should
be able to veto the great majority's decision.
</P>
<P>
   6. Do not let mistrust of the leadership's competence becloud
faith in the rightness of a cause. Principled isolationists and
pacifists of right and left had their say, but most opposition to
our Kosovo intervention came from Republicans who felt Clinton blew
too uncertain a trumpet and would settle for a weak compromise.
McCain, Bush and Dole put backbone in Clinton policy while others
failed to help.
</P>
<P>
   7. Do not let the loser win. Until sensible Serbs decide to hand
the Milosevic gang over to the Hague tribunal, no bridge should be
rebuilt or embargo lifted. Allow no subversion of Montenegro and
lock in autonomy for Hungarian Vojvodina. The Kosovo Occupying
Force must be commanded and controlled by NATO, not India or
Sweden, and the European nation with the largest army _ Turkey _
should have a commensurate presence.
</P>
<P>
   8. Don't try to mix oil and water in patrolling the peace. The
returning KLA will be ``demilitarized'' (no tanks) but not
disarmed; it will be seeking vengeance. The burden on peacekeepers
will be to protect minority Serbs and to uphold a pretense of their
sovereignty. Better to offer individual Serbs in Kosovo a
relocation bonus to safety and to let Kosovo's victims have their
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-Yugoslav war is not yet over, but civilization is more
civilized for having intervened to do the right thing. Next time we
are more likely to do it the right way.

 &HT;    More homers, less stress for Jordan in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With two home runs in the past four games, Brian Jordan
has 13 home runs, which is tied with Chipper Jones for the Braves'
lead, and well on the way to making this quite a year for the
club's new cleanup hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hit a career-high 25 home runs with the Cardinals last
season. If he maintains this season's pace, he has a shot a 40.
Last year at the all-star break, Jordan had 15 home runs and 56
RBIs. Currently, he has 13 home runs and 52 RBIs and the all-star
break is still more than five weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relaxing, having fun,'' Jordan said. ``It was more
stressful last year because of the pressure of being the No. 4
hitter behind Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 32, has been playing baseball only for the past six
years. He said he's still learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take more chances now because I'm learning the game, more
experienced,'' he said. ``I don't know what my potential is. I just
go out, play hard and hopefully get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The `playing hard' part has been evidenced by Jordan's bumps and
bruises _ starting with his left hamstring strain, left ankle
strain, a sore left abdomen from sliding into first last Wednesday
and then a sore left knee from running into the right-field wall
trying to catch a foul ball on Saturday. Through it all, he's only
missed one game.
</P>
<P>
   With numbers like these, Jordan has made a case to be a National
League all-star though he was disappointed last year when NL
all-star manager Jim Leyland didn't choose him despite his
league-leading .339 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has plans to spend the all-star break with his family at
their vacation home in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go to the All-Star Game,'' Jordan said. ``To get
that experience, just to say I've been.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's chance
</P>
<P>
   The at-bats have been few and far between for backup second
baseman Keith Lockhart this season, so Sunday's return to the
lineup as the Braves designated hitter was welcome. He came through
with a hit and two RBIs in four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Lockhart's fifth start of the season through 56
games. His 49 at-bats is the lowest total of any position player
for the Braves. He is hitting .222, ahead of only Gerald Williams
(.195), Otis Nixon (.171) and Ozzie Guillen (.151).
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no rhythm, there is no flow _ you just don't play
enough,'' Lockhart said. ``I thought I'd be in there a little bit
more. I just kind of go with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Grab that baseball
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz needs one strikeout in today's start against the
Devil Rays to reach 2,000 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two thousand will be neat,'' he said. ``Not a ton of people
have achieved it. It's like a feather in your cap.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will stop long enough for the Braves to retrieve the
ball.Carroll Rogers writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,

SEATTLE'S COSTLY HOUSING MAKING IT HARDER FOR EMPLOYERS TO LURE
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN AND TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Joe Soroka survived the move from the moderately
priced and stable housing market of Cleveland to the increasingly
pricey housing market in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was a ``sizable salary increase to be motivated to
come out here,'' the banker says _ and a willingness to commute 30
miles each day from North Bend to downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew prior to coming out here it was going to be more
expensive,'' says Soroka, vice president of international banking
at KeyBank. ``It was more than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's too expensive. Soroka knows of one colleague who
declined a transfer to Seattle because of the cost of housing here.
</P>
<P>
   Other employers are hearing the same thing. A handful of recent
Lake Washington School District job offers were met with the reply
``I'd love to work there, but I can't afford to live there,'' says
Sharon Weston, employment coordinator for the Kirkland and Redmond
district.
</P>
<P>
   High prices, especially for housing, don't stop people from
coming. The vibrancy of the economy, the companies here that lead
their respective industries, the cultural life, the scenery and
even the weather are irresistible lures to many.
</P>
<P>
   But costly housing is making it increasingly difficult to
recruit employees to the region, employers say. Recruits who turn
down job offers here cite the cost of housing almost as often as
impacts on family, adds Shari Blackwood, relocation director for
the real estate firm Coldwell Banker Bain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be addressed, but it's tougher and tougher,'' says
Gayle Glew, president of Windermere Relocation, which handles about
500 transfers a month.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are using signing bonuses, cost-of-living adjustments
and other incentives where they can. But ``sticker shock is here
with us,'' says Glew.
</P>
<P>
   Sticker shock is biting both newcomers and those already here.
The median price of home and condominium sales in King County was
$208,975 in April, up 8.9 percent from the same month a year ago
and up 28 percent from April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But people still come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fall in love with the area; if they're married and have
kids, it's even worse,'' says Key Bank Vice Chairman Luke Helms.
The area's lures make them overlook or compensate for a lot of
drawbacks, like the cost of housing. Helms says they get a look at
the area and say ``Forget the rain, forget the traffic, I'm still
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   High housing prices aren't likely to choke the region's economy
because employers can't get the people they want. One reason is
that prices aren't uniform across the region. While the squeeze is
the worst in Seattle and the Eastside, a recruit to a company in
Federal Way, for example, can still find plenty of reasonably
priced houses in South King County or in Pierce County.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Seattle is by no means the least affordable housing
market in the country. San Francisco and Silicon Valley are far
worse. And as Helms notes, ``The Bay Area is booming, this one is
booming.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that high housing prices don't provoke a lot of grumbling
from those who move here. ``If they're in a 3,000-square-foot house
in Denver, Kansas City or Minneapolis, either they have to
downscale if they want to keep the payments the same,'' or they
have to pay more than they were expecting, Glew says. ``To many of
them, it's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Soroka sold a 55-year-old, 1,950-square-foot house about 12
miles from the office in Cleveland for a 3-year-old,
2,200-square-foot house in North Bend. The North Bend house cost
twice as much as the one he sold in Cleveland. And the North Bend
home probably cost a third more than a comparable recently built
home in the Cleveland area.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Williams moved the opposite direction, from Seattle to
Cleveland. An assistant vice president of executive communications
at KeyBank, Williams sold a small two-bedroom house in Shoreline _
``kind of a classic Seattle starter home'' _ for a three-bedroom,
two-bath home in Bay Village, a suburb 12 miles west of downtown
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get twice as much home for 10 percent more''
than what he had sold his Shoreline home for, Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   For that extra 10 percent, Williams not only got a house with
double the space (not counting the full basement) but private beach
rights to a neighborhood park, complete with benches and barbecue
pit, along Lake Erie. While utility costs are higher _ both because
of the winters and because Seattle has the lowest electric rates in
the country _ on the whole, he says, ``We did very very well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact this was the second move Williams has made to a more
affordable market. In 1988 he moved from Los Angeles to Seattle
because ``we thought we might be able to afford a house in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Those moving to Seattle today start with the notion of looking
for a reasonably priced home within a reasonable commute of where
they work, Helms says. ``That's out.''
</P>
<P>
   So buyers adjust. One way is to accept a longer commute (which
helps accentuate the region's traffic snarls, but that's another
issue). Soroka was wary of living north or south of downtown
because of clogged Interstate-5, but finds the traffic on
Interstate-90 comparable to what he encountered in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers may think they're moving to Seattle, and that may be
where the job is. But ``if they actually end up buying in Puyallup,
that's perfectly acceptable to them,'' Glew says.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond police Officer Craig Shanks' traffic-snarled commute
from Renton takes at least 30 minutes each day. He'd like to move
closer, but houses in Redmond were way out of his price range when
he moved from South Dakota in August.
</P>
<P>
   A Northwest native, Shanks had only been away in South Dakota
for four years. When he moved back, he was astounded by hefty
Eastside house prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the money we wanted to spend, it was horrible,'' he says
of rickety fixer-uppers selling for upwards of $200,000. ``Hence,
we live in Renton.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle-area housing market looks quite different to
roughly a dozen new deputies hired by the King County Sheriff's
office this year. They were recruited from Hawaii, where the
salaries are lower and house prices are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's office recruiters have actively looked toward Honolulu
and surrounding areas, knowing many police officers there have both
the talent and the desire to move to a place where salaries and the
cost of living aren't so far apart, according to King County
sheriff's spokesman John Urquhart.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers also console themselves with the notion of price
appreciation: Whatever they paid, they'll probably be able to sell
for more. Given the economic prospects of the region, a meltdown in
housing prices is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly important for buyers who expect to be
transferred out of this market by their employers in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are helping too. ``We've seen some significant
cost-of-living adjustments extrapolated into recruiting
proposals,'' Windermere's Glew says.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood, of Coldwell Banker Bain's relocation services, says
some employers will help recruits with the sale of their old house,
or cover closing costs and points on a new property.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't help directly with the cost of housing, employers
and relocation experts may offer other assistance. Blackwood says
employers will offer job-placement help to spouses of recruits. She
has even seen employers help recruits with relocation of elderly
parents for whom they're caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the companies, relocation is an expensive proposition,''
Blackwood says.
</P>
<P>
   But in a tight labor market, ``It's a cost of doing business,''
and businesses figure the cost is worth it if it helps retain those
employees, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a sign-on bonus has helped Bellevue's Overlake Hospital
hire nurses. There's been a shortage of candidates, and the area's
cost of living has only compounded the problem of bringing in
people, said Lori Vocca, the hospital's employment and employee
relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   The private hospital used to pay only top-level recruits for the
expense of relocating to this area. These days, the hospital gets _
and grants _ more and more requests to help people with moving
costs, Vocca said.
</P>
<P>
   Those options aren't available to all employers though. A public
school system like Lake Washington can't offer pay incentives,
bonuses or help with moving expenses, Weston says.
</P>
<P>
   It has cost the district some candidates who were ``highly
qualified and would have been a good asset for our district,'' she
says.

GYPSIES ATTACKED BY REFUGEES, SPARKING FEARS OF CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANKOVEC I REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ For a moment, it seemed as
if the mob of Albanian refugees would literally tear the 7-year-old
Gypsy boy apart, limb from limb, said three aid workers who saw the
attack on Saturday night. Minutes earlier, 15 to 20 enraged Kosovo
Albanian refugees had beaten the boy's older brother and father,
whom they accused of collaborating with the Serbs and killing
Albanians inside Kosovo last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The look in their eyes when they tried to tear this boy's arms
out _ there was just fire in their eyes,'' said Ed Joseph, of the
Catholic Relief Service, one of the aid workers who pulled the boy
from the mob. ``I was just grabbing them and shouting `No! No! You
won't!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was part of a chaotic and terrifying four-hour siege
here as a mob of several thousand Kosovo Albanian refugees tried to
seize and beat the Gypsy family.
</P>
<P>
   The attack illustrated both the chaos NATO forces could face in
Kosovo when hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees return home
to the shattered province _ and NATO's reluctance to get involved
in such conflicts. Many of the Albanians could arrive home intent
on exacting revenge on former Serbian and Gypsy neighbors who
attacked Kosovo Albanians or destroyed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   While most Serbs, and Gypsies have who allied themselves with
the Serbs, are expected to flee the province before any Kosovo
Albanians return, some elderly people could remain. Before the NATO
bombing campaign, Serbs made up roughly 10 percent of Kosovo's
population and Gypsies about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsies attacked on Saturday had been in the camp for weeks
after crossing the border from Kosovo. While refugees have reported
that Gypsies in some Kosovo cities have allied themselves with the
Serbs, it was unclear whether this family was among them.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack, the refugees, chanting and screaming for blood,
tore down the fence surrounding the Catholic Relief Service's main
office here, kicked in the front door, tore bars from its windows
and used a metal gutter as a battering ram.
</P>
<P>
   The violence was only defused after hundreds of Macedonian riot
police arrived, and Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to
Macedonia, addressed the mob at midnight and promised that justice
would be done in the case. Relief workers spirited the Gypsy family
and other Gypsies out of the camp and took the men who were beaten
to a Skopje hospital, where they remained hospitalized Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man's face was the color of an eggplant and his eyes were
swollen shut,'' said Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees. ``The other had been beaten with a stick
and had a very large wound on his head. It was very clear that if
they had been caught they would have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has been tense since refugees started pouring in from
neighboring Kosovo after NATO began its bombing in late March. But
it was the worst violence in Macedonia since Serbian protesters
ransacked the American Embassy at the outset of the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary authority NATO carries with the refugees and
the political sensitivity of its mission was shown during the
siege. The mob repeatedly demanded that NATO troops come to take
the Gypsies away to be held as war criminals. But officials of the
U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees, in consultation with NATO
officials, decided it was not part of NATO's mission in Macedonia
to carry out such an operation.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how NATO troops respond to similar situations inside
Kosovo could be crucial in their success. NATO officials are
already emphasizing that they will enforce any peace accord
``evenhandedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Trey Cate, a NATO spokesman, said that if they fire their
weapons, for instance, Serbian soldiers, as well as members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist Kosovo Albanian rebel group,
could potentially be fired on by NATO soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, NATO's only other peacekeeping mission, whether or
how NATO troops would intervene in such situations was the focus of
fierce debate. At the outset of that mission in 1996, NATO
commanders insisted they would not be involved in carrying out what
they saw as ``local police actions'' and instead delegated much
responsibility to local police forces controlled by Bosnia's three
ethnic factions. NATO officers feared being progressively drawn
into a larger and larger role in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics assailed the approach, saying it undermined NATO's
authority and allowed local Muslim, Serb and Croat authorities to
act in the sectors they controlled to thwart efforts by refugees
from other ethnic groups to return to the homes from which they
were expelled from during the war. Most refugees in Bosnia have not
returned to their homes more than two years after the Dayton Peace
Accord guaranteed that they could.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo represents a vastly different mission, but NATO is also
likely to face difficult decisions over the scope of its mission.
After NATO forces enter Kosovo, refugees now in the sweltering
camps here may grow tired of waiting for an organized return to
their homes and simply decide to head into Kosovo on their own.
</P>
<P>
   A chaotic scenario could develop in which NATO forces would be
in the awkward position of potentially blocking refugees from
returning to their country, a right they are guaranteed under
international law.
</P>
<P>
   A far larger problem could be revenge attacks. The Saturday
night attack here illustrates how intense the desire for vengeance
may prove.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, who was still shaken by the attack Sunday, said the
attack seemed to him to be a grim omen for what could happen in
Kosovo when the refugees return. ``I think it's a very bad
harbinger for any kind of reconciliation or easy peace,'' he said.
``Any Serb still there has to be packing his bags.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the refugee camps here are sweltering cauldrons of
hate, where increasingly frustrated Kosovo Albanians can
commiserate about their mutual victimization at the hands of the
Serbs. As might be expected, peer pressure is exerted in the camps
to hate Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cegrane camp here, which holds 40,000 refugees, children
recited poems to a crowd of refugees last Thursday that glorified
the Kosovo Albanian rebel soldiers and listed massacre after
massacre believed to have been committed by Serbs as their Albanian
teachers looked on approvingly. And most refugees interviewed here
Sunday said they believed the Gypsies who were attacked did commit
war crimes and applauded the mob's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the Hague for them,'' said Afrim Ademi, an Albanian
refugee, referring to the international war crimes tribunal in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of what sparked the attack on the Gypsies were already
rampant Sunday. Nancy A. Shalala, a spokeswoman for the Catholic
Relief Service who was trying to piece together what occurred
Saturday night, said that she repeatedly heard that a newly arrived
ethnic Albanian refugee said he recognized the Gypsy teen-ager
because he was wearing a piece of jewelry stolen from the refugee's
mother. The refugee reportedly said the Gypsy had killed his father
and then robbed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsy teen-ager and his father were then beaten in separate
attacks and brought at about 7:30 p.m. to the Catholic Relief
building by Kosovo Albanians who work for the aid agency. A group
of 15 to 20 Albanian refugees stormed the building an hour later
and beat them two men even more fiercely. The aid agency's staff
staff finally pushed the group out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   A large crowd then began forming around the building, led by a
group of 150 to 200 men, Ms. Shalala said. The badly beaten father
and son were moved to the building's bathroom to prevent them from
being seen by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agency workers also went to the family's tent to try to
retrieve the mother and three younger children before they too were
set upon by the Albanian refugees. When they arrived at the relief
agency's building, the 7-year-old boy was grabbed by the mob, but
then wrestled free by aid workers. With other Gypsies in the camp
being ``hunted like dogs,'' aid workers said, the aid workers tried
to hide them to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The mob continued to grow. Efforts by Joseph and other aid
workers to use megaphones to get them to disperse failed. The crowd
repeatedly rushed the building, ripping bars from the windows. At
one point, Joseph said, he stood on a window ledge, imploring the
crowd to stop. At other times panicked aid workers stacked cots
against the chain link fence surrounding the building to prevent it
from giving way. They failed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ghedini, the refugee agency spokeswoman, said that at one
point her agency considered evacuating all foreigners from the
area. But when it became clear that the refugees' real hostility
was toward the Gypsies, she said, 17 Gypsies were evacuated from
the camp.

BARAK TRYING TO ASSEMBLE DIVERSE GOVERNING COALITION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak appears ready to
form a midsize coalition government comprising the traditional
Israeli left, the new Israeli center, the settlers, the Russian
immigrants and the ultra-Orthodox of European descent.
</P>
<P>
   That would give him a 66-seat majority bloc in the 120-member
parliament, which is to be sworn in on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It would leave the conservative Likud Party and the Sephardic
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party in the opposition, at least at the start.
Intensive negotiations in the three weeks since Barak was elected
on May 17 have not paved the way to what he had hoped would be a
broad consensus government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now working toward a 66 government,'' Barak, the Labor
Party leader, said in a television interview Sunday night, his
first since election day. ``But the doors are open to Shas and the
Likud.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy differences _ on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
the drafting of Orthodox yeshiva students into the military, for
instance _ remain to be ironed out within the 66-member bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has until July 8 to cobble together a Cabinet. The
negotiations have yet to begin. Although rumors about who will get
what post are rampant, Barak has been holding his cards close to
the vest.
</P>
<P>
   Only one position seems certain: Barak, a highly decorated
former general, is likely to serve as his own defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting at a hotel in the seaside city of Herzliya, Barak's
negotiating team has been hammering out the coalition's principles,
broad enough to appeal to a motley group but not so broad that they
paralyze a new prime minister intent on making changes.
</P>
<P>
   They have been seeking common ground between wildly disparate
groups: how to reconcile Shinui, a new centrist party elected on an
anti-Orthodox platform, and United Torah Judaism, an ultra-Orthodox
party; how to find an acceptable middle road between Meretz, the
traditional leftist party that opposes the building of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, and the Jewish settlers themselves,
represented by the rightist National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers on Sunday published the basic policy guidelines
outlined in the draft coalition agreement. They reported that
Barak's government would not establish any new settlements but
would not dismantle any existing ones. A clause refers to a review
of ``prior authorized decisions,'' leaving unclear the fate of
several projects recently approved by the departing government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Also, settlers would lose tax advantages and other benefits that
they have long enjoyed for establishing residence in the West Bank.
That section of the guidelines is under attack by the settlers and
by the leadership of Yisrael B'Aliya, the Russian immigrant party,
which strongly supports settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Navigating a path between the secular and religious parties, the
draft suggests that the government will work to prevent religious
legislation and either religious or anti-religious coercion.
</P>
<P>
   It also states relatively mildly that the government will ask
for legislation dealing with the drafting of yeshiva students, who
now are entitled to a deferment to study the Torah _ but not mildly
enough for the United Torah Judaism leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't agree to a situation in which a single soul that
thirsts for Torah will not be able to study,'' Meir Porush, a party
leader, was quoted by the newspaper Maariv as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting Sunday between Barak and Ariel Sharon, the outgoing
foreign minister and temporary chairman of the Likud Party, ended
without any agreement. Sharon has reportedly been pressing to
retain his post as foreign minister, which is considered unlikely.
He also reportedly wants to shape a peace policy that sounds like
his own rather than Barak's.
</P>
<P>
   The draft guidelines call for accelerating negotiations with the
Palestinians and submitting a final-status agreement to a national
referendum. They suggest resuming talks with Syria based on
international agreements presuming the trading of land for peace _
that is, the return of part of the Golan Heights to Syria. And they
propose a withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon but do
not repeat Barak's campaign promise to do so within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-member coalition would include eight parties: Labor, now
called One Israel; Meretz; Shinui; the Center Party; Yisrael
B'Aliya; the National Religious Party; United Torah Judaism, and
One People, a workers' party that broke off from Labor.
</P>
<P>
   While Barak won an overwhelming victory in the vote for prime
minister, his party lost seats in parliament, as did Likud. Shas,
which represents Sephardic Jews whose families came to Israel from
Middle Eastern countries, won big, siphoning votes from Likud and
earning a place as a third major party.

SEATTLE'S COSTLY HOUSING MAKING IT HARDER FOR EMPLOYERS TO LURE
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN AND TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Joe Soroka survived the move from the moderately
priced and stable housing market of Cleveland to the increasingly
pricey housing market in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was a ``sizable salary increase to be motivated to
come out here,'' the banker says _ and a willingness to commute 30
miles each day from North Bend to downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew prior to coming out here it was going to be more
expensive,'' says Soroka, vice president of international banking
at KeyBank. ``It was more than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's too expensive. Soroka knows of one colleague who
declined a transfer to Seattle because of the cost of housing here.
</P>
<P>
   Other employers are hearing the same thing. A handful of recent
Lake Washington School District job offers were met with the reply
``I'd love to work there, but I can't afford to live there,'' says
Sharon Weston, employment coordinator for the Kirkland and Redmond
district.
</P>
<P>
   High prices, especially for housing, don't stop people from
coming. The vibrancy of the economy, the companies here that lead
their respective industries, the cultural life, the scenery and
even the weather are irresistible lures to many.
</P>
<P>
   But costly housing is making it increasingly difficult to
recruit employees to the region, employers say. Recruits who turn
down job offers here cite the cost of housing almost as often as
impacts on family, adds Shari Blackwood, relocation director for
the real estate firm Coldwell Banker Bain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be addressed, but it's tougher and tougher,'' says
Gayle Glew, president of Windermere Relocation, which handles about
500 transfers a month.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are using signing bonuses, cost-of-living adjustments
and other incentives where they can. But ``sticker shock is here
with us,'' says Glew.
</P>
<P>
   Sticker shock is biting both newcomers and those already here.
The median price of home and condominium sales in King County was
$208,975 in April, up 8.9 percent from the same month a year ago
and up 28 percent from April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But people still come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fall in love with the area; if they're married and have
kids, it's even worse,'' says Key Bank Vice Chairman Luke Helms.
The area's lures make them overlook or compensate for a lot of
drawbacks, like the cost of housing. Helms says they get a look at
the area and say ``Forget the rain, forget the traffic, I'm still
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   High housing prices aren't likely to choke the region's economy
because employers can't get the people they want. One reason is
that prices aren't uniform across the region. While the squeeze is
the worst in Seattle and the Eastside, a recruit to a company in
Federal Way, for example, can still find plenty of reasonably
priced houses in South King County or in Pierce County.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Seattle is by no means the least affordable housing
market in the country. San Francisco and Silicon Valley are far
worse. And as Helms notes, ``The Bay Area is booming, this one is
booming.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that high housing prices don't provoke a lot of grumbling
from those who move here. ``If they're in a 3,000-square-foot house
in Denver, Kansas City or Minneapolis, either they have to
downscale if they want to keep the payments the same,'' or they
have to pay more than they were expecting, Glew says. ``To many of
them, it's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Soroka sold a 55-year-old, 1,950-square-foot house about 12
miles from the office in Cleveland for a 3-year-old,
2,200-square-foot house in North Bend. The North Bend house cost
twice as much as the one he sold in Cleveland. And the North Bend
home probably cost a third more than a comparable recently built
home in the Cleveland area.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Williams moved the opposite direction, from Seattle to
Cleveland. An assistant vice president of executive communications
at KeyBank, Williams sold a small two-bedroom house in Shoreline _
``kind of a classic Seattle starter home'' _ for a three-bedroom,
two-bath home in Bay Village, a suburb 12 miles west of downtown
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get twice as much home for 10 percent more''
than what he had sold his Shoreline home for, Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   For that extra 10 percent, Williams not only got a house with
double the space (not counting the full basement) but private beach
rights to a neighborhood park, complete with benches and barbecue
pit, along Lake Erie. While utility costs are higher _ both because
of the winters and because Seattle has the lowest electric rates in
the country _ on the whole, he says, ``We did very very well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact this was the second move Williams has made to a more
affordable market. In 1988 he moved from Los Angeles to Seattle
because ``we thought we might be able to afford a house in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Those moving to Seattle today start with the notion of looking
for a reasonably priced home within a reasonable commute of where
they work, Helms says. ``That's out.''
</P>
<P>
   So buyers adjust. One way is to accept a longer commute (which
helps accentuate the region's traffic snarls, but that's another
issue). Soroka was wary of living north or south of downtown
because of clogged Interstate-5, but finds the traffic on
Interstate-90 comparable to what he encountered in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers may think they're moving to Seattle, and that may be
where the job is. But ``if they actually end up buying in Puyallup,
that's perfectly acceptable to them,'' Glew says.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond police Officer Craig Shanks' traffic-snarled commute
from Renton takes at least 30 minutes each day. He'd like to move
closer, but houses in Redmond were way out of his price range when
he moved from South Dakota in August.
</P>
<P>
   A Northwest native, Shanks had only been away in South Dakota
for four years. When he moved back, he was astounded by hefty
Eastside house prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the money we wanted to spend, it was horrible,'' he says
of rickety fixer-uppers selling for upwards of $200,000. ``Hence,
we live in Renton.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle-area housing market looks quite different to
roughly a dozen new deputies hired by the King County Sheriff's
office this year. They were recruited from Hawaii, where the
salaries are lower and house prices are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's office recruiters have actively looked toward Honolulu
and surrounding areas, knowing many police officers there have both
the talent and the desire to move to a place where salaries and the
cost of living aren't so far apart, according to King County
sheriff's spokesman John Urquhart.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers also console themselves with the notion of price
appreciation: Whatever they paid, they'll probably be able to sell
for more. Given the economic prospects of the region, a meltdown in
housing prices is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly important for buyers who expect to be
transferred out of this market by their employers in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are helping too. ``We've seen some significant
cost-of-living adjustments extrapolated into recruiting
proposals,'' Windermere's Glew says.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood, of Coldwell Banker Bain's relocation services, says
some employers will help recruits with the sale of their old house,
or cover closing costs and points on a new property.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't help directly with the cost of housing, employers
and relocation experts may offer other assistance. Blackwood says
employers will offer job-placement help to spouses of recruits. She
has even seen employers help recruits with relocation of elderly
parents for whom they're caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the companies, relocation is an expensive proposition,''
Blackwood says.
</P>
<P>
   But in a tight labor market, ``It's a cost of doing business,''
and businesses figure the cost is worth it if it helps retain those
employees, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a sign-on bonus has helped Bellevue's Overlake Hospital
hire nurses. There's been a shortage of candidates, and the area's
cost of living has only compounded the problem of bringing in
people, said Lori Vocca, the hospital's employment and employee
relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   The private hospital used to pay only top-level recruits for the
expense of relocating to this area. These days, the hospital gets _
and grants _ more and more requests to help people with moving
costs, Vocca said.
</P>
<P>
   Those options aren't available to all employers though. A public
school system like Lake Washington can't offer pay incentives,
bonuses or help with moving expenses, Weston says.
</P>
<P>
   It has cost the district some candidates who were ``highly
qualified and would have been a good asset for our district,'' she
says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tipper Gore was tense.
</P>
<P>
   The question before her _ about whether her husband's designs on
the presidency had to be weighed before her recent disclosure of
her struggle with depression _ did not hew to the script she had
been following.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand at all,'' she said in a chiding, deeply
disappointed voice. Her revelation, she made clear, had nothing to
do with politics.
</P>
<P>
   That was surely true. That was also not the question. It was
recast: Given the ambitions of her husband, Vice President Al Gore,
did she not consult him about the timing and impact of what she
intended to say? Did they not talk about that?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Mrs. Gore said slowly, disbelievingly. ``No. No.''
</P>
<P>
   It was late one afternoon last week, and Mrs. Gore was giving
another interview to promote the first-ever White House Conference
on Mental Health, which will be held on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is an event that she, as President Clinton's mental-health
policy adviser, was integral in planning and making happen. It is
also an event to which Mrs. Gore feels an intense personal
connection, and as it neared, she began talking publicly about her
own experience with mental illness, but in carefully chosen venues,
and on very strict terms.
</P>
<P>
   She would not say precisely when depression struck. She would
not say how long ago it lifted, or all the symptoms she exhibited,
or what medication she took.
</P>
<P>
   She would not even divulge these details to Oprah Winfrey, the
empress of empathy, who made do with assuring Mrs. Gore that
choosing mates who were dull but dutiful was the way to go. (``Give
me boring, honey,'' Ms. Winfrey had hooted. Mrs. Gore had laughed.)
</P>
<P>
   There was less laughter this time around, in a conversation that
lasted 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the first question came, she all but flinched. ``Oh,'' Mrs.
Gore said. ``Are we going to start right now?''
</P>
<P>
   When she was asked about the difficulty of being raised an only
child by a divorced mother who had had her own bouts of severe
depression, her answer was interrupted by her spokeswoman, Camille
Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you do want to dispute the fact that you had a
difficult childhood,'' Ms. Johnston told Mrs. Gore, who was silent
for several beats, and then agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' Mrs. Gore said. ``I had a great childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she had told a television reporter recently that she
was one of her husband's closest advisers, she now said that she
could not remember that comment. Ms. Johnston piped up to clarify
that it had been ``a flip remark.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, defined constantly in relation to her husband, is
supposed to be the earthy, unguarded, effervescent one. Seemingly
everyone who knows her describes her this way, and the conventional
wisdom is that in the coming campaign, she will serve as an
essential antidote to Al, the unlabored warmth to his unyielding
chill.
</P>
<P>
   But on this occasion, Mrs. Gore seemed unprepared for that
assignment. Her answers were fuzzy, cautious, aloof.
</P>
<P>
   She was asked why, on the December day when the House impeached
Clinton, she was absent from the Democratic pep rally at which her
husband proclaimed that Clinton ``will be regarded in the history
books as one of our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even remember when that was or what I might have been
doing that day,'' Mrs. Gore said. ``I may have been with my kids or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's expulsion from office would have made Gore the leader
of the free world, but Mrs. Gore said she paid limited heed to the
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on with my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that life, especially in the last decade, has been
devoted to advocacy for the mentally ill and for an enlightened
attitude toward mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the last great stigmas of the 20th
century, really, to do away with,'' she said, ``and I think that we
can educate the American public, answer questions that they have
about mental health and illnesses and dispel fear, hopefully, by
replacing it with knowledge.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That concern carries over from her childhood, no matter how
those years are described.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was hospitalized twice for depression, leaving little
Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson _ the nickname Tipper came from a favorite
lullaby, ``Tippy Tippy Tin'' _ in her grandparents' care. Her
parents broke up when Tipper was just 4, and she has said that she
felt the stigma of that at school.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was a pivotal juncture in her life, she said, it
was marrying Al Gore. She said that his political career, along
with the couple's decision to have four children, derailed the
possibility of her becoming a professional therapist. She has a
master's degree in psychology from Vanderbilt University in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The mental-health conference is one of several milestones in her
life right now. Mrs. Gore, 50, will welcome her first grandchild
into the world in about a month. The formal kickoff for her
husband's campaign is next week.
</P>
<P>
   She was rushing off after this interview to record the
president's weekly radio address with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way for people to understand me the best,'' she
said before leaving, ``is for you to understand that I'm not really
of the political milieu.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was ever true, it is not anymore. Mrs. Gore is in the
swim, and the water will only get deeper.

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY: C'mon, Grandmama, let's see you hit that trey again _ this
time when you're really fouled. NBA Eastern Conference finals Game
4: Indiana at New York, Channel 4, 6 p.m. (NBC has Game 5 Wednesday
at 6 p.m. and, if necessary, Game 6 Friday and Game 7 Sunday, TBA) 
TUESDAY: Our scouting report says Darth Hasek has had plenty of
rest, while the Stars come out of a seven-game headbanger with Ed
Belfour's bell run. The Dominator, who used to be Belfour's backup
in Chicago, wants the Cup worse than Brett Hull, and he'll get it
in five. Stanley Cup Finals Game 1: Buffalo at Dallas, Channel 11,
5 p.m. (Fox Channel 11 also has Game 2 Thursday at 5 p.m.; ESPN has
Game 3 from Buffalo on Saturday at 5 p.m.) 
WEDNESDAY: Thanks to the Angels' Spanish-language TV friends,
there's beisbol en la tarde. You know Giants fans will watch.
Angels at San Francisco, Channel 52, 12:30 p.m. 
THURSDAY: Instead of another very special rerun of ``Golden
Girls,'' Lifetime breaks out the hoop chicks. But while the Lakers
were national TV's regular-season NBA darlings, the Sparks aren't.
Their first of 32 WNBA games, against Sacramento from the Forum,
doesn't make the tube. In fact, Lisa Leslie and her lady friends
get only six national exposures. Instead, the opening-night
spotlight is reserved for the defending champion Comets, who have
almost a third of their games on either ESPN, NBC or Lifetime.
WNBA: Houston at Orlando, Lifetime, 5 p.m. (Saturday, NBC has
Washington at Houston, 1 p.m.) 
FRIDAY: The Dodgers can help the Angels by cooling off the
Athletics; the Angels can help the Dodgers by tripping up the
Diamondbacks. The whole tank wins. But how does USC get a spot in
the College World Series? Dodgers at Oakland, Channel 5, 7 p.m.;
Arizona at Angels, Fox Sports West, 7 p.m.; College World Series
tournament, ESPN, 12:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. 
SATURDAY: Tough enough to gear up a ride for a 24-hour-long race?
How about broadcasting it that long? Speedvision almost does it,
with 20 hours of live coverage from the classic from Le Mans with
four Le Broadcasters. Gentlemen, start your No-Doz. 24 Hours of
LeMans, Speedvision, 6:30 a.m. 
SUNDAY: The NBA Finals could heat up today if the East series wraps
up by Friday. Otherwise, check out who's hot heading into next
week's U.S. Open golf championship or how hot tempers will be when
we face Iran again on the soccer field. NBA Finals Game 1, Channel
4, 1:30 p.m.; PGA's St. Jude Classic final round, Channel 7, noon;
U.S. men's soccer vs. Iran, Channel 7, 10 a.m.

 &HT;    Stewart 4th, still stalking win as rookie
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ A rookie hasn't won a Winston Cup race since 1987
_ when the late Davey Allison won in his 14th start _ or finished
in the top 10 in points since 1980. But 13 races into the season,
Tony Stewart appears ready to change all that.
</P>
<P>
   The former Indy League champion finished fourth in Sunday's MBNA
Platinum 400 in the No. 20 Pontiac, his third fourth-place finish.
He led the most laps, 127. And he remained fifth in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't pay for the first three-quarters of a race,''
Stewart said of his early-race dominance. ``We're gaining ground
and we're learning. Two or three top-fours in a row. I can't be
griping about this. I'm very happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was running second to Jeff Gordon after a four-tire pit stop
on lap 368 but fell to fourth seven laps later and never got
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told 'em I thought it was time to come in,'' Stewart said.
``I felt like my tires were gone at that time. We thought it was a
little bit of a gamble, but we went for it. (Gordon) was pulling
away from us a little bit, so we thought the only chance we had to
stay close to him was to put on four tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing his four-tire strategy to teammate Bobby Labonte's
topping-off fuel stop that determined the outcome of the race,
Stewart said, ``We're one race team at the shop and two race teams
at the track. They did what they thought was best for them. We were
getting as good fuel mileage as he was but we couldn't go as long
as Bobby could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett still leads
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett finished fifth, leading once for 21 laps, to
maintain his Winston Cup points lead. He's 51 points ahead of Jeff
Burton and 69 ahead of Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is kind of the story of our season,'' Jarrett said. ``We
work hard and get better toward the end (of a race), but it's not
quite all together. If we keep coming out with top-fives we'll be
OK. It would be nice to have a day where we didn't make these
adjustments every single stop, and come out on one side or the
other where the car would be either too tight or too loose. But
that's not happening right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Earliest exit
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schrader, who started 16th, saw his day pretty much
destroyed on the seventh lap of the 400-lap race when his No. 33
Chevy was severely damaged by a crash into the front-stretch wall.
By the time the front end was cut off the car and patched together,
Schrader was 261 laps down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 28 car (Kenny Irwin) got into the back of me,'' Schrader
said. ``Everybody checked up (when Dick Trickle's No. 91 Chevy got
loose) and he didn't. With the banking here, you get little help.
You're not going to get it gathered back up.Pit accident
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Tracey, the gasman-truck driver for Rusty Wallace, injured
his left ankle in a pit mishap just before the third caution
period. According to team officials, Tracey was hit by an airgun
and a lugnut that spun off a tire as Wallace was leaving the pits.
He went to a local hospital to check for a possible hairline
fracture. Someone else had to drive Wallace's hauler home.
</P>
<P>
   Job swap at Sabco
</P>
<P>
   The two struggling Chevrolets of Team Sabco swapped crew chiefs
this weekend to try to change their luck. Scott Eggleston became
crew chief for Sabco's No. 40 Chevrolet and driver Sterling Marlin.
He moved the 20 feet or so in the team garage from where he was
crew chief for the No. 42 Chevy driven by Joe Nemechek. Team
manager Tony Glover will serve as interim crew chief for Nemechek.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin is 18th in Winston Cup points with one top-10 finish in
10 starts; Nemechek is 35th in points with one top 10. Nemechek
finished 25th after starting 27th Sunday; Marlin was 29th after
starting 33rd.

BIRD'S LESSON TO MILLER: HOW TO BE A SUPERSTAR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Bird always incorporated his Boston teammates
into the Celtics' offense, even encouraging them to shoot more when
they, too, became flammable. But if a crucial game was still
undecided in the final two minutes, well, the ball was going to
Bird; he had no qualms about phasing everyone else out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday if he ever deferred to Kevin McHale in that type of
situation, the coach of the Indiana Pacers curtly said, ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to get his behind out there and stand, and I'll go
in the post for a while,'' he said. ``Jordan is the same way.
Scottie could score six or eight points, but when it came down to
the last two minutes of the game, you knew who was going to have
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we have to do with Reggie. Reggie's got to have
the ball in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day the Pacers were recovering psychologically from Larry
Johnson's devastating four-point play that stole Game 3, Bird
challenged his best player to return to his clutch ways. His words
were spare, his demeanor matter-of-fact. But the message was clear:
from one superstar to another _ behave like one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get the ball,'' Bird said, referring to Indiana's last
ill-fated possession that ended with Mark Jackson's fumbling in the
lane and releasing a difficult turnaround jump shot that fell a few
inches short. ``If you have to run out there and take it out of
Mark's hands, go get the ball. That's the way it is. Superstars are
supposed to go and get the basketball. Reggie didn't do it last
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller hit two free throws with two seconds left to win Game 2
on Tuesday in Indianapolis, but his late-game heroics have
dissipated almost as much as his numbers have for most of the
Eastern Conference finals. He has made less than 43 percent of his
shots and is averaging 15.6 points a game in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing statistic for Bird was Miller's scoring
total in the final 16 minutes 38 seconds of Game 3: 0. It is
baffling to Bird that Miller, a fabled Knick assassin, became
another role player in the final seconds on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bird put some of the onus on himself for failing to free Miller
for shots, and he gave credit to a stingy and menacing Knicks
defense that double-teams Miller on nearly every pick-and-roll
opportunity. Yet Bird's overriding theme focused on Miller's
mind-set; how the sinewy shooting guard needed to revert to being
the player who has haunted New York for much of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, Reggie gets in this mind-set: `Well, they're
playing well, they're moving the ball well. I come off the pick,
they're going to double-team me, so let's let them play and go
ahead and finish this game out,''' Bird said. ``But you don't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller graciously took his lumps Sunday after the Pacers'
practice at Madison Square Garden, vowing to come out firing Monday
night. ``No question, I've got to be more aggressive,'' he said,
sitting casually in the Garden stands. ``I've got to shoot more, 15
to 20, sometimes even 25 shots. I think that's going to be the case
in Game 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that he and Allan Houston were essentially canceling
each other out and that he had to do a better job of trying to make
Houston guard him one-on-one. But ultimately he came back to Bird's
point about seizing the moment, saying, ``I think I'll just be a
ball hog and just run to the ball and shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, the Pacers are an extension of Bird, the Hall
of Fame player. Chris Mullin, the slow-footed forward with the
deadeye shot and deceptively quick hands. Jackson, with his
unparalleled ability to see a play before it develops. And Miller,
the money player unafraid to hoist a game-winning 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when one of those parts does not work correctly, the
Pacers look nothing like Bird; Miller and the rest resemble any
malfunctioning team that draws its coach's ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember back when they were in the Eastern Conference
finals, when I wasn't coaching,'' Bird said. ``I'd watch and look
in the paper and say: `Wow, Miller just shot 12 times. You can't
win games with Miller shooting 12 times.' Well, now I'm in it and
he's shooting nine. So it shows what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird spoke to Miller privately Sunday about exerting more
influence on the series, which the Knicks lead 2-1 . But it's
unclear whether the message got through. After all, they had the
same type of talk about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ask him,'' Bird said. ``I said: `Reggie, there's times
during a game when you got to be selfish. All superstars are.'''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has brought many crazy, surreal moments to this rivalry
over the past seven years, and it speaks to his greatness in the
clutch that Bird and others now expect it from him. Maybe his tank
is emptying with all those fresh bodies the Knicks are throwing at
him. Maybe he's merely a spot-up jump shooter who is very human
with a hand in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Miller is about to add cruelly to New York's
post-season misery, waiting as always for the proper moment to
deliver his team and demoralize Spike Lee's.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, before he ever makes another game-winning shot, a
more immediate task awaits: Reggie Miller must first find a way to
get open and take one. &QL;

SEATTLE'S COSTLY HOUSING MAKING IT HARDER FOR EMPLOYERS TO LURE
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN AND TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Joe Soroka survived the move from the moderately
priced and stable housing market of Cleveland to the increasingly
pricey housing market in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was a ``sizable salary increase to be motivated to
come out here,'' the banker says _ and a willingness to commute 30
miles each day from North Bend to downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew prior to coming out here it was going to be more
expensive,'' says Soroka, vice president of international banking
at KeyBank. ``It was more than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's too expensive. Soroka knows of one colleague who
declined a transfer to Seattle because of the cost of housing here.
</P>
<P>
   Other employers are hearing the same thing. A handful of recent
Lake Washington School District job offers were met with the reply
``I'd love to work there, but I can't afford to live there,'' says
Sharon Weston, employment coordinator for the Kirkland and Redmond
district.
</P>
<P>
   High prices, especially for housing, don't stop people from
coming. The vibrancy of the economy, the companies here that lead
their respective industries, the cultural life, the scenery and
even the weather are irresistible lures to many.
</P>
<P>
   But costly housing is making it increasingly difficult to
recruit employees to the region, employers say. Recruits who turn
down job offers here cite the cost of housing almost as often as
impacts on family, adds Shari Blackwood, relocation director for
the real estate firm Coldwell Banker Bain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be addressed, but it's tougher and tougher,'' says
Gayle Glew, president of Windermere Relocation, which handles about
500 transfers a month.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are using signing bonuses, cost-of-living adjustments
and other incentives where they can. But ``sticker shock is here
with us,'' says Glew.
</P>
<P>
   Sticker shock is biting both newcomers and those already here.
The median price of home and condominium sales in King County was
$208,975 in April, up 8.9 percent from the same month a year ago
and up 28 percent from April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But people still come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fall in love with the area; if they're married and have
kids, it's even worse,'' says Key Bank Vice Chairman Luke Helms.
The area's lures make them overlook or compensate for a lot of
drawbacks, like the cost of housing. Helms says they get a look at
the area and say ``Forget the rain, forget the traffic, I'm still
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   High housing prices aren't likely to choke the region's economy
because employers can't get the people they want. One reason is
that prices aren't uniform across the region. While the squeeze is
the worst in Seattle and the Eastside, a recruit to a company in
Federal Way, for example, can still find plenty of reasonably
priced houses in South King County or in Pierce County.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Seattle is by no means the least affordable housing
market in the country. San Francisco and Silicon Valley are far
worse. And as Helms notes, ``The Bay Area is booming, this one is
booming.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that high housing prices don't provoke a lot of grumbling
from those who move here. ``If they're in a 3,000-square-foot house
in Denver, Kansas City or Minneapolis, either they have to
downscale if they want to keep the payments the same,'' or they
have to pay more than they were expecting, Glew says. ``To many of
them, it's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Soroka sold a 55-year-old, 1,950-square-foot house about 12
miles from the office in Cleveland for a 3-year-old,
2,200-square-foot house in North Bend. The North Bend house cost
twice as much as the one he sold in Cleveland. And the North Bend
home probably cost a third more than a comparable recently built
home in the Cleveland area.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Williams moved the opposite direction, from Seattle to
Cleveland. An assistant vice president of executive communications
at KeyBank, Williams sold a small two-bedroom house in Shoreline _
``kind of a classic Seattle starter home'' _ for a three-bedroom,
two-bath home in Bay Village, a suburb 12 miles west of downtown
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get twice as much home for 10 percent more''
than what he had sold his Shoreline home for, Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   For that extra 10 percent, Williams not only got a house with
double the space (not counting the full basement) but private beach
rights to a neighborhood park, complete with benches and barbecue
pit, along Lake Erie. While utility costs are higher _ both because
of the winters and because Seattle has the lowest electric rates in
the country _ on the whole, he says, ``We did very very well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact this was the second move Williams has made to a more
affordable market. In 1988 he moved from Los Angeles to Seattle
because ``we thought we might be able to afford a house in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Those moving to Seattle today start with the notion of looking
for a reasonably priced home within a reasonable commute of where
they work, Helms says. ``That's out.''
</P>
<P>
   So buyers adjust. One way is to accept a longer commute (which
helps accentuate the region's traffic snarls, but that's another
issue). Soroka was wary of living north or south of downtown
because of clogged Interstate-5, but finds the traffic on
Interstate-90 comparable to what he encountered in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers may think they're moving to Seattle, and that may be
where the job is. But ``if they actually end up buying in Puyallup,
that's perfectly acceptable to them,'' Glew says.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond police Officer Craig Shanks' traffic-snarled commute
from Renton takes at least 30 minutes each day. He'd like to move
closer, but houses in Redmond were way out of his price range when
he moved from South Dakota in August.
</P>
<P>
   A Northwest native, Shanks had only been away in South Dakota
for four years. When he moved back, he was astounded by hefty
Eastside house prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the money we wanted to spend, it was horrible,'' he says
of rickety fixer-uppers selling for upwards of $200,000. ``Hence,
we live in Renton.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle-area housing market looks quite different to
roughly a dozen new deputies hired by the King County Sheriff's
office this year. They were recruited from Hawaii, where the
salaries are lower and house prices are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's office recruiters have actively looked toward Honolulu
and surrounding areas, knowing many police officers there have both
the talent and the desire to move to a place where salaries and the
cost of living aren't so far apart, according to King County
sheriff's spokesman John Urquhart.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers also console themselves with the notion of price
appreciation: Whatever they paid, they'll probably be able to sell
for more. Given the economic prospects of the region, a meltdown in
housing prices is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly important for buyers who expect to be
transferred out of this market by their employers in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are helping too. ``We've seen some significant
cost-of-living adjustments extrapolated into recruiting
proposals,'' Windermere's Glew says.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwood, of Coldwell Banker Bain's relocation services, says
some employers will help recruits with the sale of their old house,
or cover closing costs and points on a new property.
</P>
<P>
   If they can't help directly with the cost of housing, employers
and relocation experts may offer other assistance. Blackwood says
employers will offer job-placement help to spouses of recruits. She
has even seen employers help recruits with relocation of elderly
parents for whom they're caring.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the companies, relocation is an expensive proposition,''
Blackwood says.
</P>
<P>
   But in a tight labor market, ``It's a cost of doing business,''
and businesses figure the cost is worth it if it helps retain those
employees, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a sign-on bonus has helped Bellevue's Overlake Hospital
hire nurses. There's been a shortage of candidates, and the area's
cost of living has only compounded the problem of bringing in
people, said Lori Vocca, the hospital's employment and employee
relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   The private hospital used to pay only top-level recruits for the
expense of relocating to this area. These days, the hospital gets _
and grants _ more and more requests to help people with moving
costs, Vocca said.
</P>
<P>
   Those options aren't available to all employers though. A public
school system like Lake Washington can't offer pay incentives,
bonuses or help with moving expenses, Weston says.
</P>
<P>
   It has cost the district some candidates who were ``highly
qualified and would have been a good asset for our district,'' she
says.

RECENT SHOOTINGS PUT SCHOOL RIFLE TEAMS UNDER MORE SCRUTINY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ga., Tenn., Ky, Miss. Ark., Colo.)   By RENWICK McLEAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some school-sponsored rifle teams and officer
training programs have come under scrutiny in recent weeks as
administrators redouble efforts to rid their schools of guns in the
wake of the Columbine High School shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Those schools with shooting ranges where competitive rifle teams
practice, are a particular concern for parents, administrators and
advocates of school safety who are uneasy about the proximity of
guns to classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Va., for example, members of the rifle team for
Yorktown High School have been honing their shooting skills in the
dusty basement of the main school building for years. But now the
shooting range is drawing passionate opposition from parents and
may be turned into storage space as part of a plan to make room for
extra classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal to ease crowding by abandoning the range
space predates the recent school shooting, the Arlington School
Board is now examining the issue through the lens of school
violence and gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the whole concept of whether it's appropriate to
have a rifle range in the school has become a consideration, even
though it wasn't originally,'' said Lisa Farbstein, spokeswoman for
Arlington Public Schools. Safety ``will be a factor in the school
board's decision,'' Ms. Farbstein said.
</P>
<P>
   For some parents, keeping guns out of schools has become
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I detest guns, and I don't think they belong in our schools,''
said Martha Rutter, whose daughter, Katie, is a junior at Yorktown.
``I am completely against the range.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of high school rifle teams nationwide is difficult to
determine because most operate outside the auspices of state
athletic associations. Gary L. Anderson, a two-time target-shooting
Olympic gold medalist in the 300-meter rifle and the director of
the Wolf Creek Olympic Shooting Complex in Atlanta, Ga., estimated
that the total is 800 to 900. The vast majority of them use only
air rifles, he said, but several use the more powerful .22-caliber
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps sponsor 2,587
Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs at high schools in
all 50 states, reaching hundreds of thousands of youngsters. Rifle
training is a frequent _ but not mandatory _ part of the
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the Clinton administration has advocated ``zero
tolerance'' for guns in schools, and the Department of Education
reported in its most recent Annual Report on School Safety that in
1996-97, 91 percent of public schools in the United States had
adopted such policies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Secondary School Principals, has no
policy about rifle teams training on school grounds. It promotes a
``zero-tolerance policy concerning weapons in school,'' and says
school weapons policies must be ``blindly enforced across the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of school safety point to what they view as a
contradiction between those policies and school-sponsored rifle
training. They say concerns about violence have prompted more and
more school districts to reexamine such sports and training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a double standard,'' said Ronald D. Stephens, the
Executive Director of the National School Safety Center. ``What are
school administrators supposed to do when students are carrying
weapons on campus in connection with JROTC and other rifle training
programs?''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hetler, a training technician for the JROTC Directorate at
U.S. Army Cadet Command, dismissed the suggestion that rifle
training by the program presents any threat to students. ``None of
these kids are ever without adult supervision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash against rifle shooting on campus has affected
schools with a strong tradition in the sport, like Montgomery Bell
Academy in Nashville, Tenn. The school's rifle coach, Leo Lujan,
fears that his proposal for a new shooting facility on school
grounds will be doomed. ``If this continues, I am sure it will
affect our ability to raise funds for the range,'' Lujan said. The
new range would cost about $250,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Gioia, the academy's headmaster, said that if the project
is approved, ``we will have to do a really good job articulating
why we want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery Bell rifle team, which has been a part of the
academy's extracurricular life for several decades, uses a room at
the school for practice. But while Gioia praised the rifle coach's
commitment to safety, he said the Littleton killings have made him
anxious about holding rifle practice in the school. ``I would put
more controls on it now than ever before,'' he said. ``Anyone
following the news would have concerns, as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of high school rifle teams say the sport is being
unfairly maligned in response to the school shootings in Littleton
and those in in West Paducah, Ky.; Pearl, Miss., and Springfield,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a bit disappointed that some people associate school
violence with a legitimate team sport,'' said Keith Dowling, a
sophomore marksman on the rifle team at Yorktown High School who
hopes to continue competitive shooting in college. ``It's a great
sport, and just like any other, it teaches you sportsmanship,
responsibility, and cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the gold medal winner, echoed the student's concerns
and called the scrutiny an overreaction.'' If anything, he
contended, ``people that are taught marksmanship are even less
likely do anything dangerous with a gun.''

 Co-Founder Talks About Life After Wired  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Louis Rossetto turned 50 yesterday.
<P>
   He's got a 2-year-old son and a 10-day-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He's investing in high-brow online smut.
</P>
<P>
   And he refuses to talk about Wired.
</P>
<P>
   As painful as it was for the pioneering publisher to leave the
company he founded, he said in a phone interview that it's not his
place to critique the new management's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should be making comments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossetto and his wife and business partner, Jane Metcalfe, live
in Berkeley and spend much of their time raising their kids, Orson
and Zoe. While Rossetto is thinking about his next venture, that's
probably not coming any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably have lots of other businesses,'' he said. ``The
question is, do I have anything to prove? Do I have a passion like
I had a passion for Wired?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wired was an all-consuming, 24-7 commitment that Jane and I
were on since 1991,'' he said. ``After that, it's time to take a
sabbatical and get reconnected to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm blessed,'' he said. ``I don't know how many fathers have
the opportunity to spend as much time with their children as I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also blessed with riches from his days at Wired. The
magazine was sold to Advance Publications for $90 million, and the
Web business he built, Wired Digital, should wrap up its sale to
Lycos for more than $300 million later this month. While Rossetto
and Metcalfe will see only a fraction of that money, they certainly
will realize a gain of millions. In the Wired Digital deal alone,
each received $1 million in severance pay and $500,000 in exchange
for uncashed stock options.
</P>
<P>
   They also will end up holding about 270,000 shares apiece of
Lycos stock. Lycos stock closed Friday at $91, valuing Rossetto and
Metcalfe's stakes at nearly $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go into it to become wealthy,'' Rossetto said. ``I'm
astounded at what an editor ended up with.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already dabbling in investments; one is Nerve.com, the New
York proprietor of what he calls ``intelligent smut.'' He likened
the erotica on the Web site to Henry Miller's writings, calling it
``sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm helping people who have vision and passion, and they're
also smart and have a good idea,'' Rossetto said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossetto's story is a remarkable one, and it has yet to be fully
told: how a long-haired expatriate returned to the United States,
founded a magazine and built a $60 million company and then lost
control as the digital revolution he heralded engulfed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much material success that I got out of it, there's the
life lesson it taught me,'' he said. ``People can make lots of
money and not necessarily learn the things that I learned.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Learning comes from success as well as failure and
adversity,'' he said. ``I've had my share of all of those, and in
very intense quantities.''

 Fast Chip Lets Laptops Play 3-D Games  &HT;       
 By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Forget solitaire. Laptop-toting travelers soon may be able to while
away the airborne hours with Quake, Unreal and other hot 3-D action
games.
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At least that's what S3 Inc. says its new graphics chips for
mobile computers will make possible. The Santa Clara company claims
that its Savage/MX and Savage/IX 3-D accelerators will deliver
three times the speed and six times the image quality of the chips
now used in notebook PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Overall performance won't match that of the latest graphics
chips for desktop PCs, but it'll be good enough, S3 said, to make
leading games playable on laptops for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The new chips will go into mass production by the end of this
month, according to the company. Notebook PCs that include them
should show up on retail shelves by September, in plenty of time
for the holiday shopping season. S3 said ``numerous top-tier PC
manufacturers'' are redesigning their notebooks to incorporate the
Savage chips, but officials declined to name specific customers.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Glaskowsky, senior editor of the Microprocessor Report, an
industry newsletter published in Sebastopol, said he's seen actual
games running on prototypes of the mobile Savage chips. ``They
looked fine to me,'' he said. ``Not as good as on a 500-MHz Pentium
III with a Voodoo card (a 3-D accelerator favored by desktop
gamers), but that doesn't matter _ people don't expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Glaskowsky said, few notebook models have graphics
chips tailored to 3-D, but ``eventually, they all will.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chips owe their speed, plus the low power consumption
required of notebook chips, in large part to the new,
state-of-the-art production process S3 will use to build them.
Circuits on the chips will be only .18 micron wide, or about one
five-hundredth the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile Savage chips also will let users connect their
notebooks to standard desktop monitors and use both screens at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   The new products could boost S3's effort to pull out of a severe
slump, Glaskowsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989, the company led the market in graphics chips
for PCs through the mid-1990s. But it fell behind competitors such
as ATI Technologies, and in 1998, it reported losses of $113.2
million on a 46-percent drop in sales compared with the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, S3 lost another $13.9 million
and sales were down 48.5 percent compared with the same quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But its Savage4 graphics chip for desktop PCs, introduced in
February, has been well received, and first-quarter sales were up
slightly from the last quarter of 1998.

PLENTY OF QUALITY TO GO AROUND AT 25TH SEATTLE INTERNATIONAL FILM
FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``Run Lola Run,'' an exhilarating German film about a
woman frantically trying to raise money to pay off her boyfriend's
debt to gangsters, received the Golden Space Needle award for best
picture Sunday in the closing ceremonies of the 25th Seattle
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Everett was voted best actor for his performance in ``An
Ideal Husband;'' Piper Laurie was named best actress for her
performance in ``The Mao Game;'' John Sayles was selected best
director for `Limbo;'' and ``Buena Vista Social Club'' was honored
as the best documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The two American Independent Awards went to ``Dead Dogs'' and
Laurie (her second prize of the day); and the three awards in the
New Director's Showcase competition were divided among Belgium's
``Rosie,'' the Czech Republic's ``The Bed'' and Norway's ``Only
Clouds Move the Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards and the official closing night presentation, ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' capped 25 days of frantic film
activity in the city and screenings of some 206 films _ SIFF's
largest lineup ever _ and, once again, a figure no other American
film festival can come close to matching.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best-attended festival ever (up 8 percent from last
year, with a projected attendance of 142,560), and, to my mind, the
best festival of the '90s in terms of quality. Festival director
Darryl Macdonald said going in that this 25th SIFF would be
``something special,'' and he more than made good on the promise.
</P>
<P>
   It was the festival that had something for everyone, and a bit
more: five filmmaker tributes, 25 classic revivals, 20
documentaries, appearances by literally hundreds of filmmaker
guests _ climaxing with a spectacular, goosebump-inducing
presentation of the 1925 ``Battleship Potemkin'' (accompanied by
the full Bellevue Philharmonic Orchestra) that is sure to go down
as one of the greatest moments in SIFF history.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were the usual flub-ups and no-shows that
invariably plague any film festival (the much-advertised, 25th
anniversary souvenir booklet, for instance, somehow didn't get
printed, and is now scheduled to come out for next year's 26th). I
also didn't attend a single event that started on time.
</P>
<P>
   But these annoyances were barely noticed, the vibes were
exceedingly good, and less complaining was heard in the queues than
in any festival of recent memory _ largely, I think, because the
films were overwhelmingly good. Out of the 80-plus entries I
managed to see, I can count the stinkers on one hand, and thus will
have to forgo my usual ritual of revenge: a festival ten-worst
list.
</P>
<P>
   The number of low-budget American independent films _ a figure
that has grown astronomically in the '90s _ was significantly
slashed for the 25th, and, clearly, a much tougher selection
process was exercised. Many of the films that made the cut still
were forgettable, but most justified their presence in the lineup
with a stand-out performance, an intriguing storyline or a flash of
embryonic talent somewhere in the credits.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, SIFF '99 lived up to the ``I'' in its initials by
delivering its strongest slate of foreign films in many years: a
testament both to the programmers' determination to make the 25th
festival a landmark edition and to the fact that the international
cinema genuinely seems to be in the first stages on a badly needed
creative renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this may have been the first SIFF in which I caught at
least one memorable film from each of 30 countries, and from every
region of the world: such happy surprises as the Czech Republic's
``Sekal Must Die,'' Ireland's ``Sweety Barrett,'' Tunisia's ``Bent
Familia,'' Russia's ``Day of the Full Moon,'' Taiwan's ``Jam,'' and
Australia's ``The Castle.''
</P>
<P>
   There were almost as many foreign films that, because of the
daunting 206-film lineup, I missed, but which generated
enthusiastic reviews and audience word-of-mouth, including
Yugoslavia's ``Black Cat, White Cat,'' Greece's ``Shores of
Twilight,'' France's ``Lautrec,'' and Italy's ``Besieged.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is my list of 10 festival discoveries that are definitely
worth catching when (and if) they come back to town for a
theatrical run:
</P>
<P>
   Earth _ Incorrectly labeled a Canadian film in the SIFF program,
this heartbreaking Indian drama set in Lahore just before and
during the partition of India in 1947 is a stunning historic epic,
and a profound examination of the 20th century's seminal and
still-bloodiest outbreak of communal violence. Opens in September.
</P>
<P>
   An Ideal Husband _ This British comedy is arguably the movies'
best adaptation of an Oscar Wilde play: a witty, stylish character
piece and delicious slice of late-Victorian London society, with
Rupert Everett at his scene-stealing best muttering Wildean
epigrams from the corner of his mouth. Opens June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Adrenaline Drive _ Shinonu Yaguchi demonstrates once again why
he is considered Japan's hottest comedy director with this uniquely
charming and frequently hilarious farce about a timid rental-car
clerk and a meek nurse who fall in love while on the run with a bag
of the Yakuza's money. No opening scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Last Night _ This offbeat Canadian ensemble tragicomedy,
directed by actor Don McKellar and set in a Toronto counting down
the final hours before the end of the Planet Earth is a funny,
scary and surprisingly emotionally powerful examination of a human
species in a strange state of denial. Opens in September.
</P>
<P>
   Return With Honor _ This absorbing, sobering documentary about
the U.S. POWs in Hanoi during the Vietnam War (which incorporates
recently released footage from the Vietnamese government) is an
epic story of prison survival comparable to such classics in the
genre as ``Papillon'' and ``Birdman of Alcatraz.'' Opens July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Run Lola Run _ Incorporating animation, rock-video techniques
and director Tom Tykwer's unique story-telling style, this German
celebration of speed _ showing three alternate plot-lines as its
heroine has 20 minutes to raise 100,000 marks to save her
boyfriend's life _ powers along like a truck on the Autobahn. Opens
June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Contract _ It's not quite ``The French Connection'' or
``Day of the Jackal,'' but this what-if, Swedish nail-biter about a
maverick cop who stumbles on the 1986 conspiracy to assassinate
Prime Minister Olaf Palme is an irresistible paranoid thriller that
proves Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on the genre. No opening
date scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates of Silicon Valley _ This made-for-cable, dual biopic
which chronicles the rise of Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple
Computer's Steve Jobs in the '70s and '80s _ and basically contends
the two tycoons stole the ideas that made them so fabulously
wealthy _ is fast, wildly irreverent, outrageous fun. Airs on TNT,
beginning June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Jinnah _ British actor Christoper Lee plays Mohammed Ali Jinnah,
the Father of Pakistan, in this absorbing biography that sugarcoats
some aspects of his life, but is mostly an eye-filling and
fair-minded epic designed to boost Jinnah's legacy as an
alternative to the Taliban-like Muslim extremists now trying to
take over that country. No opening date scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   To Walk With Lions _ This superb British/South African drama,
roughly a sequel to 1966's ``Born Free,'' is a passionate
environmental plea, a extraordinary character study (with a
towering performance by Richard Harris), and a disturbing,
mournful, poignant ode to the passing of the African wilderness in
our lifetime. No opening date scheduled.

 Column: 2 Companies Racing for a Genetic Cure for Hemophilia  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Chiron Corp. has joined the race to use gene therapy to cure
hemophilia.
<P>
   Scientists working with the Emeryville firm treated their first
human volunteer this week. Avigen Inc. of Alameda is testing a
similar gene-therapy approach to curing hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, scientists have conducted more than 200
human trials that used some form of genetic therapy to cure a
variety of diseases. Every single experiment has failed. Scientists
say one reason for the flops is that gene therapies have tackled
complex diseases like cancers, which can have several causes.
</P>
<P>
   But hemophilia is simple. Our bodies have two different genes _
Factor 8 and Factor 9 _ that promote blood clotting. Hemophiliacs
lack one of these two genes. Supply the missing gene and the
problem should be licked.
</P>
<P>
   This is a race both companies could win. Chiron is testing a
gene therapy for Factor 8. Avigen is trying to cure the Factor 9
deficiency. Avigen recently got Food and Drug Administration
approval to begin human tests.
</P>
<P>
   The whole industry is keeping its fingers crossed. If Chiron and
Avigen can't make gene therapy work on hemophilia, what hope is
there for using gene therapy on heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   The strategy behind gene therapy is to put viruses to good use.
A virus is simply a small amount of genetic material that knows how
to burrow into cells. Viruses can be annoying or deadly if they
carry harmful genetic material. But genetic engineers can replace
the disease-causing stuff inside a virus with a beneficial gene.
The idea is to turn the virus into a delivery truck to carry
genetic cures into our cells.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron Chief Scientific Officer Lewis Williams gave a condensed
explanation of the test his company began this week.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-year-old hemophiliac in Pittsburg was given a small dose of
liquid intravenously. The liquid contained billions of virus
particles, into which Chiron had engineered the genetic material
for Factor 8.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron expects these virus particles will flow through the
bloodstream, and catch certain cells in the act of dividing to form
new cells. Chiron has used a type of virus that can only inject its
genetic payload into a cell while it is dividing.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the virus will deliver Factor 8. Once the virus
penetrates a cell, that cell should start producing the chemical
needed for blood clotting, helping the hemophiliac.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron's viral delivery agents must work quickly. The patient's
immune system treats most viruses as invaders and tries to wipe
them out. Chiron estimates its genetic therapy agents will only
survive for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Now you have a sense of why 300 previous experiments have
failed. We'll stay in touch with our local hopefuls in the gene
therapy race.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BIOFEEDBACK &LR; : My May 24 column on bioengineered foods and
butterflies touched a chord with readers, who e-mailed me comments
ranging from aggravation with my snide treatment of critics, to
appreciation that I'd raised the issue at all.
</P>
<P>
   I'll share the highlights of these critiques here.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cox expressed dismay at my ``shockingly naive and
biased'' portrayal of biotech critics as ``malodorous, dreadlocked
romantics or boring Euro-crats.'' Cox, a physics professor at the
University of California at Davis, said many scientists are leery
of the rapid introduction of genetically engineered crops into the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Lowe, an Oakland consultant in the field of sustainable
agriculture, said one scientific concern is that genes engineered
into domesticated crops might jump to wild plants through natural
cross-breeding, with unforeseen environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heilig said Mendocino County authors Marc Lappe and Britt
Bailey made some good observations about bioengineered foods in
``Against the Grain,'' a book from Common Courage Press.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Purves of Berkeley picked up on a point in my column that
said Europeans support small farms to a far greater extent than
Americans. Purves said he has friends in Canada and Wales who get
government subsidies to run small farms. He used to think that was
silly, but now views the subsidies as helping to preserve ``skills
and knowledge that might get lost in the free market.''
</P>
<P>
   On a similar theme, John Lynch suggested Bay Area people are
``closer'' to their food than most Americans, as evidenced by their
support for organic produce and farmers' markets.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for these and similar thoughts I don't have room to
share. One of my biggest pleasures as a writer is getting the sort
of responses that let me know I've touched a nerve _ even when your
first line is ``Of all the nerve.''
</P>

 Microsoft To Push Office 2000  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft Corp., looking to maintain its stranglehold on the
business software market, officially will launch its new Office
2000 before about 600 invited guests today at the Sony Metreon
center in San Francisco.
<P>
   Office 2000 will hit retail shelves Thursday. It is the first
major upgrade in two and a half years to Microsoft's Office 97
package of word-processing, spreadsheet and e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   Today's formal launch, starting with a 1 p.m. keynote speech by
Microsoft President Steve Ballmer, is expected mainly to be a
promotional event for selected customers and computer trade
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Redmond, Wash., software giant actually began
shipping the final version of Office 2000 to new computer
manufacturers on March 25. The product already is in the hands of
about 1 million corporate customers that were involved in testing.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery began installing the program
in its 1,000 desktop computers in 20 locations around the world in
early April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it: It's stable, it's fast, and it has great new
features,'' said Brian Shelden, director of information services
for the Oakville winery.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it's crucial for Microsoft to persuade customers
like Mondavi to upgrade to Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Office 97, used by about 100 million customers worldwide,
generated about $4.8 billion in sales last year, about one-third of
Microsoft's $14.5 billion in revenues for fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry estimates, Office holds 85 to 95 percent
of the market for business productivity software, easily dominating
competitors like Corel Corp., which released its new WordPerfect
2000 on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   J.P Morgan analyst William Epifanio &UR;  &LR; projects that Office 2000
will generate about $5.8 billion in revenue for 1999 and $6.3
billion for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office 2000 represents Microsoft's single biggest product,''
Epifanio said. ``Given that Microsoft has about 95 percent market
share, Microsoft's key competitor is itself. The critical thing is
to get people to upgrade, and Office will succeed at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 packages the latest versions of Microsoft's Word for
word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for
presentations and Outlook for e-mail. Prices will range from $209
for a small business version to $799 for the full premium version
for new users.
</P>
<P>
   The new Office is easier to install and maintain, said Microsoft
group product manager Andrew Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Office can install individual programs automatically only when
needed, so they're not hogging space on a hard drive. For example,
Dixon said, if a PC user never uses spreadsheets but gets one in
e-mail, Office automatically will install the Excel program or
access it from a network server so the user can read the document.
If the user doesn't expect to use Excel again, it can be deleted
from the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Office automatically can replace a file needed to run
a program if it accidentally is deleted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Reducing maintenance costs should be a big selling point for
corporate computer system managers, said Dwight Davis, a Microsoft
analyst for the technology research firm Summit Strategies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to set up a standard configuration and distribute it
across all desktops electronically as opposed to going to each
desktop,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Other new features will let users cut and paste up to 12
different items in Word, instead of only one at a time, and make it
easier to put together group mailing lists in Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Also, documents can be saved in the HTML format, which is
designed to make creating Web pages and sharing documents through
the Internet simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not enamored with Web publishing and Web
integration, there might not be any compelling reason to upgrade
immediately,'' Davis said. And the new Office is ``very demanding
on system resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 computer problem also may slow Office sales as
companies halt new software purchases until after the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because Office 97 is already in widespread use, ``I
wouldn't sell Office 2000 short,'' Davis said.

 New Device Does E-Mail Without a PC  &HT;       
 By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Cidco Inc. last week began selling a new $99 device designed to
get Grandma online _ without a PC.
</P>
<P>
   The MailStation is dedicated to one purpose: sending and
receiving e-mail. The narrow focus, Cidco officials said, let them
make the MailStation inexpensive and simple enough for customers to
master quickly, even if they have no computer experience.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The machine plugs into a standard phone jack. Service from
Cidco costs $99 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's hooked up, users can check to see if they have mail at
any time, just by pushing a button labeled ``Get e-mail,'' or they
can have the MailStation do it for them automatically every every
four, eight, 12 or 24 hours. When mail has been downloaded but not
yet read, a small light on top of the unit flashes.
</P>
<P>
   No setup will be required, Cidco said, because it will configure
each unit at its factory with an e-mail address and local access
number.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a Morgan Hill telecommunications equipment
manufacturer best known for its Caller ID devices, said seniors
looking for a way to communicate with family and friends are likely
to be the largest market for the MailStation. The company also aims
to market the product to ``boomers without PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   The MailStation is about the size of a hardcover book. It
includes a laptop-style keyboard with keys about 85 percent of
normal size, plus an adjustable-angle screen that's 6 inches wide
and 2.25 inches high. A modem that runs at 33.6 kilobits per second
and a 20,000-word spelling checker are built in.
</P>
<P>
   The MailStation comes with an AC adapter, but it will also work
for three to six weeks on three AA batteries, according to Cidco.
It connects to any phone jack via a standard phone line, and
there's an extra connector on the back so buyers can keep a phone,
answering machine and the device all connected to the same jack.
</P>
<P>
   The device has enough memory _ 384 kilobytes _ to store 300 to
400 typical e-mail messages. There's no way to save messages to
disk, but they can be printed out on Hewlett-Packard, Canon or
compatible inkjet or laser printers. The MailStation keeps a log of
outgoing messages that have been sent, but doesn't save their
contents.
</P>
<P>
   MailStation buyers are entitled to up to five e-mail addresses.
Messages are limited to 1,000 words, graphics and sound can't be
included, and any attached files _ even Word documents _ are
removed when the MailStation retrieves a message. But users who
have access to a PC will have the option of getting their mail
complete with attached files on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who don't want to sign up for a full year's service
can buy the MailStation for $149 and pay $9.95 per month for
service.
</P>
<P>
   Cidco's Web site,  &LR; www.cidco.com,  &LR; currently refers potential
buyers to a toll-free number, but online sales are scheduled to
begin next month. Eventually, the device will also be available
through retail outlets and selected Internet service providers and
local phone companies, officials said.

 Column: UC Berkeley Students Ticked Off at Idea of Online Charges  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It seems like old times at the University of California at
Berkeley.
<P>
   Whistle-blowing graduate students are howling in outrage at a
hush-hush plan by school administrators to begin charging students
and faculty for Internet access. Rebellion is thick in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A university committee on computing is hashing out several
options to defray online connection costs _ including Internet
surcharges for individual departments _ and could implement a
pay-to-surf plan next year, faculty and staff fear. Thousands of
on-campus personal computers would be saddled with an undetermined
online fee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  That is particularly galling at Berkeley, which _ like most
colleges _ provides free, high-speed Internet access to students,
staff and faculty. A standard UC connection is 10 Megabits per
second _ or up to 350 times faster than a standard Internet account
(28.8 kilobits per second) that costs about $20 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some accounting guy must have come up with the idea to
generate revenues,'' said Ray Cranfill, a graduate student in
integrated biology. ``I pay $2,240 a semester for tuition. To do
this at a state-run university, it doesn't make any sense and it
isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Poppycock, counters Jack McCredie, associate vice chancellor of
information systems and technology for the University of California
system and chairman of the network funding committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while the university has offered dial-in access for
off-campus students for $10 per month since 1997, there are no
immediate plans to charge their on-campus counterparts for Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   However, the committee is mulling several options for the
2000-01 academic year to generate additional money to pay for its
campus network, which costs $12.1 million and serves 37,000 people.
One possibility is docking departments $6 per PC per month for
network access. If imposed, department heads would be notified in
March 2000 as part of the campuswide budget process. McCredie
emphatically said there are no plans to charge students for
Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large user fee may disenfranchise some faculty or
students,'' the commission said in an August report. ``Such a
consequence should be unacceptable in a modern university.''
</P>
<P>
   But Berkeley students might want to get used to the idea of
paying more for online connections in the future, as on-campus
networking costs escalate and more data-rich information is
transmitted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, U.S. universities and colleges are increasingly charging
students for on-campus use of the Internet. Stanford University,
Harvard University, Cornell University, University of Michigan and
Yale University, for example, charge students $25 to $30 per month
for high-speed Net access. That's still a bargain compared with
what people in the real world pay: Most standard 56K Net
connections cost about $20 monthly for unlimited use; high-speed
Net access usually is $50 a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   But a small group of Berkeley grad students aren't buying into
the idea of paying for access to the Net, whose roots are in
higher-education research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the cusp of a millennium where the Internet is the
door for information dissemination,'' Cranfill said. ``I fear the
wealthy sector of society will be able to manipulate its
infrastructure by charging for access and controlling vast amounts
of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Try explaining that to cost-conscious network administrators at
American universities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CRASH COURSE &LR; : On the other hand, college life may never be easier
_ or slothful _ in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in late June, a free, new online service
( &LR; www.campuspipeline.com &LR; ) will let students enroll, register for
classes, view grades, request transcripts, obtain reading lists,
buy and auction books and engage in interactive chats with
professors _ without leaving their dorm rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to eliminate some of the daily hassles that coeds
encounter waiting in line at the campus bookstore or the admissions
and records office,'' said Chad Muir, co-chief executive of Campus
Pipeline in Salt Lake City. ``Our motto is, `Get out of line by
going online.'''
</P>
<P>
   Campus Pipeline _ which fancies itself as a higher-education
portal based on e-commerce agreements with Amazon.com and Sun
Microsystems to hawk books, apparel and auction services online _
has signed up more than 170 colleges and universities nationwide,
including the University of San Francisco and Mills College in
Oakland. It initially will reach about 1.2 million students.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It's a big time-saver,'' said Breeana ``Breezy'' Borghetti,
21, a marketing major at Clemson University in Clemson, S.C., who
tested Campus Pipeline. ``Other colleges offer courses over the
Internet, but this program lets you do a lot more without trudging
to campus and finding faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WAR OF THE PICKUP ARTISTS: &LR;  The Speed Seduction guru versus
Steelballs sounds more like the &UR;  &LR; titillating title of an NC-17
movie than the nicknames for combatants in a libel lawsuit with
implications for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ross, aka Ross Jefferies _ whose Web site, newsletter and
seminars promote a behavioral approach to picking up women called
``speed seduction'' &UR;  &LR; _ is suing R. Don Steele, aka John J. White,
whose Steelballs Web site hawks books such as ``How to Date Younger
Women,'' ``Sexpectations'' and ``How to Dump Your Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in late April in Los Angeles County Superior
Court, alleges that White called rival Ross a ``fraud, ex-felon,
crack addict and psychotic'' among other things in numerous online
postings since March 1997. It seeks unspecified damages and a
restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   White claims that Ross is attempting to ``chill'' his free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can call it a classic Internet pissing match,''
said San Francisco attorney Karl Olson, who represents White.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' attorney, William E. Harris of Brentwood, said White has
attacked Ross online for two years. At one point, Steelballs
allegedly broke into a private newsgroup on Ross' Web site and
libeled him. He then posted that confrontation on his own
commercial home page.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The guy wants to ruin Ross like a company would put a rival
out of business with vicious rumors and distorted ads,'' Harris
said. ``This is a case about how far you can go with freedom of
speech. The constitution doesn't protect libel _ especially on the
World Wide Web.''
</P>
<P>
   White said he is merely trying to expose Ross, whom he
repeatedly called a ``thief and crook'' in a phone interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who has received favorable coverage in Rolling Stone and
Playboy, declined to comment.

 Wired Shifts Its Focus   By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In the year since Conde Nast took over Wired, editor Katrina Heron
has heard criticism that the magazine now features too many
celebrities, too little of what readers used to love and too much
of the Conde Nast influence.
<P>
   Heron heard it all before, when she was an editor at Tina
Brown's New Yorker, also owned by Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   There's a big difference, though. At The New Yorker, Brown was
tinkering with an intellectual institution, a general interest
magazine founded in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Wired is a mere 6-year-old. But Wired cultists
are every bit as rabid as dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker readers, and
many of them are griping about the changes in their beloved
techno-bible.
</P>
<P>
   When founders Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe brought Wired to
life in 1993, they invented a new genre of computer magazine _ and
in the process made it hip to be geek.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's cluttered, neon-colored layouts were so copied by
advertisers that before long, you could barely tell the stories
from the ads.
</P>
<P>
   It published long, philosophical essays about technology and its
impact on politics, culture, society and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Under Conde Nast, which acquired Wired on June 15, 1998, the
magazine is edging away from big thoughts and placing more emphasis
on business in the Internet age. The June cover story is on ``The
Wired Index: 40 Companies Driving the New Economy,'' and next month
features author Po Bronson's chronicle of life at a high-tech
startup.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who felt part of something hip and unorthodox fear that
Wired is becoming more like the myriad techno-business publications
that are flooding the market.
</P>
<P>
   Wired, while still looking smart, also appears cleaner and more
mature. Less MTV and more CNBC. It's got new editors, designers and
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most infuriating to the old guard: The changes are
successful. Wired's circulation, advertising pages and revenues are
all on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   For the year ended May 31, Wired's advertising revenues rose 9
percent, to $36.2 million, according to Competitive Media
Reporting, a New York ad-tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of last year, Wired's subscriptions grew 55
percent, to 423,157, and its overall paid circulation, including
newsstand sales, grew 36 percent, to 511,478, according to the
Audit Bureau of Circulation
</P>
<P>
   The numbers seem to validate Heron's new direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be crazy not to recognize that business and
finance are an integral part of the Internet, of the Wired
culture,'' Heron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `Whatever happened to Cyber Rights Now?''' she
said, referring to a popular column she discontinued. The debate
over free speech on the Internet ``has gone mainstream. Wired used
to be the only voice. ... We no longer need to rattle the sabres
and shout from the rooftops.''
</P>
<P>
   The top names on the masthead are all Heron hires, and many
share her New York publishing background. Executive editor Alex
Heard came from The New York Times Magazine. Design director Daniel
Carter came back to Wired after helping launch The Industry
Standard. Business editor Michael Noer hailed from Forbes Digital.
New writers include Warren St. John from the New York Observer and
Randall Rothenberg, who had written for New York and Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   Heron, 44, had worked for Conde Nast at both Vanity Fair and The
New Yorker. In 1994, she moved to the West Coast for a journalism
fellowship at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   She started working as an editor-at-large at Wired in 1995, took
a leave in 1997 when her twins were born, returned at the end of
the year and was named editor in December.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, Rossetto and Metcalfe were under intense
pressure from their board of directors. The company had failed to
go public, losses from its online division were mounting, and
investors were getting impatient.
</P>
<P>
   By spring of 1998, Rossetto was out entirely and Heron started
making her changes.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes continue to stir debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conde Nast has Conde Nastied Wired,'' said Lewis Perdue, a
free-lance writer and longtime reader. He thinks it's lost its
edge, and he adds, ``There's so little time, so much to read, and
at least for me, Wired has moved off the desktop and into the
recycle bin.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Katz, a media critic who once wrote for Wired and now
contributes to Rolling Stone, said Rossetto's Wired covered the
political and cultural aspects of technology, not just the business
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 15 years of working in journalism, I never heard a reporter
mention the word freedom, but at Wired and Hot Wired, they talked
about it all the time. They relished it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One source inside the magazine put it differently. ``There were
people who wanted to sit around and think about big ideas and go to
long lunches and conferences.'' None are there anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff O'Brien, the editor of the trade magazine Marketing
Computers, said Heron is raising the quality of journalism at
Wired.
</P>
<P>
   He said recent articles like science fiction writer William
Gibson's piece on eBay and Rothenberg's article about NBC are the
kind of stories that could put Wired back on the map, as opposed to
what he called ``the crazy visionaries of yesteryear espousing the
future of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Leyden, a former managing editor, said that during the
transition between Rossetto and Heron, the was a huge internal
debate about the magazine's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the original crowd wanted to stay more in
line with the original Wired,'' said Leyden. ``I was saying, cede
the digital economy story. There are so many people in that turf,
we should go into a more global story, into more politics, into
more culture.''
</P>
<P>
   As a ``new economy'' magazine, Wired does face plenty of
competition, from upstarts such as Fast Company, Upside, Red
Herring, Business 2.0 and The Industry Standard to bigger business
publications with beefed-up tech coverage, like Fortune, Business
Week and Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   With Wired's quirky blend of business, culture and technology,
``they don't have any direct competition, which is good and bad,''
said O'Brien. It's nice to be unique, but ``it would be really good
for them if Hearst came out with a book like Wired. It's easier for
two magazines to drive a market, to validate a market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Wired's niche seems to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Adscope, a Eugene, Ore., firm that tracks high-tech advertising,
reports that Wired's paid ad pages rose 18 percent, from a total of
189 in April and May of 1998 to 223 in the same months this year.
Wired publisher Dana Lyon said ad page year-over-year increases are
14 percent for June, 46 percent for July and 43 percent for August.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wired maintains its own ad sales force, Conde Nast also
sells Wired as part of a package with its other magazines. Conde
Nast ``does give them more credibility from a publishing
standpoint,'' said Laura Bracken, senior vice president and media
director in ad agency Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi's San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast brought other changes. Rossetto's Wired never ran
cigarette ads. Wired does now though that could end as governments
negotiate deals with the tobacco industry to stop advertising in
magazines, newspapers and billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference: Wired, the magazine that led the digital
revolution, no longer has its own Web site. Advance bought only the
magazine, leaving the online properties _ including the valuable
 &LR; www.wired.com &LR;  domain name _ in a separate company, Wired Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital posts the magazine's content and subscription
information on its Web site under a cross-promotional deal. At the
end of the month, Wired Digital will be sold to Lycos, a
Massachusetts Internet company, putting the magazine's long-term
access to the domain name in question.
</P>
<P>
   But its biggest long-term challenge ``will be keeping it fresh,
unique and distinctive,'' said John Battelle, who was Wired's
managing editor and left to found The Industry Standard, a weekly
Internet-economy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wired proved something that needed to be proven, which is that
there are new markets out there and new ways of thinking about
publishing,'' Battelle said. ``There's been something of a
renaissance in publishing since the emergence of Wired. The rest of
the world woke up to that story after Wired paid attention to it.''

 Designing With Women in Mind  &HT;       
 By Terry Nagel 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Anita Borg snorts at a photo of a woman smiling at her
``ScreenFridge.'' The picture is part of a press kit from ICL, a
British tech company that developed the prototype refrigerator in
partnership with Frigidaire Home Appliances.
<P>
   Before you throw out an empty milk carton or bread wrapper,
you're supposed to wave the package past a scanner built into the
refrigerator so that it can create a shopping list for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every woman is going to tell you, `I don't need one more
step,''' she says. ``Something like this would have to be voice
activated. Women complain that too many so-called labor-saving
devices add extra work.''
</P>
<P>
   Borg founded the Institute for Women and Technology in Palo Alto
to persuade companies to consider the female perspective when
designing new products, and to get more women involved in creating
them. Her one-and-a-half-year-old organization runs workshops in
which women brainstorm about how new products might help run their
homes and improve family life.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to open ``virtual development centers'' where female
college &UR;  &LR; students work with faculty members and engineers from
sponsoring companies to develop prototypes of some of the products.
</P>
<P>
   Borg says women are seldom consulted about product design. When
they are, it's usually after a prototype has been made and it would
be too expensive to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   She gives the example of a French company that designed a new
stove, then invited in a female consultant. ``The woman said, `It's
a beautiful stove, but you can't clean it.' No one who cooks would
have designed that stove,'' Borg recalls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  She winces at American inventions, too. The PalmPilot, for
example, was shaped to fit in a man's breast pocket. &UR;  &LR; And she's
discovered that most calendar software programs are designed to
track one person's life. ``How many women do you know who keep
track of one life?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, women in her workshops, who range from teenagers to
octogenarians, have suggested a layered calendar program that would
let the user track several family members' schedules
simultaneously. They also have proposed:
</P>
<P>
   _``Smart Pipes'' that warn homeowners when a pipe is about to
leak, clog or freeze.
</P>
<P>
   _A security device that lets children summon help when they're
in danger.
</P>
<P>
   _Seats in cars that swivel for easier access by handicapped
people.
</P>
<P>
   _A ``virtual wall'' that would let grandparents in a different
state ``sit'' in the same room with their grandchildren and watch
them play.
</P>
<P>
   Borg is convinced that there won't be many products like these
until more women are involved in creating them. Right now, she
points out, technology is being shaped by a narrow slice of the
world's population: young, Western, white male engineers, venture
capitalists and executives who often are more interested in making
gadgets than things that serve a human need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is,'' she says, ``do we want a bunch of 18-to
30-year-old guys making all the decisions about the technical
future of the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't necessarily bad people,'' she adds, ``but other
perspectives are not being heard.'' What's lacking from the brain
pool, she argues, are diverse viewpoints _ in gender, age and race
_ that would help create products of value to more of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Institute's goals is to interest more women in
becoming engineers and computer scientists. Before the passage in
1972 of Title IX, which bans gender discrimination in any school
receiving federal funds, only 2 percent of engineers in the United
States were women. The National Research Council reports that 9.8
percent of working engineers in the United States in 1997 were
female.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not enough, says the Chicago-born Borg, 50, who
seldom encountered other women during her ascent from data
processor at an insurance company to research scientist at Digital
Equipment Corp. in Palo Alto. ``I worked directly with only two or
three women in 20 years,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Borg has a doctorate in computer science and is proudest of her
work in memory-system performance analysis and fault-tolerant
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   She's not shy about speaking her mind. ``I've learned the boys'
rules,'' she said during a recent talk to a women's group in San
Francisco. ``I'm always thinking of how I am going to interrupt
someone else and get my idea out there.'' But she's always reached
out to other women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, she founded the Systers List, an Internet community of
women in technology that now has 2,500 members in 25 countries. In
1994, she organized a conference called the Grace Hopper
Celebration of Women in Computing.
</P>
<P>
   Then she read ``The Futures of Women: Scenarios for the 21st
Century,'' by Pamela McCorduck and Nancy Ramsey. The book predicts
the future of civilization with and without women involved, and it
stresses that females are not an inevitable part of technology.
After reading it, Borg says, ``I decided this could no longer be a
part-time activity,'' and she founded the Institute for Women and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she has raised $3 million in personnel, hardware and
cash from Xerox, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard that has let
her sponsor four brainstorming workshops and travel around the
world, talking up the Institute.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Borg has enough seed money to start the virtual development
centers, but she needs another $1 million to operate them. The
centers will be located at Santa Clara University, Texas A&AMP;M
University, Carnegie-Mellon University and, possibly, Smith College
in Northampton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan is to have women students run community workshops to
gather ideas for female-friendly products, then work with faculty
and engineers from sponsoring companies to make prototypes. During
the process, the women will be able to explore the idea of becoming
engineers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Borg's enthusiasm is winning converts; as she explains it, some
of the men running technology firms are beginning to ``get it.''
</P>
<P>
   One is Greg Papadopoulos, chief technology officer at Sun
Microsystems in Mountain View. ``Invariably, with the folks in the
Valley and elsewhere that are off building the next technology, the
habit has been to build it first for ourselves,'' he says. ``It
takes things like what Anita is doing to cause a sea change. We
need another set of people coming into technology businesses with
new and different perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   But just when Borg feels that she's making progress, along comes
another new invention that brings her back to reality _ like
Eureka's prototype Robot Vac vacuum cleaner. Measuring 15 inches in
diameter and 6 inches high, the self-propelled device can't get
under couches or into corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect for some guy who lives in an apartment and
doesn't care what's underneath the bed,'' Borg says.

   MICROSOFT BEGINS SHIPPING
</P>
<P>
   Revamped Office Software Microsoft will announce Monday that it
has begun retail shipments of a new version of its office
productivity ``suite,'' Office 2000, that all but eliminates the
distinctions between a PC document and Internet data.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000, which includes word processing, spreadsheet,
database, e-mail, scheduling and other software functions, has new
features, almost all of which are intended to give PC users a set
of software tools that deeply integrate Internet capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In its antitrust trial, Microsoft is expected to introduce

<P>
   Christian Curry, the man at the center of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter's legal trouble, was raised to blend fluidly into social and
business elites. But he did not fit in at the Wall Street
powerhouse, and the events that led to his dismissal,
discrimination suit and government inquiry into Morgan Stanley's

<P>
   Some journalists who work for Dow Jones, which publishes The
Wall Street Journal, have stopped appearing as volunteers on CNBC
to express their dismay over proposed cutbacks in their pension

instructed to keep his union button out of sight on CNBC, which has
contracted with Dow Jones for voluntary appearances by staff

   Last week, MCI Worldcom convened its first meeting for analysts

<P>
   The end of NATO's war on Yugoslavia seems to be in sight, but
among a group of Americans who discussed the news, there is little
exultation.
</P>
<P>
   Dilia Theodosakia, a retired secretary who long ago abandoned
her initial support for the bombing, sees no winners, only losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all criminals in their own way, not just Milosevic,''
she said, lumping in the leaders of NATO countries with Slobodan
Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia. ``They are all responsible
for escalating suffering. The Albanians in Kosovo had problems
before, but once the bombing started the killing got worse and the
Serbs suffered terribly, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mrs. Theodosakia, Martha McCauley has remained steadfast
in her belief that only military force could stop Yugoslav violence
against the Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO cause is just, she said, but the bill will be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the refugees go back, and their houses are all gone, what
will we do?'' said Mrs. McCauley, a retired IBM employee and busy
grandmother. ``Who is going to pay for the rebuilding of that
country? I think Milosevic and Yugoslavia should pay for that. It's
their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the NATO bombing campaign against the
Yugoslavs, Mrs. Theodosakia, Mrs. McCauley and several of their
neighbors in White Plains, N.Y., which is in Westchester County not
far from New York City, have been asked regularly to discuss their
impressions and opinions about the war.
</P>
<P>
   None has relatives or friends in the military. So without a
personal stake in the conflict, they have been paying less and less
attention to what has been happening in Yugoslavia. They all
expressed relief that the Yugoslav leadership appears to have
accepted NATO's terms for ending the bombing, but they are
skeptical about whether NATO's aims have been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Theodosakia, who describes herself as a conservative, has
come full circle in her views about the war.
</P>
<P>
   At first mistrustful of President Clinton's motives, she came to
rally to the NATO cause, believing it a moral mission to save the
Kosovo Albanians. Then, as civilian casualties mounted in the NATO
bombing, so did her sympathies for the Yugoslavs as victims of
equal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Theodosakia, who at age 57 is about to start a new
career as a nutritionist, is once again deeply suspicious of the
motivations of NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every war, there's something behind it _ politics or
selfishness on somebody's part _ and yet civilians are the ones who
suffer,'' she said. ``I'd really like to know the truth, why they
were doing this just in Yugoslavia when there are people suffering
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   From reading several newspapers, listening to radio talk shows
and having discussions with relatives, Mrs. Theodosakia said she
had reached her own conclusions about what the situation in Kosovo
was before the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a holocaust in the making, as portrayed by President
Clinton, but a conflict between the Yugoslav government and the
Kosovo Albanian separatists, ``who used force and terror because
they wanted a piece of the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did not resolve that conflict by bombing. ``What did they
accomplish?'' she continued. ``What I say is this: Send the leaders
to war. Let them feel the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clark, an employee of the Westchester County Board of
Elections, tuned out weeks ago to the war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just fed up with it,'' he said, after hearing that a peace
accord had been reached. ``We have exhausted our stay over there,
as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a trim 58-year-old, served in Vietnam as a Marine and
that experience still marks his views. He looks with a skeptic's
eye at any war, no matter how noble-sounding its goals, and
recalled his own war days as a time when he ``saw kids dying like
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   During the more than two months of the Kosovo war, he has had
very little patience with what he sees as the bombast of military
commanders, and a great deal of faith in the old adage that truth
is the first casualty of war.
</P>
<P>
   So when NATO missiles began occasionally to go astray, killing
Yugoslav civilians and in some cases Kosovo Albanians, Clark
considered his natural cynicism well founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many civilian casualties,'' he said.
``Friendly fire _ I told you that was going to happen. Once you go
to war, even if you have all these high-tech weapons, as long as
you're human, you're going to have errors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the NATO bombing, Clark paid close
attention to the war news, almost in spite of himself. ``In the
beginning I was interested,'' he acknowledged. ``But after it got
so prolonged, I just wasn't interested anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way he could explain his indifference was, again, to
reach back to his own memories as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what the outcome was going to be before it happened,''
Clark said. ``I knew no one would really win. I knew innocent
people were going to die. Been there. Done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCauley's interest, on the other hand, never flagged. An
avid reader before the war, she added an extra daily newspaper to
her morning regime to stay informed.
</P>
<P>
   At 69, she is old enough to remember her father serving in the
Army in World War II. Moved and angered by the Serbs' expulsion of
Kosovo Albanians, she saw the NATO war against Yugoslavia as an
echo of her father's good fight. And while the casualties and the
destruction wrought by NATO bombs saddened her, they never dented
her pride that the United States ``helps people.''
</P>
<P>
   So was it worth it? she was asked after Yugoslavia accepted
NATO's terms for ending the bombing last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCauley did not like that question. ``It was war,'' she
said, ``and you never think of anything as being worth war. But I
just don't think Milosevic would have done anything without this
war. He would have just gone on with his ethnic cleansing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ As Yugoslav military negotiators raised new
objections Sunday night to a NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo,
the alliance warned that it would intensify the bombing, now in its
75th day.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic agreed in principle last Thursday
to withdraw his 40,000 troops from Kosovo and to let in an
international peacekeeping force, when the Serbs approved a
two-page draft agreement. But an allied diplomat said that Yugoslav
commanders meeting with NATO officers in Macedonia were objecting
to letting in peacekeepers unless the U.N. Security Council
authorized them first, a condition that some allies view as
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air campaign will continue,'' a senior NATO official said,
as the Yugoslav officers met into the night with the British
officer who would command the international peacekeeping force, Lt.
Gen. Sir Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we don't come to a conclusion down there,'' Maj.
Gen. Walter Jertz, the spokesman for the allied military command,
said, ``the operations will be intensified.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The aircraft are in the area, the pilots are still
there and all the assets are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the bombing would not stop until the Serbs
started moving troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain why Yugoslav and Serb commanders could take
more than two days to accept withdrawal terms that Milosevic had
appeared to agree to, a senior diplomat here said, ``They were
trying to water down what they agreed to last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that allied field commanders
were refusing to negotiate the terms, which officials said require
the Serbs to shut down their anti-aircraft defenses within 48
hours, to pull all of their military, police, and paramilitary
forces out of Kosovo by designated routes within seven days, and to
let in 45,000 international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If those terms are met, the allies then expect about 1.5 million
ethnic Albanians to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to bar the peacekeeping force without express
Security Council approval strikes at the weakest link in the recent
chain of events that the allies are counting on to result in a
diplomatic and military victory.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain agree with France, Germany and
other European allies that the peacekeeping force should have the
Security Council's authorization. But they are concerned that if
approval were delayed for some reason, and if the Serbs were
withdrawing troops, NATO should be ready to move in to prevent a
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   France and most of the European allies do not see things that
way, and neither does Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats hope that Russia would be willing to approve a
Security Council resolution sending in peacekeepers whether
Milosevic wanted them or not, under Chapter Seven of the U.N.
Charter. Russia might also join the peacekeeping force on its own
terms, but Russia would certainly not approve of NATO troops
entering Kosovo without a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, in remarks televised in Moscow, the Russian prime
minister, Sergei Stepashin, made clear that Russia was not pleased
with NATO's terms for ending the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many questions are being solved with NATO calling the
tune,'' Reuters quoted him as saying. ``Our task is to prepare a
serious resolution on Yugoslavia for the Security Council. We have
to treat it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   So Milosevic's military negotiators have raised a thorny issue
just at the time when the foreign ministers of Russia and the seven
largest industrial democracies, the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan, are about to meet near Bonn to
discuss a draft resolution on Kosovo, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been insisting that the allies stop the bombing
before the Security Council votes, but the weekend snags appeared
to put off any pause in the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is to continue, Shea said on Sunday, ``until the Serbs accept
the detailed military agreement that has been outlined to them by
NATO commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get it right, we want to pin down all of the
detail, we want to make it watertight, and if that takes two extra
hours, it will save us many days of agony subsequently,'' Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the dispute over a resolution, the Serb commanders
are reportedly pressing NATO to keep the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army from attacking the withdrawing Serb forces.
Fighting between them continued Sunday along the border with
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz, of the allied command, said that most of the bombing runs
among the 431 missions that NATO planes flew from Saturday to early
Sunday, had targeted Serb forces battling the ethnic Albanian
rebels there. That number was more than a hundred below that of the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs know that one of the most dangerous moves for any
military force is disengagement and retreat from battle.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have long said they did not want to become the Kosovo
Liberation Army's air force, and they still insist that NATO has no
direct contact with the rebels. But for the past few weeks, allied
planes have been bombing Serb tanks and artillery positions that
were firing at the rebels along the Albanian border. NATO planes
hit 14 Serb tanks and artillery pieces at the border from Saturday
to early Sunday, the allied military command said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Pentagon said 13 artillery pieces, a
battalion-size staging area, five mortars, and several fixed
positions, including ammunition dumps and early-warning radar
sites, were struck Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering Kosovo, NATO peacekeepers would have to see to it
that the Kosovo Liberation Army, now believed to have between 6,000
and 10,000 fighters in the Balkans, is disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate that we are going to have a lot of trouble
with the KLA,'' Jertz said. ``The KLA want their people to go back
home to their own country, and that is one of the reasons why we
think that they will be following the guidance which they will get
from us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the allies have been surprised by the Kosovo Liberation Army
before. Last winter its leadership balked at the terms of a
proposed peace agreement during talks at Rambouillet Castle outside
Paris. At the end of the talks in February, the Albanian side
insisted that its field commanders would have to be consulted
before it could agree to the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, on March 14, the Albanian side signed an
accord that would have required all the Kosovo forces to disarm and
disband, provided that Milosevic also accepted the accord and that
NATO peacekeepers would move in to ensure that all fighting
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Milosevic refused, and the allies started bombing on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serb forces do carry out Jackson's terms, the allies seem
to be disposed still to see no problems on the Kosovo Albanian
side. Shea said, ``As the Serb forces pull out and the NATO forces
move into Kosovo, we expect the KLA to exercise restraint and not
to attempt to take advantage of the situation.''

 BRUSSELS, Belgium: the situation.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the allies, except for the British, public opinion in
European countries is impatient to see the bombing stop. Leaders in
the United States and Britain have warned that Milosevic might be
up to his old tricks, trying to sow confusion among his enemies by
appearing to accept surrender, and then trying to renegotiate by
haggling over details.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said Sunday that Serbia had
no future with Milosevic at the helm. ``It must be in the interests
of people in Serbia to have him go,'' he told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, made similar remarks.
``It's not NATO's aim to depose Milosevic; it never has been,'' he
told the Spanish television station Telecinco. ``But I think all
citizens of good faith, not only in Europe but all over the world,
would like Milosevic to give up power in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 British and German soldiers arrived in Macedonia on
Saturday, joining the 15,000 mostly European troops already there
as part of the planned peacekeeping force, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said the allies had received reports of Serb shelling of
areas near Mitrovice where ethnic Albanian refugees had taken
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said they had also heard reports of ``mass
looting'' by Serb military and police forces in Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo, on Friday and Saturday. ``This gives indications
that troops may be trying to help themselves as they prepare to
leave Kosovo,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied reconnaissance also spotted a military train moving from
Urosevac, in southern Kosovo, to the north toward Serbia and heard
reports of convoys of civilian vehicles headed north, allied
spokesmen said. But they had no confirmation that this meant that
Serb forces were already pulling out.
</P>
<P>
   Although fighting had slowed down in the northern and central
parts of the province in the past few days, they said, it had not
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb forces will not halt their operations until the senior
commanders give them the order,'' Jertz said. ``Let us hope this
will happen soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also told the Yugoslav military leaders that the allies
expect all Serb forces to withdraw to Serbia, not to be transferred
to the other constituent republic of Yugoslavia, Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   NATO wants to forestall any outbreak of fighting in Montenegro,
the one part of Yugoslavia that has been trying to come to terms
with the new Europe. The allies have warned that any Serb attack on
Montenegro would be viewed with the utmost seriousness _ just as
President George Bush warned about Kosovo a decade ago.

U.N. DENIES STATUS TO RIGHTS GROUP CRITICAL OF '89 MASSACRE IN
CHINA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Ten years to the day after the massacre around
Tiananmen Square, special U.N. status has been denied to a New
York-based human rights organization that has been helping victims'
families in a campaign to bring criminal charges against Chinese
leaders responsible for the 1989 killings.
</P>
<P>
   After China spoke against the measure, the U.N. Committee on
Nongovernmental Organizations refused, by a vote of 13 to 3, to
grant nongovernmental organization status to Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the group announced that it helped the families file
a petition with the government in Beijing last month seeking a
criminal investigation into the 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators. Hundreds of civilians are believed to
have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   As an accredited nongovernmental organization, Human Rights in
China would have been able to attend certain U.N. meetings and to
present evidence to panels like the Human Rights Commission and the
Commission on the Status of Women. China opposed accreditation,
contending that the group is a political organization, most of
whose leaders live outside of China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, France and Ireland were the only members of
the 19- nation committee that voted in favor of giving the group
official status, but France and Ireland made clear that their
position is shared by all 15 members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed were Algeria, Bolivia, China, Colombia, Cuba,
Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Lebanon, Russia, Sudan, Tunisia and
Turkey. Chile and Romania abstained, while Senegal was absent from
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights in China's chairman, Lie Qing, served 11 years in
prison after his arrest in 1979 for involvement in the ``Democracy
Wall'' movement in Beijing. Several other board members had to flee
China after the Tiananmen crackdown or were released from prison
into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions from committee members, Liu and Human Rights
in China's executive director, Xiao Qiang, said their organization
sought to support all who favored human rights and democracy in
China. While supporting every people's right to self-determination,
they said they had taken no position on such questions as the
independence of Taiwan and Tibet, which China opposes.

ANALYSIS: SOME ISSUES STILL NOT RESOLVED IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes ``what she hopes is'' to ``what she hoped would be''
in 1st graf. Inserts ``a breakdown in the talks and'' in 2nd
graf.)  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright flew to
Europe on Sunday night for what she hoped would be something of a
victory lap. In fact, it is a risky mission, and could be rather
muted.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo peace pact is not yet a done deal, with a breakdown
in the talks and several issues outstanding that Albright will
confront over the next few days as she meets her fellow foreign
ministers, confers with ethnic Albanian leaders and perhaps visits
several countries affected by the misery of the war.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright left Washington on Sunday night, the European allies
and Washington were still divided over the necessity of winning a
U.N. Security Council resolution that would give a mantle of
authority to the NATO security force and the civil administration
planned for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And it was unclear how the ethnic Albanian leaders, in
particular the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, whose representatives
Albright plans to meet in Germany, would accept the sketchy
document that is the basis of the pact with President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, beneath the buoyancy about the end of the war
appearing to be in sight, questions lingered about whether the
original goals of the air campaign had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Some, both inside and outside the administration, recalled the
objectives set out by President Clinton in his televised Oval
Office speech on March 24, the first night of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said then that the mission was to show the ``seriousness
of NATO's purpose,'' to ``deter an even bloodier offensive against
innocent civilians in Kosovo,'' and to ``seriously damage the
Serbian military's capacity to harm the people of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the air campaign was intended to keep stability in
the fragile neighboring countries of Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton's first goal of demonstrating the
seriousness of NATO's purpose was achieved: Under great strain and
differences of opinion, the alliance stayed together.
</P>
<P>
   But in essence, asserted Ivo Daalder, a former member of the
Clinton administration's National Security Council, NATO unity was
achieved at the expense of the other objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs were extraordinarily high to do this,'' Daalder
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first several weeks of the air campaign, Milosevic's
forces expelled hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians over the
border of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, more than 850,000 Kosovar Albanians, the population
NATO had wanted to protect, were squatting in tents or crammed into
the homes of relatives, friends and strangers in Macedonia and
Albania, with many of their identity papers destroyed, their homes
in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of others were left wandering around
homeless inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal of maintaining stability in the region also went
by the boards, Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate ethnic situation in Macedonia between Macedonians
and ethnic Albanians was thrown out of balance by the huge influx
of Albanian refugees. The weak economy has been thrown into
disarray by the cutoff of trade with Yugoslavia and by the costly
burden of maintaining the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, a weak political equilibrium was unsettled by the
new refugees and the growing numbers of Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas training in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
   To try to reverse these outcomes, the United States and European
nations will be entrenched in Kosovo maintaining the peace for
years, administration officials and their critics said. The
financial costs could extend for a generation, Daalder predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of maintaining NATO credibility was achieved. The
alliance followed through on the threats to bomb, got Milosevic to
accept a deal on its terms and has not yet stopped bombing in the
absence of final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But that goal was not entirely cost-free, either.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the deal with Milosevic sank in at NATO headquarters,
a senior NATO official said the alliance had hung together by
stumbling along, rather than by smart decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful whether NATO will ever venture into another
Kosovo-style campaign, he said. After 50 years of drawing up white
papers, analyzing and preparing, NATO's first war may well be its
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This showed the incredible difficulty of a
humanitarian-military action by an alliance,'' the official said,
speaking on condition that his name not be used. ``I personally
believe this is never to be repeated. NATO got in way over its
head, stumbled through, didn't know how to get out, was scared to
death by what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the internecine battles of the last 10 weeks, the
official said, ``This has left a bitter taste, of tilting within
governments, between governments, between NATO headquarters at
Brussels and the military headquarters at Mons. This has been a
searing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those questions will come up as Albright visits Germany
and the devastated countries that adjoin Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Her first order of business is a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the seven richest industrial countries and Russia, in
Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Moscow suggested that the Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov, might not come until the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
stopped. The approval of Russia, as well as China, is needed for
passage of a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were not counting on the
Russians and the Chinese to quickly agree to a resolution. Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy who helped win Milosevic's
acquiescence to the pact, came under heavy criticism when he
arrived back in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government, embittered by the mistaken bombing of
their embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was unlikely to veto a
resolution. But officials said the Chinese would probably delay
their approval to seek concessions from the United States on other
fronts in exchange for not vetoing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Washington puts much less stock in a U.N. blessing than
the Europeans do. First, the State Department argues that it would
be dangerous to leave a vacuum in Kosovo as Yugoslav forces
withdraw by waiting for a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Second, these officials assert that planning for interim
administration and the future political landscape of Kosovo can go
ahead without a resolution. But the document Milosevic agreed to
stipulates that the ``interim administration'' for Kosovo will be
established within ``substantial autonomy'' of Yugoslavia ``to be
decided by the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the detailed 44-page accord reached in Rambouillet,
France, that Milosevic rejected in March, provoking the NATO
bombing, the document he agreed to on Thursday leaves the future of
Kosovo vague.
</P>
<P>
   While the ethnic Albanians eventually signed the Rambouillet
pact after extracting a promise of a referendum on Kosovo's status
in three years, the present document does not make clear whether
Kosovo remains part of Yugoslavia, or eventually will have the
chance of becoming independent, as the ethnic Albanians want.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns have been raised that with protracted negotiations
among the United States, the Europeans and the Russians, these
political questions will be held hostage by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Almost certainly the Russians will try to circumscribe Kosovo's
autonomy and will try to limit the chances for eventual
independence, a move that promises to antagonize the Kosovar
Albanians on whose behalf largely the war was fought.

PACERS STILL WEARING HEARTBREAK ON THEIR SLEEVES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Indiana Pacers strode into Madison Square Garden
nearly a half-hour after their practice was scheduled to start
Sunday, and it was hard to say what had accounted for the delay _
city traffic or the players' slow, disappointed gaits.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief conference, they seemed even more despondent as
they trudged back to the court, the disaster in Game 3 of the
Eastern Conference finals replayed on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to hold on in the final minutes of a game was an
all-too-familiar scenario for the Pacers, who trail the New York
Knicks 2-1 after their 92-91 loss on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the regular season, Indiana lost 6 of 7 one-point games. In
this series the Pacers have been outscored by the Knicks over the
final two minutes of the three games by 25-9.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1 the Knicks pulled out a 93-90 victory; in Game 2, the
Pacers were able to hang on in the final seconds and win, 88-86.
And then in Game 3, it was an 11-2 Knicks run over the final 3
minutes 22 seconds, culminating in Larry Johnson's four-point play,
that turned around the game and possibly the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question a lot of breaks have gone New York's way,''
Indiana's Reggie Miller said. ``But one thing I am going to say is
that we've given them a lot of breaks as well. In the game of
basketball, a lot of times you have to make your own breaks. In a
few of these games, we've kind of handed it to them on a silver
platter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they've made plays down the stretch, but we've played
terrible in the last few minutes in just about each and every ball
game. We're lucky to win one of them. If you correct those things,
we could be here talking about a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   But the correction has not come yet, Pacers coach Larry Bird
said. ``We've been doing it all year,'' he said. ``We lost a lot of
games when we had the lead going down the fourth quarter and we
never really got out of it. The Knicks played some good defense
last night, but we just didn't score. We're suffering a little bit
today. Our pride's hurt. It's how we bounce back now. We feel that
we've got to put it aside and move ahead, but you never know what's
going to happen until you get out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird saw Sunday the same despair that his players displayed in
their eyes on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I was a little concerned,'' Bird said. ``During a
time out, we had a three-point lead and we had the basketball and
we looked like we were down 20, just the facial expressions, the
way they were sitting there. I told them last night, `You can't
have a better situation. Time's running out, less than a minute to
go, we've got a three-point lead and the ball, and you guys look
like you're 20 points down. We've got to finish the ball game.'
Obviously, they were down.''
</P>
<P>
   They were familiar with what was happening. A veteran team with
a player like Miller would not expect to have last-minute lapses,
particularly not against the Knicks, who have had their own
problems late in games and have been hurt by Miller too many times
to count. But the regular-season failures seem to have depleted the
Pacers' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would probably have killed lesser teams,'' Pacers
point guard Mark Jackson said of Johnson's 3-point basket and free
throw with 5.7 seconds left in the game. ``But we still feel real
good. We'll come in here and take care of business tomorrow. Tough
loss, tough one to swallow. But so be it. It can affect a Portland
or a regular team. It's not going to affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was not so sure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they had a lot of confidence coming in, but they don't
finish games,'' he said. ``We've had a lead in every game we lost
this year, especially down the stretch. For some reason we have a
spell in that four- or five-minute stretch at the end that we don't
get anything accomplished. It's turnovers. It's missed shots. Last
night we weren't taking any shots and it cost them.''  &QL;

VAN GUNDY AND CAMBY: PLAYOFF PALS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Maybe Jeff Van Gundy's method of making Marcus
Camby earn his time brought out the dominant side Camby has shown
in the playoffs. Or perhaps Van Gundy's unwillingness to trust
Camby initially hid the talent that was there all along.
</P>
<P>
   As that chicken-and-the-egg controversy began to unfold for the
Knicks this season, it resulted in organizational bickering, which
was at least part of the reason that the former team president
Ernie Grunfeld was demoted. But there is little doubt now that
Camby is the kind of player who can take over a game, the kind of
player Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, has come to count on.
</P>
<P>
   This process has not been easy on Camby. He has bit his tongue
for the most part, except to say that he prefers steadier minutes,
but there is an iciness between Van Gundy and Camby after a
tumultuous first year together.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what I'm going to say, everyone is going to say
we're in a feud,'' Van Gundy said Sunday after practice. ``So,
write it how anybody wants to write it, but we haven't had any
problems all year. The disappointment he's had is that he hasn't
played as much as he wanted. That was my decision on what I thought
was best for the team. Now was it or not? I don't know. All I know
is now, when it counts the most, we're getting his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for whatever reason, it's worked out, whether it's him
sticking with it. And I'd say all the credit has to go to him for
perseverance. And he's gotten much, much better as the season has
gone along. I've always had faith in him, but obviously, watching
him play so well against different types of players at the highest
level of competition, there's no worry that there will be
up-and-down performances.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby has been as steady as any Knick in the playoffs. In the
second round, Camby shot 55.6 percent, scored 9 points and grabbed
6 rebounds a game in 20.8 minutes a night. In the first round,
Camby averaged 7.4 points and 5.2 rebounds a game. He also shot
68.2 percent and played 20.6 minutes a game. So far in the Eastern
Conference finals against Indiana, Camby is shooting a team-high
59.1 percent, and averaging 10.7 points, 9.3 rebounds and 27
minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3, he was integral in making up for the absence of the
injured Patrick Ewing by scoring 21 points and adding 11 rebounds
off the bench. Still, he was stunned when Van Gundy told him he was
starting the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' Camby said. ``I'm not used to starting any
half. I was on the floor stretching and he came up to me and said
he wanted me to start with Chris Dudley having three fouls. So that
was a big adjustment I had to make in my mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going out and playing. I can't worry about if he's
going to play me or not. I'll go out there and make the most of my
time and minutes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller Not Getting His Shots
</P>
<P>
   By having their big men help by trapping, and with aggressive
chasing by Allan Houston, the Knicks have held Reggie Miller to
only 33 attempts in three games. But with Miller vowing to take a
more assertive role in Game 4, the Knicks were not ready to say
they had been successful in cutting off the Pacers' devastating
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lulled them into having Rik Smits score every time,'' Jeff
Van Gundy said with a heavy dose of sarcasm. ``Look, we don't
underestimate Reggie Miller at all. He's a dominant player even
when he's not putting up dominant numbers because a lot of your
attention goes to him. That opens up things for everyone else. We
have to be right with him. And even when we are, he can still put
up big numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's lack of impact has not been seized upon by either
Houston or Latrell Sprewell. Neither is having a good series
offensively, with Houston and Sprewell combining to shoot little
better than 35 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have success with Allan and Latrell
shooting that,'' Van Gundy said. ``We can't say what we've done so
far is good enough.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Praise for Johnson
</P>
<P>
   There was much-deserved praise for Larry Johnson Sunday after
his 26-point performance in Game 3, capped by his logic-defying
4-point play to win the game. Johnson has played the role of
wallflower since he arrived three years ago as a former All-Star
from Charlotte, but he has proven in the playoffs that he still has
that star quality about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's definitely an exception, not only in his
willingness to sacrifice but in his work ethic and vocal leadership
skills,'' Jeff Van Gundy said. ``When you find guys like him, you
just keep him. You never let them get away because they are so
rare.'' &QL;

TIMORESE LOOKING AHEAD TO AUGUST REFERENDUM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, INDONESIA _ In stark contrast to the election fervor in
Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, voters in the troubled territory of
East Timor are cool about prospects for change as a result of this
Monday's historic election.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's people can vote to fill four seats in the national
parliament and for members in the two-tier district parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of international observers has arrived to monitor
polling in the provincial capital, Dili, and in rural areas across
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But many East Timorese said they were far more excited about the
chance to vote for their territory's independence in a United
Nations-organized referendum scheduled for Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 23 years, we've been under the boot of the Indonesians,''
said a 32-year-old man who gave his name only as Alberto and said
he lost his right arm ``fighting Indonesians'' at the age of 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been killed and intimidated,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to participate'' on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sose Gusmao, a Dili street vendor, said he would vote on Monday
but did not think it would achieve much. ``I don't have much hope
because I'm just a small man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum on Aug. 8 will offer a choice between broad
autonomy within Indonesia and outright independence.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a United Nations-brokered agreement signed on May
5 and intended to resolve the long struggle over East Timor's
status.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials on the island said this weekend that they are
investigating apparent breaches of the accord by government
officials by exerting unspecified pressure to get votes for
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the East Timor accords, all militia groups are to be
disbanded before the August vote. A Dili-based human rights group
this weekend criticized the reorganization of at least three
pro-Indonesian militia groups into civil defense units working with
the police, saying it was ``legal nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor covers half an island and was first colonized by the
Portuguese in the 16th century. Indonesian forces invaded in 1975
and the following year incorporated the territory as the country's
27th province.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations never recognized the move and a fierce war
waged. During the first years of Indonesian control, tens of
thousands died _ some say up to 200,000 _ from massacres, disease
and starvation.

ZIONS TO BUY FIRST SECURITY, A RIVAL, FOR $5.9 BILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Calif., Idaho. and Nev.)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Trying to establish banking supremacy in the Western United
States, the Zions Bancorporation said Sunday that it was buying the
First Security Corp., its longtime rival in regional consumer
banking, in a deal worth $5.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, Zions will exchange a little less
than half a share for every share of First Security. The price per
share is about $28.90, or a 55 percent premium to First Security's
closing price of $18.625 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks, based in Salt Lake City, trace their origins to
Brigham Young, the Mormon leader whose followers settled in Utah.
The combined assets of the two will be $40.5 billion, making Zions,
which is taking the First Security name, one of the largest banks
in the West and one of the 20 largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Simmons, 44, the chief executive of Zions, will become
co-chief executive, president and chief operating officer of the
new bank. Spencer Eccles, 64, the chief executive of First
Security, will be the other co-chief executive through 2002 and
will be chairman until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both banks have approved the deal, which is
subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Some assets in
Utah, where both banks are most active, will have to be sold to
comply with antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Talks that led to the deal began in late March, Simmons said in
a telephone interview Sunday. ``We've certainly known each other
for a long time, and we've had a great deal of respect for each
other as competitors,'' he said. ``We saw this as a unique
opportunity to create a significant and very premier financial
services company located here in Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   While both banks, which are active in California, Idaho, Nevada
and several other states as well as Utah, have staked their
reputations on consumer service, they are also involved in
insurance, investment banking and Internet technology through
acquisitions and other investments. Zions in particular has been on
an acquisition binge lately, with three deals since the first of
the year alone. First Security now owns the Van Kasper investment
bank, based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Zions bought the Sumitomo Bank of California, now
known as the California Bank and Trust, for $546 million. ``It's
given us a wonderful foothold in the California market,'' Simmons
said, ``with a lot of room for additional expansion.''  &QL;

KOSOVO TALKS BREAKDOWN AS SERBS BALK OVER DETAILS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ After two days of tense negotiations, NATO
officials on Sunday night failed to get Yugoslav military officials
to agree to terms for a Serbian withdrawal from Kosovo, throwing
into doubt the peace deal reached last week by political leaders
and prompting NATO to promise to intensify bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown appeared to be caused by the Serbian demand that
the U.N. Security Council first approve a peacekeeping force before
NATO troops enter Kosovo as well as by several details of the
withdrawal plan itself, which Serbian officials felt impinged on
Yugoslav sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they would be willing to meet again, but gave no
indication of what must change in order for talks to resume.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials presented the Yugoslav delegation with a six-page
document on Saturday, which they said was non-negotiable. The
document outlined the terms for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav
army, the Serbian paramilitary and the Serbian police from Kosovo
and for NATO's entry to establish and maintain peace in the
province, where Milosevic's forces oversaw the worst mass
deportation in Europe since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job has been to translate the political agreement into a
workable military reality on the ground,'' said Lt. Gen. Michael
Jackson, the commander of the NATO's Kosovo peacekeeping force in a
statement read under klieg lights at a French air base here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav delegation presented a proposal that would not
guarantee the safe return of all the refugee or the full withdrawal
of Yugoslav forces,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the seriousness of the occasion, Jackson then
vowed that ``NATO therefore has no alternative but to continue and
indeed intensify the air campaign until such time as the Yugoslav
delegation is prepared to implement the agreement, and without
ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jackson and the Yugoslav delegation presented this clear
setback as a conflict over the basic agreement reached in Belgrade
last week by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, a special
Russian envoy and the president of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the chief spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth H.
Bacon, said, referring the group of world's top industrial powers
that includes Russia: ``We will continue to work with our NATO
allies and the G-8 to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, the air
campaign will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebojsa Bujovic, a deputy foreign minister of Yugoslavia, spoke
immediately after the British general, and said the NATO proposal
raised questions about ``the full respect of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, of which Kosovo is an integral
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly, Bujovic said Yugoslavia interpreted the agreement to
include ``deployment of international security presence under the
auspices of the U.N. or a presence established under a Security
Council mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav delegation raised four major points Sunday that
they said made it difficult to sign the agreement, according to a
NATO official. Above all, they said, they could not withdraw within
seven days as stipulated, asking for an extension of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of little details to settle,'' said Lt.
Col. Robin Clifford, the spokesman for NATO's Kosovo peacekeeping
force. ``Vehicles broken down, shortage of fuel, and roads that are
impassable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav delegation also said that they would need more than
48 hours to remove the anti-aircraft defense system in Kosovo,
according to a NATO official, and that they wanted mines cleared by
NATO, not by their own forces as required under the document.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing those and other differences, NATO officials
acknowledged that they were making changes in what they had
previously said was a non-negotiable agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well be changes in words and phrases to make sure
the points are clear,'' Clifford said. ``But there will be no
changes in the substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the questions under negotiation as the session
entered its 13th hour were the number of Serbian policeman to be
allowed in Kosovo after the initial withdrawal and whether the
Serbia would accept the buffer zone between Kosovo and its border
with Montenegro and Serbia, according to a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, NATO spokesman described the talks as ``very
professional'' and ``positive talks between military
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials expected the session Sunday to be a short one.
The talks, which began on Saturday, had been suspended overnight
after the two sides reached agreement on all but ``only one or two
minor details,'' Clifford said. They had agreed to move their
discussions to this French air base because of its modern
communications and spacious meeting rooms inside the base's
portable hangar.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates arrived by car and helicopter. They immediately
took their places around the negotiation table. Sitting on one side
were the three Yugoslav negotiators, Col. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic,
the deputy chief of staff of Yugoslav Armed Forces; Col. Gen. Obrad
Stevanovic, representing the Ministry of Interior, and Lt. Gen.
Blagoje Kovacevic, of the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   Across from them was Jackson, the sole signatory for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of what would become a serious impasse was the
arrival around noon of two NATO officials of Jackson's staff
carrying maps and briefcases filled with material about the
agreement. By this time, the other members of both delegations had
broken up into small working groups to go over the individual
sticking points that had arisen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making progress, but it's very slow,'' said Maj. Trey
Cate, a NATO spokesman, at midday. Sometime during the afternoon
session, the Yugoslav delegation asked that a Russian official take
part as an observer in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:00 p.m., the Russian military attache from the embassy in
Belgrade, Lt. Gen. Evgenie N. Barmjanchev, arrived to act as an
observer and consult and aid the Yugoslav delegation. But only two
hours later, a NATO official announced a two-hour break to allow
the Yugoslavs to ``reassess their position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems have cropped out that can only be resolved by the
president of Yugoslavia,'' said Col. Carmine De Pasquale, the head
of the Italian brigade of the Kosovo peace force.
</P>
<P>
   This was NATO's first admission that the negotiations were
coming to an impasse over major issues and not small details. The
Yugoslav position only hardened during the break and Jackson agreed
with the delegation to extend the break yet again for several more
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give Belgrade a chance to reassess its position,''
said Cate. ``We would like to go into Kosovo and we would like to
establish the conditions for the return of refugees to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   As the evening wore on, Cate warned that ``there is a very, very
slim chance of a session tomorrow if the Yugoslavs do not sign
tonight.''

NOT RELYING ON MIRACLES, KNICKS CHANGE LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The pixie dust and magic beans have served the
Knicks well in their enchanted tour through the playoffs, but the
team's realistic coach has decided that the trouble with miracles
is they are too unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   So against his structured nature, coach Jeff Van Gundy will
shake up his starting lineup even though his team leads the Pacers
by two games to one in the Eastern Conference finals. To combat the
matchup problems that could doom their supernatural ride through
the postseason, he will insert Latrell Sprewell into the starting
lineup for Game 4 Monday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell's spirits were popping like champagne after he had
campaigned for a starting role during the bulk of the season, he
didn't let it show in his subdued response to Van Gundy's decision
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal now,'' Sprewell said after the Knicks
practiced at SUNY-Purchase. ``We're so close.''
</P>
<P>
   Too close to a National Basketball Association championship
series to worry about whose name is called out as a starter. But as
fate would have it, Sprewell had just convinced himself that his
bench role was irrevocable for this season _ an issue he would take
up in the off season _ when Patrick Ewing went down with a
season-ending injury after Game 2. As a result, the matchups swung
dramatically in the Pacers' favor for Game 3 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the elated crowd nor the score revealed it _ not after a
wild 4-point play by Larry Johnson won the game, 92-91 _ but Van
Gundy saw his team dominated from the start and decided to tinker
at the risk of breaking good karma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's a gamble right now,'' he said, ``but this is the
one thing _ and it's not about winning just one game _ I know I
would have changed if the miracles wouldn't have happened. The
miracles happened, and it doesn't change what I think we need to do
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   They need to win without needing a fantasy finish. Each time the
Pacers threatened to tear away from the Knicks, Johnson came up
with shots diagramed by commercial choreographers. To close the
first quarter, Johnson hit a 30-footer at the buzzer. To beat the
shot-clock early in the fourth, he launched a 3-pointer that banked
off the glass. To win the game, he head-faked Antonio Davis, let go
of a 26-foot 3-pointer and drew a foul to create the dramatic
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Indiana looked at the tape, they'd say, `We kicked their
butt,''' Van Gundy said. ``We made three miracle shots. That was
the difference in the game. You need those type of things when
you're outplayed. We got some unbelievably great performances by
individuals, but we can't kid ourselves, either. If we play like
that again, we're going to rely on miracles? I don't think that's
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Sprewell will get his fifth start of the season, and
first of the playoffs, to balance the Knicks without Ewing. Kurt
Thomas will come off the bench, with Johnson moving over to power
forward, next to Chris Dudley at center.
</P>
<P>
   To open Game 3, the Pacers put a vulnerable Chris Mullin on the
offensively challenged Dudley and played Dale Davis on Johnson
while the 7-foot-4-inch Rik Smits guarded Thomas. By the end of the
first half, Dudley had three fouls, Thomas had two, Johnson had two
and the Pacers had a 47-42 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were cross-matched all over the place,'' Van Gundy said.
``So in transition, we were all screwed up. Instead of being able
to go at Mullin, we couldn't. And so it really got us, I thought,
off to a bad start. And I think against this team, it would
continue to get us off to a bad start. Plus, with Kurt and Dud
together, boom, quick foul trouble and then we're too small in the
second quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Pacers had Jalen Rose on the floor to push around
Sprewell, and the foul-prone big men were unable to aggressively
guard Smits, who scored 15 consecutive points at the end of the
second quarter. For Sprewell, this is also a chance to get off to a
better start and exploit any matchup he has with the slow-footed
Mullin. So far, Sprewell has had a miserable series in the
halfcourt.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the fast-break points that have grown harder to get
as the series has progressed, Sprewell would be scoring in single
digits each night. As it is, he is shooting 34 percent for the
series. He was just 6 for 19 in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was just missing shots,'' Sprewell said. ``I had a
lot of great looks, but the ball was just not going down for me. A
couple of times, they were there, and contested the shot. But
mostly, I just didn't make shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Sprewell has the chance to attack from the start, to pour
out the energy he has had to contain on the bench for the first
four to six minutes of every game. That energy has meant so much to
the success of the second unit. What now? Thomas will be the one
coming off the bench with the lively Marcus Camby and Chris Childs.
Any one of them could argue a good case to be in the starting
lineup, but they seemed at ease with Van Gundy's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell is going to start, and that's fine with me,'' Camby
said. ``It's something he's wanted, so you just have to rock 'n'
roll from there.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps win a game without using up their apportioned ration
of miracles.

HOW DOES DE LA HOYA-TRINIDAD FIGHT COMPARE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's all but set. Oscar De La Hoya and Felix
Trinidad, two of the best fighters in the world, will meet in the
ring Sept. 18 in Las Vegas in a bout reminiscent of the
Leonard-Hearns-Duran-Hagler days.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, called this ``the biggest
non-heavyweight fight since Leonard-Hagler'' in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Is it?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this long-awaited welterweight title-unification event
is monumental by today's standards. It might be the most compelling
lower-division matchup possible.
</P>
<P>
   However, how does it compare in terms of significance to the
biggest bouts involving the four legends mentioned above, whose
name recognition and popularity were built on free television?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what De La Hoya-Trinidad has working !ital!for!off! it
and against it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FOR IT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _De La Hoya and Trinidad both carry the marketable mystique of
perfect records. It's impossible to imagine either losing, which
provides the kind of intrigue that translates into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   None of the bouts involving their illustrious predecessors
pitted two undefeated champions against one another.
</P>
<P>
   _De La Hoya is, without question, the most popular
non-heavyweight fighter in the world. He and his advisers have
carefully built a movie star-like image and a fortune in the seven
years since he won an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of the few boxers who could fight !ital!anyone!off! and
create a stir.
</P>
<P>
   _Anticipation for the bout has built steadily for several years.
There are a lot of people out there dying to watch De La Hoya build
upon his legend or fall flat on his face.
</P>
<P>
   _This is an era when the best often avoid fighting the best:
Unfortunately, a loss is perceived as devastating in terms of
earning power. That means De La Hoya and Trinidad are gambling,
which is exactly how it should be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
AGAINST IT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Trinidad. Yes, he's a fine _ albeit relatively untested _
fighter. However, few outside Puerto Rico and the boxing community
know much about him. He might be compared to Roberto Duran, a
Panamanian who burst upon the American consciousness when he
outpointed a then-undefeated Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   However, Leonard, Hearns and Hagler _ who had the advantage of
fighting on free television _ had built considerable followings
before they met one another.
</P>
<P>
   Each was a star in his own way: Leonard the darling of America;
Hearns a vicious knockout artist; Hagler a complete, seemingly
unbeatable force; and Duran a legend.
</P>
<P>
   _De La Hoya. Again, he's big. At the same time, he's no Leonard,
who _ once again _ had the advantage of free television. In 1976,
when Leonard won his gold medal, boxing was a featured event in
Olympic coverage. Thus, he became a hero overnight in many segments
of society and then built upon that popularity as a pro on free TV.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't so for De La Hoya, whose path to Olympic gold
received limited focus and whose biggest fights have been broadcast
only on pay-per-view TV, which limits viewers.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's popularity is tremendous among boxing-crazy Latinos
but not Leonard-like among others.
</P>
<P>
   _The perfect records are the result _ at least in part _ of the
fighters' competition.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has come a long way. His competition, once
questioned, has been improved. Most significantly, he outpointed
both Pernell Whitaker and Ike Quartey. Trinidad's best opponent?
Oba Carr. His only other notable foe was Whitaker, who was 35 and
had deteriorated since he met De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Co. had much more impressive resumes. &QL; 
BOTTOM LINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This bout doesn't rival the days of Leonard-Hearns-Duran-Hagler.
It couldn't. De La Hoya and Trinidad don't have the history their
predecessors did at the same time of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   However, it doesn't get any better than this today. And who
knows: It could be the start of a series of bouts about which fight
fans will be talking 20 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Fight on: Todd duBoef, an executive with Top Rank, the firm that
promotes De La Hoya, said a report that the Sept. 18 bout is up in
the air because De La Hoya is demanding $30 million is untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Alcazar, De La Hoya's trainer, was quoted in a Puerto
Rican newspaper as saying his fighter would not agree to the
roughly $15 million he's expected to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight is on no matter what anybody says,'' said duBoef,
who asked De La Hoya on Saturday whether there was any truth to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``(De La Hoya said) absolutely not. We're ready to go.
Everything is fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   The parties are scheduled to meet this week to work out final
details, duBoef said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman-Tyson?: Shelly Finkel, Mike Tyson's adviser, dismissed
talk of a George Foreman-Tyson bout as just that _ talk.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Weathers, a Foreman adviser, wants to put together a bout
that would pay Tyson $25 million and Foreman $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, Finkel said Weathers has tried to make the fight for
years and is no closer now than he ever was.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel said he has repeatedly told Weathers to have Foreman
contact him to prove the boxing legend is interested and actively
involved in the project. Weathers agreed but, alas, Finkel has yet
to hear from Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there are many obstacles. For example, Showtime has
expressed interest in the bout even though Bob Arum and HBO _
Showtime's rival _ have contractual rights to a Foreman-Tyson bout.
See the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Still, Finkel didn't discount the possibility that the two
heavyweights might meet one day but said, for now, ``It's
fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield-Lewis: Negotiations for a second bout between
heavyweight champions Holyfield and Lennox Lewis in November are
moving slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem is this: HBO, which has the television rights,
doesn't want Don King to play an active role in the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Why? King is being investigated for corruption following the
controversial first Holyfield-Lewis bout. The network fears King
will be indicted for fixing the first fight during the promotion
for the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Can you blame HBO?
</P>
<P>
   Those close to negotiations say Holyfield and Lewis want the
fight badly and expect it to be made in spite of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jones-Johnson: Pity Roy Jones Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the guy is the most complete fighter in the world. He
proved it again by dominating Reggie Johnson in a title-unification
bout Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one in or around his weight class has any reasonable
chance of beating him. He might retire one day without a signature
victory, which would be a shame for a fighter of his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, he might fight Evander Holyfield. It's an interesting
prospect but most likely an impossible task. If he gets caught
once, he could be finished. And, remember, Holyfield has a great
chin; Jones could never hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   Reid watch: David Reid vs. Kevin Kelly?
</P>
<P>
   Not that Kevin Kelly, who spells his name Kelley. This Kelly
(23-5-3, 10 KOs) is from Australia and has absolutely no chance of
dethroning the unbeaten WBA world welterweight champion when they
meet July 16 in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Reid (12-0, seven KOs) has fought opponents with a combined
record of 310-45-5, 212 KOs) at the time of the fights, according
to America Presents, Reid's promotional company.

   In her 20th attempt to win the U.S. Women's Open, Inkster left
nothing to chance, and overwhelmed the competition. At the age of
38, and in record-shattering fashion, she won the most prestigious
championship in women's golf Sunday, bringing her experience and
talent together on a vulnerable golf course that played to her
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Inkster reached the 16th tee at Old Waverly Golf
Club, she had a five-stroke lead, the gallery was showering her
with ovations and it was safe to start working on a victory speech.
While young talents like Kelli Kuehne and Grace Park proved they
have the talent to win future Opens, this moment _ and a $315,000
winner's check _ clearly belonged to Inkster.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting an Open-record 16-under-par 272 for the tournament, and
winning the fourth major title of her splendid career, Inkster
cruised to a five-stroke victory over Sherri Turner, who finished
at 277. Kuehne, a 22-year-old two-time U.S. Amateur champion, was
third at 279 after shooting a 74.
</P>
<P>
   For Inkster, a three-time U.S. Amateur champion, her first U.S.
Open championship was worth the wait. A native of Santa Cruz,
Calif., she became the first American to win the women's Open since
Patty Sheehan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After a restless night, Inkster started the round Sunday morning
holding a four-stroke lead. In 1992, she had led the Open by two
strokes with two holes to play, only to lose to Sheehan in a
playoff. It was a loss that Inkster could never forget, and before
this weekend, she wondered if her best chance to win the Open had
already passed.
</P>
<P>
   But Inkster was rock-solid Sunday, shooting a one-under 71, and
she never led by fewer than three strokes. And after sinking her
final putt, Inkster, whose victory was her third of the year, spoke
freely about winning the championship that she wanted so badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told myself I've got to have the heart to win this
thing,'' said Inkster, who played the most consistent golf of her
career. ``To lose it again, I don't know if I could have gone
through another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my tournament to lose. No one had the pressure on
except me. That's the hardest part. I've played a lot of years, and
'92 was a heartbreak. But to come back to win today, no one can
take that away from me. I'm a U.S. Open champion, and I always will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster will try for the modern career grand slam later this
month when she plays in the McDonald's LPGA Championship, the only
major tournament she hasn't won.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster now has 24 Hall of Fame points, three shy of gaining
entrance into the LPGA Hall of Fame. Players are awarded two points
for winning a major, and one point for winning any other Ladies
Professional Golf Association event. Inkster has 20 career
victories, including four majors. But this tournament will be
remembered not only for her play, but also for the numerous scoring
records that fell:
</P>
<P>
   _ With scores of 65-69-67-71, Inkster's 16 under par easily
surpassed the previous women's Open record of 10 under, set by
Alison Nicholas in 1997 at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club in North Plains,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   _ There were 135 under-par rounds during the tournament,
smashing the previous record of 89, also in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   _ In tying for eighth, Park, the reigning U.S. amateur champion
who will turn professional on Monday, set a low-scoring record for
an amateur (five-under-par 283), breaking Jenny Chuasiriporn's 290
last year. If not for a two-stroke penalty when her caddie
accidentally stepped on her buried ball at No. 8, Park's score
would have been even lower.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turner's 277 was the best score on record for a runner-up.
After winning just $12,017 last year, and without a top-three
finish since 1995, she was one of the happiest second-place
finishers ever, winning $185,000, more than she had won in the last
three years combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't win, but in my mind, I got over a hump,'' said
Turner, who had the most spectacular shot of the day when she
eagled No. 11, sinking a 7-wood shot from 216 yards. ``The last 10
years has been a struggle. There have been times when I've felt
like quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Turner nor anyone else could threaten Inkster. At No. 7,
she saved par with a marvelous bunker shot from a buried lie from
about 35 feet, the ball stopping less than two feet from the cup.
Kuehne, who was paired in the final group with Inkster, could sense
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked at Juli and said, `That's an amazing shot,'''
said Kuehne, who has finished seventh, first and third in her last
three events. ``She was playing way too consistently to have any
sort of meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Inkster was embraced by her husband, Brian, on the
18th green and surrounded by players offering congratulations.
There were times Inkster wondered if she could juggle her family
life _ she also has two children _ and her career. Today was
further proof that she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every tournament has a special place,'' Inkster said.
``But this is the ultimate.''

MYERS MAKES GALAXY DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Costa Rican midfielder Roy Myers made his Los
Angeles Galaxy debut Sunday. Myers was dealt to Los Angeles from
New York/New Jersey in a three-team deal that sent Welton to Miami
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Myers replaced Ezra Hendrickson on the right side of the
midfield to start the second half and left a good impression with
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was good, I was very happy with him,'' said Schmid. ``He's
got a great attitude and he's a very sneaky defensive player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has had trouble maintaining possession, but Myers is
known for his ability to make good passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent a couple of good balls in for people to get sprung on
breakaways,'' said Schmid. ``And he also found (Mauricio)
Cienfuegos which is something we're always trying to do. I think as
he gets more comfortable with our team he's going to become an
important part.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo's return: The Galaxy is hoping to get a scoring lift
when Mexican scoring champion Carlos Hermosillo joins the team
Monday after finishing his season in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo is coming at a good time. The Galaxy faces MLS
champion Chicago Saturday at the Rose Bowl without Cobi Jones and
Robin Fraser. Both Jones and Fraser will be with the U.S. National
team when they face Argentina in Chicago the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had about six or seven good crosses and a couple of good
crosses on corners that we didn't do anything with today,'' said
Schmid. ``That's where Hermosillo is going to help us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also pretty strong on the ball. He's tough to muscle
around and he's got a good spin with defenders on him. Those are
just a couple of dimensions he brings and those are certainly
area's where we have struggled.''

PLENTY OF QUALITY TO GO AROUND AT 25TH SEATTLE INTERNATIONAL FILM
FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``Run Lola Run,'' an exhilarating German film about a
woman frantically trying to raise money to pay off her boyfriend's
debt to gangsters, received the Golden Space Needle award for best
picture Sunday in the closing ceremonies of the 25th Seattle
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Everett was voted best actor for his performance in ``An
Ideal Husband;'' Piper Laurie was named best actress for her
performance in ``The Mao Game;'' John Sayles was selected best
director for `Limbo;'' and ``Buena Vista Social Club'' was honored
as the best documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The two American Independent Awards went to ``Dead Dogs'' and
Laurie (her second prize of the day); and the three awards in the
New Director's Showcase competition were divided among Belgium's
``Rosie,'' the Czech Republic's ``The Bed'' and Norway's ``Only
Clouds Move the Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards and the official closing night presentation, ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' capped 25 days of frantic film
activity in the city and screenings of some 206 films _ SIFF's
largest lineup ever _ and, once again, a figure no other American
film festival can come close to matching.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best-attended festival ever (up 8 percent from last
year, with a projected attendance of 142,560), and, to my mind, the
best festival of the '90s in terms of quality. Festival director
Darryl Macdonald said going in that this 25th SIFF would be
``something special,'' and he more than made good on the promise.
</P>
<P>
   It was the festival that had something for everyone, and a bit
more: five filmmaker tributes, 25 classic revivals, 20
documentaries, appearances by literally hundreds of filmmaker
guests _ climaxing with a spectacular, goosebump-inducing
presentation of the 1925 ``Battleship Potemkin'' (accompanied by
the full Bellevue Philharmonic Orchestra) that is sure to go down
as one of the greatest moments in SIFF history.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were the usual flub-ups and no-shows that
invariably plague any film festival (the much-advertised, 25th
anniversary souvenir booklet, for instance, somehow didn't get
printed, and is now scheduled to come out for next year's 26th). I
also didn't attend a single event that started on time.
</P>
<P>
   But these annoyances were barely noticed, the vibes were
exceedingly good, and less complaining was heard in the queues than
in any festival of recent memory _ largely, I think, because the
films were overwhelmingly good. Out of the 80-plus entries I
managed to see, I can count the stinkers on one hand, and thus will
have to forgo my usual ritual of revenge: a festival ten-worst
list.
</P>
<P>
   The number of low-budget American independent films _ a figure
that has grown astronomically in the '90s _ was significantly
slashed for the 25th, and, clearly, a much tougher selection
process was exercised. Many of the films that made the cut still
were forgettable, but most justified their presence in the lineup
with a stand-out performance, an intriguing storyline or a flash of
embryonic talent somewhere in the credits.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, SIFF '99 lived up to the ``I'' in its initials by
delivering its strongest slate of foreign films in many years: a
testament both to the programmers' determination to make the 25th
festival a landmark edition and to the fact that the international
cinema genuinely seems to be in the first stages on a badly needed
creative renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this may have been the first SIFF in which I caught at
least one memorable film from each of 30 countries, and from every
region of the world: such happy surprises as the Czech Republic's
``Sekal Must Die,'' Ireland's ``Sweety Barrett,'' Tunisia's ``Bent
Familia,'' Russia's ``Day of the Full Moon,'' Taiwan's ``Jam,'' and
Australia's ``The Castle.''
</P>
<P>
   There were almost as many foreign films that, because of the
daunting 206-film lineup, I missed, but which generated
enthusiastic reviews and audience word-of-mouth, including
Yugoslavia's ``Black Cat, White Cat,'' Greece's ``Shores of
Twilight,'' France's ``Lautrec,'' and Italy's ``Besieged.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is my list of 10 festival discoveries that are definitely
worth catching when (and if) they come back to town for a
theatrical run:
</P>
<P>
   Earth _ Incorrectly labeled a Canadian film in the SIFF program,
this heartbreaking Indian drama set in Lahore just before and
during the partition of India in 1947 is a stunning historic epic,
and a profound examination of the 20th century's seminal and
still-bloodiest outbreak of communal violence. Opens in September.
</P>
<P>
   An Ideal Husband _ This British comedy is arguably the movies'
best adaptation of an Oscar Wilde play: a witty, stylish character
piece and delicious slice of late-Victorian London society, with
Rupert Everett at his scene-stealing best muttering Wildean
epigrams from the corner of his mouth. Opens June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Adrenaline Drive _ Shinonu Yaguchi demonstrates once again why
he is considered Japan's hottest comedy director with this uniquely
charming and frequently hilarious farce about a timid rental-car
clerk and a meek nurse who fall in love while on the run with a bag
of the Yakuza's money. No opening scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Last Night _ This offbeat Canadian ensemble tragicomedy,
directed by actor Don McKellar and set in a Toronto counting down
the final hours before the end of the Planet Earth is a funny,
scary and surprisingly emotionally powerful examination of a human
species in a strange state of denial. Opens in September.
</P>
<P>
   Return With Honor _ This absorbing, sobering documentary about
the U.S. POWs in Hanoi during the Vietnam War (which incorporates
recently released footage from the Vietnamese government) is an
epic story of prison survival comparable to such classics in the
genre as ``Papillon'' and ``Birdman of Alcatraz.'' Opens July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Run Lola Run _ Incorporating animation, rock-video techniques
and director Tom Tykwer's unique story-telling style, this German
celebration of speed _ showing three alternate plot-lines as its
heroine has 20 minutes to raise 100,000 marks to save her
boyfriend's life _ powers along like a truck on the Autobahn. Opens
June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Contract _ It's not quite ``The French Connection'' or
``Day of the Jackal,'' but this what-if, Swedish nail-biter about a
maverick cop who stumbles on the 1986 conspiracy to assassinate
Prime Minister Olaf Palme is an irresistible paranoid thriller that
proves Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on the genre. No opening
date scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates of Silicon Valley _ This made-for-cable, dual biopic
which chronicles the rise of Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple
Computer's Steve Jobs in the '70s and '80s _ and basically contends
the two tycoons stole the ideas that made them so fabulously
wealthy _ is fast, wildly irreverent, outrageous fun. Airs on TNT,
beginning June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Jinnah _ British actor Christoper Lee plays Mohammed Ali Jinnah,
the Father of Pakistan, in this absorbing biography that sugarcoats
some aspects of his life, but is mostly an eye-filling and
fair-minded epic designed to boost Jinnah's legacy as an
alternative to the Taliban-like Muslim extremists now trying to
take over that country. No opening date scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   To Walk With Lions _ This superb British/South African drama,
roughly a sequel to 1966's ``Born Free,'' is a passionate
environmental plea, a extraordinary character study (with a
towering performance by Richard Harris), and a disturbing,
mournful, poignant ode to the passing of the African wilderness in
our lifetime. No opening date scheduled.

MANAGER SAYS HE'LL GO IF METS DON'T GET BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day after three of his coaches were dismissed,
New York Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said he deserved to follow
them if the team did not improve within the next third of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about my job,'' Valentine said at the end of a
long and uncomfortable news conference at Yankee Stadium that he
shared with General Manager Steve Phillips, who dismissed the
coaches Saturday evening against Valentine's strong objections. ``I
believe within the next 55 games if we're not better, I shouldn't
be the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said that consideration of the first 55 games,
approximately one-third of the 162-game season, was enough to
decide it was time for a change. He replaced Bob Apodaca with Dave
Wallace as pitching coach, Randy Niemann with Al Jackson as bullpen
coach, and Tom Robson with Mickey Brantley as hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips acted after the Mets had lost their eighth straight
game and had fallen to a record of 27-28. The last time the Mets
lost eight in a row was in 1996; Valentine became manager in the
midst of that one.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was asked if he felt he would be gone if the team
didn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would be an absolute foregone conclusion,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Would he resign?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say that,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine expressed some optimism that the team would stay
in the pennant race. ``Within the next 55 to 75 games we'll be in
touch with the leaders of our division,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during batting practice, as Valentine discussed Bobby
Bonilla's hitting mechanics with Brantley, Valentine was asked if
he had considered quitting his job in protest against the dismissal
of three coaches who also happen to be his good friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand quitting,'' Valentine said. ``I don't know
what it is to quit. And to my coaches' credit, they know that about
me and they made it absolutely clear what we've got to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, during the news conference, Valentine squirmed often in
his seat and appeared to have trouble controlling his reactions to
certain questions directed at Phillips. Later, Valentine admitted
that the last two days had been extremely tough on him and that he
had spent Saturday night in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was finding me last night,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   He had just endured another galling defeat on Saturday, only to
ride a team bus back to Shea Stadium to meet with Phillips for more
than an hour. Valentine delivered his arguments to Phillips about
why he should not replace the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   So far as Phillips was concerned, however, there was nothing
Valentine could say to change his mind. The two met again Sunday
afternoon before making the trip from Shea. And one member of the
organization said that where an already strained relationship could
have become irreparably lost, it was surprising, considering the
growing animosity between Phillips and Valentine, how well things
went.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Sunday to describe his relationship with Phillips,
who was sitting right next to him, Valentine said: ``It was
emotional last night and very professional today. We've had some
situations in the past and we came out stronger afterwards.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Could there be a worse place in America to hold this news
conference than Yankee Stadium, one questioner asked. Phillips did
not answer. But Valentine smiled inside the home of the team that
always steals the headlines from his team and said, ``I don't think
it could be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Valentine's players were dealing with questions about
their relationships with the three coaches who had just been
deposed. Almost all noted that it was they and not the coaches who
threw or hit the balls.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was that it was not the coaches' fault that the Mets
were already six games back in the loss column in the National
League wild-card race. John Olerud, for one, appeared to be taken
aback that Robson had been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, who set the club record in batting average last season
when he hit .354, credited Robson with helping him turn around a
career that had gone stale in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best hitting instructor that I've worked with,''
Olerud said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the Mets' front office felt the same about
Apodaca's work with the team's pitchers. But the Mets, who opened
the season with a $63.5 million payroll, are built to win now.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Valentine's job was in jeopardy, Phillips said,
``It is still my opinion that Bobby is the guy who will lead us out
of the slump we're in.''

GALAXY'S WIN IS A STRUGGLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With the way his luck has gone lately,
nothing has been a sure thing for Clint Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   He's missed more chances and hit more posts than he could count
this season, which made his can't-miss, empty-net goal tougher than
it should have been in the Los Angeles Galaxy's 1-0 victory over
Kansas City in front of 6,871 at the Rose Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a game pitting the two lowest-scoring teams in Major League
Soccer, the Galaxy's Cobi Jones narrowly beat an off-side trap down
the left side on a pass from Mauricio Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   Clear of the defense, Jones drew Wizards goalkeeper Chris Snitko
away from his line, leaving Mathis clear in front of the net. Jones
dropped his pass in front of the goal for Mathis, but what seemed
like an easy tap-in barely caught the right side of the net in the
64th minute.
</P>
<P>
   That's just how it's gone for the Galaxy (6-6) this season.
Nothing comes easy, not when you've scored only eight goals in 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City dropped to a league-worst 1-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the goal) was definitely harder than I thought it was
going to be,'' said Mathis of his third goal of the season. ``It
was a little bumpy in front of the goal. They just sodded that area
and it took a funny bounce. It went in, though. That's the most
important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis and Jones (two goals this season) have taken most of the
heat for the Galaxy's lack of scoring. Jones hit the post twice
Sunday and Mathis missed an earlier opportunity that would have put
the Wizards away much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis admitted he had several chances to score last week in a
2-1 shootout loss at Columbus. He said his confidence isn't
rattled, but it's definitely on the shaky side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, sometimes it is,'' said Mathis. ``Right now it seems
like nothing's going to go my way. In practice, I've been working
on (finishing). I've been getting a lot of confidence there, but it
was good to actually get one in the back of the net during a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid was hoping his team could use this game
to notch its first multiple-scoring outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going through this a long time,'' said Schmid.
``The goal seems so small right now or maybe it's just wrapped in
cellophane.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Los Angeles received another solid effort from
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, who recorded his MLS-leading sixth
shutout.

LLOYD BURKE, 74, WINNER OF MEDAL OF HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Va., N.H.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. Lloyd Burke, who won the Medal of Honor in the Korean War
for killing 100 Chinese communist soldiers in a
five-and-a-half-hour battle to capture a hill, died on Tuesday at
his home in Hot Springs, Ark. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Burke died in his sleep, his family said, after he returned from
ceremonies in Indianapolis on Memorial Day weekend, in which Medal
of Honor winners were recognized.
</P>
<P>
   During the last week of October 1951, Burke, then a lieutenant
with the 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, was preparing
to return to the United States after 13 months of combat in the
Korean War. He had received the Distinguished Service Cross for
leading his company through a roadblock in November 1950 when
Chinese forces poured into North Korea across the Yalu River. He
had also won a Bronze Star and earned two Purple Hearts.
</P>
<P>
   He was at a command post while U.S. troops were trying to
dislodge Chinese forces from Hill 200 near Seoul, the capital of
South Korea. When the effort bogged down amid heavy casualties,
Burke headed into the thick of the action, 300 Chinese defending
the hill against 35 weary American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men were completely beat,'' he recalled later. ``They
lay huddled in foxholes, unable to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke moved ahead of his troops, firing a rifle and throwing
grenades. Chinese soldiers hurled grenades at him, but he caught
three and threw them back. He picked up a machine gun and fired
into an enemy trench, clearing out mortar and machine-gun
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese began to flee, but when Burke's machine gun jammed,
a soldier tossed a grenade that sent shrapnel into the back of his
hand. Burke unjammed his machine gun, killed that man and continued
to fire as the remnants of his company, inspired by his efforts,
began to fight again. When he ran out of machine-gun ammunition, he
used a pistol and grenades to kill enemy stragglers.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 250 Chinese soldiers were found _ 100 of them
killed by Burke _ after the hill was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Burke finally went home to his wife, Virginia, and an
18-month-old son. On April 11, 1952, President Harry S. Truman
presented him with the Medal of Honor at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, a native of Tichnor, Ark., served in Italy during World
War II as a sergeant in the combat engineers. After his discharge,
he resumed studies at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia,
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from college, he re-enlisted in the Army in
1950 with a lieutenant's commission. He remained in the military
after the Korean War and arrived in South Vietnam in July 1965, as
a battalion commander in the 1st Infantry Division. On his 10th day
in combat, he was hit by a Viet Cong grenade while riding in a
helicopter near Bien Hoa. He suffered a fractured left leg and
shrapnel wounds, ending his career as a combat officer.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Army's chief liaison to the House of Representatives
from 1967 to 1978, and then retired as a colonel.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage ended in divorce; his second wife, Maxine
Hardin Burke, died.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Gary and Douglas, and a daughter,
Leslie Ann Burke, all of Springfield, Va.; three sisters, Donna
Eddins and Dorothy Burke, of Hot Springs; and Betty Lorince, of
Stuttgart, Ark.; a stepson, Michael Hardin, of Helena, Ark.; a
stepdaughter, Pam Hardin Hughes, of New Hampshire, and five
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, a former president of the Congressional Medal of Honor
Society, participated in fund raising for the Korean War Veterans
Memorial in Washington. When the memorial was dedicated in July
1995, President Clinton praised Burke, a guest of honor at the
ceremonies, for having displayed ``extraordinary courage and
leadership'' in battle.

U.S. PEACE NEGOTIATOR WAS ALWAYS A DIPLOMAT AT HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to modify the 4th graf to reflect the newly uncertain state
of the peace deal.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1967, when Yale, like many other universities,
was in ferment over the war in Vietnam, James Reston, the columnist
for The New York Times, was in New Haven and ran into a 21-year-old
junior named Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   When Reston asked Talbott where he stood on the war, Reston
wrote in his column, this is the response he got: ``I do not want
to help pillory the present administration. I am interested to see
if there are new means and attitudes by which this university, and
hence the university community in general, can make discussion less
polemical and more meaningful and at the same time help the search
for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Talbott, now 53 years old and the deputy secretary
of state, spent his entire career as a journalist before he joined
the Clinton administration, he obviously thought and spoke like a
diplomat even as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   His diplomatic skills served him well last week during
negotiations to end the war in Yugoslavia with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic; the Russian envoy on Kosovo, former Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, and President Martii Ahtisaari of
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Saturday, Talbott, who arrived home
Friday night, was wary of saying anything that might jinx the
endgame in the Balkans. ``The talks at the border are still going
on, and this isn't over,'' he said. ``I want to make sure my
comments aren't ahead of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the negotiations as ``a very complex example of
diplomacy and force coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth week out of the last seven that Talbott (he
pronounces it TALL-but) has been in Europe. On weekends, he flew
home to meet with President Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very intense,'' he said. ``It's had its ups and
downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said that becoming a diplomat was never his ambition.
``Journalism is the only profession I ever aspired to,'' he said.
``It was a biographical fluke that presented me with this
extraordinary opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The fluke was that he and Bill Clinton were roommates at Oxford
when they were Rhodes Scholars, and they remained close friends
afterward. When Clinton became president in 1993, he made Talbott
ambassador-at-large with responsibility for countries of the former
Soviet Union. The next year, he became deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations over the war in Yugoslavia allowed ``a couple
of aspects of my life to come together,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   One was his interest in Russia. He majored in Russian studies at
Yale, is fluent in Russian and translated and edited two volumes of
Nikita Khrushchev's memoirs in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He and Chernomyrdin spoke Russian when they talked one on one,
aides said. When all three negotiators were at the table, the talks
were in English, and they were translated into Russian for
Chernomyrdin,
</P>
<P>
   The other aspect Talbott mentioned was his interest in
Yugoslavia. His first job after he and his wife were married in
1971 was as Eastern European correspondent for Time magazine, based
in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he turned on the television in his room in
Bonn, Germany, this week and saw the Yugoslav Parliament meeting on
the peace agreement, he recalled that the first apartment he and
his wife had in Belgrade was only three blocks away from the
Parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Strobridge Talbott III was born in Dayton, Ohio, on April
25, 1946. His father was an investment banker. He began learning
Russian in prep school at Hotchkiss in Connecticut and wrote his
thesis at Yale on the 19th century Russian lyric poet Fyodor
Tyuchev.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Time magazine after his years as a Rhodes Scholar and
never worked anywhere else until he entered the government. He
began as an intern in the Moscow bureau and rose to become
diplomatic correspondent, White House correspondent, Washington
bureau chief and editor at large.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bosnia peace negotiations were under way in Dayton in
1995, he pointed out to the participants some landmarks of his
youth, and he was host of a dinner at the Dayton Racquet Club, to
which his parents had belonged when he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott's wife, Brooke Shearer, has long been a friend of the
Clintons. She worked on the 1992 campaign and is now an official at
the Department of Interior, where she helps developing countries
set up park systems. They have two sons, Devin, 22, who is entering
law school in the fall, and Adrian, 18, who just finished his
freshman year at Amherst College.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Amherst dedicating a Russian culture center last
year, Talbott described how he had been fascinated by Russia ever
since the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite when he was
11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found it useful,'' he declared, ``to have, programmed
into the software of my thinking and puzzling about Russia, a sense
of what a mixed bag that proud and insecure, rich and deprived,
confused and confusing country has been, what it is today and what
it can be someday.''

WEB SPINOFF FROM DISNEY IS CONSIDERED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. is considering a spinoff of its
Internet-related operations, several people close to the
discussions said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The details of any plan were not clear, but Disney has stakes in
several Internet businesses that could become part of any spinoff.
A Disney spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say that Disney is under pressure to raise its
sagging stock price, which has been hurt recently by weak earnings
from its television and film operations. For the second quarter,
Disney said its profit fell 30 percent because of weaker home video
and merchandising sales and higher costs at ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those figures, shares of Disney rose $1.625, or 5.6
percent, on Friday, to $30.625, amid reports that Disney might
either spin off some of its Internet operations or possibly buy
back some stock. Disney's stock had been as high as $40.313 last
July and had fallen to $22.50 by October.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Disney acquired 43 percent of the Infoseek Corp., a
service that helps guide users on the World Wide Web, in a deal
valued at $900 million. Disney put up $90 million in cash and its
ownership of Starwave, a company that creates elaborate Web sites.
Disney had previously acquired Starwave in several phases from Paul
Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest venture is the sports site it operates on
behalf of ESPN. Several of Disney's other businesses, including
ABC, ABC News and Disney itself, have established Web sites, and
one analyst speculated Sunday that Disney might swap those assets
into Infoseek in exchange for a larger stake in the company.
Infoseek executives could not be reached for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Disney already has the right to raise its stake in Infoseek to
as much as 50.1 percent as part of an agreement to lend Infoseek up
to $139 million over the first five years of the deal. Infoseek and
Disney have also created the Go Network, Disney's answer to Yahoo,
and other portals to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Disney could theoretically spin off some of its assets into a
tracking stock, where underlying assets are owned by the parent
company but the stock itself is publicly traded. But a spinoff
might not be met as favorably on Wall Street as a stock buyback
because Internet stocks have weakened and new offerings have lost
some of their allure.

 &HT;    EDS: Updates with collapse of talks and fresh material
throughout 
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ NATO pledged to ``intensify the air
campaign `` against Yugoslavia after marathon talks on implementing
a peace plan collapsed early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military commanders had made a proposal ``that would
not guarantee the safe return of all'' ethnic Albanian refugees who
fled Kosovo or ``the full withdrawal of Yugoslav forces'' from the
embattled province, said Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the NATO
commander in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav proposal was ``inconsistent'' with terms of a peace
plan accepted Thursday by the Yugoslav federal government and
approved overwhelmingly by the Serb parliament, he said. Serbia is
the dominant republic in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a statement to reporters in the pre-dawn darkness,
Jackson said NATO now has ``no alternative'' but to ``intensify the
air campaign until such time as the Yugoslav side (is) prepared to
agree to implement the agreement fully and without ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Jackson's announcement, air raid sirens sounded in
Belgrade, warning of possible resumed NATO attacks in the Yugoslav
capital.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear when, of if, talks would resume on
the so-called ``military technical agreement'' that lays out the
conditions for the withdrawal of Serb-led military and police units
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson indicated the NATO commanders were willing to meet
again. Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic, who
participated in the talks, told reporters the same thing as he
demanded a halt to any further bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's reference to a Yugoslav ``proposal'' indicated the
talks had gone seriously off track. When they began Saturday at a
cafe in Blace on the Macedonian border, NATO officials had
envisioned no negotiations and swift Yugoslav acceptance of the
alliance withdrawal plan.
</P>
<P>
   But snags developed early Sunday when the talks shifted to a
camouflage tent at a hot and dusty airfield in Kumanovo, northwest
of the Macedonian capital of Skopje. The Yugoslav commanders took
issue with plans for the simultaneous entry of NATO-led
peacekeeping forces as Serb-led forces were withdrawing from
Kosovo. As the talks edged into Monday morning, it became apparent
they were at an impasse on this and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Yugoslav military commanders had agreed to
only six of the 20 conditions in the 6-page withdrawal document.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at the seriousness of the ruptured talks, Finnish
President Marti Ahtisaari, who had brokered the peace plan,
abruptly cancelled a planned trip to discuss it with Chinese
leaders in Beijing amid speculation he might be asked to resume his
negotiating role.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the talks collapsed, NATO used U.S. B-52 bombers to
pound Serb troops along Kosovo's border with Albania. Yugoslavia's
state-run Tanjug news agency reported late Sunday that NATO jets
also fired 30 missiles at Serb targets in western Kosovo, which is
a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the Yugoslavs' refusal to sign the
agreement was a stalling tactic. Pentagon officials have said in
recent days that Serb forces may want more time to cover up
evidence of atrocities before they are forced to withdraw from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There also were NATO reports Sunday of Serb forces looting the
towns of Prizren and Pristina inside Kosovo. Meanwhile, Serb forces
and pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas engaged in
heavy fighting Sunday along the Kosovo-Albania border.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and other allied officials said late Sunday that the
Yugoslav military commanders raised a number of objections to the
agreement. Among them, they:
</P>
<P>
   _ Did not like the simultaneous entry of NATO-led peacekeeping
troops into Kosovo at the same time that Serb-led forces were
withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Were unable to withdraw all of their 40,000 forces within the
specified 7-day period because they didn't have enough
</P>
<P>
   gas and many of their vehicles were damaged. They reportedly
wanted up to ten days. They also reportedly said that many of their
forces could not quickly reach the three NATO-designated withdrawal
routes from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opposed withdrawing their forces from a 15-mile buffer zone
between Serbia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Were unwilling to withdraw Serb police officers who are
residents of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Insisted the NATO-led peacekeeping effort could not begin
until the United Nations Security Council approved it.
</P>
<P>
   There also was confusion Sunday about whether the KLA would
disarm, as called for in the peace plan. Shinasi Rama, a KLA
spokesman, told CNN that ``we see no reason'' to totally disarm,
arguing that guerrilla fighters should be permitted to retain small
arms like those Americans ``can buy in a K-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, aid workers at the main Stankovec refugee center in
Macedonia on Sunday attributed a near-riot and bloody attack on
five ethnic Roma, or gypsy, refugees three of them children to
mounting tensions over the talks. They also worried the incident
previewed how ugly relations may become in Kosovo among ethnic
Albanians, Serbs and other minority groups once the refugees do get
home again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad sign for any kind of ethnic tolerance inside Kosovo
when they go back,'' said Nancy Shalala, spokesperson for the
Catholic Relief Services. ``People are looking for some face to be
responsible for what happened inside Kosovo. This time the face was
the Romas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic agency's volunteers and international staff dragged
a Roma father and son from a crowd that was battering them Saturday
night around 7:30 p.m. Some ethnic Albanian refugees believed the
two men had been collaborators with Serb forces and were
responsible for killing some Albanians, Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers took the Romas, who are also considered gypsies, to
an agency office for protection. But the crowd built until some
angry refugees stormed the office and beat the two men nearly
senseless.
</P>
<P>
   The attacking refugees finally were driven outside, but then set
upon three Roma children and tried ``to rip them limb from limb,''
Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   All five were rescued and taken for medical treatment, but only
after U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill came to the scene and
quieted the teeming crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more tense now,'' said refugee Musa Govori, 32, who
said he witnessed part of the melee and Hill's intervention.
``These people have already learned a lot from the Milosevic's past
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees not only are afraid the talks may not bear fruit, but
also now must confront the uncertainty of what destruction and loss
they will find at home if the talks do succeed.
</P>

FIRST LADY'S PET ISSUES COULD SHAPE SENATE RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As she inches closer to running for senator from
New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton is preparing to build a campaign
around education, family and health care issues _ the areas where
she has the clearest record of accomplishment, and failure,
Democrats close to the first lady say.
</P>
<P>
   Those three areas would be a natural focus of Mrs. Clinton's
campaign, because she cares passionately about them and has become
a leading administration voice on all three. For someone who has
never run for office, Mrs. Clinton has also established a
remarkably long and detailed track record on the issues during two
decades of public life.
</P>
<P>
   That record _ established in leading an education commission in
Arkansas, in her much criticized handling of the 1993 health care
debate and in her more recent but less noticed role in negotiating
adoption and bankruptcy legislation _ is sure to be a target of
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton's advisers believe that there will be a clear
political payoff to constructing a campaign around her keenest
interests. For one thing, they say, she has developed an
encyclopedic expertise on the three subjects that enables her to
debate arcane policy and give seamless speeches without a text or
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also assert that New York voters have grown
increasingly concerned about the quality of their schools and the
availability of health care, while crime _ the issue on which
voters tend to give higher marks to Republicans _ has fallen
somewhat in importance in polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were other moments when Mrs. Clinton might not have been
the right candidate for New York state,'' a top adviser to Mrs.
Clinton said. ``But a happy confluence of events has made this an
ideal time for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many prominent Democrats believe that Mrs. Clinton's
positions on education and health care will provide the sharpest
contrasts between her and the man they expect to be her Republican
rival, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible opponent is Rep. Rick A. Lazio, a Suffolk
County Republican, who has said he might enter the race. Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the three-term Democrat who holds the
seat, is retiring at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond policy, Mrs. Clinton's advisers also expect her to attack
Giuliani's hard-edged style, if he is the candidate. ``The
temperament to be a senator is very different from being a mayor,''
said State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat. ``Many people
will not see Giuliani as somebody with the ability to get along
with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding contrasts with Giuliani is important to many Democrats
because, even though Republicans have sought to paint Mrs. Clinton
as an extreme liberal, she and Giuliani agree on many of the issues
that have historically separated Republican and Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both support the death penalty, abortion rights and homosexual
rights _ as does Lazio. She endorsed the welfare law that helped
Giuliani shrink the city's welfare rolls. And he broke with other
Republicans in endorsing the Clinton administration's crime bill of
1994, which included gun control provisions and money for hiring
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of contrast that I had with D'Amato on gun control
and choice will not be as stark,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, a
Democrat, referring to former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, whom he
unseated last year.
</P>
<P>
   But on education, there are clear differences. Giuliani has
clashed with New York City school officials over what he considers
their excessive spending, and has strongly advocated vouchers to
allow more students to attend private schools. Mrs. Clinton has
been an ardent supporter of increased spending on public schools
and an outspoken critic of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, many Democrats say that Mrs. Clinton should
attack Giuliani for having tried to privatize the municipal
hospitals. Those Democrats assert that even though Mrs. Clinton's
highly publicized efforts to win sweeping health care changes in
1993 was a signal failure of her husband's first term, most New
Yorkers now support her goal of making health care coverage
available for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to say she was out there way ahead of her
time,'' said McCall, contrasting Mrs. Clinton with Giuliani.
``People see him as someone who tried to downsize and privatize
hospitals, not being an advocate for improving health care.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In recent New York appearances, Mrs. Clinton seems to have
tailored her speeches to draw distinctions between herself and
Giuliani, without mentioning his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never lift up our public schools, or the students they
serve, by tearing them down,'' she said to roaring applause at City
College last week, in what seemed a reference to Giuliani's feud
with Chancellor Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   And in an address at Teachers College at Columbia University in
April, Mrs. Clinton urged her audience not ``to be pulled off track
by false debates'' advanced by advocates of publicly financed
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have already begun attacking Mrs. Clinton by
depicting her as being out of the mainstream, and say they are
likely to use the health care debate as evidence that she is a
big-government liberal at heart. Her allies say she is more of a
pragmatist than the Republicans realize.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also say they are likely to try to cast Mrs. Clinton
as having grand but gauzy ideas on a few national subjects, but
little knowledge of regional issues like dairy prices or mass
transit. Giuliani has already repeatedly assailed Mrs. Clinton as
an out-of-stater who cannot find her way around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say she is well on her way to learning local issues.
Those Democrats say Mrs. Clinton's greater challenge, similar to
that facing Vice President Al Gore, will be to demonstrate that she
has been more than just a spokeswoman for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton can point to her own record on education,
family and health care issues, dating back to her Arkansas days.
During his second term as governor of Arkansas, Clinton appointed
his wife head of an education task force that helped write
legislation that set standards for class sizes and course
offerings, raised teachers' salaries and required teachers to pass
competency tests _ a step sharply criticized by teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   On most issues, Mrs. Clinton's positions are indistinguishable
from her husband's _ which is not necessarily a bad thing in New
York state, where the president's policies have been widely
popular.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been some cracks between Mrs. Clinton's and the
administration's positions. For instance, Mrs. Clinton in 1998
endorsed the idea of a Palestinian state, a position not taken by
the administration. Giuliani has already begun criticizing her
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also likely to attack those administration
policies that are viewed as harmful to the state, trying to force
Mrs. Clinton, who would be the first first lady to seek office, to
choose between criticizing her husband or defending unpopular
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Democrats have been the first to do that, urging
Mrs. Clinton to oppose the administration's efforts to cut
Medicare. In a sign of how difficult it may be to run for office
while living in the White House, 1199, the National Health and
Human Service Employees Union, which is reliably Democratic, has
begun an advertising campaign attacking the president's Medicare
cuts. Though the campaign does not mention Mrs. Clinton, its
message is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every reason to believe that Hillary Clinton will be
defending the interests of all New Yorkers, and one of them will be
defending the health care community of New York,'' said Dennis
Rivera, the union president and one of Mrs. Clinton's strongest
backers.

EDWARD LUMBARD, 97, JUDGE AND PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Vt., N.Y., N.M., Mass., Wash.)  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO

<P>
   Judge J. Edward Lumbard Jr., whose career as a lawyer,
prosecutor and jurist spanned eight decades, culminating in his
appointment by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1955 to the 2nd
Circuit Court of Appeals, died on Thursday at his home in
Fairfield, Conn. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   As a young lawyer, he worked with William Donovan, the director
of the Office of Strategic Services, which was the precursor of the
CIA. He also worked with Thomas E. Dewey as chief assistant U.S.
attorney in New York City and investigated many scandals. He also
was an assistant campaign manager for Dewey's second unsuccessful
campaign for president in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the most major figures in the long history of
the courts in the 2nd Circuit and the development of the body of
law in this circuit,'' said Judge Ralph Winter, the current chief
of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. The 2nd Circuit covers New
York, Connecticut and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Lumbard was born on Aug. 18, 1901, in the Harlem section of New
York City. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1918,
Harvard College in 1922 and Harvard Law School in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to New York in 1925 as an assistant in the office of
the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, which includes eight
counties in the state. In 1928, Gov. Alfred E. Smith, responding to
allegations of sewerage-construction kickbacks in the borough of
Queens in New York City, named Emory Buckner as a special
prosecutor. Buckner named John Harlan as his chief assistant, and
Lumbard, in turn, became Harlan's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The highly publicized investigation led to numerous indictments,
including that of the Queens borough president. It also sparked a
close friendship between Lumbard and Harlan, who later became a
justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Indeed, the two were men's
doubles champions at the Country Club of Fairfield in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Lumbard took Harlan's seat on the Court of Appeals in 1955, when
he was appointed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   After the Queens sewer scandal, Lumbard, from 1931 to 1933, was
the chief of the criminal division for the U.S. attorney's office,
under Dewey. In 1933, he became a founding partner in the law firm
of Donovan, Leisure, Newton &AMP; Lumbard. In 1935, at the behest of
the American Civil Liberties Union, he took on, pro bono, a
well-publicized case and helped win acquittal of 10 Mexicans who
had been accused of murdering a sheriff in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he again left private practice to be the chief
assistant to Hiram Todd, who had been appointed by New York Gov.
Herbert Lehman to investigate the beating and strangling of Samuel
Drukman, a garage worker, and a Brooklyn grand jury's subsequent
refusal to indict three men linked to the killing. The men were
later convicted of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Lumbard was a special assistant attorney general in
charge of a newly formed election-frauds bureau. He also took a
temporary appointment in 1947 as a state Supreme Court justice in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, he left private practice and for two years was
the U.S. attorney in Manhattan before being appointed to the Court
of Appeals in 1955. He became the chief judge there in 1959 and
remained in that capacity until 1971, when he became a senior
judge.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, he made many changes in the management and
administration of the court system. He was the first chief judge to
schedule appellate arguments on a specific date, a step that helped
ensure that judges who would be hearing the appeal were familiar
with the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an inspirational mentor to many of the most outstanding
judges and lawyers in the city,'' said Robert Fiske Jr., a former
U.S. attorney, who in 1954, while a student, worked in Lumbard's
office when he was the U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Chief Justice Warren Burger named Lumbard to the
Special Court of Appeals responsible for appointing independent
counsels. He resigned that position in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   From 1964 to 1968, Lumbard was chairman of the American Bar
Association's Committee to Develop Minimum Standards for Criminal
Justice. In 1968, he was awarded the ABA's Gold Medal for his
contributions to justice administration.
</P>
<P>
   He was an overseer of Harvard University from 1959 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Polly Poindexter, died in 1997. He is survived by a
daughter, Abigail Lumbard of Seattle; a son, Thomas, of Washington,
and four grandchildren.

CHARISMATIC HAS SURGERY, PAVING WAY FOR A PRODUCTIVE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no swelling in Charismatic's left front leg
Sunday morning, and veterinarians had no problems surgically
inserting four screws into that leg Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The chestnut, who was injured Saturday after running a game
third in the Belmont Stakes, is expected to recover fully and live
well as a high-priced stallion.
</P>
<P>
   But his racing career, brief and brilliant, is over.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time claiming horse whose unlikely ascent took him to
the doorstep of the Triple Crown underwent 2 1/2 hours of surgery
at the Belmont Equine Surgical Clinic to repair fractured left
front cannon and sesamoid bones. Dr. Stephen J. Selway led the
five-person surgical team to align and stabilize Charismatic's
fetlock joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the worst injury of this kind I've ever seen, but
it was a nasty one and certainly not an average one,'' Selway said
Sunday. ``What happens usually with these is that the fracture
spirals to the front _ this one spiraled to the back. The condylar
fracture happened first, and I believe Chris Antley knew something
was wrong inside the eight pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the horse went on, the damaged piece hit the sesamoids and
caused them to fracture. The sesamoids are the reason why this
horse won't race again.''
</P>
<P>
   The successful surgery was welcome news in the trainer D. Wayne
Lukas' barn. It came at the end of a harrowing 24 hours that began
with Charismatic a head from becoming the 12th Triple Crown winner
in history as he approached the stretch of the staggering 1 1/2
-mile race on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the exhilaration suddenly turned heart stopping when Antley,
Charismatic's jockey, leapt off the colt just past the finish line
and held up the horse's left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Antley was ashen and sobbing after the race, but his quick exit
from the saddle may very well have saved Charismatic's life.
According to Selway, Antley's action certainly prevented further
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Selway emphatically tried to remove any suspicion that Lukas or
Charismatic's owner's, Bob and Beverly Lewis, had made the horse
susceptible to injury by racing him five times _ including winning
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness _ in 64 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody deserved a Triple Crown, it was these people,'' he
said. ``And let me say that this joint was pristine. There was no
evidence of any pre-existing condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who is thoroughbred racing's most accomplished trainer,
began Sunday optimistic and ended the day elated. He said
Charismatic showed no signs of swelling overnight when the trainer
removed his compression boot. He was rambunctious in his stall and
lived up to his reputation as a hearty eater.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a son of a gun,'' Lukas said of the colt who he often
referred to affectionately as a big, fat horse. ``We've never had
so much as to run a hose on his leg or put ice on it. He's the
toughest horse I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The trainer was also unapologetic about the training and racing
regimen he had imposed on his horse as he vied to become the first
Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who has won 12 Triple Crown races, has often been
criticized for pushing his horses too hard in his search for those
grueling victories. His integrity and horsemanship were savaged in
the mid-1990s when Union City, a horse some believed was not sound,
fractured a leg during the 1993 Preakness Stakes and did not
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Several other high-profile breakdowns followed, including that
of the 1995 Kentucky Derby and Belmont winner Thunder Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many horses as I train and at the level we compete, I'm
going to get criticized,'' Lukas said. ``The only critics I have to
worry about are my owners _ the Lewises. I can't worry about what
people say.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown of Charismatic perhaps overshadowed one of horse
racing's finest days and the Belmont's long-shot winner, Lemon Drop
Kid. A crowd of 85,818, some of them very lucky or knowledgeable or
both, watched a 30-1 shot win and a 55-1 shot, Vision and Verse,
finish second.
</P>
<P>
   In an even more improbable twist, the riders _ Jose Santos on
Lemon Drop Kid and Herb Castillo Jr. on Vision and Verse _ are
brothers-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize that he was on the inside of me until we got
past the wire and he gave me a high-five,'' said Santos, who is
married to Castillo's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid walked quietly around the track Sunday morning
and probably won't run until late summer in the Grade II Jim Dandy
at Saratoga. ``He's fine, but he's tired,'' said Randy Schulhofer,
who is the assistant trainer to his father, Scotty.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mile and a half is a long way to go. He ate all his feed
last night and this morning, and came out with no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone filly, Silverbulletday, also was in good shape Sunday
despite losing her first race after nine victories. She looked like
she might become only the third filly to win the Belmont after
leading for a mile, but ultimately was wrapped up by Jerry Bailey
and finished a disheartening seventh.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She will now be rested for a while. ``Jerry did just what we
asked him to do,'' said Mike Pegram, the filly's owner. ``When he
felt he didn't have a chance, he took it easy on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lukas nor the Lewises knew how much of a chance
Charismatic had when he rounded the first turn in the lead. Lukas
said veterinarian Robert Copelan, a respected horse doctor, called
him twice Saturday night after watching tape of the race and told
him it appeared Charismatic had first got hurt at the top of the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Antley believes it happened either before or after the wire.
Wherever it occurred, Lukas said, two things are certain:
Charismatic will go to stud and command a lucrative fee _ probably
about $40,000 _ and the injury stopped a potentially brilliant
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's speculation where it occurred and I'm not saying it cost
him the race,'' Lukas said. ``But that horse ran hard, gave it all
he had. He's a great one, and thank goodness we didn't lose him.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The end of NATO's war on Yugoslavia seems to be in sight, but
among a group of Americans who discussed the news, there is little
exultation.
</P>
<P>
   Dilia Theodosakia, a retired secretary who long ago abandoned
her initial support for the bombing, sees no winners, only losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all criminals in their own way, not just Milosevic,''
she said, lumping in the leaders of NATO countries with Slobodan
Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia. ``They are all responsible
for escalating suffering. The Albanians in Kosovo had problems
before, but once the bombing started the killing got worse and the
Serbs suffered terribly, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mrs. Theodosakia, Martha McCauley has remained steadfast
in her belief that only military force could stop Yugoslav violence
against the Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO cause is just, she said, but the bill will be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the refugees go back, and their houses are all gone, what
will we do?'' said Mrs. McCauley, a retired IBM employee and busy
grandmother. ``Who is going to pay for the rebuilding of that
country? I think Milosevic and Yugoslavia should pay for that. It's
their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the NATO bombing campaign against the
Yugoslavs, Mrs. Theodosakia, Mrs. McCauley and several of their
neighbors in White Plains, N.Y., which is in Westchester County not
far from New York City, have been asked regularly to discuss their
impressions and opinions about the war.
</P>
<P>
   None has relatives or friends in the military. So without a
personal stake in the conflict, they have been paying less and less
attention to what has been happening in Yugoslavia, but they are
skeptical about whether NATO's aims have been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Theodosakia, who describes herself as a conservative, has
come full circle in her views about the war.
</P>
<P>
   At first mistrustful of President Clinton's motives, she came to
rally to the NATO cause, believing it a moral mission to save the
Kosovo Albanians. Then, as civilian casualties mounted in the NATO
bombing, so did her sympathies for the Yugoslavs as victims of
equal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Theodosakia, who at age 57 is about to start a new
career as a nutritionist, is once again deeply suspicious of the
motivations of NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every war, there's something behind it _ politics or
selfishness on somebody's part _ and yet civilians are the ones who
suffer,'' she said. ``I'd really like to know the truth, why they
were doing this just in Yugoslavia when there are people suffering
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   From reading several newspapers, listening to radio talk shows
and having discussions with relatives, Mrs. Theodosakia said she
had reached her own conclusions about what the situation in Kosovo
was before the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a holocaust in the making, as portrayed by President
Clinton, but a conflict between the Yugoslav government and the
Kosovo Albanian separatists, ``who used force and terror because
they wanted a piece of the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did not resolve that conflict by bombing. ``What did they
accomplish?'' she continued. ``What I say is this: Send the leaders
to war. Let them feel the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clark, an employee of the Westchester County Board of
Elections, tuned out weeks ago to the war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just fed up with it,'' he said. ``We have exhausted our
stay over there, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a trim 58-year-old, served in Vietnam as a Marine and
that experience still marks his views. He looks with a skeptic's
eye at any war, no matter how noble-sounding its goals, and
recalled his own war days as a time when he ``saw kids dying like
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   During the more than two months of the Kosovo war, he has had
very little patience with what he sees as the bombast of military
commanders, and a great deal of faith in the old adage that truth
is the first casualty of war.
</P>
<P>
   So when NATO missiles began occasionally to go astray, killing
Yugoslav civilians and in some cases Kosovo Albanians, Clark
considered his natural cynicism well founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many civilian casualties,'' he said.
``Friendly fire _ I told you that was going to happen. Once you go
to war, even if you have all these high-tech weapons, as long as
you're human, you're going to have errors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the NATO bombing, Clark paid close
attention to the war news, almost in spite of himself. ``In the
beginning I was interested,'' he acknowledged. ``But after it got
so prolonged, I just wasn't interested anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way he could explain his indifference was, again, to
reach back to his own memories as a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what the outcome was going to be before it happened,''
Clark said. ``I knew no one would really win. I knew innocent
people were going to die. Been there. Done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCauley's interest, on the other hand, never flagged. An
avid reader before the war, she added an extra daily newspaper to
her morning regime to stay informed.
</P>
<P>
   At 69, she is old enough to remember her father serving in the
Army in World War II. Moved and angered by the Serbs' expulsion of
Kosovo Albanians, she saw the NATO war against Yugoslavia as an
echo of her father's good fight. And while the casualties and the
destruction wrought by NATO bombs saddened her, they never dented
her pride that the United States ``helps people.''
</P>
<P>
   So was it worth it? she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCauley did not like that question. ``It was war,'' she
said, ``and you never think of anything as being worth war. But I
just don't think Milosevic would have done anything without this
war. He would have just gone on with his ethnic cleansing.''

   CLIFFSIDE PARK, N.J. _ With a thaw in the frosty relations
between the two countries, North Korea has arrived to prepare for
the Women's World Cup and a first-round match against the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials sat in a restaurant here Saturday, wearing
identical blue blazers with the North Korean star flag etched on
the breast and lapel pins bearing the likeness of President Kim
Jong Il. They spoke as stiffly as they dressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please ask questions only related to soccer and sports,'' said
Ryu Song Il, secretary-general of the North Korean Olympic
Committee. ``Otherwise we will make no comments.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the United States faced Iran in the 1998 men's World Cup
during a time of political softening, North Korea has arrived days
after President Clinton offered to phase out American economic
sanctions if North Korea abandons its ambitions to manufacture
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States-North Korea game, scheduled for June 27 in
Foxboro, Mass., will be held on Fair Play day, which is meant to
honor sportsmanship, Ryu said. Beyond that, he tread lightly on the
idea that soccer could be used as diplomacy the way the United
States and China once used Ping-Pong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to see,'' he said. ``That's all I can say about
that match.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryu did express his gratitude to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for
granting visas to the North Koreans without delay. There had been
uncertainty, given that the embassy had been closed over protests
of NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two countries have no normalized relations, so we were
very concerned, but we received them without any hitches,'' said
Ryu, who loosened up considerably after his early starchiness and
allowed reporters to mingle with players as they ate lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean team has arrived as one of the great unknowns
in the 16-team Women's World Cup. Sport is as closed as the rest of
the Communist society that has been wracked by the collapse of the
Soviet Union, international isolation and famine, which has killed
two million to three million people since 1995, according to
international aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans know only that North Korea finished second to
China in the Asian qualifying tournament and that the team plays
with speed and assertive tackling. The North Koreans say they have
not seen the Americans play. Only one of the players, Kim Sun Hui,
a former captain, has previously traveled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But unknown does not mean unskilled. The North Korean men's
soccer team was unknown, too, when it made it to the 1966 World Cup
finals _ after African nations withdrew in protest _ and pulled off
one of the greatest upsets in the history of the sport, shocking
mighty Italy, 1-0, and advancing to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   While the Italians returned home to be pelted with rotten fruit,
Pak Doo Ik, who scored the lone goal, was rewarded in Pyongyang,
the North Korean capital, with a Mercedes-Benz, a luxury apartment
and the titles of People's Athlete and Labor Hero of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beyond all description,'' Ryu said of the celebration
that greeted the team. ``Everybody turned out to the streets to
celebrate them. There is no more important reward than that the
players are still in the minds of the people.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, 16-year-old Kye Sun Hi
of North Korea entered her first international event as a wild-card
entry and won a gold medal in the women's extra-lightweight judo
division. Her opponent, Ryoko Tamura of Japan, had not lost in 84
matches over four years. It was the first gold medal for a North
Korean woman, and Kye received an apartment and a car as a reward.
A movie was made of her life and is now being shown on North Korean
television, Ryu said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean women have won five other Olympic medals in
speed skating, table tennis and volleyball. And now they are
looking for a breakthrough in soccer.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea did not participate in the previous two Women's
World Cups, but it would be foolish for the American women to take
them lightly. Just ask the American men. The North Korean men's
soccer team came to the United States in October 1991 and defeated
the Americans, 2-1, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each player and each team has come to win the match, not lose
the match,'' said Kim Kum Sil, who scored the goal in a 1-0 victory
over Japan that enabled North Korea to qualify for the Women's
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Since she scored that goal in December 1997, Kim said, she is
recognized on the streets. At 28, she was not yet born when Pak
scored his shocking goal against Italy in 1966 in Sunderland,
England. But she does remember, as an 11-year-old, asking her
father why he seemed to be so intensely interested in watching
soccer on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm very happy when I see our nation's flag at big
athletic events,''' Kim said. ``At that time, women's soccer was
beyond my imagination. But I was inspired by my father talking
about the importance of athletes in international matches and Pak
Doo Ik's events.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean women's team made its first international
appearance in 1989. Kim, who was on that first team, said that the
early teams possessed only rudimentary skills, ``just kicking the
ball randomly in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought that soccer was kicking the ball and running
after it,'' Kim said. ``Now we think about utilizing the space to
the maximum.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer participation is now mandatory at elementary schools in
North Korea, officials said, and each district has a sports school
to identify promising athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The women on the national team are all single. Most of them are
graduate students in physical education. Their World Cup matches
will be televised on state television. Kim Jong Il, the reclusive
president, is said to be a fan of soccer and basketball who follows
international matches with a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, sports officials have acknowledged some
difficulty in preparing teams in North Korea, given the country's
isolation and withered economic state. Its top basketball player, a
7-foot-8-inch center named Ri Myong Hun, had his ambitions to play
in the NBA thwarted, in part, by international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Several days ago, it was announced that Yoon Myong Chan,
formerly the coach of the North Korean men's soccer team, had
sought asylum in South Korea. He is the first known North Korean
sports official to defect. Myong Tong Chan, coach of the women's
team, did not accompany a group of players when they met with
reporters Saturday. No reason was given.
</P>
<P>
   Ryu, of the North Korean Olympic Committee, addressed his
country's struggles obliquely. ``It is true we are suffering
natural disasters the last couple years and also under economic
sanctions and other forces,'' he said. ``I think these temporary
difficulties can be overcome by the people's concentrated
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Kwak of Iowa City, president of the Korean Businessmen's
Federation in America, who is accompanying the soccer team and has
made 50 visits to North Korea, said the players did not appear to
be suffering any deprivation in training.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kim Jong Il pays special attention to the team and
supplies good things to them,'' Kwak said.

DOYLE BEATS THE FIELD AFTER BEATING BACK PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ When the spasms flared in Allen Doyle's back
during Saturday's third round of the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic, he
was asked if he thought the pain and discomfort could ever be bad
enough that he would withdraw from the tournament's final round on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, a hockey star at Norwich University in Vermont 30 years
ago, flashed a look of indignation. He may be a golfer now but he
was a hockey player first, and not surprisingly, his attitude
toward injuries remains rooted in the hockey culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to crawl around the course, I would finish,'' Doyle
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not crawl, but he limped and repeatedly grabbed at the
pang he felt in his lower back after most every swing. He stumbled
and played conservatively. But in the end, though it took 22 holes,
he also won.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, playing full time on the Senior PGA Tour for the first
time, continued his remarkable rookie run with his third victory
this year, a streak that has the once-unknown Georgia driving-range
owner a contender for the tour's player-of-the-year honors.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle defeated Joe Inman on Sunday on the fourth hole of a
two-man playoff after the two golfers tied at 12-under-par 204 at
the conclusion of Sunday's final round. It was the third
consecutive playoff at the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic, and though
both golfers played somewhat unsteadily in the playoff, Doyle sank
a nervy, 5-foot par putt on the fourth playoff hole to win, just
after Inman's 8-foot par putt lipped out.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Trevino was third, never seriously threatening after two
early bogeys, completing the tournament at 10 under par.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, 50, awoke Sunday without pain in his back, visited a
chiropractor who was a member of the tournament's host club, Upper
Montclair Country Club, and took megadoses of an over-the-counter
anti-inflammatory. But by the ninth hole, it was clear his back was
inhibiting his swing, which is normally abbreviated and unorthodox
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Inman was sinking a birdie putt on the ninth hole to
briefly take the tournament lead, Doyle was back on the ninth
fairway, touching his toes, trying to stretch his back.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle hit his approach shot within 8 feet of the ninth hole,
grabbing at his back after his follow-through. He then limped to
the green and made his only birdie putt of the day to tie Inman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang in there, Mr. Doyle,'' a spectator yelled from the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying,'' Doyle responded.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Doyle acknowledged that he was only chasing par on each
hole, afraid to ask too much of his back with an aggressive swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to play through it,'' said Doyle, who didn't turn
professional until 1995 and a year later was the oldest rookie in
the history of the PGA Tour. ``I kept telling myself par was my
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle and Inman remained tied through much of the back nine on
Sunday and each player had a chance to win the tournament on the
final hole of regulation play. But neither could make a birdie
despite good early positioning.
</P>
<P>
   There was more bumpy play from there, although for Doyle it was
ultimately more of the same _ four pars. He did not bogey any of
the 22 holes he played Sunday, shooting 71 for the first 18, while
Inman had a 66.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle has now won the Ace Group Classic and PGA Seniors
Championship, after entering just six Senior Tour events last year
and never finishing higher than fourth. With $1,036,364 earned this
year, he tops the tour's money list, vaulting over Bruce Fleisher,
the tour's other sensation, who has also won three events this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Once somewhat of a curiosity on the Senior Tour for his unusual
swing _ which may have evolved from his hockey slap shot _ Doyle
conceded that he may have to raise his original goal for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to win once and finish in the top 30,'' Doyle
said. ``I would have never thought of being the money leader. I
guess it's a thought I have to entertain now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Horse racing is often pictured as a troubled sport, sinking from
sight. But the throng of 85,818 at Belmont Park on Saturday, and
the threads of the drama of this year's Triple Crown, should offer
it much more hope than despair.
</P>
<P>
   The only part of the story that suggests the worst of times
would be the injury suffered by Charismatic as he struggled to
complete his sweep of the Triple Crown. It always seems that horses
break down on great stages _ before full crowds at Belmont Park on
network television.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic may have actually been injured farther up the
homestretch than people saw, but he kept racing to the finish line.
Then he felt the damage from the two broken bones in his left leg,
Chris Antley jumped off his back to comfort and calm him on the
track, and the record crowd suddenly grew hushed.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened before at Belmont Park. It happened to the
undefeated superfilly Ruffian in the great _ (but useless) _ match
race with Foolish Pleasure in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   It happened cruelly to the champion filly Go for Wand in the
Breeders' Cup in 1990. It happened just as tragically to Prairie
Bayou in the 1993 Belmont Stakes. It happened to Charismatic when
he was trying to complete his Triple Crown sweep in the Belmont
Stakes, with all those fairy-tale angles enhancing his career:
ignored as a claiming horse twice in the last seven months, winner
of the Kentucky Derby at odds of 31-1, winner of the Preakness at
8-1, a horse who ran in five major stakes on both coasts in two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Is that part of the worst of times in this horse's lifetime? He
ran fourth in the Santa Anita Derby on April 3, first in record
time in the Lexington Stakes on April 18, first in the Kentucky
Derby on May 1, first in the Preakness on May 15 and then third in
the fateful Belmont on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Racing records will report that the winner of the 1999 Belmont
Stakes was Lemon Drop Kid at 29-1, with Vision and Verse second at
54-1, which is dramatic enough. But the people who saw it happen
will remember it as an afternoon of dramatic complexity, of dreams
within reach but doomed to be lost, of a bunch of weary veterans of
the Derby and the Preakness at last surrendering to the demands
placed on them in the Belmont _ and of the favorite not
surrendering anything but eventually losing everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people would call me foolish for saying so,'' his owner,
Bob Lewis, reflected, ``but I tell you, he is just an iron horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. But his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, had been
praising him as ``a two-week horse,'' meaning that he could run
every two weeks. And he did, but was that too much too often? A
generation or two ago, horses used to be raced more often than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Citation ran 20 times as a 3-year-old, and won 19 times. Between
the Preakness and the Belmont, he even took a detour and won the
Jersey Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' his illustrious trainer, Jimmy Jones, said. ``He
needed a workout anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, horses take the workout and aim for the race, or
wait for the $1 million purse. Charismatic ran the races, and may
have paid the price. They say that fast horses are the ones most
likely to get hurt because they are the ones straining to win.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic was a fast horse straining the most to win the
ultimate prize in racing, he was doing it before 85,818 screaming
spectators, he was the star of a day to remember in New York
sports. And he was running his fifth major race in two months.
</P>
<P>
   But his fate has to be placed in perspective. Race horses are
the warriors of sport. All race horses run at risk; all Triple
Crown horses run at escalating risk. It is an issue that won't be
solved here and now, or by Charismatic's loss of his youth, or by
Lukas and his relentless drive to turn 2-year-old horses into
3-year-old champions.
</P>
<P>
   It is a philosophical issue that goes beyond the Belmont, which
is more vulnerable to sad endings because it is the final,
exhausting goal in the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Belmont also sets the stage for the best
of times in racing. The race track is spacious, orderly and
beautiful, and it may have solved racing's ``identity'' problem
with three straight years of Triple Crown showdowns (and misses).
That is the piece de resistance: the very chance that a horse might
complete the sweep, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont Day has become a force in the industry, more than any of
the marketing strategies announced by the National Thoroughbred
Racing Association, which has had little to do with the success of
the Triple Crown or the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The show's the thing. Belmont Park on its day of days is the
thing. Noble Charismatic is the thing.

   A single Stanley Cup Finals game has yet to be played, and
Nieuwendyk simply refused to bite on any talk of Hasek's being an
intimidating presence for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just faced a very good goaltender in Patrick Roy, and we
got a lot of pucks on him,'' Nieuwendyk reminded. ``This guy isn't
going to be able to stop everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Well ...
</P>
<P>
   Hasek has spent this playoffs trying to prove otherwise. He has
a 1.82 goals-against average and many believe he single-handedly
propelled a No. 7-seeded Sabres bunch to a Finals series that
begins with Game 1 scheduled for 6:30 p.m. tomorrow at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   So, back to the original question: How do the Stars beat the
great and powerful Dominik Hasek? Or better yet, whom do the Stars
have to beat him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Nieuwendyk's a start,'' said Stars winger Dave Reid, a
linemate of Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner. ``He's playing
fantastic. He's got a lot of jump in him, a lot of enthusiasm.
Playoffs tend to bring out the best in players. It's definitely
brought out the best in Joe and Jamie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 17 postseason games, Nieuwendyk has 18 points, half from
goals and half from assists, ranking him No. 3 among 1999 playoff
scorers. Only Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg are ahead of him, and
the Stars bounced out Colorado with a resounding 4-1 victory in
Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk started that ball rolling, his perfectly timed pass
leading to an easy Langenbrunner goal and a first-period lead that
Stars' players simply added to until a Finals berth had been
secured. To finish off Roy, the Stars got 23 pucks past him, an
average of 3.2 per game and better than what they had been scoring
in previous playoff rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's playing ... ,'' Stars usual playmaker Mike Modano
began, searching for a way to describe Nieuwendyk's impact. ``He's
got the whole line playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Well? Try unbelievably, amazing well?
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's a scorer; his goals were expected. He had the
winning goals in Games 2 and 3 against Colorado and assisted on
Langebrunner's in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   But nine goals, including three game-winners, from
Langenbrunner? He had a single goal in last season's playoffs. Or
what about eight points in 17 games from the usual fourth-liner,
role player Reid? In his 60 playoff games before this season, he
had 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it usually is the playoffs,'' Reid said. ``The
top lines are going to wash each other out with the same output. So
it's important for everybody else to contribute on the third and
fourth lines.''
</P>
<P>
   With Selke Trophy-candidate Michael Peca of the Sabres likely to
act as Modano's shadow, the Stars probably are going to need a lot
of other players scoring if they are going to solve Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk says the search for players to chip away at Hasek
should probably begin with Langenbrunner and Reid. He also likes
Mike Keane's chances and Brett Hull's and Guy Carbonneau's and Pat
Verbeek's ...
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk named just about every guy on the Tom Hicks' payroll
except for the Zamboni driver, and he's not counting him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those deals where we need offense from
everybody,'' Verbeek said. ``Playing on this team, there is never
the pressure on any one individual to have to do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, Hull and Jere Lehtinen have been good so far as the No.
1 line, scoring 17 goals and getting 19 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need them scoring goals,'' Keane said of Modano and Co.
``But every playoffs, you also need somebody new to step up. I
think everyone gets their chance when the playoffs start. Anyone
could be a hero. He's a hero for the night, and the next night it's
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane had his ``hero'' moment in Game 7 against Colorado,
scoring two goals, including the game-winner and the back-breaker.
Hull had his ``hero'' moment in Game 6 against St. Louis, assisting
on both goals. Nieuwendyk's entire playoff run has been one
``hero'' moment after another.
</P>
<P>
   So the question now becomes: Who is going to have the ``hero''
moments against Hasek? Or is Hasek going to be the hero once again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``... He's obviously a
world-class goalie. We're going to have our hands full, but I think
we've proven that we can create offensive chances and put the puck
in the net.''

DEREK PLANTE COULD BE STARS' SECRET WEAPON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Former Blues player Brett Hull assisted on both
goals in Game 6 as the Stars eliminated St. Louis in the Western
Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Former Avalanche player Mike Keane scored two goals in Game 7 as
the Stars eliminated Colorado, 4-1, in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, if the Stanley Cup Finals come to a deciding game the
Stars can count on a big game from former Sabres player Derek
Plante, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``There you go,'' Plante said. ``There's no pressure there.''
</P>
<P>
   Plante could be the Stars' secret weapon in the Finals. He
played in Buffalo from his rookie season in 1993 until he was dealt
to the Stars at the trading deadline on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, he can provide inside information on his former
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll be asked some questions,'' Stars forward Brian
Skrudland said.
</P>
<P>
   Plante, a center, would be happy to contribute in any way he
can. Thus far in the postseason he has been more of a stealth
weapon than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars got him to inject speed and a left-handed shot into
the lineup, but it's hard to help when you're not on the ice.
Plante played in 10 of 11 regular-season games after joining the
team, but was a healthy scratch in 11 of the 17 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a matter of matchups, I don't know,'' he said.
``They haven't really talked about it. I hope I get to play. It's
out of my control, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Plante scored one of the Stars' biggest goals in their run to
the Cup, the game-tying tally late in the third period of Game 6
against the Blues. He hasn't played since.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, who values the familiarity factor, is
toying with giving him some playing time in the Finals, although
Plante didn't skate with one of the regular lines in practice
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plante is a player who is expected to play sometime in the
series,'' Hitchcock said. ``That's something we're going to have to
play by ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Plante has been a key player in the postseason before. He led
Buffalo in assists (6), game-winning goals (2) and points (10) and
was tied for second in goals (4) during the 1997 playoffs, and
played in 11 of the Sabres' 15 playoff games last year.
</P>
<P>
   But if he's frustrated about his lack of playing time this time,
he's hiding it well.
</P>
<P>
   He remains ready to answer teammates' questions, ready to give a
scouting report, ready to do whatever he can. With his team four
victories away from winning the big prize, he's not about to stir
up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking the approach be positive, and whatever it takes for
this team to win the Stanley Cup, that's what we'll do,'' he said.
``If I'm not in there, I'm not going to have sour apples or get
frustrated. If I get the chance to help out, I'll try to do the
best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Plante continues to play hard in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to stay focused,'' he said. ``You can't think
you're not going to play and just go through the motions. You've
got to stay ready to play and stay sharp and in shape, and have the
best legs you can. That's what I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he doesn't get the chance to emulate Hull and Keane and
be the Stars' secret weapon, he's still ready to enjoy the series
between his new team and the one he played for the better part of
six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' Plante said. ``A lot of those guys are my
friends, so it's kind of neat. It should be a fun series.''

TREATMENT OF IRVIN, LETT DOESN'T ADD UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Back in early spring, when he was calling
``major press conferences'' to announce the signing of
asterisk-laden free agents, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was easy to
find.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, Owner Jones is taking the Fifth. As well as the
6th, 7th, 12th or any other day when anyone in the media wants to
ask him about Leon Lett.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys say they are bound by rules of confidentiality,
which is good. The continuing saga of Leon Lett deserves no real
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Lett has a problem. But whether the problem is drugs, drug tests
or signing the roll sheet at drug-abuse meetings, his problem has
crept into the workplace. His employer can no longer depend upon
him.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many games the defensive tackle will miss with
this third and latest suspension for violating the NFL's
substance-abuse policy. Four? Ten? An entire season?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what the terms of Lett's reinstatement, if any,
will be. Will he now be tested hourly? Will he have to write an
essay for the commissioner? Will he have to relinquish his VIP
parking space at the Iguana Mirage?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the terms, there is fervent hope here that Owner Jones
isn't keeping the porch light on for old lost Leon. The Cowboys
have things to do and places in January to see, and the time to do
and see them is getting preciously thin with each passing season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if history has told us anything, it is that Jones holds a
fond place in his heart for his star Cowboys, especially the ones
who are signed at less than market value, as Lett is.
</P>
<P>
   With free-agent defensive linemen being signed around the league
for $4-5 million per season, Lett qualifies as a $2 million
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   There are business decisions, apparently, and then there are
business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones feels compelled to wait on Lett, he
uncharacteristically lets Michael Irvin twist in the June wind. Go
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Irvin's fast and breezy lifestyle.
Argue, if you must, about how Irvin let his off-field antics
scuttle the Cowboys' season in 1996. The fact is that Irvin bleeds
Cowboy blue.
</P>
<P>
   Trade him? Whose fool idea was that?
</P>
<P>
   Irvin did not have a prominent season last year, though he did
catch 74 passes for 1,057 yards. Left unanswered in the Cowboys'
late-season swoon is how the football never did seem to find
Michael after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Cowboys find the win column much. So please _ if
you're going to argue that the new offense just isn't suited for
Irvin, maybe the harder questions should be directed at the
architect of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Trade Irvin? Somebody tell me why Owner Jones ever allowed that
to leak. It had to rip out the heart of the always passionate
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Steve Endicott, now says, sure, his client would
accept a trade. But it doesn't make sense. That's not Irvin, who
justifiably could have _ maybe should have _ demanded such a trade
at the height of his troubles three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody at Valley Ranch has decided that they don't need
Michael Irvin anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the head coach? Interesting. Especially for a coach whose
team slid miserably and then couldn't beat the Cardinals in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is loyalty. Jones owes Irvin some and Lett none. Yet
Irvin is the one on the very public trading block.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before he hurt his knee during a scrimmage against
New Orleans, Lett's trade value was as high as it was ever going to
get. Yet Jones resisted. He had faith in Lett's ability to be one
of the cornerstones of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, what does Jones have for his blind faith? He
even let the April draft go by without finding Lett's possible
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows, of course. Lett might be back in October. He may
never come back at all.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the point _ the uncertainty should be damning enough,
as far as the Cowboys' future plans are concerned.

GLAUS A NEW MAN SINCE BENCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since coming back from being benched May 28,
Anaheim Angels third baseman Troy Glaus is hitting .444 (12 for 27)
with four homers and eight RBI in seven games, raising his average
from .226 to .258. He had the big blast in Sunday's game, a
three-run homer off Carlos Perez in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   His recent surge came in the nick of time, considering there was
talk of sending him back to Triple-A just before he got hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use it as motivation,'' Glaus said of the rumors he
might go down. ``I knew I was struggling. With anything like that
you try to turn it around and make it a positive situation. I still
worked hard and did everything I felt I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill impressive: Pitcher Ken Hill managed to shake off a shaky
first inning, go six innings and earn the victory in Sunday's game.
After the two-run first, he retired nine in a row before Adrian
Beltre's leadoff single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield homered off Hill in the sixth, but that was all
the Dodgers got off him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sixth inning I was fortunate to get away with some of the
pitches I threw,'' Hill said. ``Particularly a hanging slider to
(Raul) Mondesi that he popped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup switch: Manager Terry Collins flip-flopped his top two
spots in the batting order Sunday, leading off with Randy Velarde
and moving Darin Erstad to No. 2. Velarde is the fourth player to
hit leadoff for the Angels this season, joining Erstad (35 times),
Orlando Palmeiro (18 times) and Jeff Huson (once).
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help much, as the two went a combined 1 for 10 in the
game, though the one hit was Erstad's sixth home run of the season.

KOSOVO TALKS BREAK DOWN AS SERBS BALK OVER DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Story updated throughout.)  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ After two days of tense negotiations, NATO
officials on Sunday night failed to get Yugoslav military officials
to agree to terms for a Serbian withdrawal from Kosovo, throwing
into doubt the peace deal reached last week by political leaders
and prompting NATO to promise to intensify bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown appeared to be caused by the Serbian demand that
the U.N. Security Council first approve a peacekeeping force before
NATO troops enter Kosovo as well as by several details of the
withdrawal plan itself, which Serbian officials felt impinged on
Yugoslav sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they would be willing to meet again, but gave no
indication of what must change in order for talks to resume. In the
meantime, officials said, NATO would intensify its bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials presented the Yugoslav delegation with a six-page
document on Saturday, which they said was non-negotiable. The
document outlined the terms for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav
army, the Serbian paramilitary and the Serbian police from Kosovo
and for NATO's entry to establish and maintain peace in the
province, where Milosevic's forces oversaw the worst mass
deportation in Europe since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job has been to translate the political agreement into a
workable military reality on the ground,'' said Lt. Gen. Michael
Jackson, the commander of the NATO's Kosovo peacekeeping force in a
statement read under klieg lights at a French air base here about 3
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav delegation presented a proposal that would not
guarantee the safe return of all the refugee or the full withdrawal
of Yugoslav forces,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the seriousness of the occasion, Jackson then
vowed that ``NATO therefore has no alternative but to continue and
indeed intensify the air campaign until such time as the Yugoslav
delegation is prepared to implement the agreement, and without
ambiguity.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jackson and the Yugoslav delegation presented this clear
setback as a conflict over the basic agreement reached in Belgrade
last week by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, a special
Russian envoy and the president of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the chief spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth H.
Bacon, said, referring the group of world's top industrial powers
that includes Russia: ``We will continue to work with our NATO
allies and the G-8 to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, the air
campaign will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebojsa Bujovic, a deputy foreign minister of Yugoslavia, spoke
immediately after the British general, and said the NATO proposal
raised questions about ``the full respect of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, of which Kosovo is an integral
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly, Bujovic said Yugoslavia interpreted the agreement to
include ``deployment of an international security presence under
the auspices of the U.N. or a presence established under a Security
Council mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 weeks of the air campaign, NATO dramatically reduced
its bombing missions against Yugoslavia after last week's peace
agreement. With Sunday night's failure to settle how that accord
should be carried out, NATO made clear that it would step up the
air attacks that have already devastated much of Yugoslavia's
infrastructure in an attempt to stop the expulsion of Albanians
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day on Sunday, NATO spokesmen underlined that the
air war would be considered a success only when all of the hundreds
of thousands of Albanians who became refugees in the last few weeks
were returned safely home. The Yugoslav delegation raised four
major points Sunday that they said made it difficult to sign the
agreement, according to a NATO official. Above all, they said, they
could not withdraw within seven days as stipulated, asking for an
extension of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of little details to settle,'' said Lt.
Col. Robin Clifford, the spokesman for NATO's Kosovo peacekeeping
force. ``Vehicles broken down, shortage of fuel, and roads that are
impassable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav delegation also said that they would need more than
48 hours to remove the anti-aircraft defense system in Kosovo,
according to a NATO official, and that they wanted mines cleared by
NATO, not by their own forces as required under the document.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing those and other differences, NATO officials
acknowledged that they were making changes in what they had
previously said was a non-negotiable agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well be changes in words and phrases to make sure
the points are clear,'' Clifford said. ``But there will be no
changes in the substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the questions under negotiation as the session
entered its 13th hour were the number of Serbian policeman to be
allowed in Kosovo after the initial withdrawal and whether the
Serbia would accept the buffer zone between Kosovo and its border
with Montenegro and Serbia, according to a NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue, according to NATO officials, was the size of any
Russian contingent in the peacekeeping force and where it would be
deployed. Russia has proposed that its troops be concentrated along
the northern sector of Kosovo, a proposal that NATO rejected for
fear that it would lead to the partition of the province.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the talks on Sunday, a NATO spokesman described the
discussions as ``very professional'' and ``positive talks between
military professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials expected the session on Sunday to be a short one.
The talks, which began on Saturday, had been suspended overnight
after the two sides reached agreement on all but ``only one or two
minor details,'' Clifford said. They had agreed to move their
discussions to this French air base because of its modern
communications and spacious meeting rooms inside the base's
portable hangar.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 hours of talks included a 13-member Yugoslav delegation
headed by Lt. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic, the deputy chief of staff
of Milosevic's armed forces, who was absent from the first round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates arrived by car and helicopter. They immediately
took their places around the negotiation table. Sitting on one side
were the three Yugoslav negotiators, Col. Gen. Svetozar Marjanovic,
the deputy chief of staff of Yugoslav Armed Forces; Col. Gen. Obrad
Stevanovic, representing the Ministry of Interior, and Lt. Gen.
Blagoje Kovacevic, of the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   Across from them was Jackson, who was to be NATO's sole signer
of the document.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of what would become a serious impasse was the
arrival around noon of two NATO officials of Jackson's staff
carrying maps and briefcases filled with material about the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav delegation then asked that a Russian official take
part as an observer in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, a NATO official announced a two-hour break to
allow the Yugoslavs to ``reassess their position.'' And soon
afterward, Col. Carmine De Pasquale, the head of the Italian
brigade of the Kosovo peace force, said: ``Problems have cropped
out that can only be resolved by the president of Yugoslavia.''

 (SUBS to adjust throughout for the newly uncertain state of the

 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Kosovo, the Western world is doing the right
thing in the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   The right thing was to place humanity's resistance to barbarism
above national sovereignty. When a nation commits a mass atrocity
against a segment of its own people, other nations have just
asserted their right to intervene with force.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yugoslav agreement to withdraw seems to have come
unglued, this is historic. International moral standards of
conduct, long derided by geopoliticians, now have muscle.
</P>
<P>
   We will not always be able to do the right thing everywhere. But
we have set a precedent of doing the right thing somewhere, and
once the right thing becomes possible, it tends to become probable.
</P>
<P>
   What are the lessons the West is learning in trying to stop
national criminality?
</P>
<P>
   1. Never tell the criminals what you will not do. This is a sign
of lack of confidence in your own people and your allies, and
diminishes your ability to lead. ``I do not intend to send ground
troops'' encourages the criminals and prolongs the war. Only when
NATO ground forces became a live option, and when KLA guerrilla
forces made a foray that flushed out Yugoslav tanks and made them
targets for air destruction, did the criminals begin to talk. Our
troop buildup must now begin apace.
</P>
<P>
   2. When you decide to strike, strike decisively. As Napoleon
told his hesitant generals, ``If you are going to take Vienna, take
Vienna.'' We should have turned out the lights in Belgrade and
destroyed telecommunications the first day. Slow, steady escalation
invites propaganda exploitation of ``collateral damage,''
highlights mistakes like the Chinese Embassy destruction and in the
long run costs lives.
</P>
<P>
   3. Do not place a higher value on the lives of warriors than on
the lives of civilians. Members of armed forces are trained and
paid to risk their lives; civilians are not. By bombing from 15,000
feet, we avoided NATO casualties but failed for over two months to
stop the murder, rape, pillage and mass deportation that was a
mission of our military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do not overestimate the courage of an army and paramilitary
that kills the unarmed. Just as the vaunted Iraqi army, adept at
gassing civilians, cracked and ran at the first sight of firepower,
many Serbs who destroyed villages in Kosovo are apparently
unwilling to die for Milosevic. Committers of atrocities are rarely
brave professional soldiers and should not intimidate well-armed
rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   5. Remember that in any alliance, some allies will be more
allied than others. Britain emerged as NATO's leader and France was
stalwart. The United States is providing the air punch but
temporized on a ground threat and unwisely insisted on a Russian
intermediary. Germany, Italy and Greece are the weak sisters.
Consensus should be sought, but no member of NATO should be able to
veto the great majority's decision.
</P>
<P>
   6. Do not let mistrust of the leadership's competence becloud
faith in the rightness of a cause. Principled isolationists and
pacifists of right and left are having their say, but most
opposition to our Kosovo intervention comes from Republicans who
feel Clinton blew too uncertain a trumpet and would settle for a
weak compromise. McCain, Bush and Dole put backbone in Clinton
policy while others fail to help.
</P>
<P>
   7. Do not let the loser win. Until sensible Serbs decide to hand
the Milosevic gang over to the Hague tribunal, no bridge should be
rebuilt or embargo lifted. Allow no subversion of Montenegro and
lock in autonomy for Hungarian Vojvodina. When withdrawal finally
commences, the Kosovo Occupying Force must be commanded and
controlled by NATO, not India or Sweden, and the European nation
with the largest army _ Turkey _ should have a commensurate
presence.
</P>
<P>
   8. Don't try to mix oil and water in patrolling the peace. The
returning KLA will be ``demilitarized'' (no tanks) but not
disarmed; it will be seeking vengeance. The burden on peacekeepers
will be to protect minority Serbs and to uphold a pretense of their
sovereignty. Better to offer individual Serbs in Kosovo a
relocation bonus to safety and to let Kosovo's victims have their
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-Yugoslav war is not yet over, but civilization is more
civilized for having intervened to do the right thing. Next time we
are more likely to do it the right way.

 RANDOLPH BULLOCK, CURATOR OF ARMOR EXHIBIT, DIES AT 96
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randolph Bullock, a curator emeritus of arms and armor at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art who helped build its collection into one
of the world's finest, died on May 28 at a hospital in Oceanside,
N.Y. He was 96 and lived in Wickford, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bullock's most important contribution in his 40 years at
the Metropolitan was the design of the arms and armor installation
that opened in its J.P. Morgan Wing in 1956. Previously arms and
armor had been shifted around the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The armor installation was redesigned in 1991 but remains in the
Morgan wing and retains such glories as the group of four
equestrian knights in shining armor who appear to have sighted the
enemy, leveled their lances and are preparing to thunder down the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock supervised the installation of the four knights in the
1920s and their popularity eventually led to his appointment as
curator of the department in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   As a curator, Bullock was frequently involved in acquisitions.
One of the most extraordinary of these was the museum's long effort
to acquire the fowling piece of Louis XIII of France. That
legendary long gun was then owned by William G. Renwick, a
reclusive gun collector who kept his prizes hidden from sight in
his home in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The Louis XIII hunting weapon is not only considered the most
elegant 17th-century long gun in existence, but it is also one of
only three flintlocks known to have been made in the workshop of
Pierre and Marin Le Bourgeoys of Lisieux, the gunsmiths who
invented the flintlock ignition mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock was one of three Metropolitan curators beginning in the
1920s who tried to acquire the weapon, which they called ``the most
beautiful gun in the world,'' before it could be snatched away by
the Smithsonian Institution, another museum or a private collector.
</P>
<P>
   Several times it appeared that Renwick had been wooed and won,
but he always backed off at the last minute. Then, after his death
in 1972, his collection came up for auction at Sotheby's in London.
Bullock pounced, and an agent for the Metropolitan bid $300,000 and
gained the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Bullock was born in Newport, R.I. He was a direct
descendant of the Goddard family of Newport, whose members were
renowned furniture and cabinet makers. He attended the Rhode Island
School of Design in Providence, graduating in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he was employed by the Metropolitan Museum as an
illustrator. His job was to make measured drawings of objects in
the arms and armor collection. These drawings could show cutaway
views and depict, for example, how a man's head would fit into a
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s Bullock supervised Works Progress
Administration artists assigned to similar work at the museum. In
1937 he was named assistant curator of the arms and armor
department, specializing in Asian objects.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he served in the Army Air Corps and
interpreted aerial reconnaissance photographs. His first task when
he returned to the Metropolitan was to supervise the resettlement
of the collections in the museum removed for safekeeping during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock is survived by a daughter, Barbara Stern of Oceanside,
and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He could trace his professional lineage back to Ludwig Klein,
the armorer to Napoleon III. Klein had fashioned the breastplate
and backplate that the emperor wore in 1870 when he marched against
the Prussians. As it turned out, Napoleon III was defeated, a
result more of Alfred Nobel's newly devised dynamite shells than
any defect in his armor.
</P>
<P>
   When Klein died, his armorer's tools were inherited by an
apprentice, Daniel Tachaux, who became the Metropolitan's first
full-time armorer. Tachaux, who died in the 1920s, trained Bullock
and also willed his royal armorer's tools to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The tools were an important asset to Bullock in combating the
acrid air of New York City. Stephen Grancsay, the curator who
succeeded Bullock, used the Tachaux collection of picks, hammers,
stakes and anvils to create the helmet, or ``tin pot,'' worn by
U.S. soldiers in World War II.

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Los Angeles actor and playwright has charged in a
federal lawsuit that David Hare's latest play, ``Via Dolorosa,''
which features the author as performer and has enjoyed critically
acclaimed runs in London and New York, misappropriated its ideas,
structure and some dialogue from a play written by the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit, filed last month in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan by Steven Greenstein, charged that the Royal Court
Theater in London rejected his one-act play ``Voices From the Holy
... and Not So Holy Land'' in 1997 and then usurped many of its
elements for Hare's play last year.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which asked for unspecified damages, named only the
Royal Court as the defendant and not Hare. It did not use the word
``plagiarism,'' and did not accuse Hare of wrongdoing. But it noted
that Stephen Daldry, who directed ``Via Dolorosa,'' was the
artistic director of the Royal Court when Greenstein submitted his
script in late 1996, and implied that he may have been a conduit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know to what extent Hare knew what was being given to
him,'' Richard Crisona, Greenstein's lawyer in New York, said
Sunday. ``We only know that Greenstein sent the Royal Court a
script, they rejected it, and subsequently Hare's play came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikki Heywood, executive director of the Royal Court, insisted
that the suit would be dismissed as groundless. ``It has absolutely
no merit at all,'' she said. ``The Greenstein play was submitted to
us after we had already begun discussions with David. The play has
not been read by Stephen Daldry or David Hare, and they had no
knowledge of this play until this spurious case was brought.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare, who performed a matinee of his play on Sunday at the Booth
Theater in New York and presented an award at the Tony ceremonies
Sunday night, declined through a spokesman to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hare, with Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard, is considered in the
top rank of British playwrights today. Hare has said frequently
that he drew inspiration for his play from visits to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Like Greenstein's play, the suit said, ``Via Dolorosa,'' which
opened last September at the Royal Court and has been at the Booth
since March 18, is a one-act monologue by the author, who takes the
part of people encountered on a trip to Israel _ Jews, Arabs,
politicians and others _ and explores the Arab-Israeli conflict and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Court, the suit said, commissioned a play by Hare that
``incorporated central elements, ideas, themes, structures and even
some dialogue from plaintiff's play.'' It said both plays were solo
one-act works performed by their authors, and both open in settings
outside Israel, explore Middle East issues from the visitor's
standpoint, incorporate the voices of similar characters and close
in settings far from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing dialogue, the suit said that an American Jewish
visitor in ``Voices'' says, ``It's like we the Jews are the rulers,
the occupier, and these Arabs, these Palestinians, are our
occupied,'' while in ``Via Dolorosa'' a Jewish character says,
``When you begin to see yourself as the occupier and them as the
occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit said both plays incorporate themes of a yuppie culture
in which young Israelis turn away from hard work, sacrifice and
military service, and both express concern about Jewish
assimilation, restrictions on Palestinians and the struggle of
living in Israel as opposed to living in the diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein, 39, said in an interview that he wrote his play in
1995 and 1996, submitted it to the Royal Court in late 1996 and
received a rejection letter from Graham Whybrow, the theater's
literary manager. His suit said he had received no credit or
compensation for the use of his script, which was copyrighted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying who's the culprit,'' he said. ``I'm just saying
they had my play and Daldry was the artistic director when my play
was there, and he later directed David Hare's play. The Royal Court
was the inspiration and the originators. They commissioned Hare to
go to Israel and write this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein said his play was inspired by his experiences living
in Israel from 1992 to 1995. He said he had performed it many times
at theaters in San Diego, Los Angeles and Antwerp, Belgium, and at
Rutgers University and Bloomfield College in New Jersey. He filed
his suit on May 19 after discovering what he called similarities in
Hare's work; he sent a copy to The New York Times on Sunday.

LEAGUE KICKS DECISION AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Right-hander Chan Ho Park is expected to hear
today from the National League office concerning disciplinary
action for kicking Anaheim Angels right-hander Tim Belcher on
Saturday during a fifth-inning altercation.
</P>
<P>
   Park, ejected after spiking Belcher's left thigh and bruising
his left forearm, worked out before the game. He said he received a
call from his 91-year-old grandfather, who told him he needed to
learn to fight better. Tae Kwon Do is part of the curriculum in
Korean schools, but he is not well versed in martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk about any of that,'' Park said after Sunday's
game. ``I guess Thursday would be my day, but I really don't have
any comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's performance: Los Angeles Dodgers starter Carlos Perez
(2-7) was hurt by teammates who lost the ball in the sun, but
pitching coach Claude Osteen said he should have performed better.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who allowed nine hits and seven runs in a 7-5 loss to the
Angels, gave up home runs to Troy Glaus and Darin Erstad. Glaus'
was a three-run shot in the sixth that came off Perez's first
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glaus had a single in the first on a 1-2 breaking ball, and
Carlos didn't want to get beat on that pitch again,'' Osteen said.
``So when Glaus came up in the sixth, Carlos' first pitch was a
fastball and Glaus jumped on it. He looked like he knew it was
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos had a couple of situations like that today. He had a
better fastball than he had in Atlanta (a 2-1 win May 29), but he
didn't set up hitters the way he should. It often can be the
difference between winning and losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, who went on the DL
Friday with a broken right hand, is convinced he will be back when
eligible to return. Dodgers orthopedist Frank Jobe said it will
take at least six weeks for the hand to mend. The injury is a
fracture to the bone just beneath the right pinky. ``That is a very
slow-healing area on the hand,'' Jobe said. ``There is little
chance he can return sooner.'' ... Since Grudzielanek left, his
replacement Jose Vizcaino has gone 4 for 12 at the plate with a
home run.... When Perez walked Todd Greene to open the sixth
inning, it marked the first time in 232/3 innings that a Dodgers
pitcher had issued a base on balls.... With two hits, third baseman
Adrian Beltre has hit in 10 of his last 13 games (18 for 49, .367)
since being dropped from No.2 in the order May 23.... Eric Karros
led the majors with 10 interleague homers in 1997. He had two last
year.

PAUL S. NEWMAN, 75, PROLIFIC COMIC-BOOK WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.H., Pa., Mass.)  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul S. Newman, who was listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records as the most prolific comic-book writer of all time, died on
May 30 in Columbia, Md. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Peter.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's stories included scripts for Superman, Mighty Mouse,
Twilight Zone and Star Trek comic books. He wrote stories in every
comic-book genre _ humor, horror, romance and science fiction among
them. He even wrote comic books about things usually not thought of
as comic books, like ``Leave It to Beaver'' and ``I Love Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1947, he wrote more than 4,100 stories totaling some
36,000 pages, the equivalent of 120 mystery novels, eventually
writing for more than 350 comic-book titles. In 1993 the comic-book
historian Robin Snyder named him King of the Comic Book Writers
after a three-year search for the most prolific writer in that
field.
</P>
<P>
   Newman was born in New York in 1924 and after high school
enrolled at Dartmouth College. He served in three theaters of war
during World War II and then returned to Dartmouth, where a play he
wrote as a homework assignment became the first original play
staged by the Dartmouth Players.
</P>
<P>
   Play-writing remained his real love, but he soon found he could
make a living by churning out stories for comic books. He would
make up an entire story, panel by panel, describing each drawing
for an artist to follow. Then he wrote the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing comic books, he wrote five newspaper
comic strips, ``The Lone Ranger,'' ``Smokey the Bear,'' ``Space
Cadets,'' ``Robin Malone'' and ``Laugh In'' and branched out into
screenplays and television sketches for such stars as Boris
Karloff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, of Easton, Pa., he is survived by his
wife, Carol, of Columbia; a daughter, Lisa Newman of Goshen, Mass.;
two grandchildren, three stepdaughters and five step-grandchildren.

Dodgers' weekend turns sour By Matt McHale, Daily News Staff Writer 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Under a harsh spotlight all season, the Los
Angeles Dodgers looked up at the glare of the Sunday sun and wilted
again.
</P>
<P>
   They had a chance to sweep the crosstown Anaheim Angels at the
beginning of a lengthy stretch at home, but rather than grab a
little momentum they stumbled again in a 7-5 loss in front of
53,778 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There was the popup second baseman Eric Young lost in the second
inning that led to a run, and the blooper that fell between Young
and center fielder Devon White in the sixth that set up a
game-winning, three-run homer by Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   White also got caught off first base in the first inning when
the Dodgers looked like they could put away Angels starter Ken
Hill. Two innings later, they were playing catch-up the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angels are a good ballclub and we're still struggling,''
said White, who had five hits in the series, including a two-out,
two-run single in the first. ``We let a lot of things get away
today. And then there was my dumb baserunning.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of three games next weekend in Oakland, the
Dodgers are at home until June 25, a good time to make a run.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is uncertainty. The club is facing the suspension
of Chan Ho Park, whose fight with the Angels' Tim Belcher 24 hours
earlier seemed to spark the team.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from Gary Sheffield and suddenly White, the offense is
still stagnant. Young, the leadoff hitter, was 0 for 9 in the
series and missed a game with a tender ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels headed to San Francisco after the game for three
games with the Giants. During the same June stretch, they are on
the road, except for three games against Arizona, one of the
hottest teams in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get this game after the way things had been going was
important,'' said the Angels' Mo Vaughn, who went 3 for 12 against
the Dodgers. ``It was big.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing two of three actually didn't look so bad to embattled
Angels manager Terry Collins, after watching his club blow four-run
leads in each of the first two games and fall behind 2-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Collins arrived here amid a mutiny by players upset that he is
being considered for a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that has happened, I think we moved forward this
weekend,'' he said. ``Not the way we lost those games, but with the
way we came together. There was a lot of dialogue in the clubhouse,
a lot of spirit on the bench. That was a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   So were the home runs by Glaus in the sixth and Darin Erstad in
the seventh that gave the Angels a 7-3 lead. Both came off Dodgers
starter Carlos Perez (2-7), who was coming off his best outing, a
2-1 victory over Atlanta last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Perez never was sharp, allowing nine hits and seven runs in 62/3
innings. He was given a 2-0 lead in the first because of control
problems by Hill (3-4), but quickly gave it back.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what he was thinking since he left without
comment after the game. But Perez couldn't have liked the way White
ran the Dodgers out of the first inning or the way his teammates
battled the sun and lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, when the Dodgers did catch the ball, Raul
Mondesi's strong throw to the plate skipped off the glove of rookie
catcher Angel Pena, enabling Garret Anderson to score.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson finished with four hits and three runs, raising his
average to .296. Glaus went 2 for 4 and 6 for 11 with two homers
against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough road ahead, but it's been tough so far and we're
still standing,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's homer cut the Angels lead to 6-3 in the sixth,
Hill's last inning. It was Sheffield's 13th homer and third in four
games. Dave Hansen made it 7-5 in the seventh with a two-run pinch
single off left-hander Scott Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers could get no closer. Troy Percival entered the
game with two outs in the eighth and put them away for his 16th
save.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went their separate ways, meeting again in Anaheim
during the middle of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rivalry? I don't think so,'' White said. ``There is a lot more
to think about.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Under a harsh spotlight all season, the Los
Angeles Dodgers looked up at the glare of the Sunday sun and wilted
again.
</P>
<P>
   They had a chance to sweep the crosstown Anaheim Angels at the
beginning of a lengthy stretch at home, but rather than grab a
little momentum they stumbled again in a 7-5 loss in front of
53,778 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There was the popup second baseman Eric Young lost in the second
inning that led to a run, and the blooper that fell between Young
and center fielder Devon White in the sixth that set up a
game-winning, three-run homer by Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   White also got caught off first base in the first inning when
the Dodgers looked like they could put away Angels starter Ken
Hill. Two innings later, they were playing catch-up the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angels are a good ballclub and we're still struggling,''
said White, who had five hits in the series, including a two-out,
two-run single in the first. ``We let a lot of things get away
today. And then there was my dumb baserunning.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of three games next weekend in Oakland, the
Dodgers are at home until June 25, a good time to make a run.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is uncertainty. The club is facing the suspension
of Chan Ho Park, whose fight with the Angels' Tim Belcher 24 hours
earlier seemed to spark the team.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from Gary Sheffield and suddenly White, the offense is
still stagnant. Young, the leadoff hitter, was 0 for 9 in the
series and missed a game with a tender ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels headed to San Francisco after the game for three
games with the Giants. During the same June stretch, they are on
the road, except for three games against Arizona, one of the
hottest teams in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get this game after the way things had been going was
important,'' said the Angels' Mo Vaughn, who went 3 for 12 against
the Dodgers. ``It was big.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing two of three actually didn't look so bad to embattled
Angels manager Terry Collins, after watching his club blow four-run
leads in each of the first two games and fall behind 2-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Collins arrived here amid a mutiny by players upset that he is
being considered for a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that has happened, I think we moved forward this
weekend,'' he said. ``Not the way we lost those games, but with the
way we came together. There was a lot of dialogue in the clubhouse,
a lot of spirit on the bench. That was a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   So were the home runs by Glaus in the sixth and Darin Erstad in
the seventh that gave the Angels a 7-3 lead. Both came off Dodgers
starter Carlos Perez (2-7), who was coming off his best outing, a
2-1 victory over Atlanta last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Perez never was sharp, allowing nine hits and seven runs in 62/3
innings. He was given a 2-0 lead in the first because of control
problems by Hill (3-4), but quickly gave it back.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what he was thinking since he left without
comment after the game. But Perez couldn't have liked the way White
ran the Dodgers out of the first inning or the way his teammates
battled the sun and lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, when the Dodgers did catch the ball, Raul
Mondesi's strong throw to the plate skipped off the glove of rookie
catcher Angel Pena, enabling Garret Anderson to score.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson finished with four hits and three runs, raising his
average to .296. Glaus went 2 for 4 and 6 for 11 with two homers
against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough road ahead, but it's been tough so far and we're
still standing,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's homer cut the Angels lead to 6-3 in the sixth,
Hill's last inning. It was Sheffield's 13th homer and third in four
games. Dave Hansen made it 7-5 in the seventh with a two-run pinch
single off left-hander Scott Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers could get no closer. Troy Percival entered the
game with two outs in the eighth and put them away for his 16th
save.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went their separate ways, meeting again in Anaheim
during the middle of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rivalry? I don't think so,'' White said. ``There is a lot more
to think about.''

EDITORIAL: THE FUTURE OF CUNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 7:
</P>
<P>
   Benno Schmidt's task-force report on the City University of New
York documents the failures of an urban education system that badly
needs a clearer mission and more coherent management. Often called
the ``gateway'' to a better life for immigrants and those who
cannot afford private college, CUNY is described as being
``adrift'' or caught in a ``spiral of decline.'' Some of this drift
has a political undercurrent as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov.
George Pataki have criticized CUNY and cut its budget. However,
Schmidt's ambitious report ducks the hazards of New York politics
and instead offers thought-provoking suggestions of ways CUNY could
become the model for a public urban university system.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial debate at CUNY has been how to maintain
open admissions while shoring up the value of a degree. The task
force proposes an admission policy that would have different
standards for four-year colleges and for community colleges, much
like the widely admired university system in California. At least 2
of the 11 four-year colleges should evolve into schools rivaling
the nation's better universities, Schmidt, the former president of
Yale, argues persuasively. Such elite public colleges, however,
must not diminish the opportunity for all New Yorkers who have
completed high school to attain a college education in some part of
the CUNY system.
</P>
<P>
   This issue leads to the tumultuous question of the remedial
classes that have become the norm at CUNY. Currently, 87 percent of
first-year students at community colleges and 72 percent of those
at the four-year colleges need remedial help to continue. This
abysmally high rate means that CUNY has been trying to fill in the
gaps left by New York City schools. Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew is
right to seize on the report as a catalyst to reinvent the public
schools, which send a third of their graduates to CUNY and also
employ many CUNY graduates as teachers. But meanwhile, the task
force argues wisely that CUNY must not end remediation. Rather, the
report proposes updating the tests and evaluating different
approaches to remediation to see what works. Some proposals, like
limiting remediation to community colleges and using vouchers to
foster competition among remedial programs, clearly need more
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the report advises CUNY to organize itself as a system
rather than treat its 17 campuses as separate city states.
Similarly, in a section on financial planning, the report suggests
that the ``passivity'' at the central administration should be
replaced with strategic planning and accountability that rewards
those educational functions that work and revamps those that are
failing.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and the governor have indicated they like what they
know of this weighty report. A spokesman for Governor Pataki called
it ``an important blueprint'' for improving standards. While CUNY
has pockets of success, its failures are now catalogd, with
concrete solutions proposed. The Schmidt report should be used not
merely to denounce CUNY, but to rebuild it.
