<HEADLINE> Italy Reaches Final by Beating Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy will meet France in the
Euro 2000
final by beating co-hosts the Netherlands 3-1 in a penalty
shootout following a 0-0 draw after extra time in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The final will be held in Rotterdam Sunday when the Italians
meet the world champion, who beat Portugal 2-1 thanks to Zinedine
Zidane's "golden goal" penalty in Brussels Wednesday, for the
first time in the tournament final since 1968.
</P>
<P>
Italy won after their goalkeeper Francesco Toldo saved two of
the penalty shootout from Dutch captain Frank de Boer and Paul
Bosvelt. Jaap Stam blazed one over the bar.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch had missed two penalties in normal time with the
Italians down to 10 men for most of the match after midfielder
Ginaluca Zambrotta was sent off in the 33rd minute for a second
yellow card.
</P>
<P>
Toldo saved De Boer's earlier spot kick and Patrick Kluivert
hit a post, also in normal time.
</P>
<P>
It was a massive disappointment for the 50,000 crowd in the
Amsterdam Arena who saw the Italians defend solidly for long
periods after Zambrotta was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The pattern of the match had been established from the first
whistle with Italy content to sit deep, soak up pressure and hope
to hit on the counter.
</P>
<P>
But they looked shaky at the back and Dennis Bergkamp, who
sent a header wide when unmarked in the 12th minute, ghosted past
Mark Iuliano before smacking a low shot against a post three
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Italy, with Alessandro Del Piero preferred in the starting
lineup to Francesco Totti, rarely escaped from their own half and
then suffered a huge blow when Zambrotta was given his second
yellow card in the 33rd minute.
</P>
<P>
"In the first half we had them on the ropes. And then I miss a
penalty," De Boer said. "Later we just didn't have the patience.
</P>
<P>
"In the shootout, they had the psychologicial advantage
because we had already missed two. We missed five penalties. It's
very sad. We cannot finish our job. We had a great chance to win
the championship and we only have ourselves to blame."
</P>
<P>
Coach Frank Rijkaard said penalty misses by De Boer and
Kluivert during normal time cost them a place in the final for the
first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
"The (missed) penalties were crucial," he said. "If one would
have gone in it would have meant we were 1-0 against ten men.
</P>
<P>
"We just could not force a breakthrough. The end just wore us
down. It took too much out of us. It was our mistake that we could
not bring down this defensive wall.
</P>
<P>
"Two penalties and we miss them both," Rijkaard said. "We
practiced penalties almost every day and now it is clear we are
not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
"All this is disastrous. This is such a missed opportunity.
This will take a long time to heal.''
</P>
<P>
Italian coach Dino Zoff sprang a surprise by naming Alessandro
Del Piero as a starter and relegating Francesco Totti to the bench.
Totti was brought into the game late on for Stefano Fiore.
</P>
<P>
Struggling to contain the Dutch midfielders, Italy's Zambrotta
and Mark Iuliano were shown the yellow card within two minutes of
each other for hauling down Boudewijn Zenden and Mark Overmars a
long way from the Italian goal with little danger to Toldo.
</P>
<P>
Zenden became the third player to be shown the yellow card
when he was challenged by Alessandro Nesta just inside the area on
the left but went down without any contact and was cautioned for
diving.
</P>
<P>
When Zenden went down again in the 33rd minute by Zambrotta
and the Italian was sent off for his second yellow card.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later the Dutch were awarded the penalty when
Kluivert had his shirt pulled by Nesta. But Toldo guessed right
and dived to his left to block De Boer's firmly struck spot kick
and the shorthanded Italians remained level.
</P>
<P>
Just before half time Kluivert moved into a shooting chance
but pulled his shot across the face of the goal.
</P>
<P>
With the Italians losing their cool, Toldo and Maldini also
were shown the yellow card during the first half by German referee
Markus Merk.
</P>
<P>
Dutch goalkeeper Van de Sar made his first save of the game in
the third minute of the second half and didn't even need to. Fiore
's shot was sailing well wide of the post but the keeper flung
himself to his right to palm the ball away at the expense of a
corner which, fortunately for him, came to nothing.
</P>
<P>
At the other end, Zenden ended a slick Dutch move with a
powerful left footed volley which was straight at Toldo before the
Italians handed the host another chance from the penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Davids clearly had Iuliano beaten for speed when the
Italian defender stuck out a foot and upended his Juventus
colleague just inside the area. This time Kluivert stepped up to
take the spot kick and, although Toldo dived the wrong way, he hit
the post.

<HEADLINE> Rijkaard Quits as Dutch Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard
resigned on Thursday after his team lost to Italy 3-1 in a penalty
shootout after a 0-0 draw in the Euro 2000 semifinal in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
"I set myself one goal when I started as national coach and
that was winning the European championship," he told Dutch
television. "I failed and I think now it's time for a new coach."
</P>
<P>
Rijkaard, a key member of the Dutch team which won the
European title in 1988, took over as coach after the World Cup two
years ago and had a mixed record leading up to Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team performed superbly when the tournament started,
winning all three group games and thrashing Yugoslavia 6-1 in the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing to do with the match today," he said. "It's just
that I had one goal in mind. I don't deserve to stay with these
wonderful players.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank the players from the bottom of my heart and
also the technical staff. We had a great time but we didn't manage
to achieve our goal.
</P>
<P>
"I had this decision in mind two years ago when I took this
job. The book is closed. I feel terrible for the players but it's
a law in football that when something like this happens it's time
for someone else to take over."
</P>
<P>
Rijkaard's team should have beaten an Italian side reduced to
10 men on Thursday after Gianluca Zambrotta was sent off in the
33rd minute.
</P>
<P>
But captain Frank de Boer and striker Patrick Kluivert both
missed penalties in normal time and the Dutch also missed three of
their four spot kicks in the shootout.
</P>
<P>
Dutch defender Jaap Stam said of Rijkaard's departure: "I
think it's a pity he resigned. I think he did really well as a
national coach in the two years of preparation for this
championship."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam-U.S. Trade Agreement Should Benefit Both Countries, Says Vietnamese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Trade Minister Vu Khoan
said that Vietnam-U.S. bilateral trade agreement (BTA) should
benefit both the United States and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Khoan made the remarks when he granted an exclusive interview
here to Vietnam News Agency on Thursday on his coming visit to
Washington as guest of U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
Khoan said his visit to Washington aims to work with Barshefsky
and her colleagues to compare notes on the completion of BTA
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the process of relation normalization between
Vietnam and the United States officially commenced five years ago.
Both sides are of the same view that it is necessary to reach a
BTA to cover the whole process. After more than four years of
negotiations, which was far from simple, the two countries arrived
at an agreement in principle on the BTA last year. However, there
remained some issues to be clarified so the BTA was not signed at
that time."
</P>
<P>
"Any international agreement must show a balance in terms of
interest and must be acceptable to both sides. In other words, it
should reflect the principles of equality and mutual benefit," the
Vietnamese trade minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover it will benefit cooperation in the Asia-Pacific
Region and Southeast Asia. I hope the United States share the same
view. Once both sides work on this with great interest, they will
be able to find solutions satisfactory for settling outstanding
issues and will arrive at the agreement," Khoan added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Lower House Passes 2001 Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- After two days' deliberation and
amid the pressure of members' resignation, The House of
Representatives of Thailand, the lower house of the parliament,
eventually passed the 2001 budget bill midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 910-billion-baht (23.24 billion U.S. dollars) budget bill,
for the fiscal year starting from October, was passed with 202
affirmative votes, 2 opposing votes and 4 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has tried to convince the House
members that the passage of the 2001 budget bill prior to the
House dissolution is significant for the smooth recovery of the
Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda also reiterated that
the passage of the budget bill was crucial for the economy, saying
the delayed implementation of the budget bill would cause serious
negative effects to continued recovering processes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has called for the opposition House
members to realize and maintain their political responsibilities
for the sake of the public and national interests.
</P>
<P>
Attempting to force a dissolution of the House, fifty House
members of the New Aspiration Party (NAP), the leader of the
opposition, resigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another forty-three House members belonging to the defected
Wang Nam Yen faction of the NAP has submitted their resignation,
which will be effective since Friday.
</P>
<P>
Three more NAP House members are also set to resign Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the forty-five opposition House members, including
nineteen from the Social Action Party (SAP), though not resigning,
have called for the government to withdraw the deliberation of the
budget bill from the House agenda.

<HEADLINE> EU Sanctions Against Austria Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Portuguese government said
Thursday that the 14 partners of Austria in the European Union are
not yet lifting their sanctions against the country, imposed at
the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, now holds the EU's rotating presidency, was meanwhile
mandated to ask the France-based European Court of Human Rights to
monitor whether Austria is abiding by "common European values,"
which cover "the rights of minorities, refugees and immigrants."
The court will also monitor "the evolution of the political nature
" of the far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The court will appoint three people to do an investigation and
report their finding to the 14 governments. Those states will
decide whether to lift the diplomatic sanctions after considering
the reports.
</P>
<P>
The punitive measures were imposed in February after the
Freedom Party joined Austria's coalition government.

<P>
The contacts and negotiations between ARATS and SEF have always
been conducted on the basis of the One-China principal, it said.
The One-China principle also can be found in the Taiwan
authorities' provisions and documents, and is not imposed
unilaterally by the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan authorities should show deference for the common
consensus reached by ARATS and SEF and resume talks with the
Chinese mainland within the One-China framework.
</P>
<P>
The commentary called on the Taiwan authorities to "show
respect for history and reality" and make a "positive" response to
the call of the Chinese mainland for talks and peaceful
reunification on the basis of the One-China principle.
</P>
<P>
The inter-Korean summit between the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Il and President of the
Republic of Korea (ROK) Kim Dae-jung in mid-June aroused world
attention, it said.
</P>
<P>
The historic handshake between the two leaders reflected the
aspiration of the Korean people for national reunification.
</P>
<P>
"If the new leader of Taiwan authorities claimed that he was '
deeply' moved by the inter-Korean summit, why does he, the leader
of Taiwan, which is an inseparable part of China, dare not to even
accept the One-China principle?" the commentary asked.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that Taiwan's new leaders should consider the
situation and conform to the historical trend of the times. Taiwan
's new leaders should abandon his separatist path and take the
brighter road that leads to the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The commentary finally noted that the Taiwan issue can not be
dragged on endlessly; shunning the One-China policy is no way out.

<P>
Similarly, the comments by the Taiwan media about the "goodwill
" and "sincerity" of the new Taiwan authorities to improve the
relations across the Taiwan Straits are nothing but empty talk,
the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Chinese mainland has been working continuously
to improve cross-Strait relations. Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reiterated after the Taiwan election that "whoever comes to power
in Taiwan, he is welcome to the mainland for talks, and we may
also go to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"But the One-China principle must first be recognized, and
under this prerequisite, everything can be discussed," the
commentary quoted Jiang as saying.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued jointly by the Taiwan Work Office of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
Taiwan Work Office of the State Council on May 20 also pointed out
that as long as the Taiwan authorities make a clear commitment
that it will not accept the "two states remarks," and that it will
adhere to the consensus reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992,"
the mainland would like to authorize ARATS to contact and hold
dialogues with organizations or persons authorized by the Taiwan
side.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said this attitude, which has not only made
clear the firm position held by the Chinese mainland on the One-
China principle, but also reflected the mainland's sincerity
toward improving the relationship between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits, has been warmly welcomed and praised by Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Resumption of contacts and negotiations between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits is an important indicator of improved
relations across the Straits. Sticking to the One-China principle
is the touchstone for testing the sincerity of the new Taiwan
authorities, it said.

BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A commentary released by Xinhua
News Agency here today said that the Taiwan compatriots desire to
maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
These conditions are also necessary for social stability and
economic development in Taiwan, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The changes in Taiwan's political situation since mid-March
have captured the attention of the compatriots across the Straits,
overseas compatriots and international communities.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people across the Taiwan Straits, especially the
Taiwan compatriots, are looking forward to the improvement of the
relations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, and they expect
the new Taiwan authorities to respond to their opposition to "
Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
But the acts of the new Taiwan authorities have disappointed
the compatriots, for the new leaders in Taiwan are shunning the
One-China principle and have denied the common understanding
reached by the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
The new leaders of Taiwan claimed that they value the people's
will, but they have ignored Taiwan compatriots' desire for direct
shipping across the Straits and exchange of mail, trade, air and
shipping services.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Concerned Over Adoption of Islamic Law in Northern State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
expressed concern over the decision of the most populous northern
State Kano to adopt Sharia Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo has sent his special adviser
Alphonsus Nwosu to the state to express his worries, reports
reaching here from the country's capital Abuja said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nwosu told Kano State Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso that Obasanjo
was alarmed by his June 21 declaration of plans to introduce
Sharia, which includes punishments such as amputation and
flogging.
</P>
<P>
The president said he would be very brutal in his second year
in office with anyone who takes him for granted, by mistaking his
calmness for weakness, according to Nwosu.
</P>
<P>
The Kano governor replied that the declaration last week would
not be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
"Tell the president that Sharia is in the interest of the state
and Nigeria. Sharia is irrevocable and we are not ready to
surrender our constitutional right to anybody," Kwankwaso said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kano became the third state in the mainly Muslim
north Nigeria to adopt Sharia, despite strong opposition from
northern Christians.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that Kano's move could revive the sectarian
violence in which over 1,000 have died in Nigeria this year.
</P>
<P>
Since October last year, four northern states, including
Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto, and Kano, have declared to adopt Islamic
law.

<HEADLINE> Annan Distressed by Sunk Boat in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N.Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Friday was distressed by the news that an overcrowded
boat carrying persons fleeing the clashes in northern Maluku
Province of Indonesia and bound for North Sulawesi had sunk during
a violent storm.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed his condolences to the Government of Indonesia
and to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General voiced his concern over the escalation of
violence in the Maluku and North Maluku provinces and the steady
deterioration in the humanitarian situation, and the related
reports of large numbers of people killed and widespread
displacement of population.
</P>
<P>
Annan appealed to those perpetrating this violence to respect
humanitarian law and principles and to ensure the protection of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Annan said they must allow safe and unimpeded access to enable
humanitarian workers to provide assistance to the populations in
need.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated ferry disappeared while on a voyage of more than
200 miles to Manado in Sulawesi from the Malukus, a corner of the
Indonesian archipelago where violence between Muslims and
Christians has killed almost 3,000 people of both faiths in the
past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
After more than 30 hours of searching by air and sea, Indonesia
's military and private craft was unable to find any trace of the
ship that sank Thursday with almost 500 people on board. Most of
them are refugees fleeing the violence.

BAGHDAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the United

He is expected to focus on the tragic accident that two staffers

Wednesday morning.
</P>

The gunman, identified as 38-year-old Fuad Haidar, shot and
killed the two FAO staffers -- a Somali and an Iraqi -- with the
claimed aim to protest the decade-old U.N. sanctions.

<P>
Several others were injured as well. Haidar surrendered to the
authorities after a two-hour confrontation with Iraqi security
forces.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions, imposed since Iraq's 1990 invasion

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy Cancels National Day Celebration in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Amman has decided
to cancel its Independence Day celebration for security concern,
despite Jordanian efforts to play down terrorist threats against U.
S. targets in the kingdom, diplomatic sources here said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The July 4 celebration used to be held each year at the U.S.
ambassador's residence in Amman and attended by hundreds of
Jordanian dignitaries and representatives from the diplomatic
corps.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomats described the cancellation as part of increased
security measures for the embassy compound after the embassy warned
a week ago on its Internet website of "terrorist targeting" of the
embassy and other American targets in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The mission also advised American citizens travelling in the
kingdom to keep low profile and take extra prudence.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials had played down the U.S. warning and
described it as "routine alerts" issued by U.S. embassies in most
regions of the world, saying there was nothing new in terms of
threats to justify such a statement in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, after the warning, Jordanian security forces have
apparently beefed up security of the already heavily guarded U.S.
embassy in the affluent Abdoun area in southern Amman.
</P>
<P>
Similar warnings were issued by the U.S. government and the U.S.
embassy in Amman last December, when Jordanian police rounded up 14
suspected terrorists who allegedly sneaked into the kingdom on
forged travel documents to sabotage the new millenium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said the suspects, believed to be linked to the
Afghanistan-based Saudi-expelled billionaire Osama bin Laden, had
planned attacks on American and Israeli targets during the New Year
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden is one of the most wanted suspects by Washington,
which accused him of masterminding the 1998 bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing over 200 people.
</P>
<P>
However, no serious attacks on American targets were reported in
Jordan in recent memory.

PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac met
with visiting Armenian President Robert Kocharian on Friday and
discussed with the latter bilateral relations and the situation in
Upper Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said after the meeting that the relations between France
and Armenia are very important and close because of the big
Armenian community in France.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his sympathy with Armenian nation's tragic
exodus in 1915, during which hundreds of thousands of Armenians
died.
</P>
<P>
As for the 10-year-old conflict in Upper Karabakh between
Armenia and Azerbaijan, Chirac said that both sides of the
conflict are more and more aware of the need to find a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
With Russia and the United States, France is one of the three
co-presidents of the Group of Minsk in charge of mediating the
conflict in Upper Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
The French president also expressed his support to the recent
vote by parliament assembly of the Strasbourg-based Council of
Europe to admit Armenia as a member country.
</P>
<P>
Kocharian said that he expects a lot from his direct talks with
Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev, which are aimed at finding a
positive and lasting solution to the conflict in Upper Karabakh.

<HEADLINE> Women's Anti-Discrimination Committee Ends Twenty-Third Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination against Women(CEDAW) on Friday
concluded its twenty-third session at the Headquarters of the
United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Committee, the only United Nations human rights treaty body
that deals exclusively with women's rights, began the present
session on June 12.
</P>
<P>
The Committee considered reports from seven States Parties to
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women, Austria, Cameroon, Cuba, Iraq, Lithuania, Moldova
and Romania.
</P>
<P>
In their reports, Cuba and Iraq cited embargoes and sanctions
as impediment to advancement and the full implementation of the
Convention.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, Moldova and Romania, as economies in transition,
experienced economic upheaval and hardship, resulting in high
unemployment and poverty among women.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon showed commitment to improving the status of women,
through the adoption of a national plan against female genital
mutilation seeking to improve health and living conditions of
women and to put an end to the practice.
</P>
<P>
Austria, a country of destination for women victims of
trafficking, was committed to combating the problem, by
establishing a victim protection facility for psychological,
health, legal and family matters, and to facilitate women's return
and employment in the source countries.
</P>
<P>
CEDAW's twenty-third session is particularly noteworthy as it
came immediately after the recently ended Beijing+5 General
Assembly Special Session on women held from June 5 to 9, which
made several recommendations of particular value to the work of
CEDAW and which intensify the strength of the Convention. The
outcome document also addressed many of the concerns raised by the
Committee with regard to countries under review.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the Committee has met twice annually. To date, the
Committee has considered 105 initial, 75 second, 51 third and 15
fourth periodic reports.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women was adopted by the General Assembly
in December 1979, and rapid ratification brought it into force on
September 1981. To date, 165 countries have become parties to the
Convention.

<HEADLINE> Sunderland Nissan's Future In Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The UK car industry is in trouble
again, after a threat by Nissan to shift production from its
Sunderland plant to the continent because of the strength of
sterling.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland Nissan in England is Europe's most productive car
factory, with 5000 workers producing about 330,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ghosn, the Nissan president told the Financial Times
Friday that the strength of sterling could jeopardize a potential
150 million pounds expansion.
</P>
<P>
Production could drop by as much as 50 percent if it fails to
win its bid to build the new Micra model, Ghosn added.
</P>
<P>
A number of other car firms - Toyota, Honda, BMW and General
Motors (Vauxhall) - have already expressed their unease about the
value of the pound, and warned that uncertainty about British
membership of the euro could affect their investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
Ghosn said Nissan had no intention of closing the plant, but
would decide by the end of the year whether to build its next
generation of Micras there.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here Nissan's warnings are bound to fuel the
debate in the UK, and especially British industry,over euro
membership.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Keen to Peaceful Settlement of Civil War in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negaso
Jidada said here on Friday that Ethiopia has a strong desire to
see the peaceful settlement of disputes between the Sudanese
government and the main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
The peaceful resolution of the Sudanese civil war would help
bring about a lasting peace and stability in the Horn of Africa,
the president was quoted by a spokesperson of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia remains committed to back up the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD) peace initiatives designed to
bring the Sudanese government and the SPLA to the negotiating
table, he said, when conferring with a delegation of the IGAD
sub-committee on the problem in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed the need to exert an all-out effort
to avert series of conflicts and the impacts of periodical drought
in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesperson, the IGAD delegation headed by
Executive Secretary Atallaha Mohammed, told Jidada that a series
of talks were held on the Declaration of Principles between the
Sudanese government and the SPLA in January, February and April
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration of Principles, proposed by the IGAD in 1994,
calls for the separation of religion from politics, the
establishment of a secular country and a referendum over the
future political system in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Significant achievement has been made during the talks, which
centered on the substantive issues of state and the religion,
Mohammed said.
</P>
<P>
However, the IGAD official also noted that much is yet to be
done to achieve a full- fledged consensus between the two warring
parties of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Military conflicts between the Sudanese government and the SPLA
have been going on since 1983 due to sharp differences over the
practice of Islamic law in southern Sudan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Panel Rules Steel Case in Favor of China, Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC) on Friday blocked the Clinton administration
from imposing punitive duties on steel imports from China,
Indonesia, Slovakia and China's Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The federal commission ruled 5-1 that cold-rolled steel imports
from the four trade partners were not a threat to the U.S. steel
industry.
</P>
<P>
The ruling means the United States will not impose duties
ranging from 14.97 percent to 163.89 percent on cold-rolled steel
shipments, used in products ranging from automobiles to household
appliances.
</P>
<P>
Friday's ruling was a major victory for steel makers in
Slovakia, which would have faced 109.21 percent duties. Slovakia's
second-largest employer, VSZ, had been threatened with duties of
163.89 percent.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the ruling was a victory for Indonesia's PT Krakatau,
which would have faced duties of 83.79 percent. Other producers in
Indonesia were targeted at 43.90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cold-rolled steel makers in China had also faced punitive
duties, averaging 23.72 percent, while producers in Taiwan faced
14.97 percent margins.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, foreign steel makers lashed out at their
American rivals, releasing a study alleging that protectionist U.S.
trade policies have cost consumers up to 150 billion U.S. dollars
over the last 30 years.

<HEADLINE> New Findings Might Lead to Ways of Treating Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found a way for
the first time to make fruit fly carry malaria and infect chickens
with the deadly disease, paving the way to better fight malarial.
</P>
<P>
The new finding was reported in Friday's Science journal.
</P>
<P>
Malaria remains one of the most devastating public health
menaces in the world today, killing more than one million people a
year.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists know very little about how mosquitoes carry
malaria and transmit it from person to person, largely because the
insects are difficult to manipulate and not conducive to
laboratory studies.
</P>
<P>
Along with scientists with the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Disease, David Schneider, a fellow at the Whitehead
Institute and the leading author of the study, turned to fruit
flies, an excellent model to study human diseases.
</P>
<P>
Schneider injected a form of Plasmodium, the parasite that
causes malaria in chickens, into the body cavity of the flies.
When he allowed the carrier flies to infect chickens, the birds
developed full-blown malaria.
</P>
<P>
He also observed that a component of the fly's immune system,
known as a macrophage, was able to destroy Plasmodia in an attempt
to fight the infection. Theses results suggest that the fruit fly
can indeed serve as a model for studying malaria parasite.
</P>
<P>
"One advantage of using fruit flies instead of mosquitoes is
that we can do large-scale genetic screens to find mutants," says
Schneider, "We can knock out genes to determine whether the
parasites grow better or worse when a particular gene is missing."
</P>
<P>
Because parts of the human immune system are very similar to
those of fruit flies, this approach will hopefully lead to new
ways to treat malaria.
</P>
<P>
"The first drugs to treat malaria were inexpensive and had few
side effects, but they are no longer effective because the
parasite has become resistant," Schneider explains.

<HEADLINE> Americans' Income, Spending Up in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Americans' incomes increased 0.
4 percent in May, and their consumption spending rose 0.2 percent,
the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the second month in a row in which personal incomes rose
faster than spending, suggesting that Americans' less frenzied
pace of spending may help to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
In April, Americans' incomes, which include wages, interest and
government benefits, rose 0.6 percent, a little slower than the
government previously thought. Consumer spending grew by 0.2
percent, half as fast as the government estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Disposable personal income, or income less personal tax
payments, increased 0.4 percent in May compared with a 0.5 percent
rise in the month before.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage
of after-tax income, rose to 0.6 percent in May from 0.4 percent
the month before. Last month's rate was the highest since 0.8
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending has been the engine of the robust U.S.
economy and accounts for two-thirds of all economic activities.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times in the
last 12 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control. The Fed's rate increases are designed to make borrowing
more expensive and cool demand for such big-ticket items as cars
and homes.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Fed, citing tentative signs of slowing,
decided not to raise rates for a seventh time but left the door
open to further rate increases should inflation worsen.
</P>
<P>
Friday's report also showed that Americans' spending on durable
goods, cars and other big-ticket manufactured goods expected to
last at least three years, fell 1 percent in May. That followed a
0.7 percent drop the month before.
</P>
<P>
Spending on nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, rose 0.2
percent after a 0.2 percent decline in April.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday continued its closed-door discussion on the latest
developments in Sierra Leone, where 234 U.N. peacekeepers and
military observers are still being surrounded by rebels in the
West African country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
welcomed the news that 21 U.N. peacekeepers were freed by the
rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) with the assistance of
Liberian President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who has been in contact with President Taylor regarding
the detained peacekeepers, was hopeful that "this welcome step
will be followed by the immediate and unconditional freedom of
movement of the UNAMSIL (the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone)
personnel who still remain surrounded by the RUF in the area of
Kailahun," a U.N. statement said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The released U.N. peacekeepers, all Indian nationals, were
already in the Liberian capital of Monrovia and expected to be
flown later to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, said Taylor
in a statement released from Monrovia by the Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were detaining the Indian peacekeepers in Pendembu
near the Liberian border, and are still surrounding 222 other
Indian soldiers and 11 military observers at nearby Kailahun.
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebels began seizing U.N. soldiers in early May,
leaving the Lome peace accord they signed with the government in
July 1999 in tatters.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is considering a draft resolution, which
calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining
U.N. soldiers either taken hostage or surrounded by the RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebels are still calling for the release of their
leader, Foday Sankoh, who is being held at a secret location by
the government since he was arrested in May.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Senate Passes Clarity Act on Quebec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Senate passed the
Liberal government's bill on the issue of Quebec Thursday night to
make it law against secession of the French-speaking province from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The bill, better known as Clarity Act since it was passed by
the House of Commons in the middle of March, won the approval of
the Senate with 52 votes for, 34 against and nine abstaining.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal government's Bill C-20, first tabled last December,
enshrines into law a 1998 Supreme Court decision that found Quebec
must win a clear majority from a clearly-worded question before it
can separate from Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We need a clear question and a clear majority," as was once
declared by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who strongly indicated
that fifty plus one was far short of what he called the majority.
</P>
<P>
Federal Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Stephane Dion
indicated Thursday that another referendum is much less likely now
that the Clarity Act is law.
</P>
<P>
The law leaves it to the House of Commons to judge whether a
future referendum question is clear, and whether the voting
majority is large enough to begin separation negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard has repeatedly declared his will
to launch a third independence referendum in Quebec within his
term of office. The first two referendums were respectively held
in 1980 and 1995 and ended in short of a fifty-plus-one majority,
which separatists believe to be a result of validity.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Marking "Hanaoka Incident" Held in Northeastern Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony marking the 55th
anniversary of the "Hanaoka Incident" in which some 130 forced
Chinese laborers in Japan were slaughtered during an uprising at
the end of World War II was held Friday in Akita Prefecture in
northeastern Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hajime Kobatake, mayor of the Odate city, extended condolences
to the victims of the incident in an address at the ceremony which
was sponsored by the Odate municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five years have passed since the incident occurred, but
the wounded hearts of the victims' relatives have not yet healed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kobatake said that Japan and China should make unremitting
efforts to promote peace and friendship between the two countries
so as to realize a permanent world peace.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people, including officials from the Chinese Embassy
in Japan, Odate municipal government officials and representatives
of local civic groups, attended the ceremony, which was held
before a monument within a park in Hanaoka town.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the ceremony offered a minute of silent prayer
after Kobatake presented a list of victims to the monument.
</P>
<P>
Geng Shuoyu, son of then uprising leader Geng Chun, delivered a
memorial address at the ceremony on behalf of his father.
</P>
<P>
Angered at the hard labor, more than 700 Chinese laborers
forcibly brought to Hanaoka town by Japanese aggressor troops in
China launched an uprising on June 30, 1945. The uprising was
suppressed by Japanese military police and more than 130 laborers
were killed in the incident.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Former Construction Minister Arrested in Bribe Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Former Construction Minister
Eiichi Nakao was arrested Friday by Tokyo prosecutors for
allegedly accepting 30 million yen (285,700 dollars) in bribes
from a construction company, the Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Nakao, 70, a veteran politician of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) who lost his House of Representatives seat
in Sunday's general election, is suspected of receiving the money
from Tokyo-based Wakachiku Construction Co. in connection with the
selection of construction companies to join the Construction
Ministry's designated bidding firms.
</P>
<P>
Wakachiku Construction is listed on the First Section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office on Friday also
raided Nakao's residences in Tokyo and Kofu, Yamanashi Prefecture,
and related offices.
</P>
<P>
In October 1996, the then chairman of Wakachiku Construction
approached Nakao, construction minister at the time, requesting
the company be chosen as one of the ministry's designated bidding
firms, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
In return for agreeing, Nakao allegedly received the money from
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Nakao, a Kofu native who was first elected to the House of
Representatives in 1967 and won nine lower house elections since,
has also served as minister of international trade and industry
and Economic Planning Agency chief.
</P>
<P>
Nakao was seeking his 11th win in the general election Sunday
but lost the race.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Take to Loans for Housing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their change in attitude came after the government carried out
housing reforms and banks started to provide property loans,
revealed the sample survey of 1,000 people conducted by the
Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that Shanghai residents no longer wait for the
government to allocate housing as the government's housing reforms
are progressing, and have realized that it's better for them to
buy flats on the commercial market.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the respondents said that they want to buy
houses for themselves, 10 percent said they want to buy houses for
their children or parents, while the rest consider the home-buying
an investment.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that many citizens believe that the housing market
is developing well as the national macro-economic situation is
improving," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of those questioned said they intend to buy two-
room or three-room flats with a floor space between 60 and 140
square meters, or formerly-occupied residences.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 percent of the respondents said they would like to buy
houses of more than 140 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that Shanghai residents' ability to afford
housing prices has increased in recent years.

A quarter of the respondents said they are able to buy a flat
priced between 110,000 and 200,000 yuan (between 13,000 and 24,000
U.S. dollars); 40 percent said they can afford housing at prices
ranging from 210,000 to 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen percent said they would choose a house costing between
410,000 and 500,000 yuan, and another 14 percent said they prefer
houses in the 510,000-yuan price bracket.
</P>
<P>
Three percent said they can only afford houses of less than 100,
000 yuan, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Surveyors found that Shanghai citizens have realized that bank
loans would help them buy houses.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 percent of the citizens opt for a 11-15 year
credit period, 20 percent of citizens choose a 6-10 year term, 15
percent choose a 16-20 year term.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the citizens said they would accept loans
between 100,000 and 300,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
By March this year, Shanghai citizens had borrowed 34.4 billion
yuan from banks to purchase houses.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter alone, the commercial banks in the city
provided home loans to 357,000 households. Nearly 30,000 houses
covering 2.2 million square meters were sold.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Shanghai residents have praised the
steps by various banks to lower credit limits for citizens who
want to buy houses.

<P>
It also said many citizens from elsewhere who are working in
Shanghai expressed the desire to settle down in the city by
purchasing houses with bank loans.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Export of Sand-Fixing Wild Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for Entry-
Exit Inspection and Quarantine today issued a circular to ban
applications for exporting wild algae in a bid to protect the
fragile ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, inspection and quarantine bureaus
nationwide will stop handling inspection and quarantine on wild
algae for export.
</P>
<P>
Wild algae and other sand-fixing plants play an important role
in protecting the eco-environment, particularly grass.
</P>
<P>
But rampant picking and digging of the wild plants in recent
years has resulted in the deterioration and desertification of
grassland, seriously damaging the ecological environment, said the
circular.
</P>
<P>
The State Council recently issued a circular which urged
governments at all levels to stop local residents from picking and
digging the wild plants, and take necessary measures to ban the
trade of the plants.
</P>
<P>
Algae, a black hair-like plant, has been popular as the Chinese
pronunciation of the word is similar to "facai," which means "
making a fortune" in Chinese.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Asia's Biggest Information System for Civil Aviation, Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China is to pour 1.26 billion yuan
into the making of Asia's most comprehensive information system
for civil aviation and tourism in the next three years, according
to a senior official with the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
"To manage the enormous network, we have established the China
Aviation Information Co. Ltd. with 20 other domestic airlines, and
expect to list it on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange." said Yang Jun,
general manager of the Civil Aviation Computer Information Center
under CAAC, in an interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The global distribution system (GDS) is a large computer
information service system that can be applied to civil aviation
and tourism as the connection between the two industries becomes
closer.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, the GDS, based on the ticket-selling system,
is able to provide real-time and accurate information for
travelers, help CAAC keep up-to-date with sales of domestic
airlines, as well as promote the informationalization on the
country's tourist market.
</P>
<P>
The world's eight top GDSs are distributed throughout Germany,
the United States, Japan, Republic of Korea and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The appearance of GDS here can help China to someday be
included on the list of countries with advanced civil aviation
industries.
</P>
<P>
Since China has been one of the most important markets of civil
aviation and tourism, the competition among the GDS-operating
countries will become more intense after China's entry to the
World Trade Organization, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's civil aviation passenger
volume reached 60 million in 1999, ranking seventh in the world.
</P>
<P>
Yang also pointed out that a domestically-developed GDS is
necessary if Chinese airlines want to be globally competitive,
because use of foreign GDS services will increase operational
costs.

BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China will carry out a nationwide
crackdown on prostitution, gambling and drug abuse in public
recreational sites in the coming three months.
</P>
<P>
Any official who provides protection to violators will be
severely punished, State Councilor Luo Gan said in a

Law enforcement will focus on video arcades, karaoke bars,
sauna and massage parlors, as well as beauty salons, tea houses,

Luo said that some social ills, including prostitution,
gambling, and escort services, have grown out of control in these

Meanwhile, many entertainment businesses allowing these forms
of illegal activities have admitted adolescents, Luo said.
</P>

He also warned that some officials in localities have turned a

<HEADLINE> China to Overhaul Video Game Arcades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China plans to overhaul video game
arcades throughout the country and close down businesses which are
operating illegally.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the State Council circulated a notice
today, which says the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Public
Security and other ministries are expected to make concerted
efforts in the coming three months to put things straight in the
trade.
</P>
<P>
The booming of commercial video game arcades has stirred up a
nationwide debate here, as a rising number of Chinese adolescents
are addicted to video games but neglect their studies and video
game-related crimes are increasing.
</P>
<P>
The notice ordered that all video game arcades must be located
no less than 200 meters from primary or middle schools, and must
not admit adolescents except during holiday periods.
</P>
<P>
Internet cafes cannot offer video games, and computerized
gambling machines are forbidden, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that the content of computer games should not
endanger national security and social stability, contain
pornographic or violent content, or ridicule traditions of ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The administration for industry and commerce will re-register
all arcade owners and limit their business hours from round-the-
clock to 16 hours a day maximum.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the notice called for a halt to production and sales
of commercial video games in the country, and said that the
customs offices would crack down on smuggling of such products.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tibetan Teens Dream of Study in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- People walking along the northern
section of Beijing's fourth ring road often pause to look at the
unusual white-walled, red-roofed buildings nestled among modern
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan-style structures are the classroom buildings of the
renowned Beijing Tibet High School, where more than 700 Tibetan
youngsters are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
"Just like the high schools in Tibet, Tibetan language and
other state-set courses are taught here," said Bianba Toinzhub, a
Tibetan teacher from the Lhasa NO. 1 High School.
</P>
<P>
"What's different is that the teaching facilities here are much
better. For instance, the majority of students had only a general
understanding of computers from watching TV in Tibet; now they can
do their studies and draw pictures on the computer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1987 as part of the state program for aiding Tibet,
the school has become a longed-for destination of Tibetan
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Piao Rongting, headmaster of the school, said that they accept
students who have scored high in the entrance exam held in all
counties and cities in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
To give an edge to children of Tibetan herdsmen and farmers,
the Tibet Autonomous Region government has stipulated that 70
percent of the student body must be children whose families are
not on the pay list of various governmental departments and
factories.
</P>
<P>
Sunburns from the plateau are still noticeable on some students
' faces; the pale complexions of others betray their city roots.

<P>
In most cases, the Tibetan newcomers, most of them just 12 or
13, need assistance with daily living routines. The school employs
over 20 staff to watch over them.
</P>
<P>
Of each year's 200 new faces, 100 are junior high school
students. The teachers and other school employees set aside a few
days at the beginning of each school year to instruct the
youngsters on personal hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen-year-old Dawa Lhase said the teachers are very
considerate, and are able to communicate well with the young
people.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, when I was criticized by the teacher for fighting
with my classmates, I didn't pay any attention, though I pretended
to. Here, the teacher told me that a powerful man in conflict with
others should resort to peaceful reasoning instead of fists. I
agree, and now I don't like scuffle with classmates," he said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of students are followers of Tibetan Buddhism, and
the school authority never interferes in students' religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The school presents various gifts and Tibetan food to the
students for Tibetan festivals including the Tibetan New Year
Festival, and every year more than 30 living Buddhas visit the
school.

Like students everywhere in the world, students here have lofty
aspirations. Ngatsi, from Qamdo, wants to be a singer; Cering
Zhaxi, from Nyingchi, has sights set on a career as a dancer. Both
are now members of a performance group at the school.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan language is the most important course for the students
because the regional government mandates that Tibetan count for
120 marks in the senior high school entrance exam, while Chinese
and English get 100 marks each.
</P>
<P>
Junior high school students in the school here have to return
to Tibet to take the exam for entrance of schools as senior high
school students, and about 30 percent can be re-enrolled by the
school here for senior stage learning.
</P>
<P>
Chinese teacher Zhou Lianzeng said that the Tibetan students
are honest and diligent and teachers are dedicated to teaching
them well. Though the government pays for their tuition and living
expenses, some of them are short of pocket money, every year
teachers here donate money to the students.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few students travel to see their former teachers even
years after they have graduated, Zhou added.
</P>
<P>
According to the headmaster, the funds the state invests on a
Tibetan student here are equivalent to those for a university
student: more than 10,000 yuan a year. There are 24 such schools
across the country, with an annual recruitment of 1,300 Tibetan
teenagers.

<HEADLINE> OIC Wants Equal Share of Benefits of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministers of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) Friday stressed the need
to take effective measures to alleviate the negative impact of the
international economic order on the economies of member states in
order to guarantee their sharing on an equal footing the benefits
of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the liberalization of trade has not been beneficial
to the developing countries, they highlighted, in a Communique
issued at the end of their four-day meeting here, the need for
confidence-building in the multilateral trade exchange system by
encouraging the participation of all developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister at their 27th meeting also emphasized the
principle of opening up membership of WTO to all, and called for
speeding up the procedure for joining that organization without
any condition in the areas of trade, investment, and stock markets
and technology, so as to achieve the ultimate objective of
establishing a common Islamic market or any other form of economic
complimentarity.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need to urgently implement the Strategy and
the Plan Action to strengthen economic and commercial cooperation
among member states within the framework of the Standing Committee
for Economic and Commercial Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stressed the need to make substantial reductions
in the debts of the Least Developed Countries and especially to
observe flexibility in applying the eligibility criteria for
benefiting from the initiative to assist poor debt-burdened
countries.
</P>
<P>
They made an appeal to the developed countries to implement the
'90s Action Plan for the Least Developed and Land-Locked Countries
as well as the other resolutions adopted by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the U.N. decision to convene the third U.N.
Conference on Least-Developed Countries in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
They renewed the call to the developed countries to offer
substantial reduction of the debts of African countries, including
OIC Member States, and the alleviation of the debt service charges.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Welcomes OIC Mission to Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government welcomed
Friday the reported plan of the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC to send a probe team to the Philippines to determine the true
situation in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the government does not
consider the mission as an interference, but an opportunity for
the Philippines to show that it is doing its best to bring
development to the south and fully implement a peace agreement it
forged with the Moro National Liberation Front four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem with that. It is better that the OIC sees
things for itself," Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government expects the mission to arrive in
three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
also agreed with Zamora's view that the visit of the OIC team
would give the Philippines the chance to prove that it is giving
priority to Mindanao's development.
</P>
<P>
"It would be better if they saw for themselves the situation in
Mindanao," Mercado said in a separate radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Mercado noted that the OIC earlier urged Muslim minorities to
respect the sovereignty and laws of their home countries.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the OIC's call for a stop to military
offensives against the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) in Mindanao was uncalled for, as the military was only
responding to the MILF's abuses and violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
The military earlier admitted to launching an all-out war
against the MILF, resulting in the capture of most of the rebel
group's camps and the displacement of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is one of the major issues before the OIC, which
is holding a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mercado also said the government continues to weigh its options
in dealing with the MILF, now that the June 30 deadline for a
peace agreement will lapse soon.
</P>
<P>
"Our next move will depend on the MILF's response to the
deadline. We have to protect our territorial integrity," Mercado
said.

economic development of Member State, they reaffirmed that science
and technology must be harnessed for peaceful purposes for the
good of humanity and for a reinforcement of the socio-economic
development of Member States.

<HEADLINE> Manila Expects More Jobs Created in Second Half of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it expects more jobs to be created in the 3rd and 4th
quarters of 2000 despite the country's unemployment rate rising to
a nine-year high level of 13.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said April's unemployment
rate was resulted from the decrease in seasonal or part-time
agricultural jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The jobs decrease last April was due mainly to factors
affecting the agricultural, fishery and forestry sector which is
adjusting itself while bracing for stronger food security programs
of the government," Laguesma said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The labor chief stressed that despite the rise in unemployment,
" the economy is not in bad shape," citing that the unexpected"
increase was due "almost entirely to the steep fall of 1.502
million workers in agricultural employment.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that agricultural employment would perk up in
the next quarter based on the Department of Agriculture's forecast
of a 3.5 percent increase in farm output.
</P>
<P>
The survey of the National Statistics Office (NSO) also showed
that the employment slump pushed up the services sector by 404,000
jobs as "surplus agricultural labor sought employment elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
The NSO report pointed to the conflict in the Autonomous Region
in Muslim Mindanao as one of the factors that decreased the labor
force by 570,000 to 32.874 million in April 2000 from 33.444
million in the same month of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Around 86.1 percent of the country's labor force were employed
in April 2000 -- 10.59 million in agriculture, fishery and
forestry; 4.57 million in industry; and 13.17 million in services.

dollars for 1999 and will get 11 million dollars each in the next
two years, said the PTI, adding that six million dollars would be
given to India every year between 2002 and 2009 for various ODS

<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada and visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar

During their joint press conference in the Presidential Palace,

<HEADLINE> Orlando Magic Ready to Sign NBA Free-agent Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Orlando Magic has set
sights on superstars Tim Duncan and Grant Hill when the free-agent
sweepstakes begins on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Magic, a surprise 41-41 last season under first-year coach
Doc Rivers, cleared about 18 million US dollars of salary-cap room
as it became the big wheelers and dealers in the NBA draft on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We're loaded. We have the money we needed now, and we don't
have to worry about giving away our whole team or doing any sign-
and-trade deals," said Rivers, coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Magic had three first-round picks in the draft but kept
only Mike Miller, dealing the other two and veterans Corey
Maggette and Derek Strong to get the extra cap room.
</P>
<P>
Current contracts of all free agents expire on Saturday, but no
one can be signed until August 1 when the salary cap for next
season is announced.
</P>
<P>
The thought of Duncan and Hill going to the same team could
shift the balance of power in the NBA from Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe
Byrant and the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
And Magic has made the necessary moves by being able to offer
both Duncan and Hill a maximum six-year contract starting at 9
million US dollars a year with 10 percent annual raises.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the salary cap restrictions, it will take some
major maneuvering for both superstars to end up on the same team.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Crackdown on Illegal Emigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in east China has
intensified its crackdown on stowaways after 58 illegal immigrants
recently were found dead in a truck at the English port of Dover.
</P>
<P>
The 58 men and women, reportedly Chinese, were crammed into a
truck by "snakeheads," or human traffickers, and apparently died
of suffocation on their long journey to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Local departments have been mobilized to identify the dead
immigrants, going from village to village to find family or
friends.
</P>
<P>
Many local people said that they could not comprehend why these
people paid such a high price (said to be 23,000 US dollars a head)
to snakeheads, and even risked their lives in the smuggling
attempt.
</P>
<P>
Fujian is one of China's first provinces to initiate the reform
and opening policy in late 1970s. At present, the province's gross
domestic product has reached 10,900 yuan (1,313 dollars), ranking
seventh in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the province's urban residents' average per capita
disposable income stood at 6,860 yuan (827 dollars), and farmers'
per capita income climbed to 3,091 yuan (372 dollars) --
relatively well-off amounts compared with earnings in less-
developed areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, local governments at all levels have
been adopting various measures to crack down on illegal emigration.
Snakeheads and those found involved in human being trafficking
have received severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
Concerned departments also strengthened cooperation with
international organizations in the field. U.S. and Canadian
immigration experts went to Fuzhou to help train border inspection
personnel in May. This was the first joint effort by China, the
United States and Canada to fight against illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a press
conference that the Chinese government strongly condemns the
illegal emigration activities and calls for cooperation among the
international community to crack down on the organizers.

<HEADLINE> China to Ensure Water Transport Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China will initiate a month-long
inspection in July of rural ferry boats to double-check water
transport safety, according to a working tele-conference on water
transport which was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, minister of Communications, made the
announcement at the meeting, which was also designated as the
second working conference for the Year for Management on Water
Transport Safety.
</P>
<P>
Since May, China has reported a number of accidents involving
passenger ships, especially ferries in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Rong Jian, a passenger ship carrying more than 220
passengers, sank on a section of the Yangtze River near Hejiang
County in southwest China's Sichuan Province on June 22. The
accident killed a total of 115 people and 15 more are still
missing.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have revealed that the ship carrying capacity
was only about 100 people. Overloading has been listed as a cause
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the chances of future accidents, inspectors will
examine the qualifications of the people in charge of boat-
checking, improve training of crew members for passenger ships,
tighten supervision on boat registration, and prepare for
emergency situations, Huang said.

<HEADLINE> Funeral For U.N. FAO Staffer Held in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A funeral was held Friday for Yusuf
Abdilleh, a Somali national who was killed Wednesday in the Iraqi
capital by a gunman who claimed to protest the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdilleh, an administrative officer of the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), was buried at the Karh cemetery
in a Baghdad suburb.
</P>
<P>
Abdilleh was one of the two FAO staffers killed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The other one, an Iraqi, was identified as Marewan Mohammed
Hassan. It is not immediately known whether a funeral will also be
held for him.
</P>
<P>
At the memorial ceremony held before the funeral, Hasam Abdul
Razag, an Iraqi foreign ministry adviser, expressed "regret" over
the tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
Amir Khalil, FAO representative in Iraq, extended his thanks for
those attending the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice Agricultural Minister Abdul Najim Ali,
representatives of other U.N. organizations in Iraq and diplomatic
corps were present at the ceremony which was held near the FAO
office building in central Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy happened on Wednesday morning when the gunman burst
into the FAO building, killing two FAO staffers and injuring
several others.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour confrontation with the Iraqi security forces,
the gunman, identified as 38-year-old Fuad Haidar, surrendered to
the authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to him, he did this to protest the decade-old U.N.
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said the sanctions has claimed lives of over 1.2
million people, most of them children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Haidar told reporters that he has long had the idea of attacking
a U.N.-affiliated organization in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
He said he originally plotted to abduct U.N. arms inspectors
including the former head of the U.N. Special Commission Richard
Butler, but did not succeed.
</P>
<P>
This time he chose to attack the U.N. FAO because "there are
many foreigners in this organization."
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear that what kind of penalty he will receive,
but he is likely to face death penalty according to the Islamic
law.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Return First Sum of Former Nigerian Leaders' loot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to recover the first sum
of money looted by former military rulers by next month, President
Olusegun Obasanjo said in Geneva, Switzerland, the Nigerian press
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The press quoted the president as saying on Thursday that the
identified looted funds currently in banks of Switzerland and some
other European countries have amounted to about 3 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was in Switzerland to attend a special summit of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president expressed disappointment with some
European countries on the issue, urging them to emulate
Switzerland which, according to him, actually used to be "a haven
for loot".
</P>
<P>
He said: "At this juncture, I want to express our appreciation
to the Swiss authorities for cooperating with us to trace and
freeze what we have identified as Nigeria's funds stashed away
illegally and fraudulently to this country (Switzerland)".
</P>
<P>
He added: "Measures to repatriate such funds on both sides are
being taken. And we would have thought that similar countries
harboring Nigeria's stolen funds would consider the Swiss example
for emulation".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Sino-German Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here Friday that China attaches great importance to developing
friendly and cooperative relations with Germany, calling for more
German investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at German Industry and Trade Council, the
Chinese premier said both China and Germany are important
countries in the world and that China attaches importance to
Germany's important role in European and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is willing to develop long-term and stable
cooperation with Germany on the basis of equality, mutual benefit
and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said China appreciates Germany's adherence
to the One-China policy and its refusal to sell arms to and
develop governmental relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both China and Germany should cooperate sincerely,
share prosperity and bring bilateral economic and trade
cooperation to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Germany's investment in China accounted for only 13
percent of the total foreign investment in China over the year,
which was inconsistent with Germany's status, according to Zhu.
He said that China welcomes larger-scale cooperation in investment
with Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who arrived here Thursday for an official
visit to Germany, said in his speech that China and Germany should
strengthen cooperation in a wider range of areas, including high
and new technology and environmental proctection.
</P>
<P>
Zhu praised the German nation as a nation which always keeps
its promises.
</P>
<P>
He also wished the Sino-German conference on environment
protection, scheduled to be held in Beijing in December, a great
success.

<HEADLINE> Interview: High Autonomy Widely Valued in All Parts of Society in Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- "I am very sad that I will leave
this most dynamic and energetic city in the world," said Andrew
Burns just a few days before he will assume his new post as the
British high commissioner in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Burns, 56, the first British consul general for Hong Kong and
Macao officially appointed by the British government since China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1,
1997, arrived here four months after the handover, but he first
became involved in Hong Kong affairs 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Burns pointed out that the
pessimistic predictions about the situation in Hong Kong have not
been fulfilled and Hong Kongers should have much more faith in
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of 'One Country, Two Systems' has become a
reality, the high degree of autonomy exists and is clearly widely
valued in all parts of society, and most of life here goes on
quite unaffected by the change of sovereignty," the consul general
noted.
</P>
<P>
Burns said he is very confident of the success of Hong Kong in
the long run, since he believes that the Chinese government
seriously wants the philosophy of high autonomy to be a success
and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
is determined to make it a success.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that the SAR government will continue to do all they
can to ensure that the remarkable talents of people of Hong Kong
are able to exploit the autonomy to the full," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the trade and investment between Britain and Hong
Kong, Burns said Hong Kong is, after Japan, Britain's second
largest export market in Asia, taking well over 2 billion pounds
of British exports each year and 35 percent of British exports for
China's mainland also pass through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of Hong Kong's investment in Europe is in
Britain in sectors as diverse as ports, telecommunications,
textiles, property and computer peripherals, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Here in Hong Kong we have an active trade mission program
bringing out some 250 British companies to the Hong Kong market
each year, we help around 200 British companies take part in trade
fairs here, and we also take influential Hong Kong business people
to the UK," Burns said.

<P>
As for the future business opportunities in Hong Kong after
China's accession to the WTO, Burns said there are huge prospects
in technology, education, services and environment. "We will find
new roles and new things to do in all these aspects."
</P>
<P>
Asked about what the best memory he has of Hong Kong during his
term, Burns said he was unprepared for the excitement of living in
Hong Kong when he came, though he made contacts with many friends
who have quite a lot of background knowledge of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I had not really appreciated just how dynamic and energetic
Hong Kong is," he said, describing the city as "the Manhattan of
the Pacific -- an intense urban experience, surrounded by
beautiful hills and seascapes. "It is a place where you live 120
percent all of the time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By looking back to my time in Hong Kong, what I actually most
enjoyed was entertaining over 7,000 people from all walks of life
to meals and receptions in our apartment at the Albany," Burns
recalled.
</P>
<P>
One of Burns' great pleasures in Hong Kong was that he had the
chance to travel around all over China. In his list of the
destinations, there are not only those big cities in east and
southwest China, but also the less densely-populated western areas.
</P>
<P>
Just recently, Burns and his wife flew to Lanzhou and then
traveled by train along the renowned "Silk Road" in the western
part of China. "It was a great highlight of my time here," he
recalled, adding that the Silk Road was probably the first
original Internet bringing culture and trade from the east to the
west and vice versa.

<HEADLINE> Improvement in Art Education Necessary: Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
wants to see improvements made to the country's art education
programs so that they can better serve social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Li made an inspection tour yesterday to a number of art
institutes in Beijing, including the Chinese Opera Institute, the
Beijing Institute of Dance and the Beijing Film Academy.
</P>
<P>
The reform on art education will focus on better training of
qualified people to meet the requirement of local and national
development in the 21st century, Li said at a meeting after his
tour, which was guided by presidents of the institutes and
officials from the sectors of education and arts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, art institutes should offer special tuition loans
for poverty-stricken students, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the vice premier called for promoting quality
education and popularizing the socialist ethical and moral
education among the art school students. The vice premier noted
that socialist culture and art are important components of the
socialist cause, and better-quality art programs should be created.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Armed Forces Urged to Develop West Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese military officer
today called on the armed forces to take part in the development
of the western areas.
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces should actively participate in building
infrastructure facilities and improving the ecological environment
in the west," Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission and the defense minister, said at a meeting in Beijing
on the army's participation and support for development of China's
western areas.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said the armed
forces should provide technological support and talented personnel
for major projects as well as protect the frontiers, and maintain
social stability and national unity.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed forces should take part in the construction
of transportation, water conservancy, energy and telecommunication
projects, and help combat desertification by planting trees and
grass in the land-locked western areas which are economically
underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
Assistance should also be given to help people, especially
those of ethnic minority groups, develop education and cure
disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the armed forces can share part of the military
airports, railways, warehouses, oil pipelines and other facilities
with local governments for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Senior military officials Zhou Ziyu, Qian Shugen, Zhou Youliang,
Hu Shixiang attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Military Commission has issued a
circular calling on the armed forces and armed police to develop
the west -- a plan which has a great significance for promoting
China's modernization drive, maintaining state security and social
stability as well as reinvigorating the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Host Large Exhibition of Dunhuang Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale exhibition scheduled
to open in the Chinese capital next Tuesday will give modern city
dwellers a taste of Buddhist art from more than 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Art Exhibition, garnering dozens of precious
relics originating from Dunhuang in northwest China's Gansu
Province, will be unveiled at the Museum of Chinese History on the
east side of Tian'anmen Square in Beijing, it was announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The two-month show, the world's biggest to highlight Dunhuang
art, is part of the commemorative activities for the centennial
anniversary of the discovery of the Dunhuang Sutra Cave.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits include four full-size replicas of Dunhuang caves,
copies of 30 murals, ten copies of figurines, 14 authentic sutras
and ten sutra copies, six genuine paintings and 44 reproductions,
as well as more than 80 photographs of Dunhuang relics collected
both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, Taoist priest Wang Yuanlu discovered a cave at Mogao
Grottoes in Dunhuang containing more than 50,000 sutras, documents
and paintings of nearly 10 dynasties ranging from the 4th to the
11th century.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang, popularly known as the Thousand
Buddha Caves, were carved out of the sandrocks stretching for
about 1,600 meters along the eastern side of Mingsha Hill, 25 km
southeast of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
A Tang Dynasty inscription records that the first cave in the
Mogao Grottoes was made in 366 A.D. Despite erosion and man-made
destruction, the 492 caves are well preserved, with frescoes
covering an area of 45,000 square meters, more than 2,000 colored
sculptured figures and five wooden eaves overhanging the caves.
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists, it is the greatest and most
consummate repository of Buddhist art in the world. The United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
listed the Mogao Grottoes on the World Heritage List in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that we have put relics in the sutra
cave on display. All authentic relics are collected from Beijing,
Shanghai, Sichuan and Gansu," said Fan Jinshi, director of the
Institute of Dunhuang Studies, one of the organizers of the
exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Favorable Environment Urged for Educational, Scientific Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Concerted efforts such as
financial and policy support from the government should be made in
China to create a favorable environment in which education and
science can thrive, according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, vice chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), stressed here today that
the current systems of education and scientific research must be
reformed to adapt to a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
She attended the 33rd Plenum of the Ninth NPC Education,
Science, Culture and Health Committee, whose members reviewed a
report made by Xu Rongkai, director of the National Leading Group
Under the State Council For Education and Science, on the
achievements the government has scored in reforms of educational
and scientific research systems in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A major step of the reform is to turn 242 scientific research
institutes subsidized by the government into enterprises, with the
aim of prompting Chinese researchers to ensure that their research
results are better used in economic production, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Another measure of educational reform is the merger of
universities and colleges. So far a total of 457 universities and
colleges have been merged into 188 new academies.
</P>
<P>
Great importance should be attached and concrete steps should
be taken to realize the country's goal of invigorating the nation
through education and science, Peng said, adding that reform in
these two fields should be carried out steadily.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of reinvigorating the nation through education and
science was initiated in 1995 and was put at the top of the
government's agenda in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Host International Symposium on Relics Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- An international symposium to find
some solutions for China's dilemma of rapid urbanization vs.
relics protection will be held July 5-7 in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, "Cultural Relics Protection and Urban
Development in China: Opportunity and Challenge," is the first of
its kind in China, a 5,000-year-old country which is undergoing
breakneck urban construction amid economic booms.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting will be officials and specialists who are
responsible for relics protection and urban planning in dozens of
Chinese cities, as well as foreign experts invited by the World
Bank and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now boasts about 400,000 relics
sites, including 750 sites under the state's top protection and 99
renowned historic cities.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 cultural relics sites and scenic spots in China
have been listed on UNESCO's list of world heritages.
</P>
<P>
However, large-scale infrastructural construction and
refurbishing projects in old urban areas have worsened the
situation of relics protection in recent years, according to some
specialists of relics conservation.
</P>
<P>
Many precious ancient buildings and relics have been pulled
down to make way for glass-and-chrome skyscrapers in lots of
cities, they complained.
</P>
<P>
Discussions during the symposium are expected to focus on the
establishment of cultural heritage lists, the planning and
protection of historic sites, rational use of ancient buildings
and sites, and relationships between relics protection and tourism
promotion.
</P>
<P>
A document on relics protection and urban development may be
issued after the meeting, said an official with the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH), which sponsored the
symposium together with the Ministry of Construction, the World
Bank and the UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was initiated by SACH officials in 1999 during an
international conference on sustainable development of cultural
heritage in Italy.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Strong Gene Sequencing Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China now ranks fourth in the
world in terms of gene sequencing capacity, thanks to its active
participation in the Human Genome Project (HGP).
</P>
<P>
Scientists from six countries announced on June 26 that they
had completed a working draft of the sequencing of the human
genome. China completed one percent of the work ahead of schedule
in April.
</P>
<P>
China's gene sequencing capacity has been greatly improved
after it introduced 30 sets of the most advanced "gene sequencers,
" or gene sequencing machines, from the United States in May,
enabling the country to surpass France and Germany in gene
sequencing, and placing it fourth after the U.S., Britain and
Japan, said Zhang Meng, a spokesman of the Beijing Genomics
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Biology, information, space technology, new energy and new
materials are regarded as the most important and promising fields
in the 21st Century. Many scientists believe that the biological
technology will have an even deeper impact on mankind than
information technology.
</P>
<P>
The biological industry in China will not follow the example of
the information industry, which does not possess the key
technology and has to depend on foreign manufacturers to survive,
said Yang Huanming, the chief scientist on Chinese side for the
HGP.
</P>
<P>
He said that by participating in the HGP, China has shared the
advanced information, resources and techniques with other
countries, and has built up a complete set of gene sequencing
technology and provided a solid basis for further studies on gene
sequencing of biological resources.
</P>
<P>
China has begun to launch a series of projects in gene
sequencing of plant and animal species. A gene sequencing project
of China Hybrid Super Paddy started last month, and a pig gene
sequencing project will also be launched within three days.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Not to Be Disturbed By Poll: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Friday brushed aside an opinion poll in favor of his predecessor
and political opponent Benjamin Netanyahu, saying his government
will not be disturbed by anything.
</P>
<P>
The poll, published by Israel's popular Ma'ariv daily Friday
morning, showed that if elections are held today, Netanyahu will
defeat Barak by a majority of 44 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll's margin of error is 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is a warning signal to Barak, especially considering
Netanyahu was recommended by police on March 28 to be indicted with
charges such as bribery, fraud and breach of public trust.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak told Israel Radio on Friday his government is one
of deeds, not one of talks, suggesting he will not take the poll
figure as serious.
</P>
<P>
The poll, carried out by Gallup on a representative sample of
594 Israeli adults (both Jews and Arabs), was the latest in a
series of polls surveying Barak's popularity versus that of
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Poll records showed Netanyahu surpassed Barak, the first time
since Barak took office last July, in last Week's survey, which
indicated Netanyahu would win general elections against Barak by a
margin of 42 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts attributed the swing of the pendulum between Barak
and Netanyahu to Barak's clumsy dealing with the government crisis
in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the ultraorthodox religious Shas party, who holds
pivotal 17 seats in Israel's 120-member Knesset and is the biggest
ruling partner in Barak's coalition, submitted their resignation
letters to Barak last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although they changed their minds at the last minute to avoid
the crisis, Barak had to swallow his pride and satisfy most of the
party's demands, including funding its ailing educational network,
legalizing its pirate radio stations, and having a say in the peace
process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yisrael Ba'aliya and National Religious Party, two
other right-wing partners in Barak's coalition, initiated a fresh
crisis this week, threatening to resign over reported concessions
being made to the Palestinians in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Party officials have said that if Barak goes to a summit with U.
S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
without red lines to prevent so-called "excessive concessions" to
the Palestinians, the two parties will surely resign.
</P>
<P>
Barak has been in the hope that such a summit will make final
decisions to resolve the disputes between the two sides over the
thorny final-status issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, border, security and
water.
</P>
<P>
However, the threats made by his ruling partners and the
popularity sliding in the poll might undermine his credibility in
the talks.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Troops Retake Strategic Rebel Bastions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) has
conquered a strategic bastion of the rebels in the central Bie
Province, giving a strong punch to the rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi, the official newspaper Jornal de Angola reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Located between Kuito, capital city of the Bie Province, and
Luena, capital of the Moxico Province, the municipality of Cuemba
is a strategic point for the rebels, especially after they lost
the political and military headquarters of Bailundo and Andulo
last September and October.
</P>
<P>
The city is important for the rebels because it is the place
where the rebels organize guerrilla groups and launch scattered
attacks around the country, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Besides the crushing defeat in this area, which has been under
the control of the rebels for 12 years, the rebels also suffered
heavy casualties in the neighboring town of Munhango, said the
newspaper without mentioning the exact number.
</P>
<P>
After the defeat in the two districts in the Bie Province, the
rebels fled to the north and the south of the area.
</P>
<P>
"We've started the clean-up operation along the railway from
Munhango to Cuemba," said the chief of the general staff of the
fifth brigade of the motorized infantry, adding that the rebels
showed their resistance, but were repelled by the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
During the recent battles in the eastern Bie Province, many
Savimbi's soldiers surrendered to the government troops. "It is
due to the pessimistic conditions of the rebels," said the
official newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Munhango and Cuemba, located in the Angolan central highland,
are adjacent to Angola's eastern provinces Moxico and Lunda-sul,
where the rebels have their traditional bastions, said local
analysts.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria listed Among Poorest Countries by UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria was among the 24 poorest
countries in the world, according to 2000 Human Development Report
(HDR), published by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) in New York recently.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was placed the 151st, out of a total of 174 countries
and regions in the world, a leading Nigerian newspaper Friday
quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"As if pointing to Nigeria, the report dwelt extensively on the
failure of developing countries to make positive impact on their
citizens despite moving from military dictatorship to democracy,"
said the Guardian concerning the UNDP's report.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerian office of the UNDP, at the same time, said in
its own report that the country had no business being poor if
only all its abundant natural resources were properly harnessed.

<HEADLINE> HK Local Graduates Perform Quite Favorably: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Results of a comprehensive
survey show that the overall performance of local first-degree
graduates of Hong Kong as assessed by employers is quite favorable.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at obtaining opinions of employers on the quality of the
1998 first-degree graduates of the seven University Grants
Committee (UGC)-funded institutions, the survey is conducted by a
government-commissioned consultant.
</P>
<P>
A sample size of 4,565 graduates employed in 3,063 companies
and organizations, including government departments, was selected
for the just-completed first-year survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey questionnaire has been so designed as to capture
information on eight aspects of performance, with each aspect
being measured by a number of attributes. The eight aspects are:
Chinese Language Proficiency, English Language Proficiency,
Numerical Competency, Information Technology Literacy, Analytical
and Problem-solving Abilities, Work Attitude, Inter-personal
Skills, and Management Skills.
</P>
<P>
The assessment on an aspect of performance is measured by a
score on a five-point scale. A score of 3 generally meets the
employers' required standard.
</P>
<P>
Out of the sample of 4,565 graduates, 2,017 valid
questionnaires were received, representing a response rate of 50.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey show that the overall performance of the
graduates was quite favorable, being 3.46. Fourteen percent of the
graduates received a rating above 4, implying that their
performance sometimes or always exceeds the employers' required
standard.

percentage point in May from April to a seasonally adjusted 4.6
percent for the second consecutive month of decline, the
Management and Coordination Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless stood at 3.28 million people,
representing a decrease of 60,000 from a year earlier to mark the
first year-on-year decline in 37 months, the agency said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, the number of jobless men was down 110,000 from a
year before to 1.96 million, the first decline in 35 months, but
the number of unemployed women grew by 60,000 to 1.33 million.

The unemployment rate for men was 4.6 percent, down 0.4
percentage point, while that for women fell 0.1 percentage point

March.
</P>
<P>
A separate report released Friday by Japan's Labor Ministry
showed that the ratio of job offers to job seekers in May was 0.56,

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 Fall Ill in Western Japan After Drinking Milk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 people fell sick in
Osaka and five other prefectures in western Japan after drinking
low-fat milk produced by a local Japanese company, the Kyodo News
Service reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The victims, ranging in age from 10 months to 90 years old,
suffered diarrhea, abdominal pains and vomiting after drinking the
milk Tuesday and Wednesday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The milk, packaged in 1-liter and 500-milliliter cartons, was
produced by Snow Brand Milk Products Co. last Friday and Saturday
at the company's factory located in Osaka's Miyakojima Ward.
</P>
<P>
A total of 128,000 cartons were produced during the two-day
period, Snow Brand officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the health authorities said they have yet to
determine the cause of the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they had examined a carton of milk provided
by family of the victims, but could not detect any bacteria that
would cause food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
As of 12:30 p.m. local time Friday, a total of 1,199 victims
were reported, with Osaka Prefecture posting the largest number of
victims at 737.
</P>
<P>
Most victims are not in a series condition, health authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Snow Brand announced that it had halted low-fat
milk production at the Miyakojima plant, and said that it would
recall the 298,000 cartons of low-fat milk shipped since Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Seminar on Islam Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 30 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar and
dialogue on "Enhancing the Understanding of Islam for the Media"
opened here Friday to correct the image of Islam which was said to
be wrongly portrayed by the media.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day seminar, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said "There are among us people who act
deliberately to cause Islam to be reviled by others. The Muslims
are ready to correct that image but we need the cooperation of the
media, particularly the Western media."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said there is so much misunderstanding in this world,
misunderstanding arising from wrong information or inability to
get the right information and because of this misunderstanding
countries and regions, peoples and races and the followers of
different religions hate each other and very often fight each
other.
</P>
<P>
Correct information about each other can help reduce the
animosity and suspicions and bring the groups together into a
great family of people, humankind, to create a better world for
everyone, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"There is a golden opportunity for the media to help build a
better, a fairer and more just world. There is a great opportunity
for the media to enrich the world, to enrich everyone everywhere,"
the Malaysian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not that the Muslims are asking for the media to be
biased in their favor. All they are asking for is fair reporting,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The media can do much for creating greater understanding of
Islam and Muslims, he said, adding the Muslims are not inherently
against the West, the Christians or the Jews, they want peace as
much as anybody else.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed his hope that the seminar will help the
media to get a clearer picture of Islam and hopefully to
contribute to the understanding of Islam among them all.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized in conjunction with the ongoing 27th
Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers which concludes later
Friday.

"Nothing has been found so far. There have been no reports of
survivors clinging to bits of the ship's wooden hull or the boat
itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ship was allowed to carry up to 270 passengers. But
officials and witnesses said the ship left Tobelo port packed with
nearly 500, mostly refugees from Duma and Makete who fled their
villages after the areas were ravaged by rioters last week.
</P>
<P>
The violence, which broke weeks of calm, has claimed more than
150 persons.
</P>
<P>
It was the second ferry carrying Maluku refugees to have sunk
since the Masnaiat capsized in a storm in Ambon (capital of Maluku
province) waters in May, resulting in the death of more than 40
passengers.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Ancient City to Restore Historic Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's historic city of Patan
is going to have its traditional look restored soon, according to
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO along with the Patan Municipality and other
organizations are jointly working for the project, UNESCO officer
Hema Gurung told the press Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Agreements have been signed last week. Now we are working on
the cost and design. The real construction works will start as
soon as the monsoon season ends in September," Gurung said.
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, the roads in Patan city will be stone-paved
and vehicles will not be allowed to ply inside the city, the newly
built houses will have new facades with traditional look and
commercial boards will be removed.
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO is going to provide 9,000 U.S. dollars for the plan
as seed money, while the Patan Municipality and Patan Tourism
Development Organization will also contribute to the project.
</P>
<P>
Patan is an ancient city about 5 km southeast of Kathmandu.
Full of Buddhist monuments and Hindu temples with fine bronze
gateways, guardian deities and wonderful carvings.
</P>
<P>
With the flourishing of commerce and business, the city, known
as the City of Artists, is losing its traditional look and style
if no action is taken to protect it.

<HEADLINE> Income Tax Bill to Be Tabled in Nepali Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We will accommodate the justified suggestions and present the
final draft to the Finance Ministry, which will then be tabled in
the parliament for approval," Vidyadhar Mallik, Director General
of the department, told the press Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mallik said the first draft of the bill has already been
prepared and has proposed a number of tax initiatives with the aim
to bring all types of earnings into tax net.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings, dividend, pension, foreign earnings and
capital gains are the major areas which the government wants to
cover under the new act, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new act also attempts to bring cooperatives running banking
services, political parties, schools, non-governmental
organizations and all other profit-making activities under the tax
net.
</P>
<P>
Besides bringing these new areas into tax net, the new act will
serve as the main document for income tax provisions. Currently,
there are a number of acts that govern income tax provisions and
are contradictory to each other.
</P>
<P>
"After enactment of the act, it will work as the main law and
other laws related to income tax will be automatically nullified,"
Mallik said.

<HEADLINE> One Third of African Malaria Deaths Occur in Conflict-Hit Countries: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Up to 30 percent of the 960,000
malaria deaths in Africa every year occur in countries affected by
serious conflicts, wars or natural disasters, the World Health
Organization (WHO) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Malaria often kills more people in the aftermath of a conflict,
war or natural disaster than those killed during the actual
emergency, according to the global Roll Back Malaria campaign
sponsored by WHO.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is serious, for example more people have died
of malaria in Sierra Leone during the last eight years of ongoing
conflict than from trauma injuries," said Richard Allan, WHO's
Complex Emergencies focal person for Roll Back Malaria.
</P>
<P>
"We must help people affected by complex emergencies to
maintain health when at risk of malaria. First, we have to improve
the global response. Today is the first time we have brought
together Roll Back Malaria partners to discuss how best to improve
activity in emergencies," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a number of organizations that work in emergency
situations gathered at WHO headquarters in Geneva to produce an
action plan to improve the malaria control response during and
following emergencies.
</P>
<P>
WHO and other partners in the global movement to roll back
malaria are now focusing more on the health needs of people
affected by complex emergencies. Greater attention to the impact
of malaria in malaria-endemic regions will prevent thousands of
unnecessary deaths and much suffering, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The Global Partnership to Roll Back Malaria aims to halve
malaria deaths in 10 years. Partners include national governments,
WHO, the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development Program, the
World Bank and bilateral development agencies.
</P>
<P>
Friday's conference aims to develop more effective partnerships
between partners in order to roll back malaria and, ultimately,
improve health in complex emergencies.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sets Conditions for Diplomatic Ties with Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will not establish diplomatic
ties with Armenia until the country ends the Nagorno-Karabakh
dispute with Azerbaijan and its campaign over the so-called "
Armenian genocide," Turkish Daily News Friday quoted a Turkish
diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Four Armenians, invited to attend a meeting on peace in Turkey's
eastern province of Kars by a group of businessmen, were reportedly
deported two days ago from Turkey on the grounds that they were not
officially invited.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has not diplomatically recognized Armenia, a newly
independent neighboring country in Caucasus following the collapse
of the former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Turkey demands Christian Armenia to solve its territory dispute
with Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan peacefully, and to end its campaign
concerning the so-called genocide against Turks all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Armenia claimed Turkey had committed massive killing of
Armenians in April 1915 while the country was still under Ottoman
rule, pressing for a condemnation bill against Ankara concerning
this historical atrocity.
</P>
<P>
Turkey denied the so-called "Armenian genocide."
</P>
<P>
Also, Ankara insisted the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh, now
controlled by Armenia, belongs to Muslim Azerbaijan, Turkey's close
ally in Caucasus, urging Armenia to end the 12-year conflict which
has claimed 35,000 lives on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Indian Economy Slows Down in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the revised estimates of the Annual National
Income released by Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) Friday,
the upward revision in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth
rate for 1999-2000 was mainly due to the recovery in the
manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
The revised growth rate in the manufacturing sector stood at 8.
5 percent during 1999-2000 compared to 7 percent estimated earlier.
In 1998-99, the manufacturing sector had posted a growth rate of 3.
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the GDP growth rate in 1999-2000 to 6.4 percent
from 6.8 percent in 1998-1999 was mainly due to the poor
performance in the agricultural sector, where the growth declined
to 1.3 percent from 7.2 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- One person died and more than 85
were infected by Kala-azar in Sarlahi district in southern Nepal
bordering India, a report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Many people have fled the district due to the fast spread of
the disease and lack of ample medical assistance since its
outbreak a few days ago, The Kathmandu Post said.
</P>
<P>
"At least 85 cases of Kala-azar have been traced in seven
villages of the district till date, but the actual figure must be
much higher as many have fled the district," Senior Health Officer
Raj Singh was quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The district hospital can not accommodate the increasing number
of patients due to limited facilities and resources. However, the
Public Health Section of the district has been using germicides at
the villages affected to control the epidemic, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
Kala-azar, a virulent infectious malarial disease of oriental
tropics, is one of the common diseases in Nepal that takes a toll
of at least several hundred people every year.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Medicine Gains Popularity in World Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mei's group has exported four new products to the United States
and set up a Tibetan Medicine branch in Japan. The group recently
opened up a Tibetan medicine website which receives numerous daily
visits from Tibetan medicine lovers and medical experts in and out
of China.
</P>
<P>
Richard Blooms, a well-known American entrepreneur, will sign
a contract with the Jinhe Group later this year for developing new
Tibetan medicine after a two-year investigation and negotiations
with the Chinese counterpart. All products will be exported to the
United States, Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has 21 Tibetan medicine factories, which produce 360
types of drugs. The Cheevheng pain-killer plaster, made by the
Qizheng Tibetan Medicine Group, won the grand prize at the 26th
International Exhibition of Inventions held in Geneva in 1998.
Tibetan Rhodiolao, a new type of tonic which is good for brain and
able to control cancer spreading, now has a ready market in the
United States, Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The magical effect of Tibetan medicine has aroused great
concern of medical research institutes all over the world. The
main book on Tibetan medicine, titled "Gyushi" or "The Four
Medical Codices," which contains classification of various
diseases, physiology, pathology, treatment and prescriptions, has
been translated into English, French, German and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that more than 20 countries and
regions have set up Tibetan medicine research institutions staffed
with 3,000 researchers. Four symposiums on Tibetan medicine have
so far been held abroad.
</P>
<P>
Some professors at the Tokyo University and the Medical
University of Toyama will head for Qinghai in the near future to
probe the possibility of bilateral cooperation in the development
of Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shiping, a Chinese Tibetan medicine expert, attributed
the growing world-wide demand for Tibetan medicine to its
effectiveness in curing allergic, collagen and immune system
diseases, free from pollution and easy to take.

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Nip Counterfeiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China is urged to firmly crack
down on counterfeiting of brand products in order to protect
investment sentiment of the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
The Development Research Center (DRC) under the State Council
said in a report released here today that total value of
counterfeiting goods was estimated at more than 130 billion yuan (
16 billion US dollars) in the country in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report was compiled on the basis of a nation-wide survey
that DRC conducted on 146 Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises
in the country earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference sponsored by the Quality Brands
Protection Committee under the China Association of Enterprises
with Foreign Investment, Zhang Xiaoji from DRC said that
counterfeiting caused over 18 billion yuan worth of losses of
taxation to the government.
</P>
<P>
According to the DRC report, about 80 percent of the companies
surveyed say that counterfeiting has had negative effect on their
re-investment. Nearly one-third of the foreign-funded enterprises
surveyed say that discouraging investment is the major impact that
counterfeiting has on the companies.
</P>
<P>
The report said that counterfeiting eroded 10 million yuan in
average of the profits of every company surveyed every year. It
pointed out that counterfeiting will exacerbate slowdown of
corporate investment that has weighed down the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, extremely high profits of
counterfeiting, slack law enforcement, inadequate punishment and
poor sense of law obedience have combined to complicate the fight
against counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
The report called for the Chinese government to impose much
greater punishment over counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
It also called for governments at all levels to make
coordinated efforts to deal with severe infringement on brand
names. It called for the government to discipline officials who
tolerate, cover up or involve directly in counterfeiting
activities according to administrative regulations and laws.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Annuls Prisoner Categorization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Nepal has
annulled the process of categorizing prisoners and treating them
according to their social status, The Kathmandu Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The court made the decision on Thursday, citing that
categorization clashed with the constitutional provision of equal
rights, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners in Nepal were so far categorized into "A-class" and"B-
class" depending upon their educational qualification as well as
their living standard. The daily allowance along with other
facilities such as food and clothes varies with the class they
were categorized into.
</P>
<P>
Two advocates had filed a petition in 1996 to cancel the
categorization process, claiming that it favored inequality.
</P>
<P>
The Law and Justice Committee of Nepal proposed to annul the
process of prisoner categorization during the last session of the
parliament in March.

LUSAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is currently spending over

service the debt is dependent on what the country exports, while
debt servicing consumes sixteen percent of export earnings.

He added that due to the debt servicing burden, the government
considers the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program as a
welcome arrangement for debt relief.

million U.S. dollars in energy aid to provide oil to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>

Under a 1994 agreement, the United States, Japan and South

nuclear reactors and heavy fuel oil in exchange for the DPRK's
promise to freeze its nuclear development program. Clinton said in
a certification Thursday that the DPRK appeared to be living up to
its commitment to freeze its nuclear weapons program. Under U.S.

Klestil considered the EU decision a possible start to lift the
political embargo, but he was disappointed that the EU did not
indicate an end to the sanction nor propose a timetable when it
planned to evaluate the situation in Austria, said the statement.
The EU decision mandates Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres to ask the European Court of Human Rights to appoint a
three-member panel to conduct a thorough review of the political
situation in Austria and draw up a report. Portugal is holding the
rotating EU presidency. (Austria-EU-Disappointment)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday he was
still uncertain whether it is the right time for him to have a
summit with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to hammer out a final
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to do whatever I can in the time I have left to
help them (Israelis and Palestinians) make peace but whatever I do
or don't do will be based on my calculation that it will maximize
the possibility of... ultimate success," Clinton said. Asked if he
expected to make a decision on whether to invite Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to
come to the United States for summit in the next day or two,
Clinton replied: "No." (US-Clinton-Middle East)

BERLIN -- Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was under
investigation by a parliamentary panel on campaign finance scandal,
rejected all charges against him Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the panel, Kohl refused to disclose the name of
those who provided 2 million marks to his Christian Democrats
party during 1993 to 1998. Kohl said he knew little about his
party's finance system and had no knowledge about the party's
alleged secret accounts in Swiss banks. Last December, Kohl
admitted that he received up to 2 million marks as undeclared
party donations and ran secret bank accounts in 1990s, offending
Germany's Party Funding Law. (Kohl-Testimony)

<HEADLINE> Breaking Barriers: China's "Nationalization" Drive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUJIAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- It is a hard nut to crack: before
China can embrace globalization it must first achieve "
nationalization".
</P>
<P>
This means that China must first eliminate the numerous trade
barriers erected between provinces and cities. "Eliminating local
protectionism" has become one of the more popular slogans for this
year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese premier Zhu Rongji has urged that the elimination of
local protectionism and unfair competition should be on the
government's agenda, so as to build a united national market.
</P>
<P>
To do business in this vast land, a businessman must be patient
and deal with numerous local standards, regulations, and customs --
some are just nonsense, and varies from city to city, county to
county, and village to village.
</P>
<P>
"In a country without a united market, the biggest headache is
to sell our products from one city to another," said an executive
with a foreign-invested automobile company in Shanghai, who was
reluctant to give his name.
</P>
<P>
He said that their cars sold well in the south, but they are
blocked from entry into some northern markets.
</P>
<P>
Envious of the company's big investment in the south, and fears
that it would threaten local automobile makers, officials refused
to grant license plates to cars the company was trying to sell in
the north, said the executive.
</P>
<P>
Blocked goods include everything, ranging from cars to
construction materials, fertilizer to instant noodle, and beer.
Even satellite television programs are blocked.
</P>
<P>
Many people call it "vassal separatism" which has been common
throughout Chinese history with warlords and princes setting up
regimes of own, and issuing their own orders.
</P>
<P>
Some people believe that China's economic "nationalization"
began in the Qin Dynasty 2,000 years ago, when Emperor Qinshihuang
united the country, and united currencies and units of measurement.
However, because of the lack of market game rules, the drive to
build a united national market has yet to be concluded.

Economists say that China's internal trade barriers could bury
the achievements brought by its entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot unite internal standards, how can we adhere to
international norms?" asked Wang Tongsan, an economist with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"If local protectionism remains, foreign investors will get
scared, and market competition, which is the basis for the
economic development, will disappear," said Huang Qifan, director
of the Shanghai Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
As China progresses toward entry into the WTO, how to eliminate
these barriers became a hotly debated issue at the annual session
of the National People's Congress in March.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from Shanghai proposed a motion to enact China's first
anti-monopoly law. The motion denounced regional protectionism
and trade barriers, and asked that the prohibition of
administrative monopoly be defined in the first article of the
proposed law.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongfu, the director of the State Administration for
Industry and Commerce, pointed out that administrative monopolies,
forced deals, and market blockades have become a cancer in China's
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
He said that his administration started a nationwide campaign
this year to fight local protectionism and maintain fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
China this year has approved the legislation law, or the law on
law-making, which many people believed will help solve confusion
arising from conflicting laws and regulations made by local
governments, and help build a united market.
</P>
<P>
Some key cities, especially those in the coastal region, have
taken measures to remove this tumor.
</P>
<P>
At the recent China Mayor Forum held in Fujian, Fuzhou city
announced a bold policy that it will help foreign invested
companies sell goods in the city, despite which place the company
locate its headquarters in.
</P>
<P>
"Opening a wider door will benefit us in a long run," said Liu
Yongzhao, vice mayor of Fuzhou. "More people will come to see our
city and find out a good business environment."
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, the largest industrial city in the west, has decided
early this year to abolish a time-honored policy which demanded
that cars made by other provinces would be levied upon additional
fees before they were sold in the city.
</P>
<P>
The decision will make Chongqing lose tens of millions of yuan,
however, it will force local auto makers to learn how to dance
with stronger competitors, said Wang Hongju, Chongqing's vice
mayor.
</P>
<P>
"It is a live-or-die question. The mission is not easy, but we
have no choice," said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Medicine Gains Popularity in World Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Tibet, known as the "roof of the
world," will attract global attention next month with the 2000
International Symposium on Tibetan Medicine to be held in the
capital city of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 experts on Tibetan medicine will be in the city
July 15-17 to discuss the development of Tibetan medicine and
search for ways to preserve this unique, ancient system of medical
treatment in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will be the first of its kind ever held in the
homeland of Tibetan medicine, demonstrating that Tibetan medicine
has won the recognition of people around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine, with a history of more than 2,500 years, has
been used by Tibetan people for years to ward off diseases of
various kinds. Tibetan medicine is used to treat arthritis,
gastritis, gastric ulcers and altitude sickness.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai-Tibet plateau has 2,100 kinds of herbs, 150 species
of animal and 40 types of minerals which can be used as
ingredients in Tibetan medicine. Over 50 pharmaceutical factories
specializing in Tibetan medicine have been built in Tibet, Qinghai,
Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan provinces with a combined annual output
value of 400 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A British tourist, surnamed Jennings, who has been traveling in
Tibet, said that before she left the plateau, she had visited a
Tibetan doctor, took a medicated bath and bought a large quantity
of Tibetan medicine to take home.
</P>
<P>
"I want my family members and friends to experience the magical
medicine with me," she said.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners don't need to travel all the way to Tibet for
medical treatment or to buy medicine, because China has opened
Tibetan medicine centers in north America, Europe and southeast
Asia, said Mei Xuedai, an official of the Jinhe Tibetan Medicine
Company in Qinghai Province.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Cultural Charm Revives Hunting Skill (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The skill has been a pride of the Jins for several generations.
Only one man of a generation could be taught with the secret
hunting skill of the family which has lived off hunting for
hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
Once regarded as a fearless and skilled hunter by his fellow
villagers, 69-year-old Jin gave up hunting some 20 years ago
because he saw the population of wild animals in the area
decreasing. Then a stroke in 1997 left him partially paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
"I have no family members who are hunters now," Jin said. "It
is a pity if our ancestral skill got lost in my generation."
</P>
<P>
Gazing at his shotgun hanging on the wall, Jin Xuetian is lost
in a cloud of memories as he lies motionless on his adobe bed.
</P>
<P>
Jin, now bedridden, is the 11th generation of the hunters'
family who has lived at Mount Changbai since the late 14th Century,
and gained acclaim for their abilities to understand the languages
of birds and animals.
</P>
<P>
Out in the wild, the Jins "talked" to birds and beasts by
imitating their sounds and voices. Jins always caught more animals
than other hunters, and often shared their bounty with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Jin's father selected the eager teenager from five sons and
daughters to learn the family's secret hunting skill. By blowing
on a leaf between his lips, Jin could produce up to 20 different
animal voices.
</P>
<P>
He seldom returned from a hunt empty-handed, often capturing
deer, boars, and bears. His legendary exploits include killing
seven wild boars in a single day, and several narrow escapes from
ferocious tigers.
</P>
<P>
Shisidaogou Township, Jin's home in northeast China's Jilin
Province, is close to Mount Changbai, which stretches southeast
into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, tens of thousands of hunters still
inhabited the area where their ancestors had lived off hunting for
thousands of years.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1970s the provincial government banned hunting in some
parts of Mount Changbai, a national nature reserve known for the
most diversified species in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Jin and thousands of other hunters had to move from the forests.
He became a farmer, learning to work the land with strong hands
unfamiliar with anything but the barrel of a gun.
</P>
<P>
He and his three children planted crops, fruit trees, and
medicinal herbs to make a living.
</P>
<P>
But Jin misses the forest. Back when he was able, he trekked
through the woods imitating voices of birds and animals. However
he never shot at them again but for soothing his nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
What makes him sad now is not that he couldn't hunt but he
could not speak clearly due to stroke, meaning he could not pass
on the secret skill.
</P>
<P>
Jin used to have three volumes of journals, passed down from
his ancestors, which detailed each hunting expedition of the
family, as well as the "meanings" of various bird chirps and
animal howls, and hunters' wiles. The journals were titled "Happy"
because the hunters were always happy when they returned home with
full hands.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the three volumes were burned during the Cultural
Revolution (1966-76).
</P>
<P>
Jin's story has captured the attention of a number of noted
scholars, including Cao Baoming, a world-renowned Chinese folklore
expert. At the request of the expert, Jin once performed his
family skill by making a kind of noise. And just in a while a
group of squirrels rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Cao has interviewed Jin several times, trying to recapture the
content of "Happy" by encouraging Jin to recall the details from
his memory.
</P>
<P>
"The books on hunting are an essential record of human beings'
fight for survival," Cao said. "They provide real scientific
meaning and rich cultural resources. We should not only protect
the endangered wildlife but also developing the endangered hunting
culture."
</P>
<P>
The folklorist and the hunter share the same hope that Jin
would recover one day so that he could teach people the skill only
he himself knows, with purposes other than hunting.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Starts Runoff Election for Majlis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's capital Tehran started a
runoff election for the sixth Majlis (parliament) Friday morning,
with four candidates running for two seats in the 290-member
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The vote casting in some 2,124 ballot boxes in the constituency
started at 0900 local time (0430 GMT) and will last at least 10
hours. The result is to be announced within a maximum of 24 hours
after the end of the polling, the Election Headquarters at the
Interior Ministry has announced.
</P>
<P>
Among the four candidates is prominent reformist figure Ali
Akbar Mohtashamipur, publisher of the popular Persian-language
daily "Bayan" (Expression) which was closed by the conservative
judiciary just days ahead of the runoff election.
</P>
<P>
Mohtashamipur, a presidential advisor and former interior
minister, has also been summoned by the special clerical court, but
he has refused to appear before the court, saying the guideline
of "Bayan" is to help national reforms advocated by President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Iran's first-round parliamentary election was held on February
18, which resulted in a landslide victory of reformers over their
conservative rivals. A runoff election in constituencies except
Tehran was held on May 5, in which the conservatives also suffered
a severe defeat.
</P>
<P>
Tehran constituency, the political center of the country, has a
share of 30 seats in the 290-member parliament. In the first-round
election, some 29 of the 30 seats were won by reformers.
</P>
<P>
But the powerful Guardians Council (GC), conservative supervisor
of the election, confirmed only 28 of the winners' list after a
three-month delay, ordering a runoff for the other two winners.
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 winners approved, only two were conservative figures,
including former president and Majlis speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.
The two were believed to have entered the parliament with help from
the GC.
</P>
<P>
But under pressure from reformers, Rafsanjani, currently heading
the arbitral State Expediency Council, has announced he will not
take his seat in the Majlis, leaving a vacancy to be filled through
a by-election.
</P>
<P>
After severe struggles with the conservative establishment, the
new Majlis, dominated by reformers, managed to start work on May
27.
</P>
<P>
But a number of seats are still vacant due to the delay of
Tehran election results and the GC's annulling of votes. The
conservative body is said to have annulled first-round and runoff
election results in 10 constituencies, involving 12 candidates all
belonging to the reformist camp.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright returned to
Washington Thursday and briefed U.S. President Bill Clinton on her
discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Despite assessments from officials on all sides that it is still
premature to hold a three-way summit, Clinton is expected to
announce in the coming days when he will convene one, possibly on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Albright's failure to bring the two sides together prompted
renewed warnings about bloodshed if a peace treaty is not reached
by the September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- For the second time in a week, official sources in Damascus
were quoted Thursday as saying talks with Israel could resume in
August.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the resumption is conditional on
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's acknowledgement that Syrian
President-designate Bashar al-Assad will stand firm on Syria's
territorial demands, "especially on the return of Syria to the
northern shore of the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee)."
</P>
<P>
However, the sources added "the question of water will remain
open for discussion."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli Council of Chief Rabbinate will meet on Monday
following an appeal from rabbis and political figures to relax an
accepted ruling that prohibits Jews from entering the Temple Mount
in the old city of Jerusalem for reasons related to "impurity" in
the Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
Following reports on a forthcoming agreement concerning the
Temple Mount, and amid possibilities that the Palestinian National
Authority will get formal control, the political right has stepped
up pressure on the chief rabbis to change their ruling.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Iranian revolutionary court in Shiraz is due to hand down
sentences Saturday to the 13 Iranian Jews charged with spying for
Israel since the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The last hearing in the two-month trial was held last weekend.
It ended with eight suspects confessing, four denying charges, and
one admitting that he had collected military information for
Israeli's Mossad intelligence service, but denied he ever gave it
to them.
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest of the 13 Jews, along with eight Muslims, on
the espionage charges, Israel and other western countries have been
pressuring Iran to free the defendants. Meanwhile, Iranian
officials have been making various, sometimes contradictory,
statements about the Jews on trial.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Expects Increased Value of Wood Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The value of exported wood
products of New Zealand is expected to increase by more than 50
percent during the next four years as volumes continue to increase
from more forests coming into production.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest forecast report issued by the New
Zealand Agriculture and Forestry Ministry, the recovery of the
Republic of Korea, which is a main importer of New Zealand wood
products, has been stronger than anticipated, with increased
activity from consumption rather than log-stock replenishment.
</P>
<P>
It also predicts an increasing potential to lift log sales to
the United states.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese market for New Zealand logs, it said, could see a
significant growth as well.
</P>
<P>
"High transport costs for Russian logs into South China will
make New Zealand logs more competitive in that region, but the
potential in China would remain a marketing challenge," the
ministry said in the report.
</P>
<P>
The forecast shows that prices for logs will plateau in the
next and the following years and then hold steady because of
increased supply.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's forest products are important earners of overseas
funds.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics for 1997, New Zealand exports of forest
products were valued at about 2.4 billion NZ dollars (1.13 billion
U.S. dollars). Japan, Australia and the Republic of Korea are the
main buyers.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Business Confidence Level Lowest Since 1987 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand crashed to crisis levels this month, slumping to lows not
seen since the 1987 sharemarket crash, according to the latest
survey of the country's National Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank's monthly business confidence survey showed that
confidence has now suffered its two biggest falls in consecutive
months in the 12 years of the surveys, falling a further 35 points
to a net 56 percent of respondents expecting general business
conditions to deteriorate during the next year. Pessimists
accounted for 64 percent of replies in June and optimists just for
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Two consecutive months of precipitous falls constitute a
crisis in confidence," the Dominion newspaper Friday quoted
National Bank Chief Economist Brendon O'Donovan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tony Alexander, chief economist of the Bank of New Zealand, was
quoted by the Wellington-based newspaper as saying that business
feels ignored by the government and the confidence figures can be
interpreted as "business sending a message to the government."
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said Friday in a
government press release that the erosion in business confidence
has been serious, but the mood "is turning around."

<HEADLINE> NZ Still Hopes Hostages in Fiji to Be Freed Unharmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Foreign Minister
Phil Goff said here Friday he still hopes the 27 Fiji's hostages
will eventually be freed unharmed, according to the Wellington-
based Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
Goff made the remarks in view of the latest development in Fiji
where hostage crisis is intensifying as the Fijian Army cuts
access to the Fijian Parliament, raising concerns that a military
strike on the rebel stronghold is imminent.
</P>
<P>
If the Army takes action, it is likely that hostages including
deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry will be killed, the New
Zealand foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said he fears a complete breakdown in civil order if the
hostages are injured and violence breaks out across the nation,
collapsing the Fijian economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are not at that point yet and that point could still be
avoided," Goff said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Files Charges Against "Love Bug" Creator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has filed
criminal charges against a computer science student suspected of
spreading the "Love Bug" virus that crippled millions of computer
systems worldwide, The Philippine Star said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the National Bureau of
Investigation(NBI) charged 23-year-old Onel de Guzman Thursday
with credit card fraud in a case hampered by a lack of laws
covering computers.
</P>
<P>
The virus, unleashed on May 4, rapidly replicated itself via e-
mail, overloading corporate e-mail systems in many countries and
causing damage estimated at up to 10 billion U.S. dollars, mainly
in lost man-hours.
</P>
<P>
Until Philippine President Joseph Estrada signed a new law on
June 14 covering electronic commerce and computer hacking, the
country had no legislation specifically for computer crimes.
</P>
<P>
However, the new law can not be applied retroactively to the "
Love Bug" creator and investigators will instead charge de Guzman
with"traditional" crimes such as theft as well as violation of a
law which normally covers credit fraud.
</P>
<P>
The charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, NBI
Director Federico Opinion said.
</P>
<P>
De Guzman, a former student of the AMA Computer College, has
acknowledged that he might have released the virus by accident,
but refused to say whether he authored it.
</P>
<P>
He failed to graduate earlier this year after AMA professors
rejected his thesis proposal for a program which steals Internet
passwords, a feature of the Love Bug virus.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice will now determine whether the NBI's
evidence against de Guzman is strong enough to warrant a trial.
</P>
<P>
NBI agents seized 17 computer diskettes, telephones and
computer accessories in a raid on May 8 on the suspect's apartment
in Manila, but found no computer or modem.

BERN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Adolf Ogi, president of the Federal

Thursday on bilateral relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting here, Wen expressed welcome to Ogi's
another visit to China scheduled for September to attend a
ceremony celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier said that the Chinese government
attaches importance to developing full and friendly cooperation
with Switzerland. The two countries shared the same or similar
views on various international issues.

<P>
He said that Switzerland was among the first batch of European
countries that had recognized the People's Republic of China and
there has been no conflict of interests between the two countries
in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is a developed country with advanced technology and
abundant capital. Wen said China is carrying out further reforms,
and that his country expects Switzerland to expand its trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier said that so far only Switzerland and
two other countries have not yet reached agreements with China on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), and he
hopes Switzerland could conclude such an accord as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ogi reaffirmed his government's supportive stand
on China's bid for the WTO and said that with their concerted
efforts, there must be a way out for both sides to complete the
negotiations at an earlier date.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday he was still uncertain whether it is the right time
for him to have a summit with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to
hammer out a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to do whatever I can in the time I have left to
help them (Israelis and Palestinians) make peace but whatever I do
or don't do will be based on my calculation that it will maximize
the possibility of... ultimate success," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he expected to make a decision on whether to invite
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat to come to the United States for summit in the next day or
two, Clinton replied: "No."
</P>
<P>
He said he was waiting for a report Thursday from U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was returning to
Washington after a two-day trip to the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Albright was there to assess whether the differences between
the Israelis and Palestinians have been narrowed enough for a
three-way summit in the next few weeks to help hammer out a final
settlement before the September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Albright was sent to the region after the latest round of
Israeli-Palestinian talks resumed earlier this month in Washington
failed to pave the way for a summit between Clinton, Barak and
Arafat.

<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
rejected a resolution by the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC)urging Manila to stop military operations against
Muslim rebels in Mindanao, Philippine Daily Inquirer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Press Secretary Ricardo Puno as saying
Thursday that the government would not accede to the request as it
was only carrying out "peace and order operations" and not "real
offensive operation" in some areas in Mindanao.

<P>
"This is an independent country. We have to move in accordance
with our own prerogative and in accordance with the requirements
that confront us whenever it is a question of keeping this country
together," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
The military earlier admitted to launching an all-out war
against the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Central
Mindanao,resulting in the capture of most of the rebel group's

<P>
The conflict is one of the major issues before the OIC, which
brokered a peace agreement between the government and the
mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The OIC, which is holding a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
has also resolved to send a fact-finding team to Mindanao to
assess rival claims by the government and the MNLF which made
peace four years ago in exchange for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government expressed welcome to the fact-finding
mission,pointing out that the OIC resolution was passed with the
Philippine government's concurrence.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to hide so it will be better for them to
discover the real situation, to see for themselves," Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
The team is likely to include representatives from the OIC's
six-nation committee which has been dealing with the insurgency in
Mindanao. The members of the committee are Saudi Arabia, Libya,
Bangladesh, Somalia, Senegal and Indonesia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Thursday
released 20 million U.S. dollars in energy aid to provide oil to
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Under a 1994 agreement, the United States, Japan and South
Korea founded a group to supply the DPRK with two light-water
nuclear reactors and heavy fuel oil in exchange for the DPRK's
promise to freeze its nuclear development program.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in a certification Thursday that the DPRK appeared
to be living up to its commitment to freeze its nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. law, Clinton must certify that the DPRK has
terminated its nuclear weapons program before he moves to release
such funds.

<HEADLINE> Austria Disappointed at EU Decision on Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas Klestil
was disappointed at the European Union's decision Thursday to
maintain political sanction against his country, a presidential
statement said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Klestil considered the EU decision a possible start to lift the
political embargo, but he was disappointed that the EU did not
indicate an end to the sanction nor propose a timetable when it
planned to evaluate the situation in Austria, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision mandates Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres to ask the European Court of Human Rights to appoint a
three-member panel to conduct a thorough review of the political
situation in Austria and draw up a report.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, who holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a
statement that the EU member states will re-examine their
relations with Austria on the basis of the panel report.
</P>
<P>
In another communique released the same day, Portugal said that
the political isolation against Austria remains in force.
</P>
<P>
Klestil asked the Austrian government to treat the EU statement
in a constructive manner with the emphasis on making maximum
efforts to safeguard its interests inside the EU.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel criticized the EU
decision at a news conference on Thursday, but said that Austrian
government will cooperate with the three-member panel.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a political sanction on Austria on February 4
when the far-right Freedom Party was admitted into the Austrian
coalition government.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Russia
plan to hold a joint theater missile defense exercise based on
computer simulation in Texas late this year, the Pentagon said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters
that the computer simulation exercise was planned for Fort Bliss,
Texas, in November or December.
</P>
<P>
As to the talks between U.S. and Russian defense officials in
Moscow on Tuesday and Wednesday, Bacon said the two sides did not
resolve a dispute over the U.S. plan to deploy a national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
"They have not changed their opposition, and we have not
changed our determination to go forward," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan to deploy missile defense system violates the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the U.S. and former Soviet
Union in 1972. Russia has so far refused to revise the treaty to
accommodate the U.S. move.

NANJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China is building a park in the
Zhongshan Mountain in the city of Nanjing to protect the tombs of
a 14th century prince.

<HEADLINE> Cartoon Production Booming in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai animated cartoons
production has entered a flourishing period -- the city will be
able to make 5,000 minutes of cartoon this year, compared with 300
minutes six years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Magic Lotus Lantern" made by Shanghai Animated Film Studio
was a huge hit last year and has been warmly welcomed by audience
in Thailand, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Other cartoons, including "Gorilla Detective," "Princess White
Snow and Prince Frog," and "Travel to the Moon," are also very
popular among children.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the studio came from hard work and the
studio's efforts to change its operation system and tap into the
market.
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, the studio experienced a hard time because of
poor operating systems. Many talented people also left the studio.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the studio raised funds and shot a 100-part cartoon
about a group of heroic children fighting evil. The cartoon was
well received and praised by government leaders, boosting the
morale of directors at the studio.
</P>
<P>
A year later, the studio started to work with the Shanghai
Television Station. The station invested 49 million yuan (about
590 US dollars) to support the studio make cartoons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the studio set up an animated film and TV group
company. The company is making new cartoons, such as "I am Crazy
About Songs," "White Pigeon Island," and "Little Monks."
</P>
<P>
A movie-length cartoon, "The Magic Umbrella of Coco," will be
shown in cinemas during the summer holiday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Six-time Wimbledon champion Pete

ankle revealed a strained tendon but no structural damage
following his win over Karol Kucera from Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Sampras'coach Paul Annacone said the player will continue to

fellow American Justin Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
ATP Tour trainer Doug Spreen said: "Pete Sampras underwent an
MRI scan last night and it confirmed acute tendinitis in his left
foot."
</P>
<P>
"Pete has already received treatment and will receive further
treatment later on Thursday. This treatment involves icing,
electrical stimulation and anti-inflammatory medication. He will
rest on Thursday," he said. "We will re-evaluate the situation on
Friday but Pete fully expects to play."

WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua)-- Goalkeeper Adin Brown of
Colorado Rapids, expected to start for the U.S. Olympic team in
Sydney, will have surgery on Friday on his injured right knee and
is expected to miss 14-21 days.
</P>
<P>
"It was uncomfortable, and something I felt had to get done,"
Brown said Thursday. "I thought it was going to go away, but it
wound up getting worse and worse."
</P>
<P>
Club trainer Jay Mellette said Brown will have arthroscopic
surgery to clean out the right meniscus, the second time his right
knee has required this procedure.
</P>
<P>
However, the surgery was not done to accommodate the goalie's
need to be ready when the U.S. Olympic team departs for Sydney in
September.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Lindsay
Davenport of the United States came back from the brink to keep
her grip on the Wimbledon title in a Court One classic on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But third seed and reigning French Open champion Mary Pierce
was not so lucky as she crashed out in straight sets to Spain's
Magui Serna.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, 24, was a double break down in the final set to
Russian Elena Likhovtseva before rallying to complete an
extraordinary 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 win.
</P>
<P>
She was left reeling by Likhovtseva's lightning start, when she
broke Davenport twice to lead 4-0 and had two break points for 5-0.
</P>
<P>
And Davenport, playing only her sixth match since April after
being plagued by a back injury, admitted afterwards: "I got lucky.
"
</P>
<P>
The world number two struggled with her serve as she was broken
five times and had no answer to Likhovtseva's cracking returns and
passing shots.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning the second set after breaking her opponent
twice, Davenport seemed to have thrown it all away when she was
broken in the first and third sets of the final set.
</P>
<P>
Only then did her game finally click into gear and she blazed
through the final six sets to snatch victory.
</P>
<P>
She admitted: "For some reason I'm getting off to really slow
starts. But when I got broken again for 3-0 I started to hit my
shots a little bit better. Those last six games I was hitting the
ball great."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pierce could not find top gear against her 21-year-
old opponent, ranked 49th in the world.
</P>
<P>
Serna held her nerve admirably to triumph in two consecutive
tie-breaks and blow open the bottom half of the draw even more
following the earlier exit of 12th seed Amanda Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
The South African slipped to a 7-6, 6-2 defeat at the hands of
American Lilia Osterloh.
</P>
<P>
But Monica Seles breezed past Belgian Els Callens 6-4, 6-4 to
book her place in the third round.
</P>
<P>
And the sixth seed admitted she was driven by the thought of
adding to her nine major titles and completing a grand slam of the
Grand Slams.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to do well here," said Seles, whose straight sets
thrashing by Steffi Graf in the 1992 final remains the closest she
has got to the title.
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge every year that I keep facing. I love coming
back here. I love the surroundings. I just wish the surface suited
my game more. Besides that, I love the place," she said.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov, Pierce Crashed at Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- French Open champion Mary Pierce
and Yevgeny Kafelnikov both joined the unlucky seeds on Thursday
when they were crashed at the Wimbledon tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, seeded third, lost in the second round 7-6, 7-6 to
Spain's Magui Serna while men's fifth seed Kafelnikov was beaten
by Sweden's Thomas Johansson 6-1, 7-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
There are now just seven seeded players left in both the men's
and women's draws after a disastrous first four days for the sport
's leading players.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Lindsay Davenport and Pete Sampras narrowly
avoided the carnage.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, seeded second, had to scramble back from 0-3 and a
double break down in the final set to squeeze past Russia's Elena
Likhovtseva 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, injured during a second round match against Karol
Kucera on Wednesday, said he fully expected to play against Justin
Gimelstob in the third round on Friday despite a hospital scan
revealing he had acute tendinitis in his left leg.
</P>
<P>
15th seed Safin of Russia joined his friend Kafelnikov on the
sidelines, losing to Czech Martin Damm 7-5, 7-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Safin was handed a warning for ball abuse and flirted with
another after smashing his raquet on the floor. But despite all
his yelling, the 20-year-old lost to the more consistent player.
</P>
<P>
Twelfth seed Pat Rafter made no such mistake. The dual U.S.Open
champion bulldozed fellow Australian Todd Woodbridge 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed and French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten crushed
qualifier Justin Bower 6-4, 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Tim Henman beat France's Arnaud Clement 6-4, 6-4,6-
4 in a workmanlike performance on Center Court to take his place
in the last 32 in the extremely competitive bottom half of the
draw.
</P>
<P>
In the women's draw, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Monica Seles
booked their third round spots.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Sanchez-Vicario swept aside Rita Grande of Italy 6-3,
6-1 and sixth seed Seles had little trouble beating Els Callens of
Belgium 6-4, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Team Worth 100 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The market value of Romania's
national soccer squad is over 100 million U.S. dollars, the local
weekly Capital reported in its latest issue citing experts in such
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said that while the clubs offer almost 4 million U.S.
dollars to the veteran internationals, they offer 10 million U.S.
dollars to the younger players.
</P>
<P>
Defender Cristian Chivu registered the biggest market value,
being sold by the Craiova University to Ajax Amsterdam for 3
million U.S. dollars in 1999. Now, after his remarkable play with
the Euro 2000, Chivu's market value increased four times.
</P>
<P>
The best transfer amounts of money go with Chivu - 12 million U.
S. dollars, Adrian Ilie, Cosmin Contra and Constantin Galca - 10
million U.S. dollars each, followed by Viorel Moldovan and Iulian
Filipescu - 7 million U.S. dollars each and Ionel Ganea - 6
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The weekly also read that a qualification campaign for an
international championship costs about 1.7 million U.S. dollars in
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Romanian soccer players received an 80,000 dollar-bonus for the
Euro 2000 qualification, the bonus value decreasing in accordance
with each player.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly Capital, if Romania were the Euro 2000
winner, each player would have received 180,000 U.S.dollars.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Martin Match Halted Overnight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The match between second seed Andre
Agassi and Todd Martin was halted on Thursday by bad light at
Wimbledon much to Agassi's relief.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, despite leading the second round match 6-4, 2-6, 7-6,
had just been broken in the opening game of the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
After more than two hours of hard-fought rallies, it began to
spit with rain. He called for Wimbledon referee Alan Mills and was
visibly upset when he was sent back on to the chilly center court
to play on.
</P>
<P>
After slipping on the damp grass when running for a forehand,
Agassi got his way and Mills called an end to play at 30-30 on
Martin's serve.
</P>
<P>
An overnight break will do the world of good for Agassi who
looked the less confident of the two Americans, and his trademark
early returns were rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
Play will resume on Friday.

<HEADLINE> FAO Chief in Iraq on Fact-finding Mission EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jacques Diouf,
arrived here Friday on a fact-finding visit.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to focus on the tragic accident that two staffers
of the FAO office in Baghdad were killed by a gunman Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, identified as 38-year-old Fuad Haidar, shot and
killed two FAO staffers -- a Somali and an Iraqi -- and wounded
several others.
</P>
<P>
Haidar, who surrendered to the authorities after a two-hour
confrontation with Iraqi security forces, claimed that his attack
was meant to protest the decade-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said he would meet Iraqi officials to get acquainted with
Wednesday's incident.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after arrival, the FAO chief went to the FAO office
building in central Baghdad and met the staff members there.
</P>
<P>
He also visited the wounded FAO staffers in the hospital and the
Karch cemetery in a Baghdad suburb where the slain Somali FAO
staffer, Yusuf Abdilleh, was buried.
</P>
<P>
Diouf would also meet Iraqi officials from the ministries of
agriculture and irrigation to discuss ways to better implement the
U.N. oil-for-food program, now in its eighth phase.
</P>
<P>
The FAO office in Iraq is mainly in charge of the implementation
of the oil-for-food deal, which allows Iraq to sell limited amount
of oil to buy humanitarian necessities to alleviate the crippling
impacts of the U.N. sanctions in place since Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Haidar, who is now held in the Jadria Police Bureau in
central Baghdad, told reporters Wednesday evening that he chose to
attack the FAO office because "there are many foreigners in this
organization."
</P>
<P>
He is likely to face the death penalty according to the Islamic
law.

<P>
Green described as positive the presence of 860 foreign
observers, most of them from the United States, who will watch
Sunday's presidential elections, but remarked that the process is
an internal and sovereign matter of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"This must not be construed as a theme that excludes or
sidetracks the decision that invited foreign personalities to
witness the cleanliness and transparency of the elections," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government expects local and foreign observers to
evaluate the effort of Mexicans "so everybody can give testimony
of the firm and resolute advance of democracy in the country,"
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The top Mexican diplomat added that her country has taken
decisive steps to guarantee the full transparency of what will be
the most competed elections in the history of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Almost 59 million Mexicans will elect Sunday a successor of the
incumbent President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
Ruling party candidate Francisco Labastida and right-wing
Vicente Fox are the candidates with the highest possibilities of
victory, according to the last polls.

<P>
Washington requested additional permits for the docking of
other 19 artillery-armed ships, just in case their assistance is
necessary in the antidrug patrolling.
</P>
<P>
The authorization for those tasks of surveillance and pursuit
of drug traffickers was approved Thursday night in a voting with

<HEADLINE> London Nailbomb Killer Jailed For Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A young British engineer who
carried out a 13-day reign of terror in London was jailed for life
on Friday for three murders.
</P>
<P>
David Copeland, 24, had admitted causing three explosions in
London, which killed three and injured 129.
</P>
<P>
He had denied murder, admitting manslaughter on the grounds of
diminished responsibility due to paranoid. But he faced a murder
trial after the prosecution refused to accept his plea.
</P>
<P>
The jury of four women and eight men decided he was not
suffering from diminished responsibility at the time of his
attacks, meaning he was guilty of all three murders.
</P>
<P>
Copeland showed no emotion as the verdict was read out in court.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who has heard the facts of this case will be appalled
and horrified at the atrocity of your crimes," Judge Michael Hyam
said after the sentence.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can excuse or justify the evil you have done and
certainly not the abhorrent views which you have embraced," he
said.
</P>
<P>
People in and outside the court, including victims injured in
Copeland's bomb attacks, cheered and clapped as the verdict was
read out.
</P>
<P>
Copeland's lawyer, Peter Silver, told reporters after the
verdict that it was unclear how his client was feeling.
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to say if he could recover from his condition,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Silva said his legal team had not yet decided whether to
challenge the conviction, but admitted there were "limited grounds
" for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
Copeland will be sent to a high security hospital to serve six
life sentences for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
The young engineer, who told police he carried out the attacks
because he wanted to start a "racial war", showed no emotion as
the verdict and the sentences were read out.
</P>
<P>
Copeland, who self-confessed that he hero-worshipped Hitler,
targeted London's ethnic and gay communities in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The crude bombs he built in his bedroom, its walls decked with
Nazi regalia, were packed with nails up to six inches (15
centimeters) long.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua called Friday here for surmounting the short-term vision
to achieve a stronger regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president expressed in the speech he delivered
during the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) Presidents Summit the
confidence that the member countries will surmount circumstantial
inconveniences and will advance in the key themes for the full
functioning of the customs union.
</P>
<P>
He said that the strengthening of the bloc's credibility will
contribute to diminishing the regional risks and promoting the
investments that will help reduce unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be redoubled to fulfill the commitments made in
the matter of elimination of non-tariff barriers, and to maintain
the full force of the common external tariff, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president stressed the need of working in the
instruments for the consolidation of "a united, real and genuine
market" and of coordinating the macroeconomic policies to relaunch
Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua, Mercosur's rotating president for the first semester
of the year, called for making bigger efforts to continue the
negotiations with the Andean Community with Mexico, with the Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and with the European Union to
establish a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
with Bolivia and Chile as associate members. The bloc is holding
its 18th summit meeting here.

<HEADLINE> Annan Highlights Movement's Role on International Day of Cooperatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The cooperative movement
can help ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared by
all, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Friday, the eve of the
International Day of Cooperatives marked each year on the first
Saturday in July.
</P>
<P>
"Founded on the principles of private initiative,
entrepreneurship and self-employment, underpinned by the values of
democracy, equality and solidarity, the movement can help pave the
way to a more just and inclusive economic order," the Secretary-
General said in his message on the Day.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in many countries, cooperatives have developed
into powerful and prosperous economical entities with extensive
organizational structure.
</P>
<P>
The most successful have grown into large-scale, professionally
run and solidly financed enterprises that operate in full
competition with commercial firms while emphasizing expertise that
enables people to help themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that cooperatives serve as an example to those who
would like to see the private sector get more involved in
development activities, he called for making greater use of the
tools that the cooperative movement offers towards the shared goal
of "a more just, more inclusive and more prosperous world."
</P>
<P>
The International Day of Cooperatives was initially celebrated
on the first Saturday in July 1995, marking the centenary of the
International Cooperative Alliance, an umbrella organization
comprising groups of 100 countries.

<P>
ATHENS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Friday that Greece was in favor of a process of
deeper European Union (EU) integration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister
Costas Simitis, Papandreou said that Greece was in favor of
completing the process of institutional reforms to the EU before
new member states began to join so that the expansion would have
any meaning, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted that enhancing the process of EU integration was the
best answer to those who took a phobic attitude to globalization.
</P>
<P>
Greece took a positive view of enhanced cooperation in matters
relating to the economy, internal security and law enforcement,
the minister said, adding that Greece was not opposed to enhanced
cooperation but absolutely rejected abolishing member states' veto
rights.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for Greece to take an active role in the
discussions concerning Europe's future in order to secure its
place in the "fast lane" of EU nations having closer cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Expert Proposes L. America To Sign PPI Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The signing of a PPI agreement between Latin American countries
would create the most extensive zone of uniform treatment for
foreign investment "because the field of application would extend
from Mexico to the Tierra del Fuego," according to Banderas.
</P>
<P>
The PPI accord are bilateral agreements signed between states
aimed at creating conditions of security for foreign investors in
the country and for the country's investors abroad.
</P>
<P>
The first PPI agreement was signed between Germany and Pakistan
in 1959. These treaties began to be generalized in the years of
the 1980 decade, so now they have a practically universal
character.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 1,600 PPI agreements, and 155 countries
are part of bilateral pacts on investments.
</P>
<P>
SELA figures show that Latin America and the Caribbean received
41 percent of direct foreign investment flows to developing
countries in 1998, expecting to increase because of the
privatization of some 140 regional enterprises in the immediate
future, with some 60 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is to lay
emphasis on technical education to reduce the number of unemployed
college and university graduates in the country, said Education
Minister Tunde Adeniran in Abuja on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria Friday quoted Adeniran as saying

remained jobless long after leaving school.
</P>
<P>
"Intake into technical schools will soon be raised," he said,
expressing the hope that the new policy would successfully address
the unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, technological education is also

graduates more employable after leaving school.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has a number of technical schools, in addition to a
host of polytechnics and universities spread in the 36 states in

</P>
<P>
Education is one of the priority areas of the present
administration in Nigeria, which has launched the Universal Basic
Education and the Mass Literacy Program to increase the enrolment
of school-age children and to make about 40 million Nigerians
literate in the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the focus on education, the minister said there is

LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has started the deployment
of navigational aids to various airports nationwide in a major
effort to improve aviation safety in the country, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The state-of-the-art navigational equipments include 19 sets of
 instrument landing system, 10 very high omni-directional radio

</P>
<P>
The airports, serving mostly local flights, had been operating
without functional navigational aids.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government carved out the Nigerian Airspace
Management Agency in 1999 from the Federal Airports Authority of
Nigeria to oversee aviation safety in the country.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Strike Continues, More States Join </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The strike by workers in Nigeria's
commercial capital Lagos to force their state government to raise
minimum wage continued on Friday as workers in more states in the
country also downed tools.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Thursday after abortive talks to resolve the eight-day
strike, Lagos governor Bola Tinubu went tough, saying his
administration would now consider staff rationalization as a way
out of the wage crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to Tinubu, the workers remained adamant in spite of
the fact that the state government had shifted position. The
state's executive council would soon meet to take a decision on
the staff retrenchment option, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government said it would pay 7,500 naira -- the amount
demanded by the workers as monthly minimum wage -- only to senior
workers while junior workers would make do with the 5,500 naira
offered earlier to all the workers by the state (100 naira is
equivalent to one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
The 47,000-strong governmental employee work force is demanding
an across-the-board payment of 7,500 naira before they can call
off the strike, which has paralyzed government activities in the
state, forced state-owned schools to close and crippled health and
other utility services.
</P>
<P>
"That (retrenchment) is a possible option because we cannot
paralyze the business of the state," Tinubu said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis started on May 1 when the federal government
announced a new monthly minimum wage of 7,500 naira for its
workers and 5,500 naira for their counterparts in the 36 states.
</P>
<P>
However, workers in the states demanded between 6,500 and 7,500
naira while most state governors insisted that they could only
manage to pay the stipulated wage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers in Ondo State, also in the southwest, have
decided to join the strike next Monday, saying they would not
accept anything less than 7,500 naira.
</P>
<P>
Workers in most of the other states are continuing negotiations
with their governments, with many of them threatening a strike
like the one in Lagos.

<HEADLINE> Dominican Banana Producers to Be Affected by EU Preferences Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 40,000 Dominican Republic
banana producers could be affected by the eventual elimination of
the system of preferential export quotas applied by the European
Union to the members of the Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP)
countries, said Friday Max Puig, Lome coordinator for the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is pressured by the United States government
and several banana producing countries not favored by the European
system, to eliminate the banana exports preferential quota system
applied to the ACP group, said Puig, quoted in a press dispatch
from Santo Domingo received here.
</P>
<P>
Puig told the "El Caribe" newspaper that the Dominican Republic
government "has shown a firm attitude" in defense of the more than
40,000 Dominican banana producers.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican Republic exports 60,000 tons of bananas a year to
the European Union, according to a source in the local Lome office.
</P>
<P>
Puig said that the last measures taken by the European Union
about the banana exports have favored the Dominican Republic, but
that the international conflict promoted by a group of U.S. backed
Latin American banana producing countries before the World Trade
Organization (WTO), is a threat for the local producers.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose Friday
after a government report said Americans' personal spending rose a
bit in May for the second month in a row, which eased worries
about more hike in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 49.85 at 10,447.85
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 88.88 at 3,
966.11.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 12.21 at 1,454.60.
</P>
<P>
The technology stocks rallied after the U.S. Commerce
Department reported that Americans' personal spending rose just 0.
2 percent in May for the second month in a row, pushing the nation
's personal saving rate up to its highest level since the start of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The new data indicated that consumers began backing away from
their shopping binge and less spending would ease pressures on
inflation and on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
A big rise in chip sales worldwide also helped to drive the
Nasdaq index higher. The Semiconductor Industry Association said
worldwide chip sales hit an all-time high of 15.8 billion U.S.
dollars in May, up 39.8 percent from 11.3 billion dollars a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index bounced back in the final hour of trading to
finish higher from an early falling. The index wavered between the
negative and positive territories in the most hours of session.
</P>
<P>
With Friday's advance, the Dow index finished the first half
with a loss of 9 percent for the year while the Nasdaq index was
down 2.54 percent for the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.18 at 642.93 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 4.65 at 517.23. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 3.45 at 935.89
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,532 up, 1,507 down and 372
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.4 billion shares from 1.10 billion
in the previous session.

WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Friday
approved a 11.2 billion U.S. dollar emergency spending package,
including funds for Colombia, the Pentagon and victims of domestic
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The Senate endorsed the bill on a voice vote one day after it
gained approval by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton indicated Thursday that he stood ready
to sign the bill which he said "will make our nation safer and
more secure."
</P>
<P>
The highest profile item in the package was 1.3 billion dollars
in aid to help the Colombian government to fight drug-trafficking.
Most of the funds will be used to provide the Colombians with 18
Black Hawk and 42 Huey helicopters and help train and equip
Colombian military and national police battalions.
</P>
<P>
The package also includes about 6.4 billion dollars in spending

<HEADLINE> Russia Ends Battle Near Serzhen-Yurt, Fights Rebels Near Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The large-scale operation by federal forces to wipe out the
militants surrounded near the village of Serzhen-Yurt has been
over. During the fighting, over 120 rebels, mainly Arab
mercenaries, were killed, and the federal units lost 13 servicemen,
" Colonel General Gennady Troshev, commander of the Russian forces
in Chechnya, told the press Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The separatists have been completely defeated. A mopping up
operation is now underway and the situation in the area is under
federal control on the whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal units are searching the rebel remnants in Serzhen-
Yurt and nearby populated localities -- Avtury, Morzoi-Mohkh and
Nikita-Khoi, combing the forests and mountains near the
communities. The mop-up may last two or three days, said the
general.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal troops launched an assault Friday
evening on a big group of rebels intending to attack a federal
military convoy at a suburb district, two kilometers south of
Grozny, reported the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Armored vehicles are continuously firing large caliber machine-
guns and mine- launchers into wooded areas on both sides of the
road connecting Grozny and the town of Shatoi, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The rebel resistance has almost been crushed. The number of
rebel casualties is yet unknown, but opposing shoot-outs have
weakened.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the road has been stopped and numerous civilian
vehicles were driven under military escort to safety places in the
outskirts of Grozny. The Russian military believes the order will
be completely restored by the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
Lately, Russian forces have conducted a series of well-planned
mopping-ups in a number of Chechen residential parts, including
Alkhazurovo, Duba-Yurt and Serzhen-Yurt, eliminating scores of
militants and mercenaries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Court Committee Sues to Disbar Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. court committee Friday
sued President Bill Clinton in a bid to disbar him as a lawyer for
denying his sexual contact with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Professional Conduct of the Arkansas Supreme
Court filed suit in Pulaski County Circuit Court, charging that
Clinton's conduct "damages the legal profession and demonstrates a
lack of overall fitness to hold a license to practice law."
</P>
<P>
The committee said that Clinton "has conducted himself in a
manner that violates the model rules of professional conduct as
adopted by the Arkansas Supreme Court."
</P>
<P>
The committee voted on May 19 to sue Clinton over "serious
misconduct" in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, accusing
him of giving misleading answers about his relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit, has said
that his lawyers would fight the disbarment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time an effort has been made to strip a
sitting president of his law license in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate
for his sexual scandal. He was also fined 90,000 dollars for
contempt of court by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, a licensed lawyer since September 7, 1973, was
attorney general of Arkansas from 1977-79, but he has not
practiced law since the early 1980s.
