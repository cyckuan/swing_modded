<HEADLINE> Tories Blamed for UK Nursing Recruitment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- British Health Secretary Frank
Dobson admitted on Friday the ongoing crisis in nursing
recruitment was an "international disgrace" and blamed the
previous Conservative government for the shortage of nurses.
</P>
<P>
Dobson made the remarks as the Labor Party went on the
offensive over bed and staffing problems within the National
Health Service sparked by an upsurge in flu cases in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today program, Dobson said: "We've
been importing doctors and nurses. The whole of the developed
world does it and, in a sense, it is an international disgrace."
</P>
<P>
Dobson blamed the Conservative Party for the problems, saying
"five years of Tory complacency and under-investment sowed the
seeds for today's problems."
</P>
<P>
"Between 1992 and 1994, the Tories cut the number of nurse
training places from 15,073 to 10,849," Dobson said.
</P>
<P>
This year about 15,500 student nurses are expected to begin
training - the highest figure in six years.
</P>
<P>
Dobson told Today: "The reduced number coming out is a
product of the reductions they deliberately made at that time."
</P>
<P>
He added he would like to see an improvement in the "pay and
working conditions of nurses," including introducing more
flexible shifts.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Prosecute Biggest Smuggling Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's supreme people's
procuracy has decided to prosecute 74 alleged offenders from a
private company involved in the country's biggest ever smuggling
case, the Vietnam News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Those offenders include Tran Dam, director of Tan Truong Sanh
Trading Company in Ho Ci Minh City, his wife and three of their
children, 32 former customs officers and 17 officials and
employees of nine state-owned import-export companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the indictment, Dam and his accomplices are accused of
illegally importing 903 containers of goods through nine
state-owned import-export companies between 1994 and August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of the 903 containers, 544 contained 77 cars, a number of
electronic products and refrigerators and electrical goods valued
at more than 900 billion dong (64.81 million U.S. dollars at the
current exchange rate).
</P>
<P>
The smuggled goods were allegedly hidden in the warehouses of
nine police and army units in the city, then sold at three shops
belonging to Dam's family and others.
</P>
<P>
Dam is also accused of bribing customs officers in Ho Chi Minh
City and in Long An, Can Tho and Thua Thien-Hue provinces with 4.3
billion dong (309,664 dollars) and 44,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Phung Long That, head of Ho Chi Minh City Customs'
anti-smuggling task force, allegedly received over 1 billion dong
(72,000 dollars) from Dam.
</P>
<P>
The investigation office is temporarily detaining 15 houses, 38
cars and other assets belonging to Dam and his children.
</P>
<P>
It is also holding three houses, more than 17,000 square meters
of land, 307 taels of gold, four cars, and almost 22,000 dollars
and 119 million dong (8570 dollars) from Phung Long That.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australian Dollar Might Maintain Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Analysts believe that the
Australian dollar would cling to robust gains made during offshore
trading against a backdrop of U.S. dollar weakness, a surging gold
price and waning euro interest.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar vaulted more than three quarters of a
U.S. cent in Friday's trading to a five-week high of 63.69 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
It finished later Friday at 63.22 U.S. cents after a week in
which it soared nearly two U.S. cents from the opening of trading
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers attributed Thursday night's jump to
fading early interest in the infant European currency, the euro,
which saw investors turn to Australia as an alternative as well as
a skip up in the gold price.
</P>
<P>
A weaker U.S. dollar against a strengthening Japanese yen also
added gloss to the firming local unit.
</P>
<P>
MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's currency strategist Alex Douglas said he
believed the Australian dollar could sustain current levels into
the middle of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have made a sustained move above 0.6265 U.S.
dollar, I think the Aussie (Australian dollar) is really looking
quite good," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't rule out a dip back towards those levels but that
would just be a short term thing."
</P>
<P>
Westpac Banking Corporation technical analyst Peter Pontikis
said if weakness in the U.S. dollar continued, the Australian unit
could remain around current levels for the remainder of the March
quarter.
</P>
<P>
"For fundamental reasons it should be lower but for financial
reasons - the weaker U.S. against the yen and the euro blocs -
it's really going to stop the ability of Aussie/U.S. to collapse
in a meaningful sense," Pontikis said.
</P>
<P>
However, BNP senior strategist and group treasury Clifford
Bennett said the Australian dollar could have already seen its
highs for the moment - although he did not expect it to drift down
too far.
</P>
<P>
"There's a chance we could see the Aussie up towards 0.65 U.S.
dollar in the next week or two but the risk is that it will start
to top out at current levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing at the moment is the Aussie dollar
appreciating on the back of short term bullish fundamental signs.
</P>
<P>
Bennett believed mid-1999 could see the domestic currency still
hovering around 0.62 U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Aussie is stabilizing after last year's volatility
and so we are probably going to see quite a long period of
congestion between 0.60 and 0.65 U.S. dollar. So, at the middle of
the year we could still be hovering around 0.62."

<HEADLINE> Halt Germans Oppose Dual-Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Amid heated debate over plans to
offer dual-citizenship to foreigners in Germany, an opinion poll
Friday showed 50 percent of the Germans opposed allowing people to
hold two passports.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the German Press Agency (DPA), a poll
showed that 50 percent of those asked were against allowing
dual-nationality, 40 percent backed it and 10 percent said either
they did not care or did not respond.
</P>
<P>
Carried out by the Dimpa Institute, the poll surveyed 740
people.
</P>
<P>
Younger Germans tended to back Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
plans to offer dual-citizenship. Some 52 percent of those aged 18
to 24 were in favor of the idea while 63 percent of those aged
over 60 were opposed.
</P>
<P>
But there was wide support for the second element of
Schroeder's citizenship reform which would make babies born in
German automatic citizens as long as one parent had also been born
in Germany. Some 69 percent of those polled said they backed
German nationality for babies.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's government will next week present legislation
reforming the country's 1913 citizenship law, which is based on
bloodlines, not place of birth.
</P>
<P>
Many conservatives are outraged over plans to abandon the
"German by blood" definition and are launching a nationwide
anti-reform petition campaign. They also plan to bring a lawsuit
challenging the move to Germany's constitutional court.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Neo-Nazi incidents in the German
armed forces rose last year, with 301 soldiers involved in
far-right incidents in 1998, compared with 222 soldiers in 1997,
German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Most of the incidents involved banned propaganda such as
wearing Nazi symbols or putting up propaganda from the Third Reich
in barracks but did not threaten the nations's military, Scharping
said to reporters.
</P>
<P>
There was no danger of wider far-right tendencies in the
combined armed forces, the Bundeswehr, which has 340,000 troops,
said the German defense minister.
</P>
<P>
German law bans the public display of symbols like the Nazi
swastika or giving the stiff-armed Adolf Hitler salute.

<HEADLINE> Graf, Venus Williams into HK Int'l Tennis Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's former world No. 1
Steffi
Graf beat American Serena Williams in straight sets here Friday to

proceed to the finals of Hong Kong Super-Power Challenge Cup
women's
tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
While in a later match that with 14 broken games, Russian
teenage
sensation Anna Kournikova committed 23 double-faults and lost to
Serena's
sister, Venus.
</P>
<P>
Graf will take on Venus Williams in the finals, scheduled for
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Graf, top seed of the three-day exhibition tournament, used 1
hour and
10 minutes to beat Serena 6-2, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
Coming to the Hong Kong tournament to prepare for the coming
Australian Open, the 29-year-old German took an early lead of 3-1
in the
first set by breaking Serena's second game.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams' more powerful serve became effective in the
second
set when she broke Graf's third game but Graf soon fought back to
make it
4-4.
</P>
<P>
Graf got a bad start in the tie-break when she trailed 1-3
after a
point was given to Serena on an appearing outside ball. However
the
winner of 106 careers titles took advantage of her experience and
stable
performance to level the score soon on 4-4 and eventually took the
match.
</P>
<P>
Graf said after the match that she thought for the match for a
long
time and she was "really good out there, especially in the first
set when
I went for my shot and kept on my pressure a lot." She added that
the
second set was a "good and close" one.
</P>
<P>
In the other match, Kournikova displayed precision in baseline
rallies
to keep Venus Williams running but seemed out of control when she
served.
Apart from the 23 double faults, her serve speed was sometimes
measured
at below 100 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Venus Williams, second seed of the tournament, saved just two
games of
her serve in each set and won the match. Kournikova seemed lost
her
confidence in the second set despite the chanting of "Anna, Anna"
from
the crowds.
</P>
<P>
Venus commented after the match that her performance of the
night
"deserved maybe another position in the top 50" although her
ability
deserves No.1.
</P>
<P>
Venus, who had 13 double faults in a three-setter in 1997, said
"Anna
was certainly doing her best" and "no one does that on purpose,
and she
was improving since she first started."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- South African police blocked roads
to Cape Town International Airport Friday before British Prime Minister
Tony Blair arrived from Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Armored vans were placed across the roads and every approaching vehicle
was stopped, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Muslims protesting against Blair's visit, because of Britain's
participation in the air strikes against Iraq, earlier said they would
demonstrate with placards at the airport.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a spokesman for a radical Muslim group as saying that two
Muslim groups would still stage demonstrations outside the airport and near
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Moaim Achmad, spokesman for the Muslims Against Global Oppression (MAGO)
, said that his group and Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders would try to
hold a placard demonstration as close to the airport as possible. After
that they would go to parliament for another protest.
</P>
<P>
He said Blair, who is due to speak to parliamentarians in the old
Assembly Chamber later Friday, had the blood of innocent Iraqis on his
hands.
</P>
<P>
Achmad was detained after Thursday's violent demonstration outside the
United States embassy.
</P>
<P>
He said he was being fingerprinted at the police station, and would
appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court later.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Dolan to Miss Short-course World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KOGN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Tom Dolan
from the United States said here on Friday that he would not
compete in the short-course swimming world championships slated
for April this year in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champion and world record holder in men's 400
meters individual medley is visiting here for the Hong Kong leg
starting here on Saturday, of the World Cup short-course series.
He said that he would not, however, come here again for the April
event as he would compete in the U.S. national championships
almost at the same time. And he had already qualified, at last
year's national championships, for this year's Pan-Pacific
championships in August in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his first ever trip to Beijing, where he finished
third in the 200 meters individual medley, he gave himself a 50-50
mark.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team took the World Cup meets as part of their
on-going training, Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
Dolan's teammate and backstroke events' world champion last
year Lenny Krazelburg would also miss the short-course world
championships, due to his planned participation at the national
championships. "I am satisfied with my performance in Beijing
(World Cup leg) and I would try my best here in the Hong Kong
leg," he said. "It concerns whether one could be the World Cup's
overall winner of the event," he added.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's Claudia Poll, Olympic champion in women's 200
meters freestyle and holder of short-course world records for 200-
and 400-meter freestyle events, was undoubtedly the focus of the
female swimmers here.
</P>
<P>
The female star had taken the short-course world championships
and the Pan-Pacific championships as her major events for the
year. She said she had been training "very hard" for the World
Cup meets but would not focus on improving her world mark.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 teams are to compete in the two-day short-course
swimming meeting in the indoor pool of Kowloon Park here.

<HEADLINE> Countries Should Have Freedom in Choosing Their Way: Chinese F </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
said here Friday afternoon that all countries should have the freedom to
choose their own ways of development based on their own specialities.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks when holding talks with Vice-President of Uganda's
National Resistance Movement (NRM) Moses Kigongo.
</P>
<P>
"More and more African countries are experimenting with their own ways
of development. The world is colorful and it is impossible that there is
only one way of development," the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
 "A country's choice of way of development, even its social system,
should be respected. Uganda's choice of the Movement system is correct and
proper. The success story of the system proves this," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kigongo, on his part, introduced to his guest the formation of the
Movement system, saying that the Ugandan government does not force its
people to take a certain way, instead, it provides them with freedom to
choose for themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said Uganda's NRM is ready to learn from neighbors and other
countries including China.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will never go back to war because war is not something enjoyable,
 he added.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay here, Tang is expected to meet his Ugandan
counterpart, the NRM leader, Parliament Speaker and President Yoweri
Museveni.
</P>
<P>
This is Tang's first visit to Uganda in the capacity of China's foreign
minister and the third leg of his 12-day five-nation African tour.

<HEADLINE> Shelton: Several Iraqi Key Officials Killed by Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Several key Iraqi officials
in President Saddam Hussein's government were killed by U.S. and
British bombing raids on December 16-19, the Pentagon's top
general said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"When you look at some of the intel (intelligence) reporting
that has come in, (there are) several kay individuals that were
right in the upper structure that are no longer available to him,
to advise or to lead," said Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Shelton said the losses
of key advisers, hundreds of Republican Guard troops and
widespread military damage had obviously shaken Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
He estimated 600 to 1,600 elite Iraqi Republican Guard troops
and others were killed in the raids and that perhaps "several
times" many were injured.
</P>
<P>
Shelton refused to give names of top officials killed or to
reveal the source of the intelligence. "I can't, because it
related to the sources that we have and I don't want to reveal
that. That would hurt us," he said.

<HEADLINE> Three Children Killed in Afghan Land Mine Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Three children were killed
when a land mine exploded in the suburbs of Afghanistan's capital
city of Kabul on Friday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The three children, collecting wood in a deserted field about
15 kilometers out of Kabul, triggered the unexploded land mine as
they were roaming through the area, the reports quoted
Taliban-controlled Radio Shriat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two of the children, who are between the ages of seven and
nine, died instantly and the third died later of his injuries.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, the land mine was buried during a
four-year war between rival Islamic factions who assumed power in
Kabul in 1992 after toppling the communist government.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry, stemming from the factions' competition for the
control over Kabul, did not end until in September 1996 the
Taliban religious army swept President Burhannuddin Rabbani from
power.
</P>
<P>
This has been the second time in less than one week that
children were killed by land mines in Afghanistan. Last Saturday
three children were killed and another three injured when they
stepped on a land mine near Kabul.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Falls to 4.3 Percent in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
fell to 4.3 in December and payroll employment grew at its fastest
rate in more than one year, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, down from 4.4 percent in November,
returned to the level reached in April and May, the department
reported. For the year, unemployment averaged 4.5 percent, the
lowest since 3.5 percent in 1969. The 1998 mark was the lowest
peacetime rate since 1957, when it averaged 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In December, employers added 378,000 jobs to their payrolls,
the most in 15 months. Some of the gains reflected unseasonably
warm weather, which produced 104,000 jobs in the construction
industry, but much of it reflected the U.S. economy's resilience
in the face of the world economic crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that the labor market would weaken
somewhat this year, though it would remain healthy by historical
standards. The number of claims for unemployment benefits rose
during the last two weeks of December. And layoff announcements
doubled in December, as compared with November.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Accuses Unionists in N.Irish Peace Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Irish Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams accused Northern Ireland's Unionist leader David
Trimble Friday of creating difficulties in implementing the peace
accord that was reached last April.
</P>
<P>
"David Trimble has skillfully exercised a veto which he has
used to drive a coach and horses through the letter and spirit of
the agreement," Adams, who heads the Irish Republican Army's
political wing Sinn Fein, wrote in an article published in the
Irish News.
</P>
<P>
"His use of the (arms) decommissioning issue is probably the
most obvious example," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Northern
Ireland's first minister, has been pressing the IRA to hand over
its weapons, or Sinn Fein will be barred from joining the
coalition cabinet to run the province.
</P>
<P>
The historic Northern Ireland peace agreement urges all parties
to work to achieve disarmament within two years, but IRA sources
repeatedly ruled out arms decommissioning in briefings with
several media outlets last month.
</P>
<P>
Adams said that Trimble "is deliberately seeking to delay the
implementation of the agreement. Indeed, there is an increasing
number of republicans and nationalists who are coming round to the
view that he is seeking the collapse of the agreement."
</P>
<P>
"They believe that Mr Trimble wants to create a new negotiation
process which would produce another and different agreement, more
to the liking of unionists, and which excludes Sinn Fein," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Head Meets S. Leonean Rebels on Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth secretary-general has
intervened in the Sierra Leonean crisis to urge the rebels in the country
to obey a
ceasefire directive from their jailed chief, a report from the Cable
News Network said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Commonthwealth Secretay General, Emeka Anyaoku, met
rebel representatives Thursday in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday the representatives of the rebel group came to my office,
had a discussion with us, and we are now encouraging them to support this
ceasefire," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And I hope the international community will come in support of that as
well as in support of shoring up democracy in Sierra Leone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said the Commonwealth also continued to support the Sierra
Leonean government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire was announced by Kabbah in alive radio
broadcast Thursday while rebel chief Foday Sankoh issued his orders in a
recorded
message immediately afterwards in the same broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said if ceasefire conditions are met for seven days, he will
authorize the release of Sankoh, who is now in jail after being sentenced
to death for supporting the military junta emerged after the May 1997 coup
that temporarily ousted elected President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who has been leading a rebel against successive Sierra Leonean
governments since 1991, was arrested after being released from more than
one year's house arrest in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The military commander of the rebels attacking the capital Freetown has
cast doubt on the reported ceasefire agreement, saying that he will
continue fighting unless he is personally given ceasefire orders by
Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth official also urged the international community to
give
more support to the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG that is
defending Kabbah, saying that the burden has fallen too heavily on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoyku also said that there is "mounting evidence that Liberia has
been
supporting the rebel group. I think international pressure should be
brought against Liberia at the same time that it's brought in favor of the
peace talks."
</P>
<P>
"We (the Commonwealth) are focusing on the representations made to us
by the rebel group to try and help sustain this cease-fire. At the same
time we are asking the international community to rally around the
democratically-elected government (of Kabbah)," he said.
</P>
<P>
After intensive offensives in recent weeks, the rebels in Sierra Leone
has controlled the whole northern half of the country and entered Freetown
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports reaching here, the rebels has now controlled
parts of Freetown's eastern and central neighborhoods, while the ECOMOG is
holding the western parts of the city, including the strategically-
important Lungi International Airport.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbha is reportedly safe in a military base of the ECOMOG
forces.

<HEADLINE> Georgian FM Criticizes Russian Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Georgian Foreign Minister Irakli
Menagarishvili Friday termed the activity of Russian peacekeepers
in the breakaway republic of Abkhazia as "inefficient."
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in Tbilisi that the peacekeepers
should change their ways if they want to have their mandate
prolonged, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Georgia will not extend their mandate unless "the practice of
their activity" and the conditions of their stay are changed,
Menagarishvili said.
</P>
<P>
He said the current activity of Russian peacekeepers is
senseless and does not satisfy Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in the Ghali district
of Abkhazia since 1994, after a truce ended a 1992-93 war in which
Abkhazian separatists drove out Georgian government troops.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers' mandate expired on July 31, 1998, and Tbilisi
proposed to Moscow on consultations on changing the mandate, but
no response has come so far, Menagarishvili said.
</P>
<P>
"We will give our consent to the prolongation of the mandate of
Russian peacekeepers only in case it is changed in principle," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of ethnic Georgian refugees have returned to
the district despite Abkhazian resistance, but were forced to flee
again in May when Abkhazian forces attacked their villages. Some
came back when the fighting ended, and about 10,000 Georgians now
live there.

country African tour which has already brought him Egypt and Kenya.

MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The former Soviet republic of
Georgia plans to pardon 1,000 inmates in January and another 1,500
before the end of this year to mark the turn of the century,
Itar-Tass reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty will involve those who have served half of their
under-five-year sentences, first offenders, men over 60, and women
over 55, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
However, inmates convicted for felonies such as murder, robbery
with extreme violence, and terrorism will not be eligible for the
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
This will be the largest amnesty since 1997, when the republic
of 5.8 million people pardoned some 1,000 convicts.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Quarterly Coffee Exports Shoot Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coffee exports recorded a
remarkable recovery in the October-December quarter with 809,588 bags worth
69.6 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
This represents an increase of 45.6 percent and 38.1 percent in volume
and value respectively compared with the same period last year, according
to a latest report released Friday by the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority (UCDA).
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, exports during the October-December quarter account for
20 percent of Uganda's annual exports, the report said.
</P>
<P>
UCDA report attributed this good performance of coffee exports to the
conducive dry weather which helped in the coffee drying process and made it
possible to access rural coffee growers.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers and traders front-loaded their stock ahead of Christmas
holiday festivities as well as to reap on the good prices," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Exporters took advantage of the high availability of coffee in the
internal market to meet their contractual obligations, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the main coffee growers and exporters in Africa.
Coffee exports account for 60 percent of the country's foreign exchange
income.

HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba is
expected in zimbabwe Sunday to confer with President Robert Mugabe ahead

A statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe
Friday said Chiluba would consult with Mugabe on the raging war in the

The January meeting is a third attempt at signing a peace agreement

should formally meet.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution has eluded the DRC many times after the war to
topple Kabila broke out on August 2 last year.

<P>
LUANDA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. experts group has, with the help
of Angolan government, Friday left Luanda, capital of Angola, for central
Angola's Huambo City to investigate the cases of the two U.N. planes downed
recently.
</P>
<P>
A government source who refused to be identified said that the group
will first go to Vila Nova, or Tchicala-Tcholohanga City, about 70 kms
northwest of Huambo, to look for the black box of the Hercules C-130 plane
downed on December 26.
</P>
<P>
There were 10 U.N. staff and four crew members on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
The government source said that Vila Nova had been re-captured by the
government forces, so the investigation group need not to get cooperation
from the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
On January 2, another U.N. plane, with eight U.N. staff and crew
members on
board, was downed over the hills in northern part of Huambo Province.
</P>
<P>
It is very hard for the group to get any result, though the government
has promised to offer full support in its mission, the government source

HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Dollar continued to slide
to a new record low Friday prompting brokers to urge the central bank to

</P>

The local unit, relatively stable in the last two months, closed at
39. 60 to one U.S. Dollar, its worst level since last October's record

The fall was a result of banks protecting their positions rather than

On Thursday, the unit closed weaker trading at 38.80 to the

international Monetary Fund of crucial balance of payment support.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republicans and
Democrats reached a general agreement Friday covering ground rules
for President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in connection with
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers on both the Republican and Democratic parties said it
included the possibility of testimony by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The details had not yet been drafted, senators said, and they
cautioned that no final accord had been sealed.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that under the emerging
plan the trial would begin next week with opening presentations.
Meanwhile, four senators, two from each party, would begin working
on the difficult issue of calling witnesses. Republican House
prosecutors are pressing for witnesses, while many Democrats
oppose the idea.
</P>
<P>
Clinton went on trial in the Senate Thursday for "high crimes
and misdemeanors" of a far different strip, accused in two
articles of impeachment of perjury and obstruction of justice
stemming from his efforts to keep secret his affair with Lewinsky.
Under the Constitution, conviction requires a two-thirds vote, or
67 senators if all are present.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A 60-year-old Lebanese shepherd
was killed Friday in south Lebanon in mortar attacks launched by
guerrillas on Israeli border areas, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying that the man was
killed when shells hit Houla village, two kilometers away from
Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had fired mortar
shells onto the western Galilee area in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The group said in a statement that the move was a response to
Israel's demolition of Lebanese civilians' houses and expulsion of
civilians from their village on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces bulldozed 15 uninhabited houses in the village
of Arnoun inside the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied
border zone in south Lebanon where an Israeli soldier was
seriously wounded in a Hezbollah's bomb ambush a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli command said in a communique that the demolished
houses were used by terrorists for bomb-planting activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli forces also deported a total of 25 Lebanese,
including women and children, from their homes in the village of
Shebaa inside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
The move was believed to be an Israeli revenge for the killing
of Ghassan Daher, the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army's commander
in Shebaa, on December 25.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy
SLA out of the country.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- All 20-25 people on board a bus
are feared dead in a crash in eastern Georgia Friday, Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The PAZ bus plunged into a canyon on the Voyenno-Gruzinskaya
road, the main highway connecting Georgia and neighboring Russia.
</P>
<P>
The bus, heading for the Russian city of Vladikavkaz,
apparently lost control at a mountain pass about five kilometers
from the eastern Georgian city of Kazbegi.
</P>
<P>
The victims, mostly residents of Vladikavkaz, were returning
home from Kobi after attending a burial there, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Reach Deal on Format for Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republicans and
Democrats reached a general agreement Friday covering ground rules
for President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in connection with
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers on both the Republican and Democratic Parties said it
included the possibility of testimony by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The details had not yet been drafted, senators said, and they
cautioned that no final accord had been sealed.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott and Democratic Leader Tom
Daschle said they both expected a broad bipartisan agreement on
the plan, which the Senate was to vote on later in the day.
</P>
<P>
"Our expectation is that it's going to be an overwhelming
bipartisan vote" on the trial plan, Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
He said that details of the plan, particularly guidelines for
selecting witnesses and handling salacious testimony, still had to
be worked out by a small bipartisan group of senators.
</P>
<P>
Lott said that under the emerging plan the trial would begin
next week with opening presentations. Meanwhile, four senators,
two from each party, would begin working on the difficult issue of
calling witnesses. Republican House prosecutors are pressing for
witnesses, while many Democrats oppose the idea.
</P>
<P>
Senators who were sworn in Thursday to be jurors in the second
presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history have since been
locked in a dispute over how the trial would be conducted. The
agreement was reached in a rare informal closed session of the
full Senate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton went on trial in the Senate Thursday for "high crimes
and misdemeanors" of a far different strip, accused in two
articles of impeachment of perjury and obstruction of justice
stemming from his efforts to keep secret his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed
on largely party-line votes the two articles of impeachment
against Clinton. The votes sent the issue to the Senate, where a
two-thirds majority must vote to convict Clinton in order to
remove him from office.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Libya on Friday denied involvement
in the ongoing battles in the Democratic Republic of Congo and
asserted its desire to find a peaceful solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
A unamed official of the People's General Committee for Foreign
Liaison and International Cooperation of Libya said
U.S. allegations about Libya's involvement in the DR Congo
war was totally unfounded.
</P>
<P>
Libya was working towards a peaceful solution to the DR Congo
issue based on the principle of solving the African problem within
an African framework, he said.
</P>
<P>
Libya's role, according to the official, results from a mandate
from a mini-summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held
in Sert, Libya, last year.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan official pointed out that if the United States was
keen on settling the DR Congo dispute it should offer human relief
to DR Congo and stop meddling in its internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Privatize Telecom Company: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has resisted a lot
of pressure to privatize Zambia Telecommunication Company (ZAMTEL) because
the government has to have certain institutions where it has a final say,
Communications and Transport Minister David Saviye said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Saviye said the government instead opted to commercialize the company.
</P>
<P>
"We are not protecting ZAMTEL, but government has to have certain
institutions where it has a final say," he said.
</P>
<P>
Together with Information Minister Nestead Zimba, Saviye toured
ZAMCELL offices to acquaint themselves with the operations of the newly-
founded private company.
</P>
<P>
The communications minister said that it is the government policy to
liberalize the economy especially in the communication sector which has
seen a lot of players in it.
</P>
<P>
He urged ZAMCELL to spread its wings to rural areas as at present it
has targeted only the line of rail.
</P>
<P>
Zimba also urged ZAMCELL to service rural areas because they are
desperately in need of telecommunication technology.
</P>
<P>
He said communication network is lacking in many rural areas hence the
need for ZAMCELL to service such areas.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of ZAMCELL Howard Burrows said that the company is on
the brink of expanding to southern province early this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the company will be soon approaching the government with a view
of getting a license to link with 20 African and European countries.

<HEADLINE> OAU Reiterates Support for Elected Government in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), Salim Ahmed Salim, Friday reiterated OAU's
unyielding support for the democratically-elected government of President
Tejan Kabbah in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release issued here, Salim said that he is "
deeply concerned about the grave situation unfolding in Sierra Leone, in
particular the events of the past few days which have culminated in the
infiltration of the rebel forces into the capital, Freetown, causing loss
of life, destruction and havoc as well as general distress to the long-
suffering civilian population."
</P>
<P>
In his statement on the current situation in Sierra Leone, Salim noted
with "deep regret" that "this development has occurred at the beginning of
the new year of 1999, a time which should, rather, be exploited for the
pursuance of peace and reconciliation on the African continent."
</P>
<P>
"The OAU finds as totally unacceptable and reprehensible the atrocities
and acts of violence perpetrated by the rebel forces," Salim pointed out,
and called upon the rebel forces to "put end to them."
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief welcomed the news of a meeting between President Tejan
Kabbah and Foday Sankoh, leader of the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra
Leone, saying that "I wish to encourage the parties to follow the path of
peace and proceed to establish a cease-fire, as apparently agreed at the
said meeting, thus paving the way for a process of dialog and national
reconciliation in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
"The OAU continues to stand prepared to facilitate, together with the
countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and
other members of the international community, the conduct of a sustained
process of dialog and negotiations, for the achievement of lasting peace
and reconciliation in Sierra Leone," Salim stressed.
</P>
<P>
Salim also appealed to the international community to "give all the
assistance possible to the Sierra Leonean people who have suffered
immensely."

<HEADLINE> German Defense Minister Wants to Modernize German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping has said he wants to modernize the German armed forces
in the next years and the military needs several major new weapons
systems to replace aging equipment.
</P>
<P>
This needs to be done through tightening and saving of the
civil administrative outlay for the renewal of the aging
equipment, said the minister Thursday evening to reporters in
Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Scharping said the air force's "trans-all" transport planes
were over 30 years old and must be replaced if Germany was to take
part in international missions such as in Bosnia. And the army's
armored personnel carrier "Marder," which had been in service for
28 years, also had to be replaced, he added.
</P>
<P>
But about the speculation that the German air force had an
interest to buy the Russia-Ukrainian Antonov-70 transport planes,
Scharping said the German government had not received any concrete
sale offer for the planes.
</P>
<P>
Scharping is setting up a commission to study possible sweeping
reform of the German combined armed forces, Bundeswehr. Members of
the commission will be announced in coming months and the body
will begin its work in April and issue a report late in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Scharping said he did not believe the Bundeswehr's budget would
be further cut from its present annual level of 28 billion
dollars. He noted that while in the 1980s the Bundeswehr had
received some 25 percent of the federal tax revenue, the figure
was now down to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
About the foreign policy, Scharping made it clear that he stood
for strengthening of the European identity of safety and defense.
The Europeans must have a common foreign and safety police within
the Atlantic alliance, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere to Open Mediation Office in War-Torn Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 8 (Xinhua) - The international mediator Julius
Nyerere expects to open a liaison office in the war-torn Burundi soon to
speed up the peace process, sources from Tanzania's northern town of Arusha
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
This message was conveyed by Nyerere's envoy, Joseph Warioba, to
President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi early this week in Burundian capital of
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Another official of the Nyerere Foundation was also quoted as saying
that "we are working on" this effort.
</P>
<P>
Warioba, Tanzania's former Prime Minister, informed Buyoya of Nyerere's
intention to convene a regional summit "very soon" to debate the lifting of
the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi since July 1996 following a
military coup in Bujumbura which brought Buyoya to power.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that Buyoya, who released the opponents from house arrest
last year to meet the demands by sanctions supporters, expressed optimism
with Nyerere's message and reaffirmed his commitment to the peaceful talks.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi state radio reported on Thursday that if convened, such a
regional summit will give a hope of lifting the sanctions which has hit
heavily the country's fragile economy.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Nyerere, presiding the third round of peace talks by all
Burundi warring factions in Arusha, said that he made suggestion to
regional leaders on a summit in the wake of considerable achievements from
the three rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of talks was expected to start on January 18 in Arusha,
 a famous regional conference center, to continue the efforts to bring
peace to the central African republic.
</P>
<P>
A tiny landlocked country in the Great Lakes Region, Burundi was
dragged into bloody conflicts since October 1993 when the first free
elected ethnic Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated by the
ethnic Tutsi-dominated Army.
</P>
<P>
So far some 150,000 people, mostly civilians, are estimated to have
been killed during the endless ethnic conflicts.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Probe Mission Finds Wreck of 1st Crashed Plane in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations research-and-rescue
mission Friday found the wreck of the U.N.-chartered Hercules C-130
transport plane which went down on December 26 near Vila Nova town, 70
kilometers north of Huambo City.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary survey results, the chance is slim for
anyone aboard to survive the crash, the Angolan News Agency ANGOP reported.
</P>
<P>
ANGOP said that the remains of the found crew members had been burnt
into charcoal while the wrecks of the plane were scattered in an area of
some five square kilometers covered by grass and bush.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the U.N. mission said that "the chance is quite slim for
anyone on board to survive" because the plane burst into fire after it
crashed onto the ground.
</P>
<P>
So far, the black box which recorded the flying conditions has not been
found.
</P>
<P>
According to local residents, some soldiers of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have destroyed signs at the crash
site
showing their shooting down the U.N. plane.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. rescue team arrived in Huambo Friday from capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sevan Benom, U.N. special representative and Undersecretary-
General for Defense and Security, said that the Angolan government had
pledged to ensure the safety of the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
One former UNITA soldier, who has surrendered to the government troops,
disclosed that the two U.N. plane which consecutively crashed had been shot
down by the Russian made missiles fired by the Second Motorized Brigade to
which he belonged.
</P>
<P>
The soldier noted that the second downed plane might have crashed in the
mountains in the north of Huambo Province, which is still controlled by the
UNITA forces.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Iraq's Charge Against UNSCOM Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 8 (xinhua) -- Reports that the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction (UNSCOM) had helped the United States to spy
on Iraq has further put the UNSCOM's future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
The allegation about the UNSCOM came as the United Nations
Security Council is attempting to overcome the deep division among
its members and define a future U.N. role in Iraq after last
month's military strikes by the Untied States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the UNSCOM of being a tool of U.S.
intelligence and of trying to gather information unrelated to its
assigned task of searching for prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post and The Boston Globe reported Wednesday
that the UNSCOM did just that in cooperation with Washington. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was described as possessing
"convincing evidence" and concerned it could undermine the
credibility of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Richard Butler, executive chairman
of the UNSCOM, have denied that they worked together to penetrate
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's security units and eavesdrop in
sensitive conversations as part of an effort to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
Annan has denied that he obtained "convincing evidence" on the
UNSCOM's spying for the United Nations as The Washington Post and
The Boston Globe reported.
</P>
<P>
The allegations, whether they are true or not, have been a
deadly blow to the UNSCOM, whose future has already been unknown
after the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq last month.
</P>
<P>
The wave of espionage reports has buttressed longstanding
Iraq's charges that the U,N, weapons inspectors were spies working
for the interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said
that the reports were nothing new to Iraq, and they proved what
Iraq had been saying all along.
</P>
<P>
What Iraq demands now is not to replace Butler and restructure
the UNSCOM. It wants the eight-year sanctions lifted immediately
and allows no arms inspectors to come back.
</P>
<P>
The reports have also given impetus to efforts by Russia and
France to devise a new, less intrusive arms monitoring system as a
prelude to lifting the oil embargo on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations Sergey Lavrov said
his country could not trust Butler and the UNSCOM any longer, and
France has proposed a new institution to replace the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Amid the row, Butler said in a interview with The Sydney
Morning Herald that he was thinking of leaving the job when his
contract expired in June.
</P>
<P>
It is widely seen here that the uproar over the spying reports
could make it impossible for the UNSCOM to return to Iraq and
eventually kill the U.N. arms inspection operations in Iraq.

"This visit will further strengthen the excellent bilateral relations
between South Africa and Japan and promote cooperation in multilateral fora,
" said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said Japan was South Africa's strongest trade and investment partner
in East Asia. Trade between the two countries in 1997 amounted to 19.3
billion Rand (3.3 billion U.S. Dollars).

JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Three people were shot at and two of
them arrested during an illegal placard protest against visiting British
Prime Minister Tony Blair in Cape Town Friday, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Two protesters, including a member of the vigilante group, People

They were arrested by police.
</P>
<P>
A South African Broadcasting Corporation journalist was shot in one leg
with rubber bullets and was admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police were shot at when they used two stun grenades to disperse a crowd
of about 70 Moslems who had gathered on a parade after holding a placard
demonstration at Cape Town International Airport earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Moslems protested against Blair's visit at the airport because of
Britain's support for United States military attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Police blocked access roads to the airport ahead of Blair's arrival from
Pretoria. But the demonstration at the airport was peaceful.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
Friday hailed the Sino-Ugandan relations which have developed healthily
over several decades.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks at a dinner party hosted in his honor by his
Ugandan counterpart Eriya Kategaya in Sheraton Hotel in Kampala Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"Since China and Uganda established diplomatic relations more than 30
years ago, especially after the National Resistance Movement came to power,
Sino-Ugandan friendship and cooperation have kept growing in many fields in
spite of changes on the international arena and in our respective countries,
" Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China attaches great importance to its ties with Uganda and
stands ready to work with Uganda to step up political consultation and
coordination, and to expand exchanges and cooperation in trade and the
economic field.
</P>
<P>
In his speech before the dinner, Kategaya said: "The relationship
between
these two countries has never experienced any ups and downs. It has run on
a level gradient along a smooth highway paved by friendship, openness and
mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
Beyond cooperation in the material sphere, China has been on Africa's
side throughout the decolonization process and the subsequent economic
construction. This shared vision has ensured that the two countries are
virtually always on the same side of all major international issues, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also praised China's remarkable economic achievements it has made
since it opened its doors to the outside world twenty years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tang's maiden two-day visit to Uganda is the third leg of his 12-day
five-country African tour. He has visited Egypt and Kenya and is expected
to visit Tanzania and Zambia before going to Paris.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Foreign Investments Total 4.6 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in Romania
totaled 4.63 billion U.S. dollars in eight years, with almost
60,000 companies with full or part foreign capital set up during
that lapse of time.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data released by the Commerce Registry,
3.44 billion dollars of this amount account for direct investments
in commercial companies set up over December 1990-October 1998,
over one billion dollars being invested pursuant to privatization
contracts concluded over January 1993-October 1998.
</P>
<P>
The first place in the leading foreign investments made through
the State Ownership Fund, Romania's main privatization agency, is
held by Germany, which bought 18 enterprises, followed by the
United States, Austria, the Netherlands and France.
</P>
<P>
In terms of size of investments, the Netherlands ranks first,
with 536.3 million dollars, followed by France, Germany, the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies bought by foreign investors operate in
food and drink sectors, chemistry, followed by machine-building,
services and building materials.
</P>
<P>
Worrying though is, according to the national Rompres news

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Returns Home After Visit to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
returned to Cairo Friday night after wrapping up a one-day visit
to Syria.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mubarak held talks with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad on the latest developments in the Iraqi
crisis and means of restoring Arab solidarity, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi situation was exacerbated after the United States and
Britain launched a four-day missile attack on the country from
December 16 to 19 in what the U.S. said a retaliation for
Baghdad's defiance of the United Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Following the military strikes, Arab countries decided to
convene a foreign ministers meeting on January 24 to discuss a
Yemeni call for an urgent Arab summit to discuss the attack and
ways of restoring Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also conferred with al-Assad on how to advance the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks came to a halt following Israeli
suspension of Wye peace accord by inventing an excuse that the
Palestinian side failed to fully curb violence against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Lebanon, on the one hand,
and Israel, on the other, have been in a deadlock since early 1996
due to the disputes over the future of the Golan Heights, part of
Syria's territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed ways of promoting the bilateral
relations in various domains.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and al-Assad frequently exchange views on regional
issues and international affairs of mutual concern and coordinate
their stances in this regard.

<HEADLINE> IEA Wishes to Carry Out Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Energy Agency
(IEA) is willing to carry out cooperation in China in such fields
as establishing regulatory institutions and curbing pollution,
said William Ramsay, Director of the Office of Non-Member
Countries of the IEA on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at the IEA headquarters in Paris,
Ramsay said that there exist wide fields for cooperation between
IEA and China, and IEA wishes to shares its past experiences in
running energy industries such as natural gas.
</P>
<P>
What makes it more important to carry out dialogue between the
two sides is that China is a great coal combustion country, which
leads directly to other issues such as change of climate, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IEA is also ready to provide advice to China on energy
industry regulations, pricing patterns and energy investment, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Ogutcu, principal administrator of the Asia-Pacific and
Latin American division of IEA, said that China can take advantage
of the sources of IEA, which is a non-commercial organization with
a variety of channels of information.
</P>
<P>
"The IEA is uniquely placed for providing advice and sharing
experiences of its member countries in the field such as natural
gas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that IEA may consider providing policy advice on
specific sectoral and regulatory issues, as China is currently in
the process of restructuring its energy industry and improving its
legal and institutional framework.
</P>
<P>
In the field of environmental protection, the IEA has chosen a
coal fired power plant in Shanxi Province in northern China as a
pilot project of energy technology cooperation activities aimed at
helping China deploy climate-friendlier energy technologies, said
Ogutcu.
</P>
<P>
He said that IEA is also proposing the holding of an
international conference on natural gas in Beijing in late 1999.
The conference is aimed at providing China's industry players and
government policy makers with a better understanding of natural
gas regulatory issues, gas transportation and supply security and
how to build an efficient gas market.
</P>
<P>
Other cooperation activities between IEA and China are helping
China have a modernized energy statistical system, modelling and
analysis know-how, and plans for translating IEA publications into
Chinese and for exchanging information.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1974 in the wake of the 1973 Oil Crisis, the IEA
now has 24 member countries.
</P>
<P>
It began policy dialogue with China from the early 1990s on the
basis of mutual benefit and equality.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ruling Party Vows to Uproot Careerism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) Friday vowed to eliminate elements of careerism
from the organization.
</P>
<P>
"The minority among our members are wolves in sheep's skins whose
purpose is not the betterment of the lives of the people," the ANC National
Executive Committee said in a statement to mark the 87th birthday of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"Their objective is to prey on the people and on society, for personal
benefit," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement, read by ANC President Thabo Mbeki, noted that some of
these people had made themselves available for nomination as ANC candidates
for the forthcoming provincial and national elections.
</P>
<P>
"But we must make clear that your movement will take all necessary steps
to ensure that these fail to smuggle themselves into the ranks of the
genuine representatives of the people," it said.
</P>
<P>
"On this important 87th year of the African National Congress, we must
take this one of our central tasks, to remove from our ranks these rotten
eggs which our society lays every day."
</P>
<P>
The 87th birthday celebrations are regarded as the beginning of ANC's
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for a mobilization of the masses for this year's
general election.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Launch General Offensive on Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Rebels in Sierra Leone have launched a
general offensive against the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG in
the west end of capital Freetown, reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rebel commander Sam Bockarie was quoted as saying "our plan started
since last night", adding that "my men are on the move. We will take Lungi
(airport). That is not a secret any more. We know we can do it."
</P>
<P>
Bockarie is in fact the No. 1 commander in the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) movement following the detention of its leader Foday Sankoh who
was sentenced to death for supporting the coup which ousted Kabbah in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed a cease-fire order from Sankoh broadcast on the pro-
government radio in Freetown Thursday night as faked.
</P>
<P>
The recording was made by Sankoh in 1996 and sent to fighters in the
bush after he signed a short-lived deal with Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in Abidjan,
capital of Cote d'Voire, the RUF leader noted.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said Thursday in a statement that he had reached a seven-day
cease-fire agreement with rebel leader Sankoh who is being kept in prison,
adding that Sankoh would be released if the truce and other conditions were
met.
</P>
<P>
Bockarie said that "what I heard from Kabbah last night made me
intensify my offensive. He is not the one to call for a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council Thursday night issued a
presidential statement, condemning "the unacceptable attempt by the rebels
to overthrow by force the democratically-elected government of Sierra Leone.
"
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its "grave concern" with the rebel
attacks in Sierra Leone's capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"The Council demands that the rebels lay down their arms immediately and
cease all violence," the statement said, adding that only through dialog
and reconciliation can peace and stability return to Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Businesses Welcomed to Invest in Uganda: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda welcomes more and more Chinese
businesses to invest in the east African country and help build the country'
s
growing economy, Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya said here Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya made the remarks at a dinner party hosted for his visiting
Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, China's annual exports to Uganda stand at only 10 million U.
S.
Dollars and Uganda's exports to China are only a small fraction of that
figure," said Kategaya.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working hard to improve our investment climate. We
believe conditions are conducive for more Chinese investors to come to
Uganda. We appeal to the Chinese government to give them encouragement as
they may require," the Ugandan foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, there is a lot of room for improvement," he noted. "We should
work together to expand fields of cooperation and multiply contacts for
mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
Uganda's economic development is one of the few success stories on the
African continent. At present, foreign investors put in more than 800
million Dollars, accounting for over 50 percent of the country's total
licensed investment.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Central Bank in Move to Stabilize Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Friday
issued fresh operational guidelines to the banking sector to ensure
stability following later last year's crisis when five banks collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The rules range from gradually raising the statutory share capital
requirement to lending to influential people, according to the bank. The
move followed a day-long meeting between them and chief executives of
local banks.
</P>
<P>
However, CBK Governor Micah Cheserem told reporters that local bankers
had rejected a CBK proposal for the sector to adopt a policy of reporting
the prime lending rate as opposed to the current system where banks only
made public the base lending rate.
</P>
<P>
He said the CBK had made the proposal following complaints from
customers that base rates announced by banks were advertising gimmicks and
that actual rates charged remained almost as high.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said the CBK proposes to raise the minimum statutory share
capital requirement for banks from the current 200 million Shillings (one
U.S. Dollar equals some 61 Shillings) to 500 million Shillings by 2002.
That
of non-bank financial institutions would similarly be raised from 150
million Shillings to 375 million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
He said banks would be required to increase the share capital to 300
million Shillings by December 2000, to 400 million Shillings by December
2001 and 500 million Shillings by December 2002.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Debt Restructuring Gathers Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 82 billion baht (2.3
billion U.S. dollars) in loans have been successfully restructured
to date in Thailand, representing 12.2 percent of the 674 billion
baht (18.7 billion dollars) in loans pending negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Corporate debt restructuring had begun to speed up, but overall
progress was still behind demand, Thailand's central bank said in
a statement available on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Bankers' Association, the Foreign Banks' Association
and the Association of Finance Companies are drafting an agreement
to help expedite restructuring negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and Thai creditors would consider the draft next week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial institutions had mostly extended unsecured
loans to local corporations, while loans from Thai banks were
secured with collateral.
</P>
<P>
Debt restructuring had been complicated by the need for Thai
and foreign creditors to negotiate their positions on assets and
claims.
</P>
<P>
The government has established debt restructuring committees in
55 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry is also considering reducing taxes on
condominium transfers in debt-restructuring cases to 0.01 percent
from 2 percent. The government had earlier approved a reduction in
transfer taxes to 0.01 percent from 2 percent for land and
property.

BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Roberto Matute, member of the
Directors Committee of the Central American Parliament, has
expressed hope for the further development of friendly ties and
strengthened cooperation with China in wide-ranging areas,
including culture, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
 Matute, head of a Central American parliament delegation
visiting China made the comments in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua News Agency on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
 He said members of the delegation will brief fellow
parliamentarians on the actual situation in China. He also
pledged to work diligently to find ways to improve relations
between China and countries in Central America.
</P>
<P>
 The Central American Parliament, established in 1991, is one
of the most influential political organizations in the region. A
number of member nations have not as yet established diplomatic
ties with China, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua and Panama.
</P>
<P>
 The visit is the first by a delegation from the Central Ameri
can Parliament. The delegation consists of representatives from
political parties in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
 Members of the delegation will meet with leaders of the
Chinese Association for International Understanding, the Inter
national Department of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National
People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
 The delegation's goal is to learn more about China and
promote mutual understanding, according to Matute. He said the
visit will enable the delegation to witness China's progress. He
noted that China is following a path suited to prevailing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
 We clearly made a wise decision in visiting China, said
Matute, who is also the leader of National Party of Honduras.

<P>
 Matute said members of the delegation are deeply impressed
with China's monumental achievements in reform and opening-up
drive over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
 He noted that domestic reform and opening to the outside
world have been two of the major factors contributing to China's
rapid development. We can learn a great deal from China's
experiences, according to Matute.
</P>
<P>
 He also praised China for an economic growth rate of 7.8
percent in spite of the adverse impact of the Asian financial
crisis and last year's summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
 He said business representatives in the delegation plan to
discuss the issues related to economic and trade cooperation. "We
also plan to invite Chinese officials to visit Central America,"

AMMAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko
Koumura arrived here Saturday on a two-day official visit as part
of his regional tour to bolster Japan`s role in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Koumura will hold talks with Jordanian Crown Prince and the
Regent Hassan Ibn Talal, Prime Minister Koumura Fayez Tarawaneh,
Foreign Minister Abdel Itah al-Khatib on bilateral ties and the
latest developments in the Middle East process.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to sign with Jordanian Planning Minister
Nabeel Ammari on an agreement to extend a soft loan of 63 million
U.S. dollars as development aid to the kingdom`s tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
On per capita basis, Jordan is the largest recipient of Japan`s
official development assistance loans among the developing
countries. Tokyo contributed 82 million dollars as development aid
to the kingdom with a population of 4.2 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Amman is the forth leg of Koumura`s week-long Middle East
tour, which had taken him to Egypt, Lebanon, Syria. He will leave
for Israel and Palestinian self-ruled areas after his two-day
visit to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure from Tokyo last week, Koumura said Japan
would use its economic and political weight to strongly appeal to
Israel and the Palestinians to stick to the terms agreed upon in
the land-for-security Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord, signed last October 23, was virtually shelved
after the Israeli Knesset (parliament) finally approved a bill for
early elections.

LUSAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba will
visit Zimbabwe Sunday to discuss how to put an end to the five-month
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with his Zimbabwean
counterpart Robert Mugabe, Zambian Foreign Ministry announced here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba held similar talks Thursday in Kigali with Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu and vice-president Major General Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Chiluba, Bizimungu said, "It was a very
interesting meeting which dealt with many important issues concerning the
restoration of peace in Congo."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's visit to Rwanda and forthcoming visit to Zimbabwe are part of
his preparations for the long awaited peace talks on the war in DRC, which
would have been held in Lusaka on December 8 of 1998 and now has been
rescheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka regional summit on the Congo (k) issue has been postponed
three times because of Congolese President Laurent Kabila's refusal to have
direct talks with the rebels who began their fighting to topple Kabila last
August.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Thursday that now all the warring parties have agreed to
meet to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of backing the rebels while Zimbabwe,
 Namibia, Angola and Chad have sent their troops to DRC to support Kabila.

<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A Saturday fire heavily damaged
the Hualong Wholesale Lamp Market, the largest market of its kind
in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported, but early estimates
indicate losses could reach as high as two million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The market, located in the Fengtai District in southwestern
Beijing, covers 10,145 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses report the fire erupted in the southwestern corner
of the market at 11:06 (Beijing Time) on Saturday morning.
Forty-two fire engines and three ambulances rushed to the scene
and firefighters brought the blaze under control by 19:30.
</P>
<P>
The lack of water sources in the area hampered efforts to
extinguish the blaze. The timely response of fire departments
limited the damage to a 2-3 block area, with neighboring
buildings and two nearby hotel escaping damage.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are investigating the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
A similar blaze in the Fengtai District on May 5, 1998,
damaged the city's largest furniture market and resulted in
losses of over 20 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The 3,937 fires were reported in the Chinese capital during
the first 10 months of last year claimed 28 lives and injured 90
people. Direct losses from the fires hit 34.58 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local fire departments have introduced extensive measures in
recent years to prevent fires in markets and construction sites.
For example, relevant authorities recently closed a large
furniture market because of inadequate fire prevention
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Not Allowed to Threaten Neighbors: Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will not be allowed to
threaten its neighbors again, visiting British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who arrived here earlier for a one-day official visit,
made the remark to reporters at Kuwait's Ali Al-Salem Air Base,
where 12 British Royal Air Force Tornado fighter jets are based.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait has suffered most from the invasion and occupation by
Iraq" in 1990-1991, he said, adding "What Saddam has to realize
is that we are not going to allow him to threaten his
neighborhood and the stability of the region."
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi
crisis, Blair said "we have always said that we are perfectly
happy to have a diplomatic solution. But the diplomatic solution
must be based on Saddam abiding by the agreements" he signed
with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We remain ready and willing to act if he poses a threat to the
region again," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said "the future for Iraq is in Saddam's hands,"
apparently kicking the ball to the Iraqi side on issues such as
lifting of the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1980,
can only be removed after U.N. weapons inspectors certify that
Baghdad has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister declined to say whether the
mission of the U.N. Special Commission, or known as UNSCOM in
charge of disarming Iraq, is over or not.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq in
mid-December "had killed UNSCOM" and it will never allow
U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Before touring the air base which is about 80 kilometers north
of Kuwait City, Blair had met with Kuwaiti Emir Jaber and his
Kuwaiti counterpart Crown Prince Sheikh Saad. But details of the
talks were not available.
</P>
<P>
Blair is scheduled to leave Kuwait later Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Public Confidence in Government Declines in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A well-known professor from
the Harvard University of the United States said here Saturday
that public confidence in government has declined in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Delivering to Singapore public servants a lecture titled
"Building the People's Trust in Government", Joseph Nye Jr. said:
"In 1964 three quarters of the American public said that they
trusted the federal government to do right thing most of the time.
In recent years, depending on the polls, only a quarter to a third
do."
</P>
<P>
The number are only slightly better for state and local
government, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting the government is not alone, he said over the past three
decades public confidence has dropped in half for many major
institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to him, confidence fell from 61 percent to 30 percent
for universities, from 55 percent to 21 percent for major
companies, from 73 percent go 29 percent for medicine and 29
percent to 14 percent for journalism.
</P>
<P>
Nye said the United States has always had a mistrust of
government and part of the current problem may be that American
expectation of government became too high after World War II.
</P>
<P>
Professor Nye is in Singapore for giving public lectures as the
49th Lee Kuan Yew Distinguished Visitor.

<HEADLINE> Williams Sisters to Start U.S.-China Tennis Exchange Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The program, labeled Total Understanding, Freedom &AMP; Friendship
through American/Chinese Tennis, or (TUFFACT), was developed by
the Williams sisters in order to "promote the ideals of
scholarship, personal integrity, leadership, and citizenship
through tennis."
</P>
<P>
Venus, who just won the Hong Kong Super-Power Challenge Cup
Saturday, said: "Although I have not been to Beijing, but I know
there are some similar interest and hobbies between Chinese and
American youth. That's why I made this plan to use tennis to
build bridges of friendship between our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Williams sisters just finished their high school studies last
year. Venus said: "I like high school life. I really want to go
back to high school again."
</P>
<P>
According to Leland Hardy, agent of the Williams sisters,
Venus realizes that many young people in China love tennis but,
like her, may not have had adequate exposure to the sport or
access to facilities. She aimed to use her status as a tennis
celebrity to be an "American Ambassador of Tennis to Chinese
youth."
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old and her sister Serena, 17, have become the
world's top players despite not having had private lessons from
any professional coach or access to exclusive private tennis
clubs.
</P>
<P>
With the plan, six high schools will be identified from six
different provinces or cities in China, and contacts will be
built through the Williams sisters with six American high schools.
</P>
<P>
Venus said she will try to visit Beijing and other Chinese
cities to promote her plan this summer.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar Strengthen Cooperation Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar are set to
strengthen their cooperation against drug smuggling by jointly
conducting an anti-drug operation, Thai government officials said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A two-day meeting to this effect is scheduled on next Monday,
the officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is to be held in Myanmar's Tachilek town,
will be attended by anti-narcotics officials from both countries.
</P>
<P>
Office of the Narcotics Control Board in Thailand will
represent Thailand in the talks with its Myanmar counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will propose that both countries launch a joint
operation to root out narcotics along the border areas. The
proposed joint operation will also cover the participation of Thai
and Myanmar representatives in interrogating drug suspects.
</P>
<P>
"Illicit drugs have posed a threat to the national security of
both countries. To efficiently wipe out narcotics, Thailand and
Myanmar must join forces in tackling the problem," said Pornthep
Iemprapai, chief of the Narcotics Suppression Office in Chiang
Rai, Northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed joint operation will cover all procedures,
including joint raids, exchange of information and joint
interrogation of drug suspects," Pornthep told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The proposal on the joint operation followed a recent
successful raid by local anti-narcotics suppression officials from
Chiang Rai and Tachilek in which large quantities of amphetamines
and chemical substances used in the manufacture of drugs were
seized.
</P>
<P>
According to Thai officials, there were 11 drug-producing
factories along the border opposite Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai and Mae
Hong Son provinces in Northern Thailand. But Myanmar officials
said there as many as 22 factories along the border.

<HEADLINE> S. African Family Pleads for Rescue of Members in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The family of the South African
father and son who went missing when two U.N. chartered planes were shot
down in Angola issued a plea to Angolan authorities on Saturday to help U.N.
rescue missions get to the crash sites.
</P>
<P>
The Wilkinson family said in a statement that they were still hopeful
that pilot John Wilkinson and his son, Hilton, were still alive.
</P>
<P>
The statement was released to South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to all relevant authorities to consider the 23 people
involved in the crashes and their families and facilitate immediate access
to the crash sites so rescue operations can begin," the family said.
</P>
<P>
Two Hercules C-130 transport planes, chartered by the U.N. observer
mission in Angola, were believed to have been shot down by National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels in central Huambo
Province.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have denied the allegations, but refused to guarantee safe
passage to rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
The first flight, piloted by John Wilkinson, was shot down on December
26. The second flight, carrying Hilton, who was trying to find his father,
was shot down on January 2.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan army has claimed that 14 people aboard the first plane were
alive and being held by the rebels in their central strongholds of Andulo
and Bailundo.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the nine who were aboard the second aircraft, including four
U.N. employees, are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
However, a reporter who visited the crash site of the first plane Friday,
 said charred and decomposing bodies were still in the wreckage.

HANOI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese residing in foreign
countries have invested in 70 projects in Vietnam with a combined
capital of 200 million U.S. dollars in 1998, Vietnam News Agency
(VNA) said Saturday , quoting an official report.
</P>
<P>
Over two million Vietnamese live in 70 countries worldwide, and
around 200,000 of them visited Vietnam last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties caused by the on-going regional
financial-monetary crisis, Vietnam has maintained political and
socio-economic stability, VNA said, adding that these achievements
have encouraged overseas Vietnamese to arouse sentiments towards
their motherland.
</P>
<P>
This year, VNA said, the government will continue to develop
policies relating to overseas Vietnamese and disseminate policies
of the party and state to overseas Vietnamese's communities in all
parts of the world with a view to help them better understand the
current situation in the country and make practical contributions
to the national industrialization and modernization program.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian cabinet approved on
Saturday the draft ninth five-year plan (1997-2002) with a 6.5
percent average growth rate and a total expenditure of 3,740
billion rupees (approximately 88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The long-delayed plan includes an allocation of 220 billion

R. Hashim, a secretary of the Planning Commission, said that the
government had provided three billion rupees (70.58 million U.S.
dollars) to support information technology in the country.
</P>

<P>
According to the official, the government had targeted six
percent growth in the current financial year from March 31, 1998,

the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan, of which the approval has been delayed for more
than a year due to political instability in the country, will be
immediately circulated among state governments for discussions and
the National Development Council will hold a meeting within a
month to approve the plan.

MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday expected the country's new election body chief to
help his administration eliminate massive cheating during
elections.
</P>
<P>
During a radio speech, he reaffirmed his full trust and
confidence in Justice Harriet Demetriou as the new chairperson of

Earlier, Estrada said he chose Demetriou as the poll body chief
because of her integrity and track record as a member of the
judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Govt De-registers Biggest Trade Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's Labor Department
Saturday de-registered the country's largest union for its failure to
submit annual financial reports for inspection, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Swaziland Agriculture, Plantation and Allied Workers Union (SAPAWU)
has 15,000 members and its de-registration could severely cripple the
operations of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
SFTU is one of the three major opposition groups in the tiny kingdom,
where political parties have been banned since 1976.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Labor Department said SAPAWU had repeatedly ignored
ultimatums by the government to submit its annual returns as required by
Swazi law.
</P>
<P>
SAPAWU's General Secretary Jan Sithole, who is concurrently SFTU general
secretary, challenged the de-registration, saying that the department had
no power to take such a drastic action.
</P>
<P>
Sithole said de-registering of unions is the prerogative of the
industrial court.
</P>
<P>
He said SAPAWU's failure to submit financial returns was the result of
changes in the union's financial year end and changes in leadership
structures.
</P>
<P>
The union's financial year-end has been changed from March to September.

MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
garnered some 50 million U.S. dollars in long-term investments
from domestic businesses following the issue of its 1-billion-U.S.

volunteering long-term investments after the government reported
the bonds are oversubscribed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Bankers Association has
announced that local interest rate will go down 0.25 percent next
Monday following the latest interest cut in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three months, there were four cuts in Hong Kong
and Macao, which pulled down the rate by one percent in a whole.
The last decrease was made on December 18.
</P>
<P>
Business people in the real estate sector believe that the
readjustment will boost sluggish housing market to some extent,
but the current rate is too high to stimulate investment and
consumption considerably.
</P>
<P>
With the Macao currency of pataca pegged to Hong Kong dollar,
there have been interest cuts in Macao as long as interest rate
in Hong Kong drops.
</P>
<P>
Banking analysts believe there is still potential for interest
cuts in Hong Kong, and decreases might add up to one percent in
the first half of the year.

HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa Saturday
called on local community to put the interest of Hong Kong as a
whole in the first place.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a number of Legislative Councilors here

for a better future for Hong Kong.
</P>

more attractive than a lot of places. This is because we practice
free trade and the rule of law, we have a low taxation system and
a cautious fiscal policy, our people are creative and we provide
a level playing field for businesses."
</P>
<P>
Tung pointed out: "The 'one country, two systems' concept puts
Hong Kong in a strong position to develop our special status. We

more job opportunities."

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Governors to Meet in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Andrew Crockett, general
manager of the Bank for International Settlement (BIS), arrived
in Hong Kong Saturday for an informal meeting of central bank
governors hosted by the BIS at its Representative Office for Asia
and the Pacific in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Crockett told reporters at the airport that
the purpose of the meeting to be held on Monday is to review the
global economic and financial situation and to exchange views on
the ongoing process of strengthening financial systems in
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Crockett said that the meeting is a normal and routine
activity of the BIS, which will provide an opportunity for
central bank governors to talk to each other about the world
economic situation on a rather regular basis.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a decision oriented meeting but a meeting to
exchange views," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants of the meeting will be governors of 11
central banks and monetary authorities in the Asia-Pacific region
-- those of Australia, the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New
Zealand, China, the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Other participants include governors of the central banks of
Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Mexico and the Czech Republic as well as
the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States
and the president of the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Crockett said that the BIS is primarily an European
organization. But as part of its policy of global outreach, the
BIS, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, organizes meetings in
different parts of the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
The BIS opened its first overseas office in Hong Kong in July
last year with an aim to strengthen relations between the BIS and
central banks and monetary authorities in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The BIS will hold a board meeting in Shanghai in July this
year, Crockett disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the financial situation in Asia, Crockett said that
the crisis has been contained and it is now time to look forward
to real economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the crystal ball but I think there are some
encouraging sides," Crockett said. The stabilization and
strengthening of the exchange rates is important for the
financial side to recover, he said.
</P>
<P>
The BIS, founded in 1930, is an international financial
organization with a membership of 45 shareholding central banks.
Its main objectives are to provide a forum for international
monetary and financial cooperation and to act as a bank for
central banks.

</P>
<P>

He thanked the Ugandan government for the help it extended to the
Chinese construction team during 1992-1996 construction period of the
stadium, hoping that the stadium can play a big role in promoting the
competitiveness of Ugandan sports and the local people's physique.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Supports S. Leonean President's Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) has expressed its support to the peace initiative launched
by Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate said Friday in capital Abuja
that he was encouraged by the ceasefire announced by Kabbah in Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone, The Guardian reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed Kabbah had accepted the need for a "change in
strategy" in his country's conflict, replacing confrontation with the
rebels with dialog.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Kouyate said that Kabbah believed that the rebels should go
before the courts and undergo the process of law. Now Kabbah has agreed
there must be a political solution, Kouyate added.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate noted that ECOWAS's policy is "both strengthening ECOMOG (the
west African peacekeeping force) and following a political solution."
ECOMOG will continue to play a peacekeeping role in Sierra Leone and has
not been compromised by the fighting, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday by the Secretariat of the ECOWAS in Abuja,
Togolese President Gnass Eyadema, who is current chairman of ECOWAS,
expressed concern over events in Sierra Leone and called for the laying
down of arms.
</P>
<P>
Eyadema said that a resort to arms has never solved any conflict
whatever their nature may be, urging the rebel forces in Sierra Leone to
put a stop to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Leonean rebel leader Sam Bockarie said Friday that the rebel
forces had launched a general offensive against Nigerian-led west African
peacekeeping force in Freetown and claimed to attack the Lungi
International Airport where President Kabbah had been taking shelter since
rebels started attacks on the capital last Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. International Religious Freedom Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Ye Xiaowen, director of the
State Administration of Religious Affairs, met with a visiting
U.S. official Friday in Beijing and expressed resolute opposition
to any act of using the religious issue to interfere in internal
affairs of other nations.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Robert Seiple, special representative of
the U.S. Secretary of State for International Religious Freedom,
Ye outlined the Chinese government's policy of protecting freedom
of religious belief and the development of China's religions in
the 20 years of the country's reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government implements the policy of
freedom of religious belief and guarantee Chinese citizens'
freedom of religious belief in line with the Constitution and
laws.
</P>
<P>
China is a country advocating rule by law and all men, no
matter whether they believe in religions or not, are equal
before the law, Ye said, adding that because of different
political, economic, cultural backgrounds and different
religious and cultural traditions, it is natural that different
countries have different views on the religious issue.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side is willing to increase exchanges with other
countries in the field of religion on the basis of equality and
mutual respect, but we resolutely oppose any act of using the
religious issue to interfere in the internal affairs of other cou
ntries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the "International Religious Freedom Act" adopted by the
U.S. House of Representative and Senate last year, Ye said that
it is the matter of its own for the United States to formulate or
implement laws and administrate its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it should be noted that if a country meddles
in other countries' religious affairs and internal affairs
through its own domestic legislation and even put pressure on
them by threatening to impose sanctions, what it does violates
the principles of the international law and is not conducive to
the exchanges in the field of religion between the countries.
</P>
<P>
As head of the Administration of Religious Affairs of the
Chinese government, Ye said that his bureau concerns and is
devoted to the promotion and safeguarding of religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
He raised the following principles on this issue:
</P>
<P>
-- Based on related international conventions and on the basis
of mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs, all the countries should more effectively materialize
and protect freedom of religious belief through their own
legislation as well as judicial and administrative means;
</P>
<P>
-- The international community should jointly condemn
religious extremists which endanger the peace of the world;
</P>
<P>
-- Religions and sects should respect and tolerate each other;
</P>
<P>
-- Countries with different cultural backgrounds should
increase exchanges and understanding to seek common grounds while
putting aside differences and replace confrontation with
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Seiple said he was deeply impressed by the tremendous progress
China has made since he made his first China visit in 1988. He
said that to increase exchanges in the religion field between the
United States and China is conducive to the development of bi
lateral relations.

In his interactive live interview shortly after giving his

"I hope the rebels won't try my patience because I will not
back off," he said, "I also hope our Muslim rebels will show
sincerity in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF have agreed to resume formal peace
negotiations in the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said the
agreement was reached during an informal meeting between the
government and the MILF last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is one of two rebel groups with which the Estrada
administration is pursuing peace negotiations. The other is the
National Democratic Front.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Declined in December 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The downward trend in inflation continued
in December 1998 in Kenya, attributed to the slow monetary expansion,
stability in the Shilling exchange rate and recent improvements in the
supply of basic foods, according to the latest issue of Central Bank of
Kenya (CBK)'s Monthly Economic Review available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly review shows that the inflation remained within the single
digit range in December 1998. Month-on-month inflation declined to 7.7
percent in December from 7.9 percent in November; and three months
annualized inflation remained low at 3.7 percent in December compared with
3.6 percent in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
The average annual inflation edged up to 9.8 percent in December from 9.
6 percent in November 1998 reflecting the relatively higher inflation
experienced over the first half of 1998, said the review, noting that the
significant improvements in the supply of basic foods, particularly over
the fourth quarter of 1998, had led to further deceleration in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The review explains that low inflation was evident in almost all foods,
drinks and tobacco and miscellaneous goods. However, the transport and
communications continued to experience higher inflation than other sectors
due to the poor state of roads and inefficient telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
The factors causing low inflation, especially over the last quarter
of 1998, included sustained reduction in the expansion of money supply to
levels consistent with the slowdown in the output of goods and services;
stability in the Shilling exchange rate; and decline in the international
prices of some essential imports.
</P>
<P>
To reduce further inflation, the review says, the annual expansion in
broad money in the year to June 1999 will be maintained at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling on the expansion of money supply is considered sufficient to
allow economic growth to recover by December 1999. The tight monetary
policy will be supported by sustained prudent fiscal operations and
expected increase in confidence in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
The review forecasts that the prevailing low inflation is expected to
continue into 1999, with the month-on-month inflation targeted to fall to
below 5 percent by June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Diesel Prices Reduced by 10 Percent in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- India reduced diesel prices by
nearly 10 percent effective from midnight Friday following a
sustained downward trend in international prices for the past five
months.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the cut at the inaugurating ceremony of an
international conference "Petrotech-99" here Friday, Petroleum
Minister V. K. Ramamurthy said diesel prices had been lowered in
line with the government policy to pass on benefits of price dips
in international market to domestic consumers.
</P>
<P>
The reduction range from 0.98 rupees (the current official
exchange rate is 42.52 rupees for one U.S. dollar) per liter in
Delhi, 1.15 rupees in Mumbai, 1.10 rupees in Chennai and 1.05
rupees in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the revision, diesel is now available at 8.89
rupees in Delhi, 10.04 rupees in Mumbai, 9.79 rupees in Chennai
and 9.11 rupees in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
However, the revision does not truly reflect the actual drop in
international prices as part of the price benefits is being
maintained to amortize bonds.
</P>
<P>
Low international prices of diesel, which have ruled between
13.37 U.S. dollars a barrel in October and 10.8 a barrel in
December last year, would mean a landed price of around 6,000
rupees per ton.
</P>
<P>
With local levies, the diesel price should rule at around 7 to
7.50 rupees a liter.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in diesel prices is expected to hit government
finances hard but will benefit the economy in general at the time
when the government is battling hard to rein in fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
This is the third downward revision in diesel prices since
India's decision to link domestic prices to import parity prices a
year ago.

<HEADLINE> Drought Poses Threat to Kenya: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan meteorological department has
warned that the east African country will experience a full-fledged drought
in January and February.
</P>
<P>
J.K. Njihia, the Deputy Director of meteorological services, said Friday
this was in line with global climatic prediction models on the La Nina
weather phenomenon, and the "long rains" season which usually starts in
late March is expected to be below normal, characterized by long dry spells.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike El Nino, which causes heavy rains, La Nina suppresses rainfall
with maximum effects over the eastern sector where the rains are associated
 with the east-west arm of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone," he was
quoted by Saturday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Global climate predictions forecast that the cold sea surface
temperatures associated with La Nina will be sustained up to June.
</P>
<P>
The lack of rainfall over the eastern sector of the country will
aggravate the
already dry conditions in the region and farming, pastoral, water resource
management and other sectors that depend on rain will be adversely affected,
he warned.
</P>
<P>
"Negative impact will be felt in the agricultural sector where the crop
output is expected to be below average," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Njihia said, the coastal areas may receive occasional morning
showers over few places while Western and the Lake Basin are expected to
receive occasional afternoon showers and thunderstorms over a few places.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has reportedly decided to purchase some 270
million kilograms of maize to boost the country's strategic reserves as a
drought-related famine is threatening northeastern areas.
</P>
<P>
Kenya harvested a bumper 2.34 billion kg of maize last year but the poor
rainfall in the October-December "short rains'' season caused crop failures
and threatened famine in northeastern Kenya.

<HEADLINE> WRSA to Hold First Symposium Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua)-- The Western Returned Scholars
Association (WRSA), a non-governmental organization for students
who have returned after studying abroad, will hold a symposium in
Washington this August, its first ever abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Jiansheng, deputy secretary of the
association, the symposium will focus on three topics closely
connected to China's development, namely resources and
environment, science and education, and economy and finance.
Twenty three associations for Chinese students in the U.S. will
join hands with the WRSA in organizing the symposium.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the association has sponsored a series of
symposiums on issues relating to China's development in the next
century. Participants include those who have returned and those
who are currently studying abroad, mainly in the U.S., Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Australia, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
By this way, the association recommends nearly 100 articles to
relevant government departments each year, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Serial symposiums are only a part of a plan aimed at helping
those Chinese students who have studied or who are presently
studying abroad to serve for the country in its economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
The plan also includes introducing new ideas to the
government, helping State-owned enterprises with technical and
management difficulties, popularize students' research results.
So far, 97 items covering trade and technical information,
enterprise management problems, and suggestions to the country's
development have been collected and released via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to State statistics, some 300,000 Chinese people
have received education or currently studying abroad, and among
them, about 100,000 have returned.

<HEADLINE> Poor Rains to Threaten Kenya's Tea Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The production of tea, Kenya's leading
foreign exchange earner, reached record levels in 1998 but poor seasonal
short rains has threatened tea crops for the new year, Africa Tea Broker
(ATB) said in a statement Friday .
</P>
<P>
"In contrast with 1997, the 1998 crop benefited from good growing
conditions resulting from recorded crops, particularly during the first
half of the year," ATB noted.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's agricultural Minister Musalia Mudavadi said this week that
seasonal short rains, which normally run from October to December, had
arrived a month late and has then trailed off early.
</P>
<P>
"Crop levels will continue to decline unless more rainfall is received,"
 ATB said, adding that all tea growing areas in the country remained dry
and tea crops faced severe moisture stress.
</P>
<P>
ATB said weather had cast a shadow on the country's tea crops and a
repeat of the high production figures of 1998 was doubtful for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first 11 months of 1998 show tea production at 267.65
 million kg, a rise of 37.37 percent over the 1997 same period.
</P>
<P>
The sector's 1998 production forecasts have hovered between 280 million
kg and 290 million kg. Kenya's tea export earnings rose to 23.9 billion
Shillings (386.1 million U.S. Dollars) in the first eight months, compared
with 14.1 billion Shillings in the 1997 same period, according to data from
the Central Bank of Kenya issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that this eastern African country is the world leading
exporter of black tea, which is Kenya's leading exchange earner, ahead of
tourism, coffee and horticulture.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide information
technology (IT) spending will grow to over 1,100 brillion U.S.
dollars in the year 2002, according to a new study released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Led by strong growth in software, services and data communicat
ions, IT spending will increase 9.6 percent annually from 1997
through 2002, said the U.S. research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC) in its 1998 edition of the Worldwide Black Book.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the forecast period, North America will continue to
outpace worldwide growth in spending on IT products and services,
IDC said. But in 1998, growth in Western Europe, at an estimated
10.3 percent, outpaced worldwide and North America's growth.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide spending on IT products and services totaled 720.5
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, a growth of 6.3 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese IT market declined 7.6 percent in 1997 due to a
decline in the value of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
In the rest of Asia, IDC said, the polarization of countries
into growth markets like China and troubled markets like ASEAN
and South Korea is a new phenomenon, and vendors are struggling
to adapt to the new market realities.
</P>
<P>
While Russia and Latin America are showing downward trends,
growth remains strong in all segments of the IT market in the
Middle East and Africa, confirming the importance of the region
as an emerging market to the evolving global picture.
</P>
<P>
IDC's research was based on 52 countries. IT spending covered

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Export Raw Ivory to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has met all the stringent
conditions set by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES) and is now almost certain to get permission to sell its
experimental 20-ton quota of raw ivory to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Willie Makombe, the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife
Management of Zimbabwe, said Friday the experimental trade, which is likely
 to begin in
March this year, will earn the country millions of Dollars needed to
finance conservation and development activities.
</P>
<P>
In acccording with an evaluation team from the CITES which was in the
country last month, Zimbabwe has rectified and met stringent conditions set
during the 10th meeting of the parties to the CITES to trade 20 tons of
ivory with Japan, Makombe said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe was liaising with the Ministry of International Trade
of Japan to obtain details on the likely buyers, the daily Herald reported
Saturday..
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia successfully lobbied for the down listing
of elephants from Appendix one to two during the 10th meeting of the
parties to the CITES held in Harare in 1997. Trade in animals and their
products of those listed in Appendix one is strictly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Limited trade of trophies, skins and any other elephant products for non-
commercial use from the three countries was taking place with the European
Union when it revised its regulations to fully reflect the CITES resolution
to down list the elephants to Appendix two, Makombe said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Raw Jute Exports Down 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's raw jute export fell
by more than 50 percent during the current fiscal year (July
1998-June 1999) compared to that of the previous fiscal year, The
Daily Star daily newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Only 613,000 bales (110,340 tons) of raw jute were exported
from the country during the July-December period against 1.277
million bales in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal
year, the report quoted sources from the Bangladesh Jute
Association (BJA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from the jute sector also declined by over 50
percent, coming down to about 1.13 billion taka (about 23.3
million U.S. dollars) in the period from nearly 2.37 billion taka
(about 48.9 million dollars) in the same period of the last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for the decline in export earnings are price
falls in the international market, less import by major
jute-buying countries and an economic recession throughout the
world, jute exporters said.
</P>
<P>
Due to a dull export market, the traders are in a bad situation
with their stocks, and "they are burdened with around 700,000 to
800,000 bales of jute," said BJA's vice-president Rezaul Karim.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi jute exporters hope that major jute importing
countries will buy more raw jute from the country, Karim added.
</P>
<P>
Admitting the fall in raw jute export, State Minister for Jute
A.K. Faezul Huq said that the government was now mulling over
sending a delegation to some jute-importing countries to persuade
them into buying more jute from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned mills could buy the piled up jute on a
deferred payment basis to bail out the traders from this fallen
situation, Huq said.
</P>
<P>
Jute goods export by private mills had also declined by about
20 percent due to the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 40 privately-owned jute mills, of which,
35 are running and the rest have already been closed down.
</P>
<P>
The jute sector is a major foreign exchange earner of the
country which earns about 400 million dollars every year from the
export of raw jute and jute products.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Clear Streets of Beggars in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in the Tanzanian
capital plan to clear the streets of beggars who are seen as an eye sore
and a source of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf Makamba, the Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner, has formed a
task force to repatriate beggars to their places of origin.
</P>
<P>
The force will comprise the police force, intelligence service, the
regional social welfare department, regional youth development department
and district administrative officers, The African newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Makamba said most of the beggars are physically sound and the nation
expects them to engage in farming activities in their hometowns instead of
loitering in the city begging.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a local development council in Dar es Salaam Friday, the
regional commissioner said beggars are an unpleasant sight in the city
especially when foreign tourists come to visit.
</P>
<P>
He also accused beggars of defecating everywhere thus polluting the city
center.
</P>
<P>
As for the beggars who are elderly, orphans and the handicapped, Makamba
said, they will be registered and assisted through the Social Welfare
Department.
</P>
<P>
Social welfare officials said regional commissioners in the past
launched several campaigns to drive beggars out of the town but failed as
they would always come back after repatriation.

<HEADLINE> Dokic Beats Carlsson at Hopman Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian teenager Jelena
Dokic recorded a straight sets win over a higher ranked player on
Saturday to give Australia a 1-0 lead in the at the Hopman Cup
mixed team tournament final against Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Australia's world junior No.1 Dokic, ranked 341st in the
world, beat Asa Carlsson, ranked 91, to put Australia within one
match of winning its first ever Hopman Cup.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Martina Hingis, who smiles her way past opponent after
opponent, the 15-year-old Dokic has the steely, distanced look of
an assassin on the court.
</P>
<P>
She quickly seized on the weakness of the Carlsson serve and
was ruthless, breaking the Swede on six occasions on the way to a
6-2, 7-6 (10-8) win.
</P>
<P>
Dokic took the first set in 31 minutes and raced to a 4-1 lead
in the second, with two early breaks.
</P>
<P>
The Swede wasn't going to give in though and broke back to
claw her way back to 4-3 as Dokic started to tire.
</P>
<P>
Carlsson had two more break points in the eighth game to get
back on serve, but Dokic showed great composure under pressure,
producing some powerful forehand winners to hold serve for a 5-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
However, the 23-year-old Swede saved three match points in a
marathon game on her serve before holding for 5-4 and then broke
back to love to silence the expectant home crowd.
</P>
<P>
Carlsson held for 6-5, before Dokic returned the favour to
force a tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Dokic downed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain in
straight sets at the Hopman Cup.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Outpaces Airbus in '98 Order Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Airlines and other
customers placed 656 orders with Boeing in 1998, giving the
Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer 55 percent of the market for
new commercial-jet orders.
</P>
<P>
This brings the total to more than 14,000 orders for Boeing
since the beginning of the jet age, the company said in a report
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of new Boeing orders last year represented a 16
percent increase over 1997, beating rival Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
But Airbus was not far behind in the heated competition for
control of the commercial-airplane market. The Seattle Times, a
newspaper usually familiar with the new developments in
aerospace, said Friday that Airbus is expected to report firm
orders for at least 540 airplanes in 1998. The European
consortium will release its official total next week.
</P>
<P>
Boeing also said that it delivered record 563 jets in 1998, a
50 percent increase over 1997. This means the company had 70
percent of the deliveries, or two out of every three commercial
airplanes sold.
</P>
<P>
In aerospace, Boeing said, deliveries and a healthy backlog
are important measures of success in the marketplace. But the
company admitted that achieving financial health is a major
challenge.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Times quoted analysts as saying that new orders
for Boeing will not necessarily be translated into larger profit
margins because the majority of the new sales are for
single-aisle 737s. Margins on those have been pinched by
production problems and tough competition with the Airbus A320.
</P>
<P>
"In Boeing's case," said the newspaper quoting analysts,
"management needs to focus not on market share but on restoring
and boosting profits from planes it builds. Its factories are
running at record rates, but production problems have led to
financial losses."

<HEADLINE> Chile Sees Record Number of Organ Transplants in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Minister of Public
Health Alex Figueroa said Friday that the country registered a
record number of 269 organ transplants in 1998, a sharp rise from
75 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Figueroa attributed the growth to the improvement of domestic
medical conditions and facilities, as well as the increased
number of organ donators.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid progress, organ transplants still cannot
meet the needs of patients. About 800 people are in need of
kidney transplants, 150 people liver transplants and 80 people
heart transplants. Twenty-five percent of the patients are
children.
</P>
<P>
To promote the development of organ transplants, the Chilean
Ministry of Public Health last September founded a national
consultative commission on organ transplants dedicated to
advising on transplant work and formulating related programs.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government has also designated September 26 as the
National Organ Donation Day to popularize organ donations.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Take Up Project to Ease Traffic Jam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government plans
to take up a 256 million U.S. dollar bypass project to ease
traffic congestion in Dhaka, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The project "Dhaka Eastern Bypass" has already been
incorporated in the World Bank's lending operation document for
South Asia, press reports Friday quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has prepared a project profile earmarking the
portion of both domestic and foreign currencies for reaching an
agreement with the lending agency by 2000, the sources said,
adding that the agency is likely to provide 175 million dollars
for the project while the government will provide the remaining 90
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank said that it will take a number of
steps before the approval of the loan.
</P>
<P>
The appraisal for the project will start on February 19, 2000
and negotiation will begin on May 24 the same year. And on
completion of negotiation, the project will be submitted to the
World Bank's board on July 20, 2000.
</P>
<P>
When implemented, the project would help facilitate the
transport of industrial and agricultural goods and alleviate
poverty through raising income by reducing transport costs and
generate temporary employment during the construction of the road,
they added.
</P>
<P>
With an area of 815 square kilometers, Dhaka, the capital of
this South Asian country, has grown into a busy city of over nine
million people. The traffic situation in the city is becoming
increasingly tense as its population is growing constantly.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Mahathir on His Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday that according to normal practice,
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi who was appointed deputy prime minister
Friday, will become the prime minister to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
"According to normal practice, the deputy becomes my successor
but I had three (deputies) who didn't become (my successor).
Nowadays, it's difficult to say...I'm scared to say, but normally,
yes," Mahathir told reporters when asked whether Abdullah will
become his successor, after his visit to the Immigration
Department headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who had been foreign minister, was also appointed
home minister, a post held by Mahathir himself for about 10 year,
in a cabinet reshuffle announced by Mahathir Friday after the
Supreme Council meeting of United Malays National Organization
(UMNO), a backbone component of the ruling 14-party coalition
National Front.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that he had taken into account UMNO's unifying
factor when appointing Abdullah as the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
To a question why he is not holding any portfolio, the first
time being so since he became the prime minister in 1981,
Mahathir, who released duties as home minister and first finance
minister in the reshuffle, said that it was to reduce his burden
and to give him time to concentrate on his duties as the prime
minister, which are more time-consuming during the current
economic crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred and thirty two
Italians donated their organs for transplant in 1998 in northern
Italy , a 11.4 percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Girolamo Sirchia, chairman of the northern organ transplant
association, said in Milan that there were 18.5 donors per
million people in north Italy, which ranked fourth in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1,131 transplant operations were performed in
1998, a 0.6 percent rise from the 1,069 operations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sirchia attributed the increase to the better medical
technology, which raises the rate of operation success and made
people more willing to donate their organs.
</P>
<P>
The government has also taken measures to support the organ
donation. The law stipulates that if a person does not have any
specific wish if he unexpectedly dies, the relatives have no
right to interfere with the transplantation of the person's
organs.
</P>
<P>
The association has also established an information center for
organ donors and those waiting for transplants, which makes
donations more efficient, Sirchia said.

WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Tim Floyd admitted he is
waiting for a call from Michael Jordan after the lockout was
cleared on Wednesday.

"I am just as anxious as all of you are," said Floyd, the
Chicago Bulls' coach-in-waiting. "And readily looking forward to
hearing what his intention are."
</P>
<P>
Floyd still doesn't know if he will stay or not. If Jordan
returns, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and the rest of the gang
are more likely to. If Jordan decides to retire, Chicago will
face one of the biggest rebuilding efforts in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I could see it being a very delightful situation
if all of the players come back," Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
"I can see it being a very difficult situation if they're not
back, but the same plan will be in place. And that plan will be
to try to win a championship at some point, but there may be a
process involved if those guys aren't here.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf will get in touch with Jordan soon.
If Jordan says he still wants to play, Floyd is ready to talk to
him.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Targets Men's Doubles Title at Badminton Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) does not expect too much from the Sudirman Cup
mixed team event championship in May, but is upbeat about
retaining at least the men's doubles title at the subsequent
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Director of the national training center Christian Hadinata
admitted on Friday that Indonesia did not hold enough trump cards
to regain the Sudirman Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Of the five rubbers to be played, we reckon our biggest
chances to score come in the men's singles and doubles matches
only," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1989, the tournament applies a
best-of-five-match format, with each team featuring its men's
singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles and
mixed doubles players.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the initial tournament, which was named after
the PBSI's first chairman, but has never triumphed since then.
</P>
<P>
The Sudirman Cup is followed by the World Championships. Both
are biennial events.
</P>
<P>
Hadinata tipped Denmark as the strongest candidate to win the
Cup instead of China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"Denmark has players of about the same quality in the five
disciplines, while China will rely heavily on its women's team.
South Korea is a bit weaker than China currently," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hadinata said the retirement of former world women's singles
number one Susi Susanti would weaken the team's performance in
the event.
</P>
<P>
"Without Susi, we lose some of our confidence, not to mention
the fact that her successor Mia Audina has yet to live up to our
expectations," he said.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the World Championships, Hadinata was
optimistic that Indonesia could land titles other than the men's
doubles crown it will defend.
</P>
<P>
"We are setting our sights on retaining the men's doubles
title, but our chances look great as well in the men's singles
and mixed doubles," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, Hendrawan is likely the best hope to win
the title.
</P>
<P>
Hadinata said now that the country's badminton top flight
concentrates on the two major events, they must be exempted from
other international duties, including the Southeast Asian (SEA)
Games in August.
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to denigrate the SEA Games but we must look
ahead to the next and bigger event: the 2000 Olympics," he
added.

and 60 million rupiah each, silver medalists receiving between 15
million rupiah and 30 million rupiah and bronze medalists between
7.5 million rupiah and 15 million rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Each coach received half the sum awarded to the victorious
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Only 25 percent of the bonuses were presented in cash, the
rest goes to the medalists in the form of life insurance.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won six golds, 10 silvers and 11 bronze medals at
the Asiad in Bangkok, which ran from December 6 to 20.
</P>
<P>
The council's chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar defended the
decision not to provide the rewards in cash.
</P>
<P>
"We chose life insurance in order to protect the athletes'
future," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The athletes' bonanza is not yet over because on Friday the
Association of Indonesian Wood Panel Producers promised to
provide the athletes with a further 500 million rupiah. The
association gave the sports council an 3 billion rupiah donation
prior to the games.
</P>
<P>
Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, who teamed up to win the men's
doubles in badminton, topped the earnings list after each
collecting 75 million rupiah. Both earned 30 million rupiah for
their parts in securing victory in the men's team event and
received a further 45 million rupiah for their gold medal in the
doubles event.
</P>
<P>
Women middle-distance runner Supriati Sutono, tennis women's
singles star Yayuk Basuki, windsurfer Oka Sulaksana and karateka
Arief Taufan Syamsuddin each received 60 million rupiah for
winning gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan also collected 60 million rupiah after leading the
national men's badminton team to the gold medal and finishing
second in the individual men's singles.
</P>
<P>
The athletes also received financial bonuses from their
respective sports federations. Supriati, for example, was given
100 million rupiah by the Indonesian Amateur Track and Field
Association.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Officials Call for Dialogue on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's Chief of General
Staff Dragoljub Ojdanic and Interior Minister of the Republic of
Serbia Zoran Sokolovic said here Friday that dialogue was the
only way to a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo conflict while r
especting the rights of all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Tanjug news agency reported the two high-ranking
officials aired the view during a meeting when they compared
notes on some urgent issues relating to national security.
</P>
<P>
They said that in the past year the Yugoslav armed forces and
the staff of Serbia's Interior Ministry resolutely prevented the
terrorist activities in the troubled province from escalating and
thus creating conditions for the settlement of the crisis through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The same day, Kosovo's administrative executive Velijko
Odalovic said security forces would use "energetic and effective
action" to "normalize the situation" in Kosovo, a Tanjug report
said.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Gabrijel Keler, deputy chief of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in European (OSCE) verification
mission, Odalovic urged the OSCE observers in Kosovo to
explicitly condemn the terrorist activities conducted by the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said the terrorist deeds conducted by the ethnic Albanian
separatists were the only obstacle to the settlement of the
Kosovo crisis through political means.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian leader in Kosovo Ibrahim Rugova said in
the provincial capital of Pristina that the situation in Kosovo
was both grave and dangerous. He urged both sides to show
restraint and reiterated that the best way to solve the crisis
was to grant Kosovo independence.
</P>
<P>
Three Serb policemen were reportedly killed and four others
wounded at 10:20 a.m. Friday when KLA troops fired an anti-tank
weapon at their armored vehicle near Suva Reka, 48 kilometers
northwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, KLA rebels attacked a Yugoslav
convoy carrying rations to troops garrisoned near Kosovska
Mitrovica, about 40 kilometers northwest of Pristina, and
kidnapped eight soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the Kosovo conflict last February, more
than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands
displaced despite the ceasefire under the peace deal struck by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke last October.
</P>
<P>
The first few days in 1999 saw policemen and civilians killed
or wounded by ethnic Albanian separatists almost on a daily
basis. Observers here said the real intention underlying the separ
atists' intensified terrorist activities was to draw Serb forces
into a counter-attack, which would in turn serve as a pretext for
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to start military
intervention in the province.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Needs More Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China should attach more
importance to developing animal husbandry, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Liu Chengguo,
Vice-Minister of Agriculture, as saying that since animal and p
oultry breeding needs less investment and makes quicker profits
compared with other rural sectors, many regions have chosen to
expand animal husbandry to add to the coffers of farmers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry statistics indicates that more than 30 percent of
the increase of farming household's earnings these past three
years have been derived from animal breeding.
</P>
<P>
while launching projects to eliminate poverty for more than 40
million rural inhabitants, local governments should make animal
husbandry a top priority, notes Liu.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sweeping Southeast Asian financial turmoil and the
devastating summer floods last year, China's animal husbandry
experienced steady and sound growth.
</P>
<P>
Last year's meat production hit 55.7 million tons, which was
four percentage points higher than the previous year. Milk
production reached 8.45 million tons, rising by nine percent,
ministry statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will speed up revising the Grassland Law, and
strike hard against those who illegally cultivate grassland, or
damage pastures.
</P>
<P>
Other important works for this year include strengthening
animal quarantine measures, spreading quality breeding stock,
fortifying pasture ecological infrastructures and promoting
feeding animals with processed crop stalks, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> Cardoso Reaffirms Limitation on Government Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso reaffirmed its order Friday to limit the
government spending to no more than revenues collected.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the new cabinet's first meeting at the Planalto
Palace, Cardoso requested the National Congress to speed up the
voting on the economic stabilization program and other topics of
interest such as the social prevision, tax, and fiscal and
administrative reforms.
</P>
<P>
The program and reforms are all aimed at reducing the present
high public deficit, the high bank rate of interest, the
unemployment rate, and promoting the national economic
development, Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso, whose 1999-2002 second presidential term started
January 1, defended the bill designed to increase the public
servants' contribution.
</P>
<P>
He said that presently some 900,000 public servants active or
inactive in the country contribute just 1.8 billion U.S. dollars
a year, but receive almost 19 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso also criticized some governors for threatening to
delay the payment of their states debts.
</P>
<P>
The new governor of the Minas Gerais state and former
president of the Republic, Itamar Franco, has decided to suspend
for 90 days the payment of the 108 million dollar debt of his
state with Europe due February 10.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the total 27 Brazilian governors will hold a meeting
January 18 in Belo Horizonte, the capital of the Minas Gerais
state, to discuss the payment of the debts with the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
The move alarmed investors, already worried about Brazil's
huge budget deficit and its loss of nearly 40 billion dollars in
foreign reserves since July. Stocks, debt bonds and even the
dollar plunged in markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said "I was not elected to administer a crisis, but to
surmount it and carry out a project of a country."

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Rebel Leader Expresses Desire for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The
leader of the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC), Manuel Marulanda, on Friday expressed his desire for
peace at his meeting here with former Nicaraguan president Daniel
Ortega.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting somewhere on the "La Machaca" trail,
Marulanda said he was pleased with the presence of Colombian
President Andres Pastrana at Thursday's peace negotiation,
according to Ortega.
</P>
<P>
Marulanda explained that he himself had wanted to attend the
inaugural ceremony of the negotiations between the government and
the FARC, but his security advisers warned against attending
because of a possible attack, Ortega said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I found comrade Manuel in good spirits and with much optimism
about the process," Ortega added.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said the FARC leader had announced he would
attend on January 20 at the opening of discussions on the
exchange of 480 imprisoned guerrilla members for 315 members of
the public security forces who are in the hands of the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government and the FARC held their first peace
talks in six years on Thursday in an attempt to end the country's
civil war, which has been going on for 50 years and has caused
the deaths of more than 35,000 people in the last decade alone.
</P>
<P>
Marulanda failed to show up at the jungle town of the Caqueta
province on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Foresees 1 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian trade
deficit is expected to fall to one billion U.S. dollars this
year, significantly lower than the figure of 6.33 billion dollars
for 1998, the Brazilian National Industries Confederation (CNI)
has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The confederation was quoted as saying that the country's
exports this year will reach 54 billion dollars, while imports 55
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CNI International Affairs Department economist Sandra Rios
said that the forecast was made on the basis of the 1.5 percent
gross domestic product drop, and also on the basis of the
continuation of the present monetary policy, with an accumulated
devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the real, of 7.5 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"This is a baseline scenario, that does not take into account
possible positive effects of the euro, the new European currency,
on the future behavior of the Brazilian exports," added Rios.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Trade Association of Brazil (AEB) must publish
next week its estimates for the balance of trade in 1999, which
must be better than those of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's exports dropped by 3.53 percent last year, against
the initial goal of the government of a 10 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The Development, Industry, and Commerce Ministry calculations
said that in 1998 Brazil had a trade deficit of 6.33 billion
dollars, with imports reaching 57.55 billion dollars and exports
51.22 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Automobile Sector May Pose Zero Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile industry was
hit hard by weak market demand and stockpiles last year, possibly
posting a zero industrial growth after several years' steady
increase, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes preliminary statistics from the State
Administration of Machinery Industry as saying that the country
produced 1.6 million automobiles, including 610,000 heavy-duty
trucks and 507,000 sedans.
</P>
<P>
The truck category witnessed a negative output growth of -8.5 p
ercent, while the output growth for sedans was 5.3 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry had a total industrial output of 262.4
billion yuan (31.6 billion U.S. dollars) plunging 1.7 percent
from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth of the industrial output had been maintained
beyond 15 percent since 1990. The profits, estimated at 3.44
billion yuan (414.4 million U.S. dollars), are sharply down 55.4
percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Industrial experts attributed the sector's poor performance to
the decline of group and administration purchasing. The State
Council initiated an unprecedented campaign to slim down its
staff by half last year. Therefore, governmental departments,
which were the major car consumers, largely cut their purchasing
budget.
</P>
<P>
Car markers pinned more hope on individual consumption, which
has seen a growing momentum last year.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to lessen the financial burden of car users, the
government is expected to replace various road maintenance fees
by a fuel tax this year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng on Thursday said that his
ministry would focus on consolidating road and vehicle fee
collection, and implement the fuel tax, which is set at 1.15 yuan
(0.14 U.S. dollars) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicted that market demand for sedans will be limi
ted this year while sales of heavy-duty trucks will see a stable
growth.
</P>
<P>
The sector's total industrial output aims at 306 to 311
billion yuan (36.8 billion-37.4 billion U.S. dollars), up 9.4 to
11.2 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
An officer of the bureau said that every effort should be made
to win the market by developing independent technology and a
sound distribution system, rather than relying on macro-policy
support, the paper reports.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka: One of 25 World's Biodiversity Hot Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has been identified by
the environment activist group Conservation International (CI) as
one of 25 biodiversity hot spots in the world, reported the Time
weekly in its January 11 issue.
</P>
<P>
These hot spots could have maximum benefit by preservation
efforts, the magazine said in a cover story titled "Heroes for the
Planet: Earth Angles", the first in a series of special reports by
the magazine to honor people who work to protect the natural
world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based CI said that together with Western India, Sri
Lanka, the island in the Indian ocean, accounts for 2,180 plant
species that are unique to each hot spot.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's tropical rain forest ecosystem is considered as an
area which is disturbed by human activity, but still exceptionally
rich in animal and plant species found nowhere else, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that nearly 60 percent of the world's tropical
rain forests have been lost, and what remains is under extreme
pressure from logging and human population growth.
</P>
<P>
CI believed preservation efforts should be focused on these hot
spots and tropical wilderness areas that are relatively untouched
by humanity.
</P>
<P>
The environment group also pushes for the demarcation of key
reserves in these biodiversity bastions that will forever be off
limits to agriculture and industry.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Hoaxes Disrupt Indonesian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Two more bomb threats were
received in Indonesian capital Thursday, bringing the number of
such threats in the first eight days of this year to seven. All
have turned out to be hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters Friday, Jakarta police spokesman said the
two bomb threats Thursday were called in to the 26-story Gajah
Mada Plaza shopping center in Central Jakarta and the 50-story
Bank Negara Indonesia tower in South Jakarta, the tallest
building in the capital.
</P>
<P>
All the threats were made through phone calls by unidentified
parties, the spokesman was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It remains unknown whether all seven bomb threats were made by
the same party. Most of those who received the bomb threats claim
that the voice was that of a male.
</P>
<P>
There was a blast last Saturday at a vacant Ramayana department
store in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment Friday about the rash of bomb threats in
the city, Governor Sutiyoso said he strongly believed that the
threats were masterminded by those who had their own political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly suspect these hoaxes are politically motivated.
It's in the hands of the police and the military to prove," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The governor, however, reminded Jakartans not to panic when
dealing with such threats, but to report instantly to the police
anything suspicious, even strangers lurking around their homes or
offices.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Medical Insurance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A new nationwide medical
insurance plan will replace the state-funded health care system
covering more than 100 million urban workers in China over the
past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Medical reform which is scheduled for completion by the end of
this year will affect all state-owned enterprises, foreign-funded
and private firms, governmental departments, and institutions and
mass organizations, according to information released at a
national health work conference held Friday in the Chinese
capital.
</P>
<P>
A State Council circular issued last month said the transition
is expected to ease enormous financial burdens created by the
rapid growth of medical expenditures and at the same time provide
improved social security for workers.
</P>
<P>
The plan requires workers to contribute approximately two
percent of their annual income to an individual medical fund.
</P>
<P>
Companies will be required to contribute additional amount
equaling to six percent of the payroll. Thirty percent of the
contribution will be deposited in individual accounts and the
remainder will be used to fund the public health insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes maximum and minimum payment schedules and
workers will be required to use their individual accounts to pay
medical fees below the minimum. Individual and public funds will
be used to pay costs between the two payment standards.
</P>
<P>
The minimum is fixed at the 10 percent of a worker's annual
salary and the maximum, at four times annual wages.
</P>
<P>
Commercial medical insurance services will be introduced to
cover medical bills beyond the payment capacity of individuals or
the public program.
</P>
<P>
China's state health care system was founded under a strictly
planned economy which assigned people to work units that provided
cradle-to-grave benefits.
</P>
<P>
Economic reform has created a number of non-traditional
industries which provide fewer benefits to workers.
</P>
<P>
The existing system has also failed to provide needed care for
millions of workers released by China's inefficient state ind
ustries who have in turn lost their health care benefits.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that laid-off workers and over 30 million
retirees will benefit from the new system.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Optimistic on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, COLOMBIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana Friday said he was optimistic about the peace
process, even if the head of the country's main guerrilla
faction, Manuel Marulanda, failed to attend the start of the
talks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said in Cartagena about that he considered the
non-appearance of the commander of the Revolutionary armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC) a "snub," but he was confident that the
negotiations "will continue without any hindrances."
</P>
<P>
"I kept my word that I would attend the San Vicente del Caguan
meeting for the good of the peace in Colombia," Patrana said upon
arrival in Cartagena, where he will spend the weekend in the Fort
of Manzanillo presidential house.
</P>
<P>
According to rebel commander Raul Reys, Marulanda could not
attend Thursday's ceremony at the start of the peace talks due to
unspecified "threats against his life."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were expected to end 50 years of civil war
which has claimed thousands of casualties every year and billions
of dollars in economic losses to the country.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 12 more people died Friday in three
killings allegedly committed by paramilitary troops in villages
in the northwest of Colombia, increasing the number of victims of
attacks by the extreme right, which resumed its activities last
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Keep Using U.S. Dollar After 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Panama will continue using
the U.S. dollar as a legal currency beyond the year 2000, after
the withdrawal of the U.S. troops in 1999, Panamanian Foreign
Minister Jorge Ritter said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the circulation of the U.S. currency was
guaranteed by the monetary agreement of 1904 signed by Panama and
the United States, so it will continue in force after the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said that the treaty through which Panama organized its
economic structure had nothing to do with the inter-oceanic
waterway or with its reverting to Panamanian sovereignty, because
this had another juridical foundation still in force.
</P>
<P>
"Panama was one of the first countries to use the United
States monetary unit in Latin America, and has been using it
since the middle of the 19th century, when it was still part of
Great Colombia," said Ritter.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the drafting of the first constitution at
the beginning of the century, the Panamanian state officially
adopted the dollar as its legal tender, and the present
Panamanian Constitution also reaffirms this principle.
</P>
<P>
Panama has a nominal currency called the "Balboa". However,
in practice, the currency virtually does not exist, except as a
symbolic coin that circulates as a one cent unit, with the image
of an Indian leader.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Describes U.S. Measures as "Crumbs" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government Friday
described the measures recently announced by the United States to
soften the economic blockade against the island as "crumbs."
</P>
<P>
The White House announced Wednesday an increase in the number
of commercial flights to Cuba, the establishment of a mail
service between the two countries, an expansion of the
authorization of money remittances and an increase in the
exchange of travellers, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Economy Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez said that these
measures were "crumbs," although he explained that the official
position will be stated Friday night at a televised appearance of
the head of the Popular Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that the measures would have no impact on the
economy of the island, "because they do not solve the essential
problem that is the blockade itself."
</P>
<P>
The minister defined the Cuban economy as socialist, "but
adapted to the present conditions of the world." He rejected a
return to a market economy, although he admitted that economic
transformation measures must be followed.

JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers in Gianyar, Bali
island of Indonesia, Friday shoveled out 10 more bodies from
beneath mounds of mud, bringing to 27 the death toll from
Thursday's landslide.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen more people are missing and feared dead, local leading
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The search for the landslide victims involved more than 200
rescue workers from the Mobile Brigade, local Udayana Military
Command, local police and Gianyar administration, Gianyar Police
Precinct Chief Lt. Col. Komaruddin was quoted as saying Friday
evening.

Komaruddin said the disaster occurred when around 50 villagers
(not 100 as previously reported) were repairing an irrigation
channel on a steep riverbank near Timbul village.
</P>
<P>
"At first a small chunk of the riverbank fell, but not on the
workers ... then an overhang collapsed and struck them. Many were
buried in the landslide, though some could escape," he said.

<HEADLINE> Railway Transport Subject to Buyers Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's railway sector
established under the planned economy received a painful lesson
from the emerging market economy in 1998 and has finally realized
that it is operating in a buyer's market.
</P>
<P>
Railway Minister Fu Zhihuan warned subordinates attending
Friday's annual work conference of impending difficulties in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the sector successfully overcame record
summer flooding and sluggish market last year, but warned that it
will be much harder to increase transportation volume in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the railway department's 1998
freight transportation volume hit 1.53 billion tons, down 5.3
percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The passenger transportation volume overcame a three-year
slump with a slight gain of 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The debt-ridden had planned to decrease 1998 losses to 1.2
billion yuan, but losses for the year nonetheless hit 2.1 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fu pointed out that the sluggish growth in China's fixed asset
investment and the substantial reductions in exports hindered
improvements in market demand for transportation.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the highway system has also emerged
as the rival facing the railway sector.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts note that the buyer's market offer more choices
for both shippers and passengers and it is thus necessary for
railway departments to alter outdated modes of thinking and
improve both efficiency and services.
</P>
<P>
The sector extended painstaking efforts during 1998 by
increasing speed limits on the country's three backbone railway
arteries and offering computerized booking services in some major
cities.
</P>
<P>
The sector plans to raise train speeds in 1999, actively
develop the container transportation market and develop a
nationwide computerized booking system, according to Fu.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Indonesia's Karawang Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Karawang, which
is located 60 kilometers northeast of Jakarta in a rice-growing
area, has returned to normal after mass rioting rocked the city
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two people were shot dead and eight others were injured after
security officers opened fire to prevent the mob from attacking
shops, according to national newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Regent Dadang S. Muchtar inspected the devastated area at about
4:35 p.m. with his subordinates and security officers, calling on
the crowd to end the violence or face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel finally gained control over the situation
and stone-throwing has stopped, a police spokesman was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The crowd dispersed shortly before the breaking of the fast at
about 6 p.m. Soldiers continued to patrol the city in military
trucks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the violence erupted shortly after rumors
spread that police had mistreated a motorcycle taxi driver at the
traditional Johar Market.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the driver did not have a license, and attempted to
bribe police when they asked to see his personal documents. The
police then allegedly responded by beating the hapless driver,
sparking wild public outrage.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of angry residents ran amok in Karawang, attacking
police stations, burning cars and looting shops in the city's
business district.
</P>
<P>
Six police posts, Karawang police station and Kota police
station were vandalized by the mob, who also pelted stones at the
police officers deployed to disperse them.
</P>
<P>
Consisting mostly of high school students and youths from
surrounding areas, the mob burned vehicles in a car showroom and
looted clothes and shoes from several stores. Some of the youths
immediately donned the T-shirts, shorts and shoes, but others
stuffed their plunder under their clothes.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were forced to open fire on their assailants
to prevent the attacks from spreading to other areas.
</P>
<P>
One of the bullets fatally struck a senior high school student.
The second fatality was a man in his 30s, who died after being
shot in the legs.
</P>
<P>
Karawang Police Chief Lieutenant Colonel Achmad Hidayat told
reporters that several rioters, including a military officer, were
arrested after the rampage.
</P>
<P>
Friday's riot was the latest eruption of violence in
crisis-racked Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
There has been mounting violence over the past year as the
country endures its worst political and economic crisis in three
decades.
</P>
<P>
The persistent violence has been linked to a number of causes,
including economic hardship, ethnic and religious tensions and
political turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers: Universe May Contain 125 Billion Galaxies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. astronomers said that
the universe may contain about 125 billion galaxies.
</P>
<P>
The astronomers made such an estimate based on the
observations by the Hubble Space Telescope, the Associated Press
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a study "the Hubble Deep Field South", the space telescope
was focused on a small portion of the sky above the Southern
Hemisphere for 10 days and took images of galaxies 11 billion
light-years away.
</P>
<P>
An earlier study "Hubble Deep Field North" estimated the total
number of galaxies are 80 billions.
</P>
<P>
Henry C. Ferguson of the Space Telescope Institute in
Baltimore said the new estimate is higher because the space
telescope has new instruments that allowed it to look farther
than before.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers said that the study is aimed at capturing a narrow
beam sample of what the universe is like.
</P>
<P>
It is just like a core sample of the heavens. The images taken
this time will be studied by astronomers throughout the world,
the report said.

BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China's gold production reached
record-high levels in 1998, with the industry's profit jumping by
47 percent to one billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>

The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes an official from

He says the gold industry will make every effort to produce

Technical upgrading and enterprise restructuring contributed

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with White House lawyer's remarks U.S. Senate Approves Blueprint for Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Friday
unanimously approved a blueprint for impeachment trial against
President Bill Clinton in connection with his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint for Clinton's impeachment trial calls for
lawyers to begin their presentations next Thursday but limiting
them to the evidence made public in the House. During an
extraordinary private session, senators agreed to decide later
whether to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
In a brief session presided over by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, the senators voted, one-by-one from their desks, to
approve the plan that was reached earlier in the day during an
informal meeting of all senators. The vote ended days of
uncertainty over the format of the first presidential impeachment
trial since 1868.
</P>
<P>
"I think today we have acted in the very best tradition of the
Senate, and it is an appropriate approach for this historic, very
solemn event," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the trial would begin next Thursday with
motions by the two sides, followed the next day by opening
presentations. House prosecutors and presidential lawyers would
be given until next Monday to file any pretrial motions.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for giving House prosecutors and Clinton's
legal team 24 hours each to make their presentations. Senators
would then have 16 hours to ask questions through Rehnquist, who
presides over the trial.
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors, who have been pressing to call witnesses to
make their case, would have to wait until after the opening
presentations and questions to learn whether senators would
permit any such witnesses.
</P>
<P>
After the question period, senators would be free to make
motions -- either to adjourn the trial and move to censure or to
call witnesses and produce evidence not in the House record.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on Thursday, stands
accused of two articles of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction
of justice, in connection with his effort to conceal a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He is only the second
president in history to be subjected to a trial, after Andrew
Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
A partisan disagreement over rules had clouded the opening of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
Senators were sworn in as jurors, in an oath administered by
Rehnquist. But moments later, the trial was recessed so senators
could attempt to fashion a bipartisan accord that both parties
said they wanted to serve as a contrast to the highly partisan
impeachment proceedings in the House last year. The two sides
agreed to a meeting this morning in the Old Senate Chamber, the
site of great debates in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's lawyer Greg Craig said Friday the White House
respects the Senate plan for an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
Craig said the White House plans a vigorous defense, but
declined to say if he will attempt to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that White House lawyers are "optimistic"
and "confident" that once senators see the defense, they will
agree that the articles of impeachment don't warrant removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
Craig concluded his brief statement by saying that he remains
hopeful that the impeachment matter will be resolved
"expeditiously and fairly."
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the U.S. House of Representatives pa
ssed on largely party-line votes the two articles of impeachment
against Clinton. The votes sent the issue to the Senate, where a
two-third majority must vote to convict Clinton in order to
remove him from office.

LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian forward Paolo Di Canio
could return to Sheffield Wednesday by the end of the month,
according to the BBC on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He failed to return to England following the end of an
11-match ban imposed for pushing referee Paul Alcock over after
being shown the red card during the game with Arsenal last

</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old sent a medical certificate saying he was
suffering from stress and depression, but the club has fined him
for refusing to return from Italy.

<P>
Club secretary Graham Mackrell said: "The directors are
concerned, both for the future of the player and in the interests
of Sheffield Wednesday, that he should receive the best medical
treatment possible to speed his return to football.
</P>
<P>
"With a view to agreeing both the condition of the player and a
n appropriate course of treatment, it has been agreed that he
shall be assessed by an independent medical practitioner within
the next few days."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Paolo is sorry for what happened in the past and
what is happening at the moment and because of this we will be
writing a letter explaining his present state.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The two top officials of the
Salt Lake City Olympics Organizing Committee (SLOC) resigned
today amid a bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
Frank Joklik, president of the city's Olympic organizing
committee, resigned but will stay on until a successor is hired,
according to the local press report.
</P>
<P>
Joklik asked for and received the resignation of senior vice
president Dave Johnson.
</P>
<P>
The resignations were announced following a joint session of
the Salt Lake and U.S. Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore it, " Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt, who attended
the meeting, said of the scandal that has rocked the Olympic
community. "We cannot avoid the fact we've been injured. We will
clean this wound."
</P>
<P>
Joklik admitted that the bid committee had paid International
Olympic Committee members cash and gifts, in one case more than
$70,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch expressed regret about
the resignations.
</P>
<P>
"The IOC wishes to reiterate that it has full confidence in
the organizers of the 2002 Olympic Winder Games and has no doubt
as to their ability to ensure the total success of these games,"

ROME, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi arrived in Rome Friday afternoon on the second leg of his
Europe tour, which began in France on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi will remain in Italy throughout the weekend and meet
with Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema on Saturday and Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with the Italian leaders, Obuchi is expected to
confirm that the troubled Japanese economy will grow this year by
0.5 percent, following a 3 percent decline in the gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda are preparations for the G-7 summit in June
in Cologne of German. They will discuss work on ways and means
for reducing exchange rate fluctuations among the dollar, the yen
and the new European single currency euro.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema is likely to encourage Japan to play an active role in
seeking international financial stability against the backdrop of
worries about an overly-strong euro which could penalize European
exports.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and D'Alema are also expected to discuss the sensitive
issue of UN Security Council reform and Japan's desire to take a
permanent seat on the council.

LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League champions
Arsenal said on Friday they had signed 15-year-old Jermaine

England.
</P>

According to local reports on the day, Arsenal are believed to
have paid second division County 2.0 million pounds (3.28 million
U.S. dollars) "compensation" for the player, who last week became
the second youngest to play in the FA Cup when he appeared as a
second-half substitute in Notts County's 1-1 third round draw
with Sheffield United.
</P>
<P>
An Arsenal spokesman said: "Jermaine has signed academy forms
with the club and will sign scholarship forms next season. He is
likely to play at the weekend for our Under-17 team."
</P>
<P>
Pennant first came to prominence when he starred for England
Schoolboys in a live televised match against Scotland last season.
</P>
<P>
Former Arsenal skipper Liam Brady, who is now head of the
club's youth development said: "Jermaine is a very talented
youngster with the potential to do well. County have done a
fantastic job with him and we are anxious to further the
development."

ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A Coaster of India's Delhi
Transport Corporation (DTC) carrying 20 officials representing the
tourism and transport industry reached Lahore, eastern Pakistan,
from the Indian capital of New Delhi Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The coaster entered the Wagha Border in a freezing temperature

Customs, Immigration, Communications and a representative of the
Indian High Commission in Islamabad, reported the Associated Press
of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
"It was an eventful 12-hour journey that covered 700 kilometers
from Delhi to Lahore," DTC Chairman G.S. Chima told reporters at
the border adding that the bus service between the two countries
is " technically viable, quite safe and sound."
</P>
<P>
He said the basic objective of running the bus service between
the two countries is to provide better traveling facilities to the
people living on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
Chima said the Lahore-Delhi bus service would prove
instrumental in improving relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is the first-ever proposed bus service between the two
countries in 50 years. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart Atal Behari Vajpayee took the initiative to facilitate

BUCHAREST, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Moldova
will convert 30 percent of its foreign currency reserves in the
new European currency, the Euro, Bank officials announced early
this week.
</P>
<P>
Moldova's foreign currency reserves are kept in large Western
banks. By the end of 2000, the Euro reserves may grow, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the country's gross reserves in foreign currencies
decreased from 366 million U.S. dollars to 150 million.
</P>
<P>
The Euro launch will not affect the monetary-crediting policies
of the National Bank, said its governor, Leonid Talmaci. He told
the press that Moldova is prepared to make transactions in Euro
and the new coin will be widely accepted on its currency market.
</P>
<P>
The trade between Moldova and the 11 Euro zone countries is
evaluated at over 10 percent of the total.

UNITED NATIONS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler on Friday met Peter Burleigh, U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations, on latest spy charges.
</P>
<P>
"At no point have I given authorization to place any part of
UNSCOM's operation under the control of the United States or any

Butler, (UNSCOM) Executive Chairman of the United Nations

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
lawyer Greg Craig said Friday the White House respects the Senate
plan for an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
Craig said the White House plans a vigorous defense, but
declined to say if he will attempt to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that White House lawyers are "optimistic" and
"confident" that once senators see the defense, they will agree
that the articles of impeachment don't warrant removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
Craig concluded his brief statement by saying that he remains
hopeful that the impeachment matter will be resolved
"expeditiously and fairly."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate Friday unanimously approved a blueprint for
impeachment trial against President Bill Clinton in connection
with his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint for Clinton's impeachment trial calls for lawyers
to begin their presentations next Thursday but limiting them to
the evidence made public in the House. During an extraordinary
private session, senators agreed to decide later whether to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Clinton went on trial in the Senate Thursday for "high crimes
and misdemeanors" of a far different strip, accused in two
articles of impeachment of perjury and obstruction of justice
stemming from his efforts to keep secret his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed
on largely party-line votes the two articles of impeachment
against Clinton. The votes sent the issue to the Senate, where a
two-thirds majority must vote to convict Clinton in order to
remove him from office.

<HEADLINE> Ultrasound Method Detects Heart Defects Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have
discovered that an ultrasound technique can identify heart defects
in unborn babies from 10 weeks into pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Using ultrasound technique at an earlier stage could determine
which ones require treatment, said the researchers from King's
College Hospital Medical School and Guy's Hospital in London.
</P>
<P>
The study, published Friday in the British Medical Journal, has
tested the ultrasound technique in 29,154 pregnancies and found it
could reveal 55 percent of major defects of the heart and arteries
between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
This method of screening is more accurate than the traditional
method of viewing the four chambers of the fetal heart at 16-26
weeks, which only pick up 26 percent of major defects, the
researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
The ultrasound method involves scanning the thickness of fluid
accumulating behind the neck of the foetus rather than examining
the heart itself.
</P>
<P>
"Extensive studies" have shown a link between cardiac defects
and this thickness, called the nuchal translucency thickness, the
researchers said.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Discover New Gene Involved in Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- British scientists said Friday
that they had discovered a new gene involved in cancer which they
hope will provide an understanding of the basic cause of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Defects in the gene, called Bcl10, are believed in a wide range
of cancers including the most common tumors of the colon, lungs
and breasts, and the new discovery could provide new target for
the design of a new cancer drug, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research in London
found the Bcl10 gene after analyzing the stomach tumor of a
75-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
They subsequently found that a number of patients suffering
from a range of cancers carrying mutations of the same gene,
indicating the genetic faults may be important in tumor
development.
</P>
<P>
Martin Dyer, who leads the research team, told a news
conference that the gene could prove to be one of the most
important discoveries in cancer research.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the second gene to be discovered which is
implicated in such a large number of cancers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Peter Garland, chief executive of the Institute of
Cancer Research, said that it is a "remarkable discovery which
will have a major impact on the direction of cancer research."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that in the future, it may be possible to
develop new treatments which will prevent the abnormal Bcl10 gene
from functioning in a way which causes cancers to develop.

<HEADLINE> Chemical May Reduce Risk in CJD: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A chemical which has produced
successful results in mice may be able to treat the new variant
CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, British scientists said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A team from the Institute for Animal Health in Edinburgh
inoculated mice with the chemical pentosan polysulphate (PS). The
mice had been infected with scrapie, a brain disease similar to
CJD.
</P>
<P>
Mice injected with one milligram of PS appeared to be
completely protected against the scrapie, the researchers reported
in the British medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
Those injected with another strain had at least a hundredfold
reduction in sensitivity to it, and some of those injected with a
third survived.
</P>
<P>
Previous research had shown PS to be effective in treating
scrapie, but the animals were inoculated before being infected
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Edinburgh study is the first time that animals have been
successfully treated with PS after being infected.
</P>
<P>
"Although direct testing of the efficacy of PS in reducing
susceptibility to variant CJD is not possible, further animal
studies are essential to examine the possible use of PS for risk
reduction," the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said that much more work was needed before the
chemical was used on humans. There would be problems identifying
which people were carrying the CJD infection soon enough to ensure
PS could work.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five people in Britain have been diagnosed as suffering
from new variant CJD since scientists said in March 1996 that they
had evidence that it could be contracted by eating beef from
animals suffering from mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabian, S. African Envoys to Visit Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Friday announced that Saudi Arabian and South African envoys will
visit Libya next week in another attempt to persuade Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi to surrender suspects involved in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference here that
the envoys, Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, his country's
ambassador to Washington, and Jakes Gerwel, South African
President Nelson Mandela's chief of staff, would leave for Libya
from London next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said they would fly to the Libyan capital of Tripoli
and then to the coastal town of Sirte, Gaddafi's desert tent
domicile, and return on Wednesday "in support of Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's efforts on the Lockerbie case."
</P>
<P>
Slovenian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Danilo
Turk, chairman of the Security Council's Libya sanctions
committee, reported yesterday that Bandar's application to waive a
U.N. flight ban against Libya had been granted for the trip.
</P>
<P>
Their visit is considered key following talks in Pretoria
between Mandela and British Prime Minister Tony Blair earlier this
week. Both said they had made progress in resolving outstanding
issues.
</P>
<P>
Bandar and Gerwel intend to deliver letters to Gaddafi on
behalf of their respective governments, they told the sanctions
committee.
</P>
<P>
Annan last month visited Gaddafi in Sirte in an effort to
secure the surrender of the two men, but he failed to talk the
Libyan leader into handing over the two Libyans, who were accused
of planting a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 103. It exploded as it
flew over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988,
killing 260 people on the ground and in the air, 189 of them
Americans.
</P>
<P>
But speculation following Annan's trip that Gaddafi was on the
point of surrendering the two was dashed when the Libyan leader
called for an international court, a solution that London and
Washington say is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, the United States and Britain dropped
their insistence that the accused be extradited to either of their
countries and challenged Libya to make good on its repeated offer
to allow them to be tried before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council sanctions, imposed in 1992 and tightened
in 1993, would be suspended automatically once the two arrived in
the Netherlands. The sanctions include an air and arms embargo, a
freeze on some Libyan assets abroad and a ban on some equipment
used in oil terminals and refineries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Blueprint for Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Friday
unanimously approved a blueprint for impeachment trial against
President Bill Clinton in connection with his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint for Clinton's impeachment trial calls for lawyers
to begin their presentations next week but limiting them to the
evidence made public in the House. During an extraordinary private
session, senators agreed to decide later whether to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
In a brief session presided over by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, the senators voted, one-by-one from their desks, to
approve the plan that was reached earlier in the day during an
informal meeting of all senators. The vote ended days of
uncertainty over the format of the first presidential impeachment
trial since 1868.
</P>
<P>
Clinton went on trial in the Senate Thursday for "high crimes
and misdemeanors" of a far different strip, accused in two
articles of impeachment of perjury and obstruction of justice
stemming from his efforts to keep secret his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed
on largely party-line votes the two articles of impeachment
against Clinton. The votes sent the issue to the Senate, where a
two-thirds majority must vote to convict Clinton in order to
remove him from office.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Calls for Efforts to Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Li
Zhaoxing called here Friday for joint efforts to better the
relationship between China and the United States, rebutting
allegations of China threat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the National Press Club,
Ambassador Li stressed that the Sino-U.S. relationship "does
matter a lot to all of us, and to the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"The world has changed fundamentally since the end of the Cold
War. Yet, the needs for our two countries to stay engaged are
increasing, not decreasing; and the potentials for both countries
to cooperate are expanding, not dwindling," said Ambassador Li,
who was China's deputy foreign minister before he came to
Washington last March to assume the ambassadorship.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States established diplomatic relations on
January 1, 1979. In the past decades, the bilateral trade has
increased 19 times, from 2.45 billion U.S. dollars in 1979 to
roughly 49 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has become China's second largest trading
partner and China the fourth largest with the United States. Being
one of the fastest growing markets for U.S. exports, China is,
among other things, the biggest buyer of U.S. aircraft and wheat,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
As for U.S. investment in China, the ambassador noted that in
the first half of 1998, six U.S.-funded ventures were set up in
China each day, while many other East Asian economies were
shadowed by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
To ease American fears about the growing trade imbalance,
Ambassador Li said that the U.S. imports from China are mainly low
value-added and labor-intensive products such as textiles,
footwear and toys, which are either no longer produced or produced
only in small quantities in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, imports from China of these goods do not cost
American jobs. Rather, it brings about tremendous benefits to
American consumers," he said, citing the World Bank as reporting
that U.S. customers would have spent an extra 14 billion U.S.
dollars in 1994 if their country had had to import similar
products from other countries that year.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, we share common responsibilities in maintaining
peace and stability in Asia-Pacific and the world as a whole, in
promoting global economic prosperity, improving environment and in
many other important areas such as non-proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, fighting cross-border crime, drug trafficking,
alien smuggling and international terrorism," the Chinese diplomat
added.
</P>
<P>
The growth of relations gained new momentum when President
Jiang Zemin and President Bill Clinton exchanged visits in the
past 15 months. The two leaders agreed to strive for a
constructive strategic partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Looking into the future, we have every reason to be optimistic
about China-U.S. relations," said Ambassador Li. However, he
stressed that differences remain on some issues.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to adhere to the guiding principles
enshrined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques on Taiwan, the
most sensitive and important issue concerning bilateral ties, as
China believes.
</P>
<P>
"History showed that when these principles were observed, our
relations sailed smoothly; if not, they suffered setbacks," the
ambassador stressed.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China last June, President Clinton assured
Beijing that the U.S. does not support independence of Taiwan, or
"two Chinas," or "one China one Taiwan", and Taiwan's membership
in any organization for which statehood is requirement. But the
visit to Taiwan by the U.S. energy secretary several months later
provoked protest from China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador lashed out at the advocates of "China
Threat" for "muddying the water by fabricating shocking stories."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House select committee delivered this week a 700-page
report alleging China had tried in the past two decades to acquire
or steal American advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
"The story is totally groundless and extremely irresponsible,
and the fact that it comes from such high office is indeed
lamentable," said Ambassador Li, stressing there is neither need
nor possibility for China to obtain satellite, rocket and missile
technologies through commercial satellite launching service.
</P>
<P>
"It should be pointed out that for some of the people to
cherish ulterior motives in the context of the domestic politics
is one thing, but to make much ado about nothing and try to pull
China and her scientists and engineers through the mud is quite
another, and it could not be more wrong," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li believes that the two countries should view and
handle their relations from a historical height and in a strategic
perspective, bear common interests in mind and work together to
build a China-U.S. constructive strategic partnership oriented
towards the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Blair Defends Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Friday defended the recent air strikes on Iraq by his country and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"The military action we and the Americans took against Iraq last month
was controversial. I believe obviously that it was right," Blair told
South African parliamentarians in Cape Town Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if we had not confronted (Iraqi President) Saddam
(Hussein), when we did, we would only have to do so at a later stage, in
circumstances much more dangerous for his neighbors and the rest of the
world."
</P>
<P>
He said Saddam had a "proven record" of aggression against his neighbors
and of developing and using weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Since the Gulf War, the U.N. has been trying to ensure his weapons be
destroyed. And the Iraqi regime has consistently failed to honor its
promises despite given every chance to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair applauded South Africa's attempts to broker peace in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and promised that Britain would like to play
its part in resolving the conflict and those in Angola and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He pledged British support for Mbeki's vision of African renaissance,
saying Britain was renewing its bonds with the continent's peoples and
nations.
</P>
<P>
Blair said his country was strengthening its diplomatic representation
in west Africa and giving priority to African issues at the U.N. and in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his support for further debt relief for poor countries and
said markets should be open up to goods from the least developed countries.
