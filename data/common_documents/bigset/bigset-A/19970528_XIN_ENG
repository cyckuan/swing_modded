<HEADLINE> Russia to Reorient Missile Warheads from NATO Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia will reorient the missile
warheads it deploys along its western border from NATO countries
and will destroy these warheads in future, said Serguei
Iastrjembski, the Russian presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He was explaining a surprise announcement made by President
Boris Yeltsin at a signing ceremony of the Founding Act on
Russia-NATO relations that Moscow will dismantle these warheads.
</P>
<P>
"I just took the decision to dismantle all the nuclear
warheads of the missiles which are pointed toward the countries
whose leaders are sitting around the table. You have got my
message," said Yeltsin in the presence of 16 heads of state or
government of NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was received with prudence by the United
States and NATO officials, who are seeking further details of the
decision by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"We have asked President Yeltsin about the exact meaning of
this declaration," said U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns.
</P>
<P>
The NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said that the message sent by
Yeltsin is "encouraging."
</P>
<P>
But he said that what is more important for NATO is above all a
ratification by the Russian State Duma of a 1993 nuclear
disarmament agreement with the United States -- also called Start
II, which calls for the reduction of strategic nuclear warheads to
between 3,000 and 3,500 in both Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the gesture by Yeltsin is inscribed in
"the spirit of the new relations" between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia today signed an agreement on bilateral
relations, called Founding Act, which is aimed at building a
relationship of confidence between the two former Cold War
adversaries.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Urges Tightening of Flood Control in Major Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged that every effort be made to guarantee flood control in the
three major rivers in north China, where weather forecasters say
the rainfall in the coming flood season may be most heavily
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and vice premier of the
State Council, China's cabinet, said at a meeting held here today
that the anti-flood facilities in the valleys of the Yellow River,
the Haihe River and the Huaihe River should meet the standards to
sustain the heaviest flooding in China since 1949.
</P>
<P>
To check up anti-flood measures in the region, China's State
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters held a two-day
meeting from May 26-27 in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province,
also a key section for flood prevention of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who leads the anti-flood headquarters, attended the
meeting and inspected the dam and anti-flood facilities in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said all preparatory work done by the local flood control
authorities will help to prevent any serious flooding that may hit
the regions.
</P>
<P>
However, he emphasized that the situation this year will be
tough: the riverbeds of these rivers suffer from serious silt
accumulation, which has reduced flood diversion
capabilities. Also, during the flood season, rainstorms in the
region usually fall in large quantities over a short period of time,
which makes flood control work even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The river valleys are of strategic importance for China, as
there are many big cities, including Beijing, a number of key
transport lines, major grain and cotton production bases and key
industrial and mining enterprises located in these regions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged that the security of big rivers, lakes and
reservoirs be fully guaranteed, and asked all local governments to
watch against potential dangers.
</P>
<P>
Also, he asked all flood control organs to restore projects
damaged by previous floods and fix up dams, set up flood-control
teams, and prepare necessary materials before the flood season.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting were Niu Maosheng, minister of Water
Resources and heads of local governments in the river
valleys.

<HEADLINE> UN Meeting Focuses on Public Administration, Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An expert meeting on the
United Nations program in public administration and finance
started here today.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day meeting, organized by the Division for Governance,
Public Administration and Finance of the Department for
Development Support and Management Service, would focus on the
requirements for effective public administration as recognized and
supported by the General Assembly in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Calling for enhanced public administrative and financial
management through reform, efficiency, productivity,
accountability, and responsiveness, the General Assembly in its
resolution 50/225 reaffirmed that democracy, good governance and
efficiently performing public services are essential for the
economic, social, environmental and political health of states.
</P>
<P>
During the current meeting, 41 administration and finance
experts from all regions of the world would explore the factors of
success in developing a sound governance environment. The experts,
public administrators, academics and representatives of
non-governmental organizations come from Argentina, Brazil, China,
France, India, Russia, the United States and 31 other countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would address a challenging agenda aimed at
advancing socio-economic development and change through better
governance and public services. The five main themes would
include: development of a sound governance environment; enhancing
the professionalism, ethical values and image of the public
service; redesigning the state for social development; creating an
enabling environment for private sector development; strengthening
governmental capacity in the mobilization, management and
accountability of financial resources.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Largest Steelmaker Reports Surge in Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany' largest steelmaker Thyssen AG
today reported an 81 percent surge in pre-tax profit for the first
six months of the current business year, mainly thanks to its
restructuring drive.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of the the business year ending September
30, the company achieved 631 million German marks (373 million
U.S. dollars) in net profit. Thyssen said the result was due
partly to the sale of the Wuelfrather Group.
</P>
<P>
But even after adjustments, the profit was still 22 percent
higher than the first-half level of the previous business year.
</P>
<P>
For the next six months, Thyssen expected an continuing
expansion of its international business, which could enable the
company to make an improvement on the one billion marks (590
million dollars) in profit of the last business year.
</P>
<P>
Thyssen was the target of a hostile takeover bid by its
arch-rival Krupp-Hoesch AG which was surprisingly announced in
March. But the corporate raid was defused later when the two
companies agreed to negotiate a merger of their steel units on
friendly terms.
</P>
<P>
Thyssen said Tuesday that it expected the merger negotiations
to be finalized by the end of September. The merger will create
Europe's largest steel concern with an annual output of 17 million
tons of steel.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Israel Agree to Hold More Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, EGYPT, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
agreed to hold more discussions in the coming days during their
summit held today in Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, emerging from their three hours of talks,
described their meeting as positive. They looked far more relaxed
than after their first meeting this year in Cairo in late March.
</P>
<P>
They told reporters that their talks focused on ways to move
forward the peace talks, which collapsed in mid-March when Israel
broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he would contact with Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat first and expect to bring
together Netanyahu and Arafat if further negotiations proved
successful.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader, may be for the first time in public, said
that he will "try to persuade the Palestinians to consider the
ideas from the Israeli side."
</P>
<P>
He said his talks with Netanyahu covered the controversial Har
Homa building project, an issue that Israel had previously
refused to deal with at the summit.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Netanyahu concurred with Mubarak in saying that
"further negotiations, conversations and consulations" would be a
must to achieve concrete progress.
</P>
<P>
However, both leaders refused to divulge any details of their
proposals on the table today, stressing that they would have more
consultations in the coming days to further the result of their
current negotiations.
</P>
<P>
As part of Egypt's intensified efforts to revive the peace
process, Mubarak has reportedly proposed a five-point initiative,
under which there should be a "political solution" to the Har
Homa issue.
</P>
<P>
Other points include resumption of security cooperation, a
halt to the Jewish settlement construction in the West Bank,
immediate resumption of talks on Israeli further redeployment in
the west Bank and on a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
While brushing aside any questions on concrete peace proposals
in sight, the Egyptian president denied that Egypt was applying
pressure on both sides. "Egypt is not a country to exert
pressure, either on the Palestinians or on the Israelis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu praised the Egyptian role, saying that "Egypt at
certain point offers good service to the peace process, to the
desire of all."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu flew in with a large delegation this morning to seek
Egyptian support to encourage the Palestinians to return to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that further negotiations will translate into
positive result," he said, adding that he is committed to
completing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Sharm el-Sheikh summit is an outcome of days of intensive
diplomatic contacts.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak had two telephone conversations with Netanyahu and
meetings with Arab leaders, while sending his top advisor Osama
el-Baz to meet Israeli top officials twice in three days.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in
1979, has been deeply involved in the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Canada Receives More Foreign Tourists in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners made a record number of
overnight trips to Canada in 1996, injecting all-time high of 6.6
billion U.S. dollars into the Canadian economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada said today that last year overseas residents
(from countries other than the U.S.) made a record 4.4 million
overnight trips to Canada, up 11.5 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth consecutive annual increase, and the third
consecutive increase of more than 10 percent, the federal agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Though overseas tourists made only a quarter (4.4 million) of
all overnight trips to Canada in 1996, they accounted for almost
half the money spent by all foreigners in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Among the overnight trips overseas visitors, Europeans
accounted for over half of them, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Asia was the second largest overseas market for Canada and
continued to grow rapidly. In 1996, the number of Asian visitors
grew 17.3 percent, twice the rate of European visitors.
</P>
<P>
To meet Asia's increased demand for Canadian tourism,
international carriers have increased both the number and the seat
capacity of flights between Canada and the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Tourism Organization, Canada was the
10th most popular destination for international tourists in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Though Canada is an increasingly popular international tourism
destination, its share of the growing world market was down
slightly, from 2.98 percent in 1995 to 2.93 percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, Holding Talks to Merge SBC at 50 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. and SBC Communications
Corp., two telecom giants of the U.S., are holding talks to join
forces in a 50 billion-U.S.-dollar merger, which would easily be
the largest such transaction in history.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that AT&AMP;T and SBC would
have nearly 80 billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue jointly,
with 230,000 workers, more than 60 percent of the 80
billion-U.S.-dollar U.S. long-distance market and a grasp of
local-phone and wireless services throughout the Southwest and
California.
</P>
<P>
SBC earned 3.24 billion U.S. dollars in last year's net income,
compared with 5.91 billion U.S. dollars of AT&AMP;T. SBC provides
local phone services in seven of the 10 largest U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions have grown very serious in the last month,"
said one person familiar with the talks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the merger would be the first combination between
AT&AMP;T and a Bell since the landmark 1984 breakup of the old
American Telephone and Telegraph Co., the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some said this would be a deal changing the competitive
landscape and could make it harder for smaller players to survive,
especially start-ups that have bet billions on everything from
wireless licenses to Internet-access services.
</P>
<P>
An AT&AMP;T-SBC combination would be twice as big as any other
deal. The paper said that AT&AMP;T had also attempted to conduct
certain forms of links with other big companies to attack
the international market.
</P>
<P>
Some people said several issues could block a deal, including
a federal ban on SBC entering the long-distance market until its
own local-phone market is open to competitors.

<HEADLINE> Georgian President on Abkhazia Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Edward
Shevardnadze said today that the central government was willing to
resume peace talks with the break-away Abkhazia Republic as soon
as possible, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In his annual state of the union address delivered at the
parliament, Shevardnadze proposed to solve the Abkhazia issue by
giving the Abkhazia Republic a high degree of autonomy on the
basis of a unified country, a phased repatriation of refugees in a
short period of time, and by pardoning those participating in the
Georgian-Abkhazian conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed an international meeting on the Abkhazia issue
to be chaired by the Unite Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Abkhazia Republic declared independence from Georgia in
July 1992, leading to Georgian-Abkhazian conflicts. Under the
mediation of Russia and the U.N., a ceasefire was reached in May
1994, but the final status of Abkhazia has yet to be decided.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Begins to Receive Water from Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 27 (Xinhua) - Israel started pumping a daily 72,000
cubic meters of water to Jordan today, ending the water dispute
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The start of water pumping is only a fraction of what Jordan
has achieved in the peace process, said King Hussein of Jordan
while addressing a ceremony celebrating the event in the town of
Adasiah near the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
The water dispute between the two countries erupted early this
month after Israel's failure to implement the water article in the
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty signed in 1994, which stipulates
that Jordan shall obtain 150 million cubic meters of water from
Israel to cover Jordan's urgent needs.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between King Hussein and Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on May 8, Israel agreed to pump 30
million cubic meters of water from the Tiberians Lake to the King
Abdullah Canal according to the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 million cubic meters will come to Jordan during this
summer and the rest will be pumped in winter, said Jordan's
Minister of Water and Irrigation Munther Haddadin Monday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides will also work together to develop a water
desalination project in order to supply Jordan with larger amounts
of water, Haddadin said.
</P>
<P>
Israel promised to pay half of the total cost of the
desalination project estimated at about 353 million U.S. dollars,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, the annual consumption of water per capita is no
more than one-fourth of the international water-poor countries
line.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been sharing most of its surface water
resources with neighboring countries, whose control nevertheless
deprives Jordan of its fair share.

<HEADLINE> OAU's Council Meeting Has Busy Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity's
Council of Ministers meet on Wednesday to prepare the agenda for the
OAU's 33rd summit that will highlight Africa's determination to
achieve peace and economic development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Conference sources said the council meeting will review a report by
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, who is seeking a third
term at the summit but faces rivalry from Ivory Coast's Foreign
Minister Amara Essy.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are to discuss Africa's trouble spots, including
the crisis in the Great Lake Region, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia
and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Salim told Xinhua on Tuesday that the OAU will continue to give
priority to preventing, containing and resolving conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
As part of peace-related issues, the situation of refugees,
returnees and displaced persons and ban on landmines will be dealt
with at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Of all the issues the most pivotal for Africa is the question
of peace. Africa has suffered and continues to suffer from too many
wars," Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said.
</P>
<P>
Economic issues like economic reforms, regional cooperation and
development of economic and trade ties with the outside world also
weigh heavily on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Conference sources said that unlike the previous meetings, the
upcoming conference will give special attention to the dispute between
Libya and the United States, Britain and France over the 1988
Lockerbie bombing that killed more than 200 people over Scotland. The
United States, Britain and France accused Libya of being behind the
bombing and wanted Libya to hand over the two Libyan suspects, a
demand rejected by Libya.
</P>
<P>
Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa Muntasser told reporters
here that Libya has asked for the OAU's moral support.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that through perseverance by our organization,
something will come out," he said.
</P>
<P>
OAU ambassadors have been meeting behind closed doors over the
past two days to work out the agenda for the council meeting.

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Agree to "Evaluate Bit by Bit" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
U.S. President Bill Clinton today agreed here to "evaluate bit by
bit the actions of and position taken by Iran," following the
presidential election in the Islamic republic last week.
</P>
<P>
The French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that
President Chirac told President Clinton during their talks this
morning that Europeans keep thinking that a "demanding dialogue"
with Iran is better than a policy of isolation or confrontation.
</P>
<P>
On the situation of the Middle East peace process, Chirac and
Clinton reached an agreement on "a general analysis" of the
situation, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Both of them said that the blockade of the peace process is "a
subject of strong concern," and expressed the wish that the
deadlock of the peace process should be put to an end quickly and
that confidence between Israelis and Arabs be restored.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that it is primarily up to the "actors in the peace
process" to remove the blocks toward a political solution to the
Middle East conflict, and pointed out that the European Union has
presented a formula of proposals aimed at facilitating the
resumption of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Assembly President Meets Chinese Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Assembly President
Antonio Almeida Santos and visiting Chinese leader Li Ruihuan
agreed here today that increasingly frequent contacts between
leaders of the two countries signify the steady growth of
Sino-Portuguese friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is here on a five-day
official good-will visit at the invitation of Santos.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Li said China is satisfied with the steady
development of bilateral ties since the two countries established
diplomatic relations 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Santos on the CPPCC's organizational structure and
its status and role in the Chinese political life.
</P>
<P>
Li said the CPPCC is an important organizational form of the
system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under
the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC is composed of 34 circles of people, including
various political parties, mass organizations and public
figures. Its main functions are carrying out political
consultations, exercising democratic supervision, and
participating in and deliberating state affairs.
</P>
<P>
In foreign affairs, the CPPCC works for promoting world peace
and development, and for increasing mutual understanding and
exchange among the people of various countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the CPPCC is willing to expand ties with
the Portuguese Assembly and other organizations to serve the
Sino-Portuguese friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Santos said his last visit to China has deeply impressed him
with the country's economic development. He attributed the
achievements to the reform and opening-up policy initiated by the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Santos and Li also exchanged views on the issue of Macao. They
agreed that the current situation about Macao's return to China is
very good.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their belief that on the basis of the
Sino-Portuguese joint declaration on the question of Macao and
through joint efforts of the governments of the two countries,
Macao will surely witness a smooth transition, and long-term
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Santos and Li last met in Beijing early this month when Santos
was on a China visit.

<HEADLINE> OAU Seeks More Fund for Drought, Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) is seeking more fund for its emergency assistance fund for
drought and famine, according to the Organizing Committee of the
imminent 33rd OAU Summit here today.
</P>
<P>
There are plans to hold a special pledging meeting at the OAU heads
of state and government summit on June 2-4.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the only contribution made to the fund between
February and May this year was the statutory contribution of the OAU
amounting to one million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The General Secretariat once again appeals to member states to
make additional contributions to the fund as a sign of their
solidarity and the determination of Africa to fight drought and famine
on the continent," said a report circulated at the on-going OAU
Committee of Ambassodors' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The fund has so far helped a project for desertification control in
Bukina Faso, transportation of food and food aid in Kenya, a drought
control project in Zimbabwe and a water supply project in Botswana.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Liberals to Win Slim Majority in Federal Election: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's ruling Liberal Party
appears headed for a slim majority victory in the June 2 federal
election despite a steady erosion in its support, a poll published
today shows.
</P>
<P>
Some 38 percent of decided voters said they intended to vote
for the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, says
the poll conducted on May 22-25.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since the 1993 federal election that the
Liberals have tumbled below 40 percent in popular support across
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Liberal strength in Ontario and favourable splits in the rest
of the country will yield a bare Liberal majority," says the poll
report by Ottawa-based Ekos Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
Yet, any further slippage in support for the Liberals could
result in a minority government, Ekos said.
</P>
<P>
The poll finds that the Progressive Conservative Party is
supported by 21 percent of decided voters, while the Reform Party
gets the support of 18 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
Eleven percent of the voters said they would vote for the New
Democratic Party, while 10 percent picked the Bloc Quebecois.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States and France have
agreed that the international high representative in Bosnia,
Norwegian Carl Bildt, be replaced by Spanish diplomat Carlos
Westendorp, said a U.S. official here today.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse quoted the American official as saying
that Washington and Paris reached the agreement on Monday during a
meeting between French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Washington considered it "very important" that Westendorp, a
60-year-old former foreign minister under the Socialist government
of Spain, will have an American assistant.
</P>
<P>
He could be referring to Jacques Klein, the United Nations
administrator in the Serb enclave of Eastern Slavonia in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of 11 member states of the Follow-up
Committee of the Dayton Peace Agreement on former Yugoslavia will
meet in Sintra, Portugal, on Friday to formally designate the
successor of Bildt, who has been in charge of civil aspects of the
Dayton agreement, mainly the resettlement of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Albright will visit Bosnia this weekend to relaunch the efforts
to apply the Dayton peace agreement signed by the Serbs, Croats
and Bosnian Muslims two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Former Finnish Prime Minister Ilkka Suominen and former British
Defense Secretary Michael Portillo were also among the candidates
for the post.

<HEADLINE> British Women Team Reaches North Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) - A group of British women reached the
North Pole on Tuesday after 13 days of hard expedition from
northern Canada.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said 20 women, ranging in age from 21 to 51,
pulled their own sledges across the 1,000-kilometer journey and
finally reached the North Pole at 0345 GMT on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fantastic achievement. They have done this through
sheer will-power and determination," local reports quoted
operations manager Mike Ewart-Smith as saying.
</P>
<P>
The women were split into five teams walking in stages ranging
from 40 to 70 kilometers. They pulled sledges of equipment and
supplies weighing 55 kilograms over terrain ranging from
ice-pressure ridges to cracking ice sea.
</P>
<P>
The expedition team included journalists, physiotherapists and
designers. They were selected from a group of 100 applicants who
went through rigorous fitness and endurance trials in Britain last
year after replying to a newspaper advertisement.
</P>
<P>
"The concept was to enable women from all sorts of walks of
life to achieve a fantastic goal but at the same time carry on
their own lives," said Ewart-Smith.
</P>
<P>
He said all the women were fit and well, with the only major
incident being one woman who suffered a dislocated shoulder.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Review ACP Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union should come up with
concrete options for dealing with the debt crisis of the 70-member
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of Countries, Organisation
of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim has said.
</P>
<P>
In a progress report on the preparation for the Fifth ACP/CUu Lome
Convention tabled at the OAU Ambassadors' Committee meeting in
Harare, which ended today, Salim said Africa's external debt stock
was fast approaching 400 billion US dollars despite the fact that
Africa had ceased to borrow.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the debt service is crippling and robbing the economy
of needed resources for development. The EU should recognise the
need to formulate concrete options for tackling the ACP debt
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
Salim said building or strengthening the capacity of ACP states had
become very urgent in view of globalisation of the world economy and
increasing competition.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa's trade performance with the EU had been very poor,
with its share of the EU market dropping from 6.7 percent in 1976 to
2.8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Africa's dependence on trade with the EU was the highest among the
ACP group, being 46 percent compared to the Caribbean's 18
percent, and the Pacific's 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said what was not apparent to the EU was that there were
large gains and benefits to the EU from the EU-ACP cooperation,
particularly in terms of public construction contracts in the ACP
states.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention, first signed in 1975, has been the framework
of cooperation between the EU and the ACP states.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Lome Convention, which was signed in 1989 and revised
in Mauritius in 1995, will expire on February 29, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ACP is composed of 70 member states, 47 from Africa, 15 from
the Caribbean and eight from the Pacific region. enditem

and defending champions Argentina, as well as a second round match
on June 26.
</P>
<P>

JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's cellularphone
industry, barely three years old, has got one million subscribers by
Tuesday, according to a high-ranking official of the industry.
</P>
<P>
South Africa officially launched its cellular inustry on July 1,
1994 and recorded one of the fastest growth rates in the world, South
African Press Association quoted Vodacom Managing Director Alan
Knott-Craig as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Vodacom is one of the two major companies specializing for
cellularphone business in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Knott-Craig attributed the rapid development of the cellular
industry to the introudction of pre-paid products toward the end of
last year. He said that his company was expanding its network at an
average rate of two to three base stations per day.
</P>
<P>
Nott-Craig predicted that the cellular industry in South Africa
would grow at an ever increasing rate, reaching a total of almost

<HEADLINE> PKK Kills 5 People in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) has killed five Turkish citizens and wounded
one in an attack against a village in southeastern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a group of PKK militants raided Cardakli
village in Hani town of Diyarbakir, center of southeastern Turkey,
late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale operations to capture the PKK guerrillas, who
escaped from the scene, are underway, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The PKK attacked the village in Diyarbakir at the time when the
Turkish government troops killed at least 1,800 PKK rebels in the
massive cross-border military operation in northern Iraq started
from May 14.
</P>
<P>
The PKK guerrillas often infiltrate into Turkey from northern
Iraq to launch attacks against Turkish positions, posing serious
threats to the security of Turkey's border area.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a near 13-year-old separatist
war, which has claimed more than 23,000 lives in eastern and
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> OECD Praises Uk over Its Labor Market Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) blamed leading European
countries for lagging behind in introduction of vital labor market
reform.
</P>
<P>
However, it praised Britain's record for reducing structural
unemployment over the past decade in a report prepared for its
annual ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Implementing the OECD Job Strategy:
Lessons from Member Countries' Experience, cited Britain along
with the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Irish Republic as role
models for improving labor market.
</P>
<P>
In the UK, the OECD estimates that the structural rate of
unemployment has fallen from 10.2 percent in 1986 to 7 percnet
last year.
</P>
<P>
Britain's unemployment figure has been declined since last
year. But for the first time in several months, the decline in
unemployment was much as expected in march with the rate dropped
to 6.1 percent, the lowest since October 1990.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the OECD claims that structural unemployment rates
have risen sharply in Germany, France, and Italy over the past ten
years, with all three falling behind the UK.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from the organization backed the report in a
communique, saying that greater reform efforts are needed in most
countries.

<HEADLINE> Wijaya Survives Third-game Horror in Badminton Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Fourth-seeded Indra
Wijaya of Indonesia staged a dramatic comeback from 10-0 down in
the third game to overcome Finland's Pontus Jantti in the first
round of the world badminton championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wijaya, who beat Jantti in the Swedish Open last year, said
motivation was one of the reasons that put him behind then.
</P>
<P>
"I was not in full motion in the second set and when it was
10-0 suddenly I waked up to speed up and attack more," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wijaya made spectacular and daring smashes to draw 11-11 in the
third set before finally snatching a 15-3, 4-15 and 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Ong Ewe Hock of Malaysia also had a tough time
when he had to rally from one set down to beat Ukraine's Vladislav
Druzchenko 13-18, 15-4, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's other matches, 10th seed Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen of
Denmark rallied from behind in the second game to defeat Thomas
Johansson of Sweden 15-13, 18-15.
</P>
<P>
Other seeds had an easier time, with world number one Dong
Jiong, Indonesia's defending champion Heryanto Arbi, eighth-seeded
South Korean Park Sung Woo and Denmark's Peter Rasmussen all won
in straight games.

<P>
Other men's singles matches will be played later Tuesday

<HEADLINE> CBI Backs Government on PFI Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) has strongly backed the Government's plans to
review and reform the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) to remove
existing hurdles and accelerate projects.
</P>
<P>
In its response to the Government's 12-point plan to shake up
the PFI, the CBI today backed calls for the abolition of universal
testing for state projects to assess their compatibility with the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Charles Cox, chairman of the CBI's public procurement and
efficiency committee, said: "The top priority is breaking the
logjam in health, and avoiding it recurring in education and local
government."
</P>
<P>
He said the biggest challenge was in the National Health
Service, where many hospital building projects had become bogged
down with unnecessary bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Better project selection was now the top priority, along with
clearer legal guidelines on the relationship between the public
and private sectors, Cox added.
</P>
<P>
Last week one of the first PFI projects -- the building of the
bridge to the Isle of Skye -- was criticized by the National Audit
Office for leaping out-side costing forecasts and for being
undertaken after little market comparison of costs.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that the PFI had been "hampered by not being clear
on its role and authority and through unrealistic expectations
about how hands-on non-executive directors can be".
</P>
<P>
It has also urged the Government to appoint value-for-money
ministers in the PFI who would be responsible for making the best
use of cash in projects.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Federation to Receive UAE Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Federation of Muslims
and Croats are receiving two shiploads of heavy weapons from the
United Arab Emirates, the Sarajevan daily Dnevni Avaz reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The weapons, which include 50 French-made AMX-30 tanks and 41
"Panhard" personnel carriers, are currently aboard the transport
ships Mosa and Sandos.
</P>
<P>
One of the ships is already in the Adriatic sea and both are
expected to dock at the Croatian port of Ploce next week from
where the weapons will be further transported to Bosnian inland.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the weapons are part of the "Train and
Equip" program which was masterminded by the United States to arm
the Muslim-Croat federal army, but opposed by the European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States argued that the federal army should be
sufficiently armed to counter-balance the Serb forces in order to
prevent the resumption of war after Nato peace-keepers leave,
while European countries were concerned that the arrival of heavy
weapons might actually contribute to a new war in the region.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Against Growing Water Shortage in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel warned today that the
Middle East is quickly approaching the time when it has not
enough water for urban and agricultural use due to the growing
water crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon
said that the whole region was quickly running out of water.
</P>
<P>
Calling the water shortage a critical "humanitarian problem"
facing the region, Sharon said the crisis should be dealt with at
the regional level rather than on individual basis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials predicted that the entire region would face a
serious water shortage from the year 2005 to 2010, when there
would be no enough water both for urban and agricultural
consumption.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they said, countries had to turn to large-scale
of desalination for producing more fresh water, which would
cause a heavy burden of cost to the consumers.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that while the Israelis could pay an extra
1,000 U.S. dollars per capital for annual water consumption, it
would be more than the Palestinians could afford.
</P>
<P>
Sharon strongly criticized the Palestinians for their
indiscriminate digging of water wells in the Gaza Strip and
intentional polluting of the water in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians had dug hundreds of wells in
Gaza for agricultural use, leading to the pollution of the
aquifer by sea water.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, he cited Hebron as example, saying the
Palestinian municipality refused to use the Israeli-built sewage
purification facilities and let the sewage water to pollute the
aquifer.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials also charged that the Palestinians in other
West bank cities were channeling untreated sewage water into the
streams, thus polluting not only the water sources, but also the
coastal plain.
</P>
<P>
On the recent resolution of a water crisis between Israel and
Jordan, Sharon said that Israel has promised to provide Jordan
with 25 million cubic meters of good-quality water within three
years until Jordan builds a desalination plant.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Meretz leader Yossi Sarid praised Sharon for
solving the crisis with Jordan. A day earlier, leading
opposition party Labor's leader Shimon Peres also paid tributes to
Sharon for salvaging the Israeli-Jordanian peace
relations.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Labels Netanyahu-Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
labeled today the summit between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at Egyptian Red
Sea resort Sharm el-Sheikh as a failure.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed
Rabbo called the summit an attempt by Netanyahu to try to appear
that he is not diplomatically isolated despite the deadlock in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Mubarak held three-hour talks on exploring ways
of bridging the wide gap between the Israeli and Palestinian
sides.
</P>
<P>
No apparent breakthrough was achieved on reviving the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which have been stalled since
Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in southeastern
Jerusalem in late March.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu insisted the meeting was not a failure, calling it
a positive beginning that would be followed by more steps toward
restarting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment on Israeli press reports that he might
consider a temporary halt to the Har Homa project in order to
start the crucial final-status talks with the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat is to travel to Cairo Wednesday to
be briefed by Mubarak on the details of today's summit. During
the meeting with Netanyahu, Mubarak already made a telephone
call to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Back in Israel, opposition Meretz Party leader Yossi
Sarid criticized Netanyahu for causing the failure of the
summit. He said that as long as Netanyahu refused to freeze the
settlement activities, the deadlock in the peace process would
continue along with the danger of war.
</P>
<P>
The party decided to table a no-confidence motion against
Netanyahu at the Knesset (Parliament) over the failure of the
summit to get the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Leading opposition leader Shimon Peres of the Labor party
said the summit should not be seen as a breakthrough, but only
an attempt to save the peace process from sinking. He noted that
Netanyahu did not have the mandate from his hardline coalition
partners to make any concessions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coalition officials were happy about Netanyahu's
refusal to bow to the pressure to halt the settlement
activities, especially the Har Homa project.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Zvi Hendel from the rightist National Religious
Party offered congratulations to Netanyahu on his resolute
position at the summit. He said Israel should not agree to
resume the peace talks without obtaining Arafat's promise to
combat terrorism.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- German local government today offered
a reward of 50,000 German marks (about 30,000 U.S. dollars) in
order to help tracking down suspected Neo-Nazi arsonists who set a
fire on Sunday destroying a Catholic church in the northern German
city of Luebeck.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out early Sunday totally destroyed the interior
of the St. Vicelin church in Luebeck with nobody injured. Police
linked the incident to Neo-Nazis because the church's outside wall
was smeared with swastikas and the name of a Luebeck pastor who
recently gave a family of Algerian immigrants shelter in his
parish.
</P>
<P>
Despite a number of tips from local residents, police still
failed to discover the trail of the arsonists. A 40-member special
committee has been set up to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile police said the house in which the Algerian family
lives stands currently under their protection for fear of similar
arson attacks.
</P>
<P>
Rita Suessmuth, speaker of German parliament's lower house,
visited the gutted church in Luebeck Tuesday and called on the
citizens to battle all forms of violence.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Reform Debate Unfolding in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The debate on constitutional
reforms is going on in Kenya with the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) issuing an official response to the demands
for change by churches, Muslims and the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Monday, KANU Secretary General
Joseph Kamotho said that such a sensitive exercise like
constitutional reforms can only be undertaken after the
forthcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
He hit out at Church leaders for the tendency of whipping up
public emotions over the issue of constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Catholic and Protestant Church leaders asked
the Kenyan government to effect minimum reforms before the
elections or face unspecified action.
</P>
<P>
Among the "minimum" reforms the Church advocates is that any
person wishing to be president must receive a minimum of 50
percent of the votes in addition to at least 25 percent in five
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi later responded to the
demands put forward by the Church leaders, accusing them of being
dictatorial.
</P>
<P>
The church's campaign coincides with pressure for similar
reforms early this month from Western diplomats based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Kamotho noted that the ruling party had
never been opposed to the need for "good intentioned reforms".
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, KANU will not support piecemeal
review as it is "opportunistic in character and aimed at
satisfying selfish personal interests and leadership ambitions."
</P>
<P>
The KANU spokesman said that a major constitutional reform would
require no less than 36 months since it required careful,
thoughtful and comprehensive handling.
</P>
<P>
But, opposition Democratic Party Chairman Mwai Kibaki said
yesterday that two days were enough to effect minimum
constitutional reforms demanded by opposition parties and
religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Ole Maloiy, Vice-Chairman of the opposition National
Development Party, noted that his party supported the call for
minimum constitutional reforms before the general election.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Review Debts Owed by Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union should make
concrete options to ease the debt crisis in the 70-member
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, Organization of
African Unity (OAU) chief Salim Ahmed Salim has urged.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a progress report on the preparation
for the fifth ACP/EU Lome Convention to the OAU Ambassadors'
Committee meeting ending here today.
</P>
<P>
Salim said Africa's external debt stock is fast approaching
400 billion U.S. Dollars despite the fact that Africa has ceased
to borrow.
</P>
<P>
"The debt service is crippling and robbing the economy of
needed resources for development. The EU should recognize the
need to formulate concrete options for tackling the ACP debt
crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim said strengthening the capacity of ACP states has become
a very urgent need amid the wave of globalization of the world
economy and increasing competition.
</P>
<P>
Africa's share on the EU market dropped from 6.7 percent in
1976 to 2.8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
EU should recognize that there are large potential profits
which can be gained from the EU-ACP cooperation, particularly in
public construction field in ACP countries, Salim stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention, first signed in 1975, is the framework of
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The fourth Lome Convention, which was signed in 1989 and
revised in 1995, will expire on February 29, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ACP group is composed of 47 African, 15 Caribbean and
eight Pacific countries.

<HEADLINE> Survey: US No 1 Exporter of Surplus Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The world market is flooded with
surplus weapons, with the United States being the largest
exporter, showed a survey published today by the Bonn
International Center for Conversion (BICC).
</P>
<P>
The surplus of weapons comes as a negative side effect of
disarmament, implementation of regional ceasefires as well as
reduced military budgets, according to BICC, an independent
institute of the Bonn University.
</P>
<P>
The BICC survey found the US the world's No.1 exporter of
surplus weapons. Between 1990 and 1995, it said, the US sold 7,123
armored vehicles, 827 military aircraft, 72 navy vessels as well
as artillery, radar and guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
Germany ranked second among the exporters, which sold 3,972
armored vehicles, 256 aircraft, 98 vessels and other military
equipment. It was followed by the Netherlands, Russia, Belgium and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The six countries together accounted for 80 to 90 percent of
the global trade of surplus weapons, it was added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Greece, Israel, Egypt and Pakistan were found the major
importers among a total of 90 countries buying surplus weapons.
The report said that between 1992 and 1995, Turkey alone imported
1,028 used battle tanks and 60 combat aircraft, while Greece
bought 940 battle tanks and 98 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
It was also revealed that during the period from 1990 to 1995,
Israel imported 571 used combat vehicles and 136 used aircraft,
while Egypt purchased 1,496 tanks and 11 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The BICC report blamed the availability of surplus weapons for
increased arms races in regions such as Aegean and the Middle
East. BICC Director Herbert Wulf warned that the surplus weapons
could be a source of new conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Voters Not to Let Socialists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac today
urged French voters not to let the Socialist Party "get back to
the saddle" in the next round of legislative election to be held
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"My dear compatriots, the future of your children is in your
hands," said Chirac in a radio-television speech this evening,
one day after Prime Minister Alain Juppe presented his resignation
following the failure of the center-right coalition in the first
round of the election.
</P>
<P>
In what is likely his last public intervention before the
decisive voting next Sunday, Chirac called on the French people to
"choose another way, a modern way which serves better the chances
and interests of France."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the majority you will designate will not take the
risk of weakening the European construction... France, tomorrow,
should be strong, coherent and determined to defend its interests
in the great negotiations which are going on now," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he "has well understood the message of the
French people" coming in from what was widely regarded as a
protest vote last Sunday, and called on the 31 percent voters who
abstained in the first round to ballot in the second round.
</P>
<P>
He praised the performance of Juppe over the past two years,
and said with emotion that he would join the last meeting of the
Juppe cabinet on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I pay a particular homage to the prime minister for his
action and his character. In the future, I have no doubt about it,
the French people will join me in this judgment," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that Juppe has made great effort in readjusting and
modernizing France's economic and social structure "which is not
easy."
</P>
<P>
But he said that France needs to "invent a new method of
government (which is) closer to the French people to listen to
their wishes and their difficulties" by holding more dialogue.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations would
further cut expenditures and reduce posts in its 1998-1999
proposed program budget, UN Under-Secretary-General Joseph Connor
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the proposed budget at a news briefing, Connor said
that the overall level of resources in 1998-1999 would be 2,479.3
million dollars before recosting, 124 million dollars less than
the 1996-1997 budget. As recosting would include inflation
estimated for 1998-1999 and foreign exchange values at end 1996,
the proposed budget would reach 2,583 million dollars, still 20
million dollars less than the existing budget. The current budget
has already realized zero growth over the previous biennium one.
</P>
<P>
The posts in the world organization would be reduced to 8,839,
compared to the current 10,021, Connor said. While reducing
administrative costs, the United Nations would significantly
increase in resources devoted to the regular program of technical
cooperation, thus redirecting resources to areas in the economic
and social field. The world organization would also increase
appropriation in staff training to support the introduction of
managerial change and to improve the effectiveness of staff, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Street Kids to Be Helped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- An organization named Social
Service for the Street created by the Cameroun's Ministry of
Social and Women's Affairs is expected to go operational in July
1997, local paper "Cameroun Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The organization will focus its work on helping the large
number of street kids between the ages of five and 18 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngamo Bernard, the sub director in the department
of the child in the Ministry of Social and Women's Affairs, there
are more than 1000 homeless kids on the streets of Yaounde, 2000
in the nation's economic capital Douala and 1000 in Maroua, a
city in the far north province.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of these kids come from northern Cameroun, 20
percent from other parts of the country and the rest are refugees
from Chad, Sudan and Ethiopia, others are abandoned kids from
prostitutes and broken families. They all looked helpless,
hagard, bare footed, facing hunger and diseases like malaria and
have no place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
These kids engage themselves in all sorts of activities to
earn a living. Some go around the street begging, others clean
offices and market stores or carry luggage at the motor park for
small pay.
</P>
<P>
The Social Service for the Street will help these kids to
resume a normal life. Ngamo says this service will use a three
dimensional approach to sesolve the problem. Firstly, it will
identify the families from where the kids come. Secondly, it will
try to improve their living conditions on the streets through
feeding, shelter, medical care, clothing and the protection of
their right. And finally, it will take them from the street and
train them for some trade for their livelihood.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Robust: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said today
that the country experienced sound economic fundamentals during
the first quarter this year, indicating the economy is "rosy and
upbeat".
</P>
<P>
In a report issued today, the National Economic and Development
Authority said these sound economic fundamentals included lower
inflation rate, continued agriculture growth and a slowdown in the
rise of trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to good weather conditions and favorable market prices,
most of the crops recovered in the first three months this year
from last year's negative performance, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the agriculture sector, a pillar of the Philippine
economy, registered a 4.22 percent growth in the production,
compared to a 2.49 percent in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Citing a February survey on key enterprises in manufacturing,
the report said the value of production index (VPI) also posted
0.1 percent increase compared to the level a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The report said industry output is expected to further pick up
in the succeeding quarters, especially as the troubled
manufacturing sub-sectors get out of their transitory
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the growth of trade balance was limited
to 8.4 percent in the first quarter this year, against 41.2
percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Another indicator of the rosy economy, the average inflation
rate, dropped to 4.7 percent during the period despite the full
deregulation of the oil industry and the hikes in minimum wages in
six regions.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the continued downtrend in inflation, the report
said, the government has already lowered its annual average
inflation rate target for 1997 to 5.2 to 5.7 percent from the
original 6 to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also predicted that the projected seven to eight
percent growth in the gross national product (GNP) for the year
would be attained.
</P>
<P>
The growth rates of the GNP and the gross domestic product
(GDP) for the first quarter are still being calculated and will be
announced soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report dispelled fears that the country will
repeat the banking crisis plaguing Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The report explained that Philippine banks' exposure to the
real estate sector represents only 3.6 percent of the country's
GDP, while the Thai banks' exposure to the sector represents 21
percent of Thailand's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it said, unlike in Thailand, local finance companies
were not significantly engaged in real estate lending.

<P>
THE HAGUE, the Netherlands, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The European
Union (EU) and the United States singed here today two agreements
to deepen their cooperation in combating customs fraud and
smuggling of drug production chemicals.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who arrived here Tuesday evening
for both the bi-annual EU-U.S. summit and the 50th anniversary of
the Marshall Plan, held a two-hour talks today with EU leaders.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the talks, Dutch Prime Minister Wim
Kok, current head of the 15-nation European Union, announced that
the two sides would joint efforts to crack down on the chemicals
used in the manufacture of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Kok said it was an "important step" in the fight against the
booming trade in drugs, widely used in Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also had approved an agreement on "customs
cooperation that will facilitate trade and continue with the fight
against fraud and corruption," Kok said.
</P>
<P>
"And furthermore, we are very close to a common understanding
with regards to the mutual recognition of norms and standards of
products," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two agreements come amid soaring trade between the EU and
the United States that reach some 550 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jaques Santer, president of the EU Commission, who also
attended the press conference, said he was satisfied with the
outcome of the U.S.-EU bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United State and the EU are stepping up
cooperation in a range of areas. In addition to the two
cooperation accords, he expressed his satisfaction with the EU's
announcement to join the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO), following the United States, Japan and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
KEDO was set up in March 1995 to supply the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) with light-water reactors.
</P>
<P>
Also, both sides agreed that the Marshall Plan, which was
unfolded 50 years ago by then U.S. Secretary of State George
C. Marshall to help Europe gain an economic recovery from the
ruins after the war, was inspiring and that the spirit of it
should be carried forward into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that the U.S. and Europe should pursue
their cooperation on the basis of the legacy of the Marshall
Plan.

modern landmarks.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region Tung Chee Hwa cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
The seven-story complex, designed by Terry Farrell and
Partners, has a distinctive skyline resembling a Chinese bowl.
Inside, there are various entertainment attractions, shops,
restaurants and viewing terraces.
</P>
<P>
Owned and developed by the Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Limited
(HSH), the Peak Tower cost 500 million HK dollars (64 million US
dollars). The building was completed in November, 1996 after three
years of construction.
</P>
<P>
HSH chairman Michael D. Kadoorie hoped the Peak Tower could
provide a lively, all-weather destination for both overseas
tourists and local residents.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the distinctive architecture, Kadoorie said: "The
challenge was to create a building on this significant site which
would be identified with Hong Kong itself,"
</P>
<P>
"I can think of no better reflection of such a vibrant,
exciting city, particularly at this juncture in its history as it
prepares to become a special administrative region of China," he
added.

TOKYO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Human cloning should not be allowed
and research on genetic engineering should proceed only with the
consent of the general public, the advisory committee to Japan's
Science and Technology Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many countries, including Japan, do not approve of
human cloning, the committee said there should be legal
restrictions on such experiments.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that the Japanese government set up an special
agency to deal with genetic engineering research. It also stressed
the need to raise the general public's understanding of the
potential impact of such research and urged an examination of the
ethical and social issues involved.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the system to evaluate the safety of genetic
engineering should be improved in order to prevent harmful effects

<HEADLINE> Iraq Paper Criticizes U.N. for Not Stopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi daily today criticized the
United Nations for not taking any measure to stop Turkey's
military incursion in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an article, Ath-Thawra, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath
Socialist Party, expressed its surprise at the failure by the
U.N. Security Council to take any measure to stop Turkey's
military incursion.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been condemning Turkey's cross-border military action
in northern Iraq against the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
which began on may 14.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 to 50,000 Turkish troops supported by tanks and
air force entered northern Iraq to attack the PKK bases there.
</P>
<P>
Iraq described Turkey's military incursion as a flagrant
aggression against an independent and sovereign state, and also a
blatant violation of Iraq's sovereignty, security and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the Turkish government has
ignored an earlier call by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to pull out its troops from the Iraqi soil.
</P>
<P>
The strange thing is that the Security Council has not moved
despite the fact that Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Sa'eed
al-Sahhaf has sent three letters to the U.N. Security Council in
which he detailed the Turkish invasion, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz also
complained that the U.N. has taken no measures against Turkey's
military invasion of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council president, Aziz said that
neither the Security Council nor its member states have taken any
measure against Turkey's invasion in northern Iraq.

<P>
KATHMANDU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Students of a secondary school in
far western Nepal have started a lock-up campaign for an
indefinite period to protest the teachers' penchant for politics,
official news agency RSS said today.
</P>
<P>
The students of the Bageswori school in Kanchanpur district,
about 500 km west of Kathmandu, complained that their teachers
preferred taking part in political activities to teaching at the
school especially after the country adopted a multi-party
democratic system seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Many of the teachers had been actively engaged in different
political parties' campaigning for the local elections which
concluded recently, they said.
</P>
<P>
The students demanded removal of the teachers engaged in
politics, improvement of educational atmosphere, presence of
teachers from 10 AM to 4 PM on school days and necessary
sanitation facilities at the school, the RSS said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Minister: Iran Sees No Change in Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said here today that the country's foreign policy is
unlikely to witness changes after the new president takes office
in August.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the final
round of Tajik peace talks, Velayati said president-elect Seyed
Mohammad Khatami has indicated no change in Iranian diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his support for Khatami's arch rival Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri in the presidential election campaign and his feeling
toward the victory of Khatami, he said, "I sent a written
congratulatory message to Khatami because anyone who wins votes of
people to such a large extent deserves to be congratulated."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would retain his post as foreign minister in
the next cabinet, Velayati said, "as I said before, I will never
refuse to undertake responsibility."
</P>
<P>
As to Iranian support for the government of Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, Velayati said, "we follow the line of the
United Nations in this respect. The UN regards Rabbani's
government as the legal government of Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The religious militia Taliban declared its own government in
capital Kabul after defeating Rabbani's government troops, gaining
several countries' recognition.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister expressed hope that the problem in
Afghanistan would be resolved soon through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Egypt's mediation efforts in the Middle East
peace process, Velayati said, "we think that Israel will not
change its position and that the peace talks will get
nowhere. The Zionist regime will continue to violate the rights
of the Palestinian people as before."
</P>
<P>
"Iran sees solidarity of Islamic states and their serious
contribution to the Palestinian cause as the only key to
peace in the Middle East," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 percent of the Beijing
residents said in a survey of ordinary people's understanding of
science that they were "very interested" in new discoveries in the
field.
</P>
<P>
The survey organizer said such a ratio was higher than the
figures of the United States and Japan, where similar surveys have
been made.
</P>
<P>
About 25 percent of some 3,500 respondents expressed their
interest in new technology and also breakthroughs in medical
research, according to the survey results published today.
</P>
<P>
The data shows that more than 60 percent of Beijingers have
some knowledge of computers, 28 percent understood the term
"acid rain" and 24 percent were aware about the cause of the hole
in the ozone layer. Over half of those surveyed do not believe
fortune-telling.
</P>
<P>
They also hope that new scientific discoveries and technology
could be adopted in diagnosis and treatment of chronic illnesses,
environmental protection, and increase of grain and sideline
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
British scientist Sir Isaac Newton, Chinese geologist Li
Siguang and the ancient Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi, the
first in the world to calculate the value of "pi" to seven decimal
places, were regarded as the most famous scientists by the Beijing
people.
</P>
<P>
"The survey results will help departments in charge of
spreading scientific knowledge among ordinary people do a better
job," said Tian Xiaoping, the organizer of the survey.
</P>
<P>
The same activities have been conducted nationwide, as well as
in big Chinese cities of Shanghai and Tianjin, Tian said.

<HEADLINE> Symphony 1997 to Mark Return of Hong Kong to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A masterpiece by a Chinese
composer, entitled Symphony 1997 (Heaven Earth Mankind), will make
its debut here on July 1 to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Chinese composer Tan Dun spent almost one year creating
Symphony 1997, a 50-minute orchestral work featuring a solo part
by world-known cellist Yo-Yo Ma, a choir of 200 children and a set
of 2,500-year-old Chinese bells.
</P>
<P>
The musical work was commissioned by the Association for
Celebration of Reunification of Hong Kong with China, a
non-government body founded to organize various activities of
celebration in Hong Kong around the handover.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Raymond Wu, chairman of the association, said today: "Tan's
work is so excellent that we choose it as the symphony to
commemorate the historical moment when China resumes its exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the piece of work will be enjoyed by future
generations," Dr. Wu told a news briefing here today, "We will try
our best to play the orchestral symphony on more occasions in
celebration of Hong Kong's return to China."
</P>
<P>
An episode of the symphony will first be played at a grand
gathering to mark the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region on the morning of July 1. In the evening the
music will accompany a spectacular fireworks display across the
Victoria Harbor. The work will be fully staged on July 4 in Hong
Kong, and July 5 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Replicas of the ancient bells called Bianzhong will be brought
to Hong Kong for performance, in which composer and conductor Tan
Dun, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the Asian Youth Orchestra and members of a
local children's choir will all participate.
</P>
<P>
Tan, a graduate in music composition from both the Central
Conservatory in Beijing and Columbia University in New York,
regarded his work as a mix of eastern and western culture.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the components of Symphony 1997, Tan said: "Listen
to the innocent voices of these Hong Kong children. They are the
future of Hong Kong. In this piece I pair them with Bianzhong, the
voice of China. They are bridged by the cello -- 'the story
teller'." The symphonic work is composed of three movements --
heaven, earth and mankind.
</P>
<P>
A compact disc, which combines portions recorded in Hong Kong,
China and the United States, will be released by Sony Musical
following the performance in Beijing.

</P>
<P>
Charitable functions organized by the Government or

The spokesman said, "We are looking at ways to make the
Government House more open to the public and considering the
possibility of establishing part of it as a museum."

<P>
He said that Tung has decided to continue living in his
existing apartment at Grenville House and not in the Government
House.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Russian Reactions to NATO-Russia Security Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian politicians reacted
differently to the historic accord signed between Russia and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Paris on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin said that during the process
of enacting the document, not only the interests of Russia, but
also those of other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States had been taken into account.
</P>
<P>
He added that the signing of the pact was conducive to European
security, though he voiced again his opposition to NATO's eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the signing of the document as "a major victory" for
Russia, Yuri Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow, said it would help contain
NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Shokhin, first vice chairman of the State Duma (lower
house of Parliament) echoed that the pact had paved the way for
closer cooperation between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
However, Mikhail Lapshin, chairman of Russian Agrarian Party,
regarded the signing of the pact as "a major political defeat"
that Russia had suffered in 20th century.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the "Anti-NATO Parliamentary Group" composing
of 250 deputies, pointed out that the pact had not made enough and
definite promise on the non-deployment of NATO nuclear weapons on
the territories of its new member states.
</P>
<P>
Rather, it said, the pact had opened the possibility for the
Western military alliance to deploy troops and military
infrastructure in east European countries.

</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia today retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif ,
stronghold of defeated Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, after hours of
heavy fighting with forces loyal to general Abdul Malik, whose
defection to Taliban last week triggered Dostum's downfall, said
sources in Peshawar, Pakistan's northwestern city.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal came only four days after the Islamic militia,
which now control more than 80 percent of Afghanistan, entered the
stronghold of Dostum, who is now in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clashes broke out Tuesday night between the Taliban and the
Shiite militia Hezb-e-Wahdat linked to Malik's troops, but the
causes of the clash were unclear, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There were also unconfirmed reports that the Taliban had
suffered very heavy casualties, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forces of Ahmad Masood, former military chief of the
ousted Afghan government, has been resisting the Taliban fighters
near the strategic Salang highway liking Kabul and northern
Afghanistan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There were conflicting reports pouring in Peshawar, capital
city of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province, they said.
</P>
<P>
Malik, Masood and other anti-Taliban factions in northern
Afghanistan are planning to form a new alliance against the
Islamic student militia, the sources said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today the decision to admit Myanmar
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be
entirely up to the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, the decision to admit Myanmar will
be entirely ASEAN's decision. I think friends of ASEAN have
recognized this point and many countries have said so," he was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever decision ASEAN is going to make, they will respect
the decision because it is a regional matter, it concerns our own
association," Abdullah said when asked to comment on a foreign
media report on Myanmar's expected entry into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the matter was for ASEAN, and not others, to
decide, and the decision would be consistent with the policy of
constructive engagement adopted by ASEAN in its dealings with
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is expected to join the seven-member regional grouping
together with Cambodia and Laos later this year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Reiterates Claims to Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze today reiterated that his country should participate
in the division of the Black Sea Fleet, according to a Itar-Tass
report from Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said at a press conference that his country
claims the ships which were anchored at its Port Poti before 1992
and withdrawn without consent from the Georgian leadership.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze emphasized that Georgia has taken part in the
creation of the fleet and, moreover, as one of the littoral
countries of the Black Sea, has the right to make the claim.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, a major part of the former Soviet Union's naval
force, is based on the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia and
Ukraine both claim the fleet since the disintergration of the
Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is now visiting
Ukraine and expected to sign an agreement on dividing the fleet
amidst repeated claims made by Georgian's leaders to the
fleet.

<P>
GLASGOW, Scotland, May 28 (Xinhua) -- All-England Open champion
and world number one Dong Jiong has a high fever on Wednesday,
which would probably wiped out his hope to win his first world
champion, his coach said here.
</P>
<P>
Dong, one of the heavy favorites to the world title here, was
not feeling well since last night, his coach Li Mao told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
With his body temperature running as high as 39.8 degrees
Centigrade Wednesday morning, Dong had to battle one hour to gain
a 15-11, 15-5 second-round victory over Pavel Uvarov of Russia,
his coach Li Mao told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The fever would "greatly affects his performance" in Thursday's
third-round clash against 10th-seeded Denmark's Thomas
Stuer-Lauridsen, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said team doctor Luo Weisi has begun to give Dong
anti-biotic shots but was not sure whether he would recover soon
enough to face Stuer-Lauridsen.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese coach Li Yongbo said, "It was normal that a
shuttler had injuries or sickness during a major competition."
</P>
<P>
Dong lost to Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen of Denmark in the final at
last year's Olympic Games in Atlanta, the United States, but won
the World Cup in December, last year.

</P>
<P>
During his current visit to Libya, the Syrian Vice President

<P>
Khaddam arrived in Tripoli from the Mauritanian capital
Nouakchott where he handed Mauritanian President Maaouya Sidi

</P>
<P>
Khaddam's visit to Mauritania was preceded by a visit to the
Tunisian capital for the same purpose.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Stresses Importance of Agro-science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China can finally feed its large
population by promoting agro-science advances in an attempt to
boost output, improve quality of agricultural produce and make
best use of land resources.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Jiang Chunyun, member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and
vice-premier of the State Council, the country's cabinet, in a
national meeting to review the "Harvest Program."
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by China's ministries of agriculture and finance, the
program is set to spread agro-scientific results in China's rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the contradiction between China's growing
population and decreasing farmland cannot be resolved in the
foreseeable future. Also, "it is imperative for China to increase
the supply of agricultural produce so as to improve the people's
lives and promote the sustained economic growth," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that it is a worldwide trend to make use of
science and technology for agricultural development. "Scientific
revolution in the agricultural sector provides both a
challenge and a precious opportunity for China's agriculture,"
Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged governments at all levels to strengthen the
leadership in this regard. In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), agriculture-related research institutions should be
organized to boost the commercialization of agriculture-related
research results by introducing a number of new varieties along
with new planting, animal raising, processing, storage techniques
to local people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted the program, launched a decade ago, has
successfully promoted scientific advances in China's rural
areas. During the past ten years, the ministries introduced 257
types of technology in agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery and
forest sectors to the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture show that as a
result of the project, China increased 31 billion kg of grain, 800
million kg of ginned cotton, and three billion kg of oil-bearing
crops with a combined output value of 40 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's effort to check taxes,
financial accounts and prices has scored good results, the
Ministry of Finance announced today.
</P>
<P>
A total of more than 22 billion yuan (about 2.6 billion US
dollars) in illegal and unauthorized funds was uncovered in the
annual check, which started last November and ended at the end of
March, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Of the funds, which were 39.18 percent more than that uncovered
during the previous check, 17.2 billion yuan has been fed into the
state treasury, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the check netted an additional 3.23 billion
yuan in delayed taxes.
</P>
<P>
A total of more than 160,000 work teams or examination groups,
consisting of a total 552,000 people, checked over 5.05 million
enterprises, units and private businesspeople between November and
March, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 828,000 units and over 13,900
individuals were punished for economic wrongdoing, 321 persons
were subject to disciplinary action and 349 persons were handed
over to judicial departments.
</P>
<P>
The disorder in the financial and economic system has not yet
improved fundamentally, the official said, adding that annual
checks will be continued in the future.

<HEADLINE> China's Stern Land Policy Not to Affect Economy, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's new policy on cultivated
land protection will not adversely affect economic development or
overseas investment, a top land official said.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities have issued a document putting a
one-year freeze on the use of cultivated land for non-agricultural
development, lasting from April 15 this year to April 14 of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The stern policy will not affect the development of the
national economy or the utilization of overseas investment," Zou
told a national working conference on land on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, it will boost the rational use of land
resources, promote economic development, and raise land prices, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China's land, which has long been used haphazardly and
inefficiently, leaves many potentials to be tapped, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, an average Chinese urban dweller occupy 153 square
meters of land each. If the figure can drop to 100 square meters,
another six million hectares of land will be available through the
renovation of old towns and making better use of land resources,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The space will meet the demand of economic development for a
considerable period of time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
To launch the new projects will serve as a means of securing
land as over the past years a great amount of land has been left
idle, he said, adding the renovation of old towns can increase
land availability, and land in developed zones will be better
utilized.
</P>
<P>
Zou pointed out that China's land market has been sluggish in
recent years owing to excessive supply. The freeze policy will
regulate the relationship between land supply and demand and will
foster a healthy land market.
</P>
<P>
"With the rise of land prices, the the development of land
promises a bright future, which will undoubtedly be favorable to
investors," he said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: I'll Feel Better in My Work after HK's Handover, Says Bowen Leung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If there is any change, I can say that as a Chinese, I will
feel better in my work of serving the Chinese people in a place
ruled by Chinese," he said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I have to strike a balance among the three major items on my
agenda: overall planning, land exploitation and environmental
protection," said Leung Tuesday. "It's a great challenge to me."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is geographically small, with a total land area of
less than 1,100 sq km and this includes the reclaimed area at the
northern coast of Hong Kong's largest island, Lantau, for the new
airport. About 80 percent of the land is mountainous and thus not
ideal for any major project.
</P>
<P>
Leung said he had been hard pressed by the rapidly expanding
local population, which has seen an increase of one million per
decade ever since the end of World War II and which is expected to
rise to about 8.1 million by the year 2011, from the present 6.3
million.
</P>
<P>
"The growth poses a big challenge to housing, education,
transportation and the environment in the years to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
The continuous development of satellite townships is the only
way out, as it has been proved by his department's efforts ever
since the early 1970s, said Leung, who now serves as the Hong Kong
government's secretary for planning, environment and lands.
</P>
<P>
The "New Territories", for example, had a population of less
than 300,000 at that time, but the figure has now rocketed to 3.6
million, accounting for about half of Hong Kong's total
population, with the establishment of nine new satellite towns in
the region.
</P>
<P>
His department has drafted a long-term development program for
the period between 2001 to 2006, focusing on the establishment of
10 New Development Zones, seven of which will be in the "New
Territories", according to Leung.
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction of some of the city proper areas is also one of
the key points of the program. Among other proposals, an elevated
road is to be built, running from the Eastern Harbor Crossing
Tunnel through the northern coast of the Hong Kong Island to the
newly-built Western Harbor Crossing.
</P>
<P>
"This could greatly improve the traffic along the northern
coast of the island," Leung believed.
</P>
<P>
To ease the housing pressure, Leung expects to provide some
390,000 residential units by 2001-2005, by allocating some 400
hectares of land for private and public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
On environmental protection, Leung said that to protect the
water and air from being polluted in particular has always been
given equal priority in the overall planning.
</P>
<P>
When asked what is behind the success in his work so far, Leung
noted that the government should not interfere in the specific
work of any department such as his.
</P>
<P>
"Give Hong Kong more autonomy and let it adapt itself to the
needs of the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Born in Hong Kong in 1949 and a graduate of the Department of
Social Sciences of the University of Hong Kong in 1971, Leung
joined the civil service at administrative grade in 1973 and took
up his present post in May 1995. He is the British team leader of
the Sino-British Land Commission.
</P>
<P>
Leung married a social worker in 1975 and has a son and a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
Leung has hobbies ranging from tennis, music to fishing. But
all these are perhaps now all gone, as he put it.
</P>
<P>
"After a busy daily schedule for about 12 hours, I have only
some three hours for myself and my family," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any regret over his choice of the job? "No, I don't. I'm deeply
rooted in Hong Kong and I think I will have a better sense of
responsibility because of my Chinese nationality after Hong Kong's
return to China," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Leung is considering working in still more closer cooperation
with the various departments of China's mainland for the
development of the south China region after the handover and
taking the region as the new springboard for Hong Kong's post-97
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"People are all confident of the future. You can see this by
just looking at the expanding population here," he said with a
smile.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Stresses Respect to Iraq's Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Stressed respect to Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity in an official statement
issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry issued the statement following
strong protests from neighboring Iraq and strong criticism from
Iran, Syria and Arab and Western countries. These countries demand
an immediate withdrawal of the Turkish troops from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey's cross-border military
operation, which is continuing in northern Iraq, is aimed at
removing the terrorist danger toward Turkey from the vacant
authority in the region.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the military operation is to clear northern Iraq
of all the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
added the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that like the previous cross-border military
operations, Turkey will withdraw its security forces from the
region as it reaches its goal to protect the life and security of
the innocent people.
</P>
<P>
With the support of air bombings and artillery fire, about
50,000-strong Turkish government troops have killed at least
1,800 PKK militants since Turkey launched the massive military
operation in northern Iraq on May 14.
</P>
<P>
The military incursion followed a request for help by Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Mesud Barzani, whose
forces clashed with the PKK militants in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a near 13-year-old separatist war
which has claimed over 23,000 lives in eastern and southeastern
Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
The PKK guerrillas often infiltrate into Turkey from northern
Iraq to launch attacks against Turkish military and civilian
targets posing serious threats to the security of Turkey's
border area.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian parliament has given a green
light to a three-way deal under which Ukraine will pay part of its
multi-million-dollar gas debt to Turkmenistan by way of supplying
goods to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran, in return, will pay Turkmenistan in hard currency in the
deal involving 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, to be signed by the three countries on June 27,

session recently.
</P>
<P>
The goods to Iran will include mainly railroad cars and wheels
to be provided by local companies paid in hryvnas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would allow Ukraine to save valuable foreign
currency reserves and was one of the few victories of Ukrainian
economic policies, said First Deputy Foreign Economic Relations
Minister Igor Podoliev.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's debt to Turkmenistan, amounting to 723 million
dollars, stemmed from gas supplies from the Central Asian country.

Ukraine had agreed to pay 141.7 million dollars back for this year,
with 49.6 million already paid by the end of the first quarter,

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' unemployment rate
dipped to 7.7 percent in January 1997 from 8.3 percent a year ago,
National Economic and Development Authority Director-General
Cielito Habito said today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Legislative and Executive Development Advisory
Council meeting, Habito said the economy continues to employ more
people this year than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said a labor force survey showed that an additional 819,000
people found jobs as of January 1997, bringing to 27.3 million the
total number of employed Filipinos compared to 26.5 million in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, he said, indicated that the overall job
situation in the country has been improved this year, but the
situation varies from region to region.
</P>
<P>
While there was an improvement in the employment situation in
some regions, the situation in other regions showed slight
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the unemployment rate in Eastern Visayan, the
central Philippines, jumped from 5.3 percent last year to 7.7
percent this January, he said.
</P>
<P>
Habito pointed out that most of the new jobs were created in
the industry and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Industry opened 208,000 new jobs last January, which is an
improvement by 47.5 percent over the year-ago figure.
</P>
<P>
Services likewise created 668,000 new jobs this year compared
to the 560,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the agriculture sector created 59,000 new jobs as
against the 631,000 jobs in 1996.

<HEADLINE> India Develops Phytochemical Extraction Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have developed
a process for extracting a phytochemical that could be used as
hepato-protective drug against liver diseases, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
The scientists at the Central Institute of Medicinal and
Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) in India's Uttar Pradesh have obtained
this phytochemical from lantana camara, a weed plant which is
abundantly available throughout the country and contains a high
concentration of the phytochemical.
</P>
<P>
Hepatic disorders are a major concern of medicinal plant
research nowadays as synthetic drugs have not been significantly
effective in curing liver injuries.
</P>
<P>
Toxicity tests on the phytochemical extracted by the CIMAP have
shown that it is a relatively safer drug for hepatic disorders,
PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The CIMAP has filed a patent for the process and invited
pharmaceutical houses to make use of the material in the
production of a life-saving drug, it added.

HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) began its 40th meeting here today with its focus
expected to be on a number of remaining issues including detailed
arrangements for Hong Kong's handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Beginning the three-day meeting which is described as the final
one during the transition period before July 1, Zhao Jihua, head
of the Chinese team on the JLG, said: "We want the meeting to be a
success."
</P>
<P>
As the final one before Hong Kong's handover, the meeting is of
"special significance and special importance," Zhao pointed out,
stressing the need to make the best use of the numbered days and
accelerate the effort to solve the remaining problems.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the remaining problems can be basically settled
at this meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that the sides have achieved, at the levels of
both chief representatives and experts, a number of significant
results since the 39th meeting of the JLG held in London in March.
</P>
<P>
The results are related to the overall arrangements for the
handover ceremony, the entry of the second and third contingents
of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong garrison advance
personnel, the localization of some laws including that on civil
aviation and Hong kong's bilateral agreements with other regions
or countries, Zhao noted.
</P>

Senior British representative on the JLG, Hugh Davies, on his
part expressed the hope that the current meeting would be as good

<HEADLINE> WHO: Developing Countries Suffer Most From Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Eight hundred million out of all 1.1
billion smokers in the world and 70 percent of three million
deaths each year caused by tobacco products are in the developing
countries, according to a fact sheet released by the World Health
Organization (WHO) here today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, cigarette consumption has remained at
over 1,600 cigarettes per adult per year. However, in the last two
years, WHO points out, there has been a shift in the distribution
of tobacco consumption, with a drop in the developed countries as
against an increase in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
WHO said, the sharpest increase of tobacco-related diseases is
expected in India and China where consumption has grown most
rapidly. In China, for example, there are about 300 million
smokers inhaling an estimated 1,900 cigarettes each.
</P>
<P>
Making "United for a Tobacco-Free World" as the theme of this
year's World No-Tobacco Day, WHO calls on governments to play a
central role in tobacco control, and points out that the most
effective actions to reduce the tobacco epidemic are not in
hospitals but in government halls.
</P>
<P>
If no strong and immediate action is taken, it warns, the
current death toll of three million each year, one every 10
seconds, will rise to about 10 million in three decades and a
total of half a billion people will die from tobacco products by
then.

opening of the airport. Yang Rudai, Vice Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), attended the opening ceremony at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The new airport significantly improves the infrastructure of
Guizhou and its investment environment, and will speed up the
economic development and opening of the province, Premier Li said
in his telegram.
</P>
<P>
The 4D-class airport is designed to handle five million
passengers annually, compared with one million of Guiyang's
Leizhuang Airport which was put into use in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The total handling capacity is expected to reach some 1.2
million people this year and to reach 2.1 million annually by the
end of this century, as cargo handling capacity increases at a
rate of 20 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
The flights, aside from the chartered flights to Hong Kong,
will increase to 40 in the next three years to Singapore, Thailand
and other southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The four-million-sq.m. project, costing about 1.3 billion yuan
(156.6 million US dollars), is the first operational airport among
eight which are to be built across China this year, Chen Guangyi,
director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC),
said at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The airport will be of great significance to improving the air
transportation network of southwest China, a mountainous area with
many land transportation difficulties, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
CAAC will offer full support to the air transportation sector
of southwestern provinces in future, said Chen.

<HEADLINE> One Out of Three HK People Don't Drink Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A survey found that one out of
three Hong Kong people drink less than six glasses (250
milliliters per glass) of fluid everyday, the bare minimum doctors
recommend, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Close to 40 percent of 1,014 people surveyed don't find enough
time to get an adequate intake. 21 percent reported they were not
thirsty and 12 percent said they forgot.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons included wanting to avoid going to the toilet and
drinks not available.
</P>
<P>
Doctors warn that inadequate fluid intake leads to dehydration,
which results in dry skin, bad breath, constipation and more
serious ailments like kidney stones and urinary tract infections.
</P>
<P>
Since the body loses about three liters of water every day
through breathing, urinating and sweating, doctors recommend eight
glasses of fluid per day, with six the minimum.
</P>
<P>
Water was the most common drink among those surveyed, with
nearly 94 percent saying they drank it everyday. Soup came in the
second and tea or coffee the third.
</P>
<P>
The survey, commissioned by the Liberal Party, was conducted
over telephone by a research center with the University of Hong
Kong.

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The performance of listed companies
operating in China's many ethnic minority areas was better than
average last year, according to today's Shanghai Securities News.
</P>
<P>
There were 46 companies from ethnic minority areas listed on
China's two stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, that had
issued A-shares, reserved for domestic investors, by the end of
April, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The companies' gross and net profits increased in 1996, and the
yield for the 46 companies was 0.29 yuan per share, about the
average for all companies listed on the two bourses.
</P>
<P>
As more companies from ethnic minority areas are listed, more
people from minority groups open trading accounts, the newspaper
says.
</P>
<P>
China's ethnic minority groups are scattered over about 64
percent of the country's territory, an area of more than 9.6
million sq.km.
</P>
<P>
The two stock markets, which opened in the early '90s, have

<HEADLINE> Engagement With Asia Australia's Top Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Engagement with Asia was
Australian government's top foreign policy priority, Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a new attack on attitudes fueled by independent MP Pauline
Hanson, Downer said the public was uncertain and skeptical about
engagement with Asia, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister said this was the government's
top foreign policy priority.
</P>
<P>
"No Australian government with a shred of responsibility and
concern for the well-being of future generations of Australians
would choose blithely to turn the nation away from the very region
where our prosperity and security lie," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet that is exactly what is offered by views which would leave
Australia sitting alone in the corner like a petulant child at a
party."
</P>
<P>
Downer told an Australian Institute of International Affairs
function that Australians had to be persuaded that engagement with
Asia did not mean abandoning their unique values and way of life
and their historical links to other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"One of the great challenges of public leadership is to explain
to a rather skeptical and uncertain public this fundamental
importance of engagement with Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a difficult task which demands ability to explain to
Australians that if we do not engage with Asia we will have no
control over our security environment, we will never reduce our
unemployment and living standards will at best stagnate and at
worst fall."
</P>
<P>
Downer said Hanson and her supporters wanted an economically
isolated and culturally monotone fortress.
</P>
<P>
"But a fortress Australia would be an insular, narrow minded,
intolerant and protectionist Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These views, if they ever became official policy, would leave
us internally divided, economically downtrodden and morally
bereft."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese bookstore, the
Uchiyama, was commemorated today by the Shanghai literati for its
close ties with Chinese revolutionaries such as Lu Xun and Guo
Muoruo since its founding in this city 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The bookstore, opened by Uchiyama Kanzo of Japan in 1917,
contributed to the introduction of democratic ideas and new
sciences to China at the start, it was said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of Shanghai Literary Association Du Xuan, Lu
Xun's grandson Zhou Lingfei, and Japanese Consular Toshio
Matsumura, spoke at a symposium marking the 80th anniversary of
the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
Uchiyama Kanzo used his bookstore to provide sanctuary to
famous leftist writers such as Lu Xun, Guo Muoruo and others,
against Kuomintang suppression.
</P>
<P>
Most of Lu's books in Japanese were bought from the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
After he returned to Japan in 1947, Uchiyama devoted himself to
documenting his friendship with Lu Xun and Chinese people. He
toured most of Japan to deliver speeches on Sino-Japanese
friendship and peace.
</P>
<P>
The Uchiyama Bookstore now in Japan mainly sells books about
China.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Expatriates Remit Big Money Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 28 (Xinhua) - Jordan's expatriates working abroad,
mainly in the neighboring Arab states, remitted more than 400
million U.S. dollars back here in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Those expatriats are expected to revive the kingdom's glory in
the 1980s when such remittances made up some one-sixth of its
gross national product (GNP), said Ahmad Mustafa, executive
director of the Research and Studies Department at the Central
Bank of Jordan(CBJ).
</P>
<P>
This also indicates a gradual rise from the major plunge
following the 1990-91 Gulf crisis in which some 350 thousand
Jordanians working in neighboring Arab countries were driven back
for their country's siding with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the remittances already amounted to 1
billion dollars in 1996, the executive director said in an
interview with Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
The trend is moving up and it will be more meaningful over a
longer period of time, Mustafa added.
</P>
<P>
The remittances in 1997 are expected to reach 1.6 billion
dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Official statistics, the remittances were 809
million dollars in 1992, 1 billion in 1993, 1.07 billion in 1994
and 1.23 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of Jordan's young people from 18 to 22 years
old are educated at universities or community colleges. However,
due to the limited market in Jordan, some of them find jobs in
other Arab countries and make big wealth.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rules Out Meeting With Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today ruled out the possibility of
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at the
current stage.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks after being briefed by Osama Baz, top
adviser to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, on the results of the
 Tuesday summit between Mubarak and Netanyahu held in Egypt's Red
Sea resort Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters that there were no prospects for
holding a meeting with Netanyahu as long as Israel rejects
the Palestinian demand for a halt to the settlement expansion
in order to resume peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel is waiting for the outcome of the Arafat-Baz meeting
and Arafat's reaction to the ideas raised at the Sharm
el-Sheikh summit.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Mubarak failed to produce a formula for
renewing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which has been
stalled since Israel began building the controversial Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But the two leaders agreed to meet again in the coming
weeks to continue their efforts to find a solution to the
crisis. Mubarak said he hoped to convene a tripartite summit
which will include Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has so far refused to talk to Netanyahu since the
start of Har Homa construction in late March. Despite Israel's
repeated demands and the mediation by U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross, the Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and peace
negotiations have failed to resume.
</P>
<P>
Although the Israelis and Egyptians rejected the claim that
the Netanyahu-Mubarak summit was a failure, Palestinian officials
have expressed deep disappointment at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's senior advisers said, according to Israeli newspapers,
that Arafat was angry because he felt Israel was not
serious in resuming the peace talks and Netanyahu was not
interested in resolving the problems.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeinh, an adviser to Arafat, said: "Netanyahu
and his policy will bring destruction to the entire region.
Not only Israel will lose, he will put the entire region
into a crisis."
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned Netanyahu
for trying to destroy the peace accords by continuing expanding
settlements. PNA Culture Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo blamed
Netanyahu for the failure of the summit, saying "it will not be
surprised if the ground burns again."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Security
Services, warned that the situation was tense, and could
trigger a violent outburst in the Palestinian territories at
any moment.

JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government has
denied a claim by nine political parties that the work done by
the chief electoral officer was a legal derailment of the
electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today from Maseru said the parties last
Friday rejected the work on the registration and compilation of
voters' list and demarcation constituency boundaries in
preparation for the general elections next year.
</P>
<P>
The parties also called on the government to expedite a law to
abolish the chief electoral office and replace it with an
independent electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Foreign Minister Kelebone Maope said yesterday that
there was no need to worry about laws aimed at creating the
independent electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
The bill for the independent electoral commission was recently
passed by the senate with amendments, which were ratified by the
National Assembly last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the attorney-general was busy preparing a
clean bill for signature by King Letsie.
</P>
<P>
Only after then can the process of establishing an independent
electoral commission begin, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said it was important that preparations for elections
continue, adding that once established, the commission would
decide whether to accept or reject the work of the chief
electoral officer.

<HEADLINE> China Speeding Up Afforestation in Northern Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China has started a large-scale
aerial seeding operation for afforestation in 13 northern and
western provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities,
according to a Ministry of Forestry official.
</P>
<P>
He said that China plans aerial seeding on 779,000 hectares of
land in the northwest, north and northeast in five years starting
in 1996, 1.3 times the total afforestation area of the past 18
years.
</P>
<P>
The "three-north" shelterbelt project began in 1978 and was
regarded as one of the world's largest ecology projects.
</P>
<P>
China has a more than 40-year history of aerial seeding and the
tree survival rate has reached 50 percent. China plans to build up
its shelterbelt system by 2050 by afforestation of 35.6 million
hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
China has used various kinds of seed processing technology and
mixtures of trees and grass for aerial seeding with the help of
ground satellite navigation.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the aerial seeding is 300 yuan (37 US dollars) for
each hectare of land, one-fourth the cost of afforestation by
people.

The currency is expected to continue to trade between 76.30 US

<HEADLINE> Macao Still Appealing for Tourists: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Macao is still an attractive place
for tourists although travelers from Hong Kong dropped during the
first four months of this year, a senior Macao government official
said.
</P>
<P>
Salavessa da Costa, secretary for Media, Tourism and Culture,
said on Tuesday that Macao's charm was proved by the 23-percent
increase in tourist arrivals from other parts of the world in
April.
</P>
<P>
Macao immigration officials said this month that the number of
Hong Kong travelers to Macao dropped by 170,000 in the first four
months of the year compared with the same period of last year.
Figures showed that the number fell by 90,000 in April alone.
</P>
<P>
Officials said many factors, including a recent wave of crimes
in Macao, led to the drop.
</P>
<P>
Costa told the Macao Daily News that he believes many Hong Kong
tourists may have chosen to go to other destinations instead.
</P>
<P>
He quoted an official at the World Tourism Organization, which
convened a session in Macao this month, as saying that Macao is
safe and a place worth sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
Tourism contributes the lion's share to local revenues. The
government expects the number of coming visitors to reach nine
million this year, after 8.15 million visitors were recorded in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong and HK Firms Plan Investment in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joao Magalhaes Domingos, president of the Macao Trade and
Investment Promotion Bureau, told the Macao Daily News on Tuesday that
his bureau is negotiating with two Zhuhai companies and several Hong
Kong companies on their investment in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Their total investment will mount to over 600 million patacas
(about 75. 9 million US dollars), according to Domingos.
</P>
<P>
Known for its casinos, Macao's weak manufacturing industry,
mainly toy and garment making, is being severely crippled from
fierce competition from neighboring regions. The authorities have
tried to woo outside investors to upgrade its manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The two Zhuhai companies, whose names the president denied to reveal,
plans to set up ventures involving high technology. One of the planned
venture will need investment of 120 million patacas (about 15.2
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Zhuhai-invested venture in Macao will start manufacture laser
disk products in July this year, and another Zhuhai-invested firm to
produce medical products and equipment is yet to be approved, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a group of entrepreneurs and officials from Zhuhai is on
a visit in Macao. They were greeted by local investment officials and
investment promotion organs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of Hong Kong companies are moving into Macao.
They include two paging companies, a small beer brewery, a
pharmaceuticals institute and an electronics company, whose investment
volume would add up to more than 500 million patacas (about 63.29
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Macao's cost of labor, rent of workshop and office building are
all lower than Hong Kong, and that help the territory gain more
investors, according to Domingos.

<P>
BONN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest industrial group
Daimler-Benz notched up revenues of 36.3 billion German marks
(21.5 billion U.S. dollars) in the first four months of 1997, up
15 percent from the same period of 1996, the company announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz chairman Juergen Schrempp said the growth had been
fueled by the automotive division with its passenger car turnover
up 14 percent to 16.2 billion marks (9.6 billion dollars), and
revenues from commercial vehicles up 15 percent to 11.6 billion
marks (6.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
At the annual general meeting in Stuttgart Wednesday, Schrempp
said the company was expecting deliveries of over 700,000
passenger cars this year, after last year's 645,000.
</P>

Daimler-Benz was also expecting "substantial improvement" both
in sales revenues and operating profits for the year as a whole,

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Warns Parliament of "Enemy's Plot" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
today sternly warned the Parliament of "enemy's plot to
destabilize" his country in the wake of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with members of the Parliament, Khamenei urged
the Parliament to "get a clear understanding of the situation"
and "take wise actions."
</P>
<P>
The warning came after last Friday's election, marked by an
unprecedented turnout and a landslide triumph of moderates over
conservatives. Observers noted they spelled out concern and worry
about the political situation in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Moderate candidate Mohammed Khatami defeated hardline
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri by winning more than 20
million, or 69 percent of the total, votes. Nateq-Nouri, a
representative of the conservative wing, was said to have the
tacit support of Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The massive turnout was thus interpreted by the west as a
political protest against the regime and an eagerness for changes.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts noted that the meeting between the
Iranian leader and Parliament members was very important because
the Parliament is going to elect a new speaker on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They said that there are now three candidates, including the
incumbent Speaker Nateq-Nouri, competing for the post.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri would retain the post in the Parliament dominated
by conservatives, analysts said. Should he fail again, it will
send even greater impact on the Iranian society, they added.
</P>
<P>
Khameni rejected the "misinterpretation of" the massive
turnout, warning that the "enemy is trying to create a nationwide
controversy in the country."
</P>
<P>
He said the turnout indicated that the people support the
Islamic system. The elected president serves to smash enemy's
rumor since the new president put emphasis on the law, social
justice and adherence to the lines of late spiritual leader
Ayatollah Khomeini, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said all slogans by the new president is
revolutionary and go with the Islamic system, reported the
state-run Tehran Radio.

<HEADLINE> Navy Fleet Returns Home from American Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANJIANG, GUANGDONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A navy fleet of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) returned today to the
Zhanjiang naval harbor in south China's Guangdong Province after
its goodwill visit to the United States, Mexico, Peru, and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, greeted the
fleet at the harbor.
</P>
<P>
The Central Military Commission sent a congratulatory message
to officers and men of the fleet, praising their contributions to
promoting friendship and understanding of the peoples and armies
of China and the four American countries and to maintaining and
promoting world peace. The visit also added a new chapter to the
PLA's navy history, the message said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the message added, The visit had served as an
all-round training and test for the navy in organization and
command, marine training, new technology, logistics, and in the
navy's combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
The message read by Liu Huaqing also called on navy officers
and men to meet the general requirements of "being qualified
politically and competent militarily, having a fine style of work,
maintaining strict discipline, and being assured of adequate
logistic support" set forth by CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin, so as to
raise to new heights the building up of the navy into a modernized
and regularized revolutionary army.
</P>
<P>
Since it left Zhanjiang on February 20, the fleet has sailed
24,000 nautical miles in 98 days. And the trip, first of its kind
by a Chinese navy fleet to the American continent, has also
created several firsts in the country's navy history in terms of
distance traveled, duration of time, and scale of the fleet.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Develops New Cannon for Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has developed a
new cannon which can provide tank commanders of the future with
effective firepower against armors and bunkers, according to
military sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest powerful gun, codenamed EMAk 35, was designed by
Denel, the state-owned arms manufacturer in South Africa. It is
also the latest in a long list of South African-developed
military equipment.
</P>
<P>
Others have included the Rooikat armored vehicle, a range of
mine-resistant vehicles, the G-5 and G-6 artillery pieces,
frequency-hopping radio transmitters for secure communication,
and the Rooivalk attack helicopter.
</P>
<P>
According to EMAK designers, EMAK 35's loading and firing
mechanism is driven by an electric motor and not by the
high-pressure gases generated in the barrel during firing as is
the rule in conventional cannon design.
</P>
<P>
Project Manager Albert Owgan said that the gun can fire 120
rounds a minute of standard 35 x 228 mm ammunition and can be
converted to fire 50 mm rounds as well.
</P>
<P>
It has been designed as an external, remote-controlled weapon,
but can also be mounted in a turret. It can be operated by hand
by the turret crew if their vehicles's energy supplies are
disabled.
</P>
<P>
EMAK is expected to give South African army infantry combat
vehicles of the next century effective firepower and will replace
weapons on existing vehicles, military sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market

steadied from its recent sharp losses and ANZ Banking Group
delivered better than expected half year profits.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries index closed 6.3 points firmer at 2585.2,
passing its previous record high set on Monday of 2584.8
</P>
<P>
Lance Jones dealer Brett O'Donovan said the market bounced back
in afternoon trade, boosted by ANZ's result and a recovery in key
resource stocks such as BHP and WMC.
</P>
<P>
ANZ shares closed at a record high after reporting an 18
percent rise in half year net profit to 615 million Australian

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Reported in Talks With S. Leonean Coupists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
started negotiations on Tuesday night with Sierra Leone's
coupists, ostensibly to seek a peaceful vacation of power of the
isolated new military government, the daily "Champion" said
today.
</P>
<P>
The talks followed the reported anchorage of two of the
Liberia-based force's naval boats off the shores of Sierra Leone
earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean soldiers sacked the 14-month-old civilian
government in a coup on Sunday, forcing President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah to take refuge in neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the force, known as ECOMOG, would
resort to force to ensure the ouster of the military regime led
by Major Johnny Paul Koroma if the negotiations failed, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah however had appealed to west African
countries to help restore democracy in his country, his
ambassador to the United Nations, James Jonah said in the UN on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The envoy was also authorized to ask for sanctions against
coup leaders, including non-recognition of the current military
regime and a travel ban on the coupists.
</P>
<P>
As a sub-regional power, Nigeria has not yet made any official
reaction to Sunday's coup in Sierra Leone so far.
</P>
<P>
But local press reports said the Nigerian government may have
adopted a hard stance against the coup plotters.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, a counter-coup is
reportedly rife among residents who ignored the military's orders
to return to work. Shops and businesses, largely looted in the
coup, remained closed along with markets.
</P>
<P>
In bo, the second largest city of the country, 5,000-8,000
people staged a demonstration on Tuesday asking for the
restoration of Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Liberia, the ECOMOG also sealed off land and
sea frontiers with Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah reportedly said in Guinea he was still the
head of state and intended to return to Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Makes Decisions on Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The provisional ruling Council of
Nigeria will later today meet in Abuja to decide on a request to
reschedule the transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
The country's five political parties, the Transitional
Implementation Committee and the National Electoral Commission
met on May 20 in Abuja and agreed to recommend the rescheduling
to the government.
</P>
<P>
Their suggestion is that the state assembly election
originally set for the second quarter of this year be shifted to
the same quarter of 1998, and be held simutaneously with the
national assembly poll.
</P>
<P>
The governor election fixed for the last quarter of this year
is also to be postponed to the third quarter of 1998, and be held
at the same time with the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The rescheduling request takes into consideration delays in
elections preparations and is desirable to avoid conflicts
between civilian governors and a military head of state that are
possible under the original transition timetable, early reports
said.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed, however, the October 1 date for the
inauguration of the new civilian government will remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, to be presided over by the Head of State,
General Sani Abacha, will also discuss the recent spate of bombs
blasts and ethnic clashes in the country, local media reported.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Netanyahu's Gamble Behind Sharm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- By agreeing to hold the Sharm
el-Sheikh summit, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was gambling on
the Egyptian pressure to revive the peace process without
compromising on settlements.
</P>
<P>
No breakthrough was achieved at the summit held between
Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, despite their
agreement to continue efforts to break ice in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians regarded the meeting as a chance, the
Israelis hailed it as a positive beginning, but the
Palestinians labeled it a failure. These different assessments
well reflected the delicate and difficult situation of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the holding of the meeting itself was a
positive development in view of the tense situation caused by
the two-month stalemate since Israel began the controversial Har
Homa settlement construction in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said: "The progress was
in the very fact of the meeting." But he was quick at
pointing out that "good will is not sufficient" to bring the
peace process back on track, and urged Israel to suspend its
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of apparent progress, Mubarak intentionally
refrained from making harsh criticism against Israel at the press
conference following the meeting. He even avoided directly
mentioning the differences between him and Netanyahu, and instead
promised to persuade Arafat to consider proposals put forward by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The change of attitude was parallel to that by the
Israeli side, which has also dramatically tone down its verbal
attacks against Cairo. This was evident in the fact that
Netanyahu, who until about a week ago still denounced Mubarak
for obstructing the peace process, finally agreed to hold the
summit which virtually awarded Mubarak a central role in
mediation.
</P>
<P>
Giving the Egyptians the green light to mediating the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute was not an easy decision for
Netanyahu. Israeli analysts said this was a gamble by him,
which might have far-reaching negative effects on the peace
process if it failed.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to deposit in the hands of President Mubarak
the salvation of the negotiations with the Palestinians contains
in it a gamble, a gamble which we have taken upon
ourselves," a senior official close to Netanyahu was quoted by
the Hebrew daily Haaretz as saying.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz revealed that Netanyahu's tactical change toward Egypt
came in light of two assessments: Mubarak has at his
disposal pressure levers over Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
which no other leaders have; and second, Mubarak is interested
in showing the U.S. Congress the centrality of his country
and thus will gladly take upon himself the role of mediator.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu hoped to transform what he saw as Mubarak's
negative role into a positive one with the Egyptian leader
coaxing Arafat to go toward Israel. Netanyahu expected Arafat
to be pushed back to the negotiating table with a weakened
position -- without his patron Mubarak, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Israel agreed to accept Mubarak's
senior adviser Osama Baz to visit Jerusalem last week to
begin the unprecedented shuttle mission. Today Baz is to
travel to Gaza to brief Arafat on the Sharm el-Sheikh
summit.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mubarak had his own reasoning for the change
of attitude toward Israel. According to the prestigious Hebrew
daily Yediot Ahronot, Mubarak feared the rise of Islamic
terrorism due to the peace deadlock and knew that peace was
one of the most effective ways to eliminate this enemy.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was also facing the pressure from the United States
which threatened to cut its aid to Egypt for his anti-Israeli
stance in the peace process. Moreover, Mubarak assessed that the
recent failure of U.S. envoy Dennis Ross' mediation created a
vaccum, which Egypt can fill to prove itself to be the head of
the Arab leader, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
In a short term, the Sharm el-Sheikh summit seemed to
create a vital lull in the Arab condemnation against Israel.
But in a long term, the gamble by Israel could backfire on
the whole situation if it continues refusing to back down
from its hardline position on the settlements.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has not changed its opposition to Israel's settlement
activities, so it might find it difficult to persuade the
Palestinian side to tone down its stand on this issue.
Mubarak also made it clear that he would not exert pressure
on either Israel or the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
And, the lack of quick results from its mediation is
likely to push Egypt to renew its full backing for Arafat
and criticism against Israel.
</P>

<HEADLINE> "China Will Never become a Superpower," Top legislator says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- "China will never become a
superpower and will always be a force safeguarding peace in Asia
and in other parts of the world and promoting the development of
all mankind," China's top legislator has said.
</P>
<P>
in an interview on May 23 in Beijing with Nathan Gardels,
editor of the US "Global Viewpoint" service, Qiao Shi, Chairman of
the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress,
briefed the journalist on China's economic development, democratic
and legal development, the return of Hong Kong, environmental
protection and international relations.
</P>
<P>
On the question whether China's economic development will bring
threats to other countries, Qiao Shi gave a negative answer by
saying that historically, China was invaded and bullied repeatedly
by foreign powers, but China will not be a threat to others
whether it was very poor and are experiencing great difficulties
or doing better economically. "China has always stood for the
equality of all counties and it has opposed any form of
hegemonism, power politics or invasion and expansion. In the
future when China has become developed and when its overall
national strength has increased, it will make further
contributions to world peace and stability," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's economic development, the chairman
said that in determining the speed of development, China proceeds
from reality. Since the policies of reform and opening up were
introduced in China in 1979, he said, "the Chinese economy has
been growing by more than nine percent annually. During the Ninth
Five-year Plan period (1996-2000), we will exercise macro-economic
control so that the economy can increase by eight percent
annually. In the first decade of the next century, we will
exercise macro-economic control based on the assumption that the
economy will grow by about seven percent annually."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy as a whole is not big and the average per
capita GNP is still very low, he said, adding that it is predicted
that by the end of the century, calculated at present prices and
exchange rates, China's average per capita GNP will be about 800
US dollars, and it will only be about 1,500 US dollars by the year
2010. "So China will still be a developing country at that time,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the competition between states, Qiao Shi
pointed out: "Competition between states is normal, and conflicts
or disputes are bound to arise. As long as the concerned countries
do not only consider their own interests but also respect the
interests of others and take into consideration the common and
long-term interests of all countries, reasonable, fair and
feasible solutions to conflicts and disputes will be found through
consultation on the basis on equality. We believe that
disagreements between countries should be resolved through
dialogue, not through confrontation.
</P>
<P>
On China's economic system, the chairman said that since the
founding of the People's Republic of China, it has been trying to
find a developmental path suited to its unique situation. "After
several decades of working on this, China began its reform and
opening up in the late 1970s and blazed a developmental path
suited to its own conditions, that is, the path to a socialist
market economy, he said, adding that experience demonstrates that
the socialist market economy is suitable for conditions in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the issue of the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, Qiao
Shi said that "After Hong Kong is reunified with the motherland,
we will implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration and follow
the Basic Law to the letter. The Central People's Government will
absolutely not interfere in affairs that fall into the category of
autonomy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. After the
year 2000, Hong Kong will continue to be prosperous and stable and
it will have a brighter future."
</P>
<P>
When asked about how China view its responsibility to global
environmental protection, Qiao Shi pointed out that it is China's
basic policy to protect the environment, and the country is
conscientiously implementing a strategy of sustainable
development. "China is taking an active part in international
environmental affairs; it is promoting international cooperation
in environmental protection, conscientiously fulfilling its
obligations concerning international environmental protection and
has done a lot of work in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi noted that it is the common task of all mankind to
protect the environment. "To this end, developed countries should
help and support developing countries by providing them with,
among other things, funds and technology," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the question concerning democracy and legal system, the
chairman said that the "cultural revolution" was not democracy; it
was turmoil which brought great suffering to the country and
people. "An important reason why the 'cultural revolution' took
place and lasted 10 years is that we had not paid enough attention
to improving democracy and the legal system. it was because of the
lesson from this bitter experience that by the end of the 1970s
our Party decided to stress the need to develop socialist
democracy and improve the socialist legal system and laws." He
stressed that the core of socialist democracy is that the people
are the masters of the country. "According to the Constitution of
China, all power in the country belongs to the people, and the
people exercise state power through the National People's Congress
and local people's congresses at various levels. In order to
ensure that the people have state power in their own hands and are
the real masters of the country, we must uphold and improve the
people's congress system. To this end, we must strengthen the work
of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committees and
give full play to the role of local people's congresses," Qiao Shi
said.
</P>
<P>
As China has a long history of feudal society and because of
other factors, it will be a long process for us to improve the
socialist democracy and the socialist legal system. We will
continue to proceed from the reality in China in making vigorous
efforts to improve the socialist democracy and the socialist legal
system with Chinese characteristics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the interview Qiao Shi urged the Western media to
objectively and impartially portray China. China, he said,
attaches great importance to protecting the rights of its
citizens. To resolve the differences between countries on human
rights, he said, China advocates the use of dialogue instead of
confrontation. "No country should use the issue of human rights to
interfere in the internal affairs of another country," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Growth Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic growth rate in
1966 dropped to 4.6 percent from 4.8 percent in 1995 and is
expected to be at 5.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Economic Survey released here on Tuesday said that
the failing to meet the 5.5 percent growth target last year was
partly attributed to the recent drought between October and March
hit in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Launching the document, Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti
noted that despite inadequate rains and reduced use of farm
inputs, the agricultural sector recorded a growth of 4.4 percent
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti who is also minister for planning and national
development noted that the agricultural sector would continue to
provide the stimulus for growth.
</P>
<P>
The average long rains received in the months of April and May
this year are expected to boost agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The growth in manufacturing sector was 3.7 percent, a drop
from the previous year's 3.9 percent, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector, it pointed out, recorded a 7.1 percent
growth rate with its share of the GDP rising to 10 percent from
9.8 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the year under review, the tourism sector, the second
highest foreign exchange earner after agriculture, fetched 474
million U.S. Dollars while the number of visitors to the country
went up by 1.9 percent from 690,000 in 1995 to 717,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
On international trade, the over-all balance of payments
account registered a high surplus of 430 million Dollars,
compared with a deficit of 136 million Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti said that the projected recovery of the industrial
sectors, the government's continued implementation of
macro-economic reforms and structural adjustments were expected
to further trigger growth in Kenya's economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government would continue to strive to
control its expenditure and improve on revenue collection, and
would intervene to gradually bring down the prevailing high
interest rates.

<HEADLINE> State Firms Report Double-Digit Growth in Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The growth of profits of China's
state-owned industrial enterprises outpaced that of losses in the
first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned industrial firms reported a total of 56.973
billion yuan in pre-tax profits during the first three months this
year, up 15.67 percent from the corresponding period of last year,
according to the State Statistical Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, losses by state firms went up a mere 8.6 percent to
28.16 billion yuan during the period.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in more than two years that the growth of
losses dropped from a double-digit level, which, together with the
steady rise in profits, indicates performance of the state firms
has been improving, according to Ou Xinqian, an official with the
State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Economic returns of industrial firms at year's start is
usually the poorest due to seasonal factors, but the state firms
has managed to make better achievements this year than the
previous year," Ou said.
</P>
<P>
For several years, China's state firms have been slow to react
to the changes brought about by the nation's market-oriented
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the central authorities have implemented a
series of policies and measures to reform and renovate the state
sector, and enterprises have strived to strengthen their own
management in line with market rules.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to inject more capital into state firms,
alleviate debt burden, and reduce redundancy. Bankruptcy and
mergers have been widely applied where necessary.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized state firms have shown better results
from the reform. The SSB said that their overall performance was
better than the average in the state sector in the first quarter,
with pre-tax profits up 16.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
While admitting time is needed for the state sector to get out
of difficulty, Ou was optimistic about the prospect of state-owned
enterprises, predicting that their performance will keep improving
gradually in the coming months.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has set up a special
technical group to promote Africa's capacity building, according to
the latest issue of the World Bank news.
</P>
<P>
The news quoted World Bank President James Wolfensohn as
saying that the technical group will examine practical
ingredients of capacity building in sub-Saharan Africa and is
also carrying out a complete review of its africa projects to
assess their contribution to boosting the number of local
professionals to make them more responsive.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental thrust of this initiative is that there has
been an enormous amount of money spent in sub-Saharan Africa, but
too much of it has been on technical assistance with foreign
advisors and too little of it has been really in building
capacity," said Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
He said the best guarantee that the bank will be successful in
promoting its new capacity building initiative in Africa is that
it is largely an African-inspired plan.
</P>
<P>
This initiative differs from past efforts because the bank is
away from doing things for African countries to helping them
build capacity, according to the news.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Residents of this leading south
Chinese city no longer have to worry about whether they are eating
unclean or substandard pork, thanks to the local government's
contols on slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
The city used to have more than 1,000 family-run slaughter
operations supplying 8,000 to 10,000 pigs every day, many of which
did not meet health department requirements and posed health
threats.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve the problem, the city government decided that
only pork from government designated slaughterhouses could be
sold, and it spent 168 million yuan (20.24 million US dollars)
building three state-of-the-art slaugherhouses, which slaughter
12,000 pigs in all, sufficient to meet the city's pork needs.
</P>
<P>
These modern plants meet hygiene standards and are equipped
with waste-water processing facilities to reduce pollution. Each
plant has spent six million yuan on cold-storage facilities to
handle pork better in the summer months.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is now taking steps to keep about
2,000 pigs from private slaughterhouses from entering the
market.

technological upgrading.

<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong's return will quicken the pace of the
listing of local enterprises in Hong Kong, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Liaoning and Hong Kong can supply each other's
needs in economic growth. The massive transformation of the aging
industrial enterprises and construction of energy, transport and
telecommunications facilities, as well as the vast consumption
market and and rich labor force in the province will provide a
host of opportunities for Hong Kong investors.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Hong Kong and Liaoning has been
growing with a strong momentum. Statistics showed that by the end
of last year, a total of 5,047 HK-funded enterprises had been set
up in Liaoning, with promised HK investment topping 7.7 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the imports and exports between Liaoning and Hong

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tourist City to Benefit from Hongkong Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry of Guilin in
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of south China expects to
benefit greatly from the return of Hongkong to the motherland, a
leading official says.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jiacheng, Director of the Guilin Tourism Bureau, told
reporters that Guilin will use the opportunity to increase
cooperation with Hongkong to help its already booming tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
Guilin has the scenic Lijiang River and a picturesque landscape
and is one of China's most famous tourist destinations. In the
past decade it has had over six million overseas tourists and
about 100 million Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
It has convenient river, highway, and air links with Hongkong,
which is one of its major tourist sources, and the city takes part
in annual tourism fairs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"After Hongkong returns to the motherland, it will become more
convenient for Guilin and Hongkong to cooperate, especially at a
higher level," Huang said, noting that the two could design a
Guilin-Hongkong tour route and international promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
The two cities will also set up hotel groups and other tourist
facilities and cooperate in personnel training. The Guangxi
Tourism Office expects to expand itself in Hongkong, but
organizations from Hongkong are welcome to set up offices in
Guilin to jointly promote the tourism links between the two, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) has decided to allocate 25 million US
Dollars for Tanzania's population and development activities for
a five years period beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA Representative to Tanzania, Bill Musoke told a press
conference here on Tuesday that the funds will cover activities
emanating from the International Conference on Population and
Development (ICPD) held in Cairo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to Musoke, the ICPD stressed the need for
governments to take deliberate measures to improve the
reproductive health and rights of women, estimating about 17
billion US Dollars to be used by developing nations in population
and reproductive health programs up to year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the costs are expected to come from domestic
resources, and only one third from the donors community.
</P>
<P>
Musoke noted that while many governments have increased their
allocations for population activities since 1994, annual global
expenditures are still below half the 17 billion mark, which is
less than what the world spends each week on armaments.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNFPA has given Tanzania 21 million US Dollars
during the term which ends next month.
</P>
<P>
Seven million US Dollars went to programs educating Tanzanians
on population issues, and the rest to family planning and
repreductive health activities.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA representative disclosed that UNFPA Executive
Director, Nafis Sadik will launch the State of the World
Population Report in London today which gives summary of
reproductive health in the world, with specific data on maternal
mortality, abortions, HIV/AIDS and other infections, rape and
other sexual related issues.

Q: China complains that the West looks at nothing but the human
rights issue and really does not understand the reality in China
today. Can you describe the correct way you think the Western
media ought to be portraying China today?
</P>
<P>
A: We hope that the media will objectively and impartially
portray China today. They should do the same about the human
rights issue in China. China attaches great importance to
protecting the rights of its citizens. The Constitution has
defined all the basic rights for our citizens, and moreover, we
have formulated a series of relevant laws such as the Electoral
Law, the Labor Law, the Trade Union Law, the Law on the Protection
of the Rights and Interests of Consumers, the Education Law and
the Law on Scientific and Technological Progress. In order to
safeguard the rights of people of special interests, we have
formulated the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests
of Women, the Law on the Protection of Minors, the Law on Security
for the Disabled, the Law on the Protection of the Interests and
Rights of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Family Members of
Overseas Chinese and the Law for the protection of the Rights and
Interests of the Aged. In order to safeguard equal rights for
ethnic minorities, we have formulated the law on the Autonomy of
Ethnic Minority Regions. We have also formulated the
Administrative Procedure Law and the State Compensation Law to
protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens from being
infringed upon by illegal activities of administrative and
judicial authorities. We even protect the rights of those
undergoing judicial prosecution during criminal procedures and
those of convicted criminals serving prison terms. All this is
stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law and Prison Law. In March
of this year, the Criminal Law was systematically amended at the
5th Session of the 8th National People's Congress to better embody
the principles that punishment should be prescribed for specified
crimes, that punishment should fit the the crime and that all
should be treated equally before the law. In addition, relevant
stipulations on the protection of human rights were further
improved. To resolve the differences between countries on human
rights, we advocate the use of dialogue instead of
confrontation. No country should use the issue of human rights to
interfere in the internal affairs of another country.

Q: According to one point of view, when China is an economic
power, it will not be a danger to other countries; to the
contrary, China is a danger to others only when it is poor. Can
you expand on this point of view? What will China's geopolitical
role in the world be in the first half of the next century?
</P>
<P>
A: the Chinese people love and value peace. It has always been
China's policy to develop friendly and cooperative relations with
all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence. Historically, China was invaded and bullied
repeatedly by foreign powers, but we will not be a threat to
others whether we are very poor and are experiencing great
difficulties or doing better economically. Domestically, we will
handle our own affairs well, and internationally, we will try to
maintain peaceful coexistence with all counties. Our aim is to
build China into a strong, prosperous, democratic and culturally
advanced modern socialist country.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its reform and opening to the outside world
in the late 1970s, the economy has been developing rapidly and the
standard of living has improved notably. China has undergone great
changes, but it is still a developing country with a large
population, a poor economic foundation, and an uneven regional
development. It will take the hard work of several future
generations to modernize China. According to our development
strategy, China will be basically modernized and will have caught
up with moderately developed countries by the middle of the next
century. To develop, China needs a long-term stable, peaceful
international environment, and it is of particular importance for
China to maintain good relations with its neighbors. At present,
China enjoys good relations with its neighbors and with other
countries. We will maintain friendly and cooperative relations
with our neighbors and work with them to safeguard peace and
stability in this region and in other parts of the world. China
has always stood for the equality of all countries, big or small,
and it has opposed any form of hegemonism, power politics or
invasion and expansion. China will never become a superpower and
will always be a force safeguarding peace in Asia and in other
parts of the world and promoting the development of all mankind.
China has worked on and is presently engaged in safeguarding world
peace. In the future when China has become developed and when its
overall national strength has increased, it will make further
contributions to world peace and stability.

Q: What will China be like by the year 2050? Do you see the
economy growing as rapidly as the Japanese economy did in the 30
years after the end of World War Two?
</P>
<P>
A: China formulated a three-stage strategy for modernization a
long time ago. To be more specific, in the first stage the 1980
GNP was to be doubled by 1990 and the people were to have adequate
food and clothing. This was achieved ahead of schedule in 1988. In
the second stage, the 1980 GNP was to be quadrupled from 1991 to
the end of the century and the people were to achieve a
comparative prosperity. The objective of quadrupling the GNP was
attained ahead of schedule in 1995. In the third stage, China is
to reach the per capita GNP level of moderately developed
countries by the middle of the next century. This will mean that
our people have begun to enjoy a relatively affluent life and that
modernization has been basically accomplished.
</P>
<P>
In determining the speed of development, we proceed from
reality, since the policies of reform and opening up were
introduced in China, the economy has seen sustained and rapid
increase. Since 1979, the Chinese economy has been growing by more
than 9 percent annually. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), we will exercise macro-economic control so that the
economy can increase by 8 percent annually. In the first decade of
the next century we will excise macro-economic control based on
the assumption that the economy will grow by about 7 percent
annually. While maintaining an appropriate economic growth rate,
we attach great importance to the quality of economic growth. We
stress the importance of using state macro-economic control to
avoid the bubble economies that some countries have experienced as
a result of a too rapid economic growth. On the other hand, the
Chinese economy is developing rapidly, but the economy as a whole
is not big and the average per capita GNP is still very low. It is
predicted that by the end of the century calculated at present
prices and exchange rates, China's average per capita GNP will be
about 800 US dollars, and it will only be about 1,500 US dollars
by the year 2010. So China will still be a developing country at
that time.

Q: At present, there are two views on foreign relations. One is
that as nations get closer and closer together economically, the
penalties of conflict and the benefits of cooperation are much
larger than before. The other is that great powers are in a state
of permanent rivalry, in which one works against the interests of
the others, what is your opinion?
</P>
<P>
A: The world is undergoing major and profound changes. As
science adn technology develop rapidly and as the world economy
becomes increasingly globalized and regionalized, nations are
getting closer and closer together and their economic
interdependence is becoming more and more obvious. In addition,
the global issues that cannot be resolved without close
coordination and cooperation between countries are becoming more
and more outstanding. Of course, competition between states is
normal, and conflicts or disputes are bound to arise. As long as
the concerned countries do not only consider their own interests
but also respect the interests of others and take into
consideration the common and long-term interests of all countries,
reasonable, fair and feasible solutions to conflicts and disputes
will be found through consultation on the basis of equality. We
believe that disagreements between countries should be resolved
through dialogue, not through confrontation. Different countries
may have different social systems, values, economic development
levels and historical and cultural traditions, but they all exist
on one and the same planet, so mankind has to stand together
through thick and thin. All countries can and should make
concerted efforts to deal with the challenges mankind faces in its
survival and development so as to create a better world.

Q: One scholar believes that the Cold War has been replaced by
a "clash of civilizations" and that, at the deepest level, the
West and China see the world differently and are in conflict. What
do you think of this thesis? Another view is that the overwhelming
dominance of the United States in global politics and culture is
creating a backlash of loss and resentment across the Third World,
and that more and more, Third World countries will say no to the
United States. Do you agree or disagree with this view?
</P>
<P>
A: Every country or nation has its own cultural traditions and
values, which came into being historically and exist
objectively. It is entirely normal that different countries see
the world differently. We maintain that differences in cultural
traditions, values, degrees of economic development, economic
models and ways of seeing the world should not lead to
disagreements and conflicts between countries. In handling state
to state relationships, we always advocate that the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should be followed. We should,
on the basis of these principles, seek common ground while
recognizing differences, strengthen cooperation and work together
for world peace, human progress and the development of
civilization. Any attempt to impose one's own will and values upon
others or to unify the world under a certain model for
"civilization" will definitely fail.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the cold war, the world trend toward
multi-polarization has been developing more and more rapidly. All
countries have become more aware of the need to be
independent. The call to establish new, reasonable and just
foreign relations on the basis of the principles of mutual respect
for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality,
mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence will become louder and
louder. More and more countries will oppose those nations that
practice hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
China is the biggest developing country in the world, and the
United States is the largest developed country, and they both are
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. They
shoulder important responsibilities in safeguarding world peace
adn stability. Maintaining and developing a sound Sino-US
relationship and strengthening our cooperation in international
affairs are in the interests of the two countries and the world as
a whole. Based on the fundamental interests of the two countries,
we hope to develop a long-term sound and stable relationship with
the United States in order to promote human cooperation and world
progress. We hope to work together with the United States in
creating a glorious 21st century of peace, stability and
prosperity. Recently, thanks to joint efforts of both countries,
Sino-US relations have improved and there is good momentum in this
improvement. Experience demonstrates that as long as the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are followed and the three
Sino-US Joint Communiques are strictly abided by, friendly and
cooperative relations between China and the United States will
continue to grow.

Q: Does Anglo-Saxon free-market capitalism have a future? Or,
is the mixed model of socialism seen in China or Cuba a better bet
for the poor of the planet?
</P>
<P>
A: World history in modern times and current economic
developments throughout the world show that no one economic system
is good for all countries. The best choice for a country is to
proceed from its unique conditions to create a system that is
conducive to the development of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the People's Republic was founded in 1949, we have been
trying to find a developmental path suited to our situation. After
several decades of working on this, China began its reform and
opening up in the late 1970s and blazed a developmental path
suited to its own conditions, that is, the path to a socialist
market economy. In 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping elaborated clearly
on "socialist market economy." he told the visiting American
scholar Frank B. Gibney and Canadian scholar Paul T. K. Lin that
it was definitely a mistake to maintain that market economies can
exist only in capitalist society or that there can only be
capitalist market economies. Market economies were in bloom in
feudal society, Deng added, so we can develop a market economy
under socialism. Later on, Deng often discussed this issue. In the
important talks he gave during his inspection tour in southern
China in 1992, Deng further stressed, "Planning versus regulation
by market forces is not the essential difference between socialism
and capitalism. A planned economy is not equivalent to socialism
because there is planning under capitalism too; a market economy
is not capitalism because there are markets under socialism too."
At the 14th National Congress of our Party held in the same year,
it was announced that the establishment of a socialist market
economy would be an objective in the economic restructuring. The
revised Constitution, adopted at the 1st session of the 8th
National People's Congress in 1993, stipulates that "the state
practices a socialist market economy." In developing a socialist
market economy by proceeding from the reality in China, we attach
importance to absorbing and learning from all the achievements of
civilization and from the advanced modes of management and
managerial expertise of all countries, which are based on the laws
of modern social production, including those of the developed
capitalist countries. Since China began its reform and opening up,
it has enjoyed economic prosperity and social progress and the
people's living standards have improved continuously. This
experience demonstrates that the socialist market economy is
suitable for conditions in China.

Q: Many in the West are concerned that the Chinese Government
will intervene too much in the affairs of Hong Kong after resuming
sovereignty over Hong Kong. Others say that China's takeover of
Hong Kong is a hubbub created by the media. What will Hong Kong
look like after the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
A: The concept of "one country, two systems" as a method for
reunifying the motherland, which accords with the special
conditions in China, was the great creation of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping. This method serves as the foundation for the settlement
of the Hong Kong question and other issues. In 1984 the Chinese
and the British governments signed a joint declaration on the
question of Hong Kong. In 1990 the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region was adopted at the 3rd Session of
the 7th National People's Congress. In the five years from the
drafting to the adoption of the Basic Law, extensive commentary
was solicited from the people of Hong Kong concerning this
law. Adhering to the concept of "one country, two systems," the
Basic Law clearly stipulates: The socialist system and policies
shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall
remain unchanged. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
shall exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive,
legislative and independent judicial power, including that of
final adjudication. After Hong Kong is reunified with the
motherland, we will implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration
and follow the Basic Law to the letter. The Central People's
Government will absolutely not interfere in affairs that fall into
the category of autonomy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region. After the year 2000 Hong Kong will continue to be
prosperous and stable and it will have a brighter future.

Q: How will China cope with the growth of population and the
strain on resources of its megacities (for example, getting water
from the south to the north)? In what ways can China stem global
warming that is increasing because China is generating energy
mainly by burning coal? How does China view its responsibility to
global environmental protection?
</P>
<P>
A: China faces great pressure from its population, and the
average amount of per capita resources in the country is still
low. We uphold the basic policy of practicing family planning and
attach great importance to appropriate development and utilization
of our resources. In this respect, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress has formulated a series of relevant
laws. The Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social
Development (1996-2000) and the Outline Long-Range Program to the
Year 2010, adopted at the Fourth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress in 1996, also has provisions on these issues. We
plan to construct some large projects to alleviate the strain on
resources of our big cities. One of these is a cross-river basin
project to divert water from the south to the north during the
first decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Generating energy by burning coal is not the only cause of
global warming. We are always trying to solve the environmental
problems caused by burning coal. We attach importance to
scientific research and to developing processes to liquefy and
gasify coal. We are making great efforts to build electric power
sations near coal-mines and at the same time we are paying great
attention to developing and using other clean resources.
</P>
<P>
It is China's basic policy to protect the environment, and the
country is conscientiously implementing a strategy of sustainable
development. In this respect, the National People's Congress and
its Standing Committee have formulated a series of laws such as
the Environmental Protection Law, the Marine Environmental
Protection Law, the Law on the Prevention and Control of Air
Pollution, the Law on the Prevention and Control of Water
Pollution, the Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental
pollution by Solid Wastes and the Law on the Prevention and
Control of Environmental Noise Pollution. These laws basically
constitute a legal system for environmental protection. In
addition, the Congress and its Standing Committee check and
supervise the enforcement of these laws form time to time. China
supports the industries that cause little or no pollution. Greater
efforts are being made to develop forests throughout the country
to protect the ecology and to control environmental pollution. For
example, we have planted large shelter forests such as the
Northeast, North and Northwest China Shelter Forest, and we have
closed a large number of factories responsible for serious
environmental pollution, including the over 1,000 small paper
mills which were shut down in the Huaihe River valley alone. China
is taking an active part in international environmental affairs;
it is promoting international cooperation in environmental
protection, conscientiously fulfilling its obligations concerning
international environmental protection and has done a lot of work
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
It is the common task of all mankind to protect the
environment. To this end, developed countries should help and
support developing countries by providing them with, among other
things, funds and technology.

Q: Is there a middle ground between Western style democracy and
"cultural revolution" democracy that you see emerging in
China? What are the key features of the socialist democracy and
legal system with Chinese characteristics?
</P>
<P>
A: The "cultural revolution was not democracy; it was turmoil
which brought great suffering to our country and people. An
important reson why the "cultural revolution" took place and
lasted 10 years is that we had not paid enough attention to
improving democracy and the legal system. It was because of the
lesson from this bitter experience that by the end of the 1970s,
our party decided to stress the need to develop socialist
democracy, improve the socialist legal system, incorporate
democracy into the legal system and laws, maintain the stability
and continuity of this system and these laws and make them very
authoritative. Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a systematic exposition
on this matter and his ideas on improving democracy and the legal
system are an important component of the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The core of socialist democracy is that the people are the
masters of the country. According to the Constitution of China,
all power in the country belongs to the people, and the people
exercise state power through the National People's Congress and
local people's congresses at various levels. In order to ensure
that the people have state power in their own hands and are the
real masters of the country, we must uphold and improve the
people's congress system. To this end, we must strengthen the work
of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee and
give full play to the role of local people's congresses at various
levels and the role of their standing committees. We must also
safeguard the rights of the deputies to the people's congresses in
accordance with the law. At the same time, at the grass-roots
levels, it is necessary to improve the people's organizations of
self-government so that the people can manage their own
affairs. Since China began its reform and opening up, we have
reformed the electoral system, appropriately expanded the powers
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and
given autonomy to both rural and urban residents. All this was
done for the purpose of expanding democracy.
</P>
<P>
In order to safeguard the people's democracy and ensure that
the entire society will progress in an orderly fashion, we have
attached great importance to improving the legal system in China's
reform and opening up. We have formulated a large number of laws
so that now we have laws to go by for the main aspects of social
life in China. At the same time, we have strengthened supervision
of the enforcement of laws and urged administrative and judicial
authorities to act in in strict accordance with the law to correct
illegal activities and improve law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
As China has a long history of feudal society and because of
other factors, it will be a long process for us to improve its
socialist democracy and the socialist legal system. We will
continue to proceed from the reality in China in making vigorous
efforts to improve the socialist democracy and the socialist legal
system with Chinese characteristic.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Ming Tombs Power Station to Be Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The installation of the last
generating unit of the capital's Ming Tombs Water Pumping and
Energy Storing Station will go into full operation in late June,
a local source said.
</P>
<P>
The power station, located at Beijing's well-known tourism
resort Ming Tombs, is the largest power project undertaken by the
municipal government ever since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The power station will have a total generating capacity of
800,000 kw and have four 200,000-kw pumping and energy-storing
generating units.
</P>
<P>
The project was launched in 1992. The first three generating
units went into operation in 1995 and 1996, respectively, which
generated a total of 520 million kwh, effectively easing the power
shortages in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, after the fourth generating unit goes
into operation in June, the power station will contribute a
combined electricity supply totaling 800,000 kw at the electricity
consumption peak.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Vows to Continue Operation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Military has said that
the cross-border military operation in pursuit of the rebels of
the outlawed PKK in northern Iraq would continue until Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) achieves a total control of the
region.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted senior military
sources, who declined to be named, as saying that the Turkish
troops were determined to go ahead with the fighting against the
PKK rebels despite international protests.
</P>
<P>
"The operation will continue until (KDP leader Mesud) Barzani
says 'enough' and the KDP has attained complete authority in
northern Iraq, " the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, had said that the military operation was
aimed at clearing the region of the PKK members, which the
Turkish government described as a major threat to the security of
its eastern and southeastern areas.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops, backed by tanks
and fighters, launched a massive cross-border military operation
on May 14 in a bid to wipe out the PKK militants in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military operation has drawn strong criticism from
the international community, which demands the withdrawal of the
Turkish troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking military official brushed out the protests from
Iran, Syria and Iraq, saying it was "the PKK terrorist
activities " that constituted a serious threat to Turkey's border
areas.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's warplanes today heavily bombed the PKK rebels trying
to retreat to Iraqi-Iranian border in the east and Iraqi-Syrian
border in west, according to the semi-official Anatolia News

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A special steel production line
with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons has gone into trial
operation in Anshan No.1 Steel Rolling Mill in northeast China's
Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The production line for producing the H-shaped steel, a key
project designated by the Ministry of the Metallurgical Industry,
will ease shortages of rolled steel products on the domestic
market, local source said.
</P>
<P>
H-shaped steel is widely used in the construction of high-rise
buildings, workshops and bridges and is in great demand on both
domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
The production line, with a total investment of 200 million
yuan, uses equipment imported from the United States and from
Germany, and mainly produces the 200 to 500-mm H-shaped steel.
</P>
<P>
When full operation begins, the line will earn 1.26 billion
yuan a year from sales.

<HEADLINE> PLO Wants African Pressure Exerted on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official has
called on African countries to exert pressure on Israel to
implement the peace accord it signed with Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"We greatly cherish the support we have received in our
struggle from the African people. This continuous stand of
solidarity of the OAU and the Palestinian people has been
fruitful," Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Political Department of
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), told reporters on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Farouk is here to attend the 66th meeting of the OAU Council
of Ministers which opens later today. The meeting precedes the
33rd summit of the Organization of African Unity scheduled for
June 2-4. The Palestinian issue, among other topics, is on the
summit's agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the summit will come out with a concrete resolution
to isolate Israel in the political arena as this will pose great
pressure on it and the United States to listen to the voice of
wisdom," Kadoumi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi blamed the United States for not taking a firm stand
against Israel. "This is simply a matter of arrogance of power.
You can't find any elements of justice but their interest only."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States failed to act as an unbiased broker
to promote peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people "will remain resistant for as long as
their land is occupied. We cannot dispense with resistance," the
PLO official said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the hardline policy of Israel's Likud-led
government, peace talks between Palestine and Israel have been in
an impasse.

<HEADLINE> India's Sugar Production Registers Sharp Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- India's sugar production is
expected to fall sharply from a record 16.5 million tons last year
to 13 million tons in the 1996-97 season (October-September), the
Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Indian Agriculture Minister Chaturanan
Mishra here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although this is likely to put a strain on government stocks
for the public distribution system and increase the food subsidy
bill, Mishra said the Indian government had stocks of 7 million
tons from the previous years, which would prevent an increase in
market prices of sugar.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that land had been diverted from sugarcane
production this year, and the reduced availability of land for
sugarcane this season brought down the production.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The deadliest tornadoes in a
decade ripped through central Texas from Waco to Austin on
Tuesday, killing at least 32 people and injuring scores.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 homes in the Double Creeks Estate in Jarrell, a
small Williamson county town about 40 miles north of Austin, were
leveled by one of several twisters that hit four counties at about
4 p.m local time, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty people were confirmed dead at a temporary morgue set up
at the volunteer fire department. Rescue workers planned to search
for survivors throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
The swath of destruction was about a mile long and 200 yards
wide, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Jarrell, a town of less than 1,000 people, was largely
destroyed by a tornado in 1989 which killed one, injured 28, and
severely damaged or destroyed 35 houses and 12 mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
In Austin, one person was killed when a tornado destroyed two
homes around Lake Travis, and a woman drowned in a creek during a
storm, city spokesman Carlos Cordova said.
</P>
<P>
Interstate 35, the main north-south freeway in Central Texas,
was closed in the Jarrell area.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Williamson County, strong wind blew off part of a
grocery store's roof in Cedar Park, causing the building to
collapse. At least eight people were hurt and one was missing in
the rubble, said county spokesman John Sneed.
</P>
<P>
A fast-food restaurant and a video store near the grocery were
badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
In Bell County, a tornado destroyed a marina and at least five
boats. Several houses were also reported destroyed, but no
injuries were reported.

<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong said today that Singaporeans must keep pace with technology
and urged the country's adults to learn how to use information
technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Public Service Exhibition, the
prime minister said that the message of the exhibition is that
Singaporeans must keep pace with technology and adapt to the
changes in order to stay ahead.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the younger generation is being equipped to handle
the new technology, Goh said however that it is not enough that
only children learn how to use the information technology. "Adults
have to use it as well", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The number one reason for this, as he said, is that the
children need guidance. "A responsible parent must seek to learn
about the world of the Internet," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The largely unregulated Internet is overflowing with
information for all kinds of purposes and audiences. Our children
need guidance in navigating the Internet. We must teach them to
choose and use information wisely," he explained.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, adults must set a good example of willing
to learn at whatever age. "We too must be learners if we want our
children to love learning", the prime minister urged.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Tamil rebels have
extorted money from fishermen whose boats were seized by them in
the east of the country when the fishermen earlier refused to pay
a monthly fee to rebel collectors.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources today, 40 boats with outboard
motors and fishing nets were seized last week by the rebels from
the fishermen who refused to pay the monthly money demanded.
</P>
<P>
The boats and equipment valued at 406,800 US dollars were
returned Tuesday after the fishermen finally paid the ransom.
</P>
<P>
The sources said there are about 300 fishing craft in Eastern
province whose residents belong mostly to the Muslim community.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen in the north and east of the country pay a monthly
fee to the collectors of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE). This is part of the resources for the LTTE rebels who have
been fighting a 14-year-old guerrilla war for a separate state in
the north and east of the island country.

<HEADLINE> Higher Joint Oil Production Expected in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's production of crude oil
in partnership with foreign companies will be up 80 percent this
year, said the state-owned petroleum company PDVSA.
</P>
<P>
Daily output under the "Operating Agreements" program will
increase from 62,000 barrels in 1996 to 117,000 barrels in 1997,
said a PDVSA news release published today by the press.
</P>
<P>
The program allows foreign companies to participate in the
public auctions of some of the country's oil fields and then sign
operating agreements with Lagoven, a PDVSA subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
While a third public auction of 20 oil fields is scheduled for
June 2, pumping operations authorized by previous agreements are
being carried out in eastern Venezuela and the Maracaibo Lake.
</P>
<P>
Kicked off in 1992, the program is designed to attract private
investment to help reactivate low-profit oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the fields sold to the highest bidder rose to
974 U.S. million dollars and this year's public sales is expected
to bring in another 830 million dollars, the PDVSA said.
</P>
<P>
According to the PDVSA's estimation, the oil deposits already
auctioned off have 571 million barrels of oil reserves and the
overall reserves in the area are over 8 billion barrels.

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Urged Not to Smoke on May 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
calling on the public not to smoke on May 31 to mark the world's
No Tobacco Day, a government official said.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997 asked all U.N. member
countries to take part in activities commemorating the No Tobacco
Day with the theme "Be United to Reach a Tobacco-Free World,"
Director General for Drug and Food Supervision at the Health
Ministry Wisnu Katim said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Katim, cigarettes' smokes contain toxic and
additive chemicals which could cause cancerous diseases besides
being detrimental to cerebral blood vessel and embryos.
</P>
<P>
"Still many cigarette vendors are found at public places, which
induce teenagers to buy cigarettes. Such a condition is feared to
hamper development of human quality, particularly that of the
Indonesian younger generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would issue regulations banning people
to smoke at public places and to sell cigarettes to children and
teenagers. Such regulations have been applied in other countries
including Singapore and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Violations against the prospective regulations would face
imprisonment for one year at the maximum or pay a maximum fine of
10 million rupiah (about 4,600 U.S. dollars), he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Works to Cut Reliance on Foreign Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is stepping up its
efforts to reduce its reliance on foreign workers by urging
developers to use more prefabricated parts in constructing
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering a regulation which would require
building designs to be construction-friendly, which means
architects may have to make sure that they use prefabricated parts
in their building if they want to get the designs off the drawing
board in the future, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
If the regulation comes about, developers would have to meet
standards in building design before they can get approval for
their building plans, it said.
</P>
<P>
Lim Hng Kiang, minister for national development, said on
Tuesday that the requirement is being considered as a way to get
more companies to opt for simple-to-build designs and wean the
industry from its reliance on foreign workers, whose number now
stands at some 350,000 in this city state with a population of
nearly 3 million.
</P>
<P>
"If the heavy dependence on foreign labor continues in the
construction sector, the government will have to consider making
minimum 'buildable' scores a requirement for building plan
approval," the minister was quoted as saying at a function of the
Construction Industry and Development Board.
</P>
<P>
A design with a high buildable score means that the building
can be put up speedily and uses such factory-made parts as beams
and staircases whose dimensions are standardized, thus reducing
the number of foreign workers needed at the construction sites.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Seek Car Talks With Japan, EU, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will continue to seek new
rounds of bilateral talks with Japan, the United States and the
European Union over its national car policy, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Tunky Ariwibowo said here last
night that Indonesia will seek to resume talks with the three
sides, but has no intention of offering compensation to any of the
parties protesting its car policy until the next meeting of the
World Trade Organization's (WTO) Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)
later next month.
</P>
<P>
The WTO body's next meeting will be held in Geneva on June 25.
</P>
<P>
At a DSB meeting on May 23, Indonesia blocked the EU request to
set up a dispute settlement panel to decide whether Indonesia's
national car project breached WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States and the EU have held a series of
bilateral talks with Indonesia after lodging a complaint with the
WTO last October in an attempt to get Jakarta to remove measures
which the trio claim are discriminatory and against multilateral
trade rules.
</P>
<P>
However, Tunky said the Indonesian government has prepared
everything needed to face complaints filed by both Japan and the
EU against its car policy.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, the Indonesian government announced a
preferential car policy which exempted producers of a national car
from import duty and luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
The tax breaks were granted solely to Pt. Timor Putra Nasional,
a company controlled by President Soeharto's youngest son.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Cut Lending Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Six major commercial banks in
Thailand have cut their minimum lending interest rates with effect
from today while others are expected to follow suit soon.
</P>
<P>
The minimum lending interest rate has been lowered by 0.25
percentage points, from 13 percent to 12.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at easing the cost of funds for local
businesses and help exports stay on target.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached during an "export summit" at the
weekend in Pattaya chaired by Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, the Thai Bankers' Association agreed to cut the
minimum lending interest rates over four months starting this
month by 0.25 percentage points each month, to bring down the
rates by a full percentage point by late August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chavalit and Finance Minister Amnuay
Viravan have thrown their support behind the Bank of Thailand
governor's stand of refusing to reduce the discount rate, now
standing at 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the discount rate was cut, it could make the Thai currency,
the baht, more vulnerable to further heavy attack by foreign
speculators.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said, "If monetary policy was loosened right now, it
would not be matched with fiscal discipline."
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Amnuay said the central bank governor,
Rerngchai Marakanond, is best qualified to control monetary
policy, dispelling rumors that Rerngchai would be dismissed
because of his stand of maintaining high interest rates to defend
the baht.

BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to the
motherland will give China's tourism industry a major boost,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Sun Gang, deputy
director of China National Tourism Administration (CNTA), as saying
that the July 1 return will provide an opportunity to foster
further co-operation between Hong Kong and the inland to develop
the country's tourism industry jointly.
</P>
<P>
"We will work together with our counterparts in Hong Kong to
arrange more sales promotions overseas and cooperate in many other
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both tourist departments are working together to publicize Hong
Kong and other Chinese cities as attractive tourist destinations
on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's tourism facilities and shopping environment have
been rated among the best in the world. Last year, the city
received a record 11 million visitors, earning revenues of more
than 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inland area's tourism industry is the ninth highest in the
world in terms of income earned from tourism, and the fifth most
popular destination.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been an important market for the inland
area. Nearly 35 million Hong Kong residents visited the inland
area in 1996, up 12.66 percent over 1995, and the number of inland
tourists to Hong Kong is growing rapidly.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government today
called on the UN Security Council to renew the mandate of its
observer mission in the disputed Prevlaka area which expires on
July 15.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic said in a letter to the
UN Security Council that the mandate of the UN observer mission in
Prevlaka must be extended to ensure regional security and
strengthen mutual trust until the two sides find a way to solve
the problem through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On January 14, the UN Security Council renewed the mandate of
the 28-member observer mission in the Prevlaka Peninsula for
another six months, until July 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Prevlaka Peninsula is in the Adriatic Sea and is a part of
Croatia. But it is located at the entrance to Boka Kotorska bay,
an important navy port of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of its ships, Yugoslavia managed to
negotiate an agreement with Croatia in 1992, declaring the
peninsula as a demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council sent military observers to help
implement the agreement in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Candidate Embroiled in Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A political row has erupted in
Costa Rica after one of the country's presidential candidate met a
Mexican tycoon who is being investigated by the U.S, for drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Rodriguez, the presidential candidate for the country's
biggest opposition party, the United Social Christian Party,
went to Mexico last week and spent two nights in a hacienda owned
by Hank Gonzalez, former Mexican agriculture minister and a
business tycoon.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department
for alleged involvement in drug trafficking, the Costa Rican press
has claimed.
</P>
<P>
His political opponents have demanded an explanation for the
visit and the issue has been front page news for days.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was accompanied by a delegation from his party which
was founded by former Costa Rican president Rafael Angel Calderon
who ruled the country between 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Critics say Calderon, who married the daughter of a prominent
Mexican politician, was the person who arranged the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Liberation Party had asked Rodriguez to
appear before the drug trafficking committee of the Legislative
Assembly while the Democratic Force, the third largest political
party in Costa Rica, asked for an explanation or resignation of
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the meeting was aimed at attracting important
Mexican entrepreneurs to invest in Costa Rica. He said he was
unaware that Gonzalez was suspected of being involved in drug
trafficking. But he admitted that his trip to Mexico was "a
mistake".

<HEADLINE> Girl Sufferer Donates to Help Other Sick Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A 15-year-old girl, who has
recovered from a rare bacteria disease, has become the first
donor to a fund to help children with rare illnesses, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xiaoxia, from Shandong Province, was stricken with a rare
bacteria that literally ate away her flesh. She was treated and
survived her horrific disease thanks to widespread support from
people across China.
</P>
<P>
Grateful for the help she had received, Yang yesterday donated
450,000 yuan (54,216 US dollars) to the new fund in the Soong
Ching Ling Foundation, which was set up to help child disease
victims.
</P>
<P>
Yang and her parents decided to pay back society by financial
supporting others tortured by hard-to-treat illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The money is the balance from donations she received that
helped pay for her to undergo intensive medical treatment in
Beijing two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Yang, whose mysterious ailment made national headlines,
received 870,000 yuan (104,000 US dollars) from public donations,
of which 420,000 yuan was spent to pay for various medical
treatments.
</P>
<P>
These include the cost of an operation to provide her with an
artificial right arm to replace the one she lost as a result of
her illness.
</P>
<P>
The new fund will pool donations from individuals and
institutions to cover medical treatments for children with rare
ailments, said Ma Lianyu, vice-chairman of the Soong Ching Ling
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
It will also award researchers who have made breakthroughs in
treating such diseases, she said.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will establish free trade
zones to boost key export-oriented industries, according to Thai
Industry Minister Korn Dabbaransi.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Profile of Indonesia's Contesting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's three political parties
will vie for 425 seats in the House of Representatives tomorrow in
the country's sixth general election since 1971 and the following
is a profile of the three political groups:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Development Party (PPP) is an Islam-oriented
group, set up in 1973 after the merger of four Islamic parties. At
the beginning, the new party bore the symbol of kaabah, the Muslim
shrine in Saudi Arabia. In 1987, however, the PPP replaced the
symbol with a five-point star.
</P>
<P>
Most of the party's constituents are ulema and students of
pesantren (Islamic boarding schools) in the rural areas, mainly in
Java.
</P>
<P>
One of the four former parties making up the PPP is Nahdlatul
Ulama (NU), which has some 30 million supporters and is the
country's largest Muslim organization. Struggles for positions
among leaders of the four factions led to the withdrawal of NU
members from the PPP in 1987, thus undermining the party's
position in that year's general election.
</P>
<P>
There is no official information on the size of the party's
membership.
</P>
<P>
The PPP is chaired by veteran politician Ismail Hasan Metareum,
who said the party's campaign theme would be justice,
democratization and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The party won 17 percent of the vote and 62 seats in the House
of Representatives in 1992 compared with 99 seats in 1977, the
first general election after the party merger.
</P>
<P>
-- The Golkar, set up by a group of military and civilian
leaders in 1966, has been the dominant socio-political force
during President Soeharto's 30-year administration. It claims a
membership of 36 million out of the country's 200 million
population.
</P>
<P>
Its chairman is Harmoko, the first civilian to hold the
position, and Harmoko is also minister of information in the
government.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Golkar, which has won each of the five
elections in the past, say they have set a target of 70.02 percent
of the 124.7 million voters in the coming election, compared with
68 percent in 1992 and 73 percent in 1987. The party enjoys full
backing from the military, government bureaucracy and leading

</P>
<P>
-- The Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) is an alliance of
several Christian and nationalist parties set up in 1973.
</P>
<P>
In its history, the PDI has been pockmarked by internal strife.
The latest, and quite probably the gravest, is the conflict
between the Megawati Soekarnoputri and Soerjadi camps, which
started last year when a breakaway extraordinary congress,
organized with strong support from the government, toppled
Megawati as the party's chairman and appointed Soerjadi in her
stead.
</P>
<P>
The electoral authorities have refused to accept Megawati's
list of legislative candidates for the election and she has thus
declared that she will not use her political right to vote on May
29.
</P>
<P>
The PDI, which won 15 percent of the vote in the 1992 general
election, claims a membership of 16 million. According to
Soerjadi, his party has the objective of promoting
democratization, social justice and nationalism.

MADRID, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 200,000 young Spaniards are
being sent abroad this summer as "ambassadors" of olive oil, one
of the country's major products.

The students will each take a bottle of Spanish olive oil as a

</P>
<P>
The initiative is aimed at forming solidarity among Spanish
olive oil producers. But the association has asked the Spanish
government and olive oil producers to contribute towards the cost
of the project, which has risen this year due to the increase in
registration fees for summer courses.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's border police
announced today the seizure of 195 kilograms of marijuana hidden
in a truck and a semi-trailer from Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The police, known as the National Gendarmeria, intercepted the
vehicles in operations on Monday in the capital of the provinces
of Chaco and Formosa, on the Paraguayan border.
</P>
<P>
The truck and semi-trailer were in a 12-vehicle convoy carrying
cement to a local importer. Once emptied, the vehicles would split
into two groups -- one back to Uruguay and the other to Chile.
</P>
<P>
An inspection by the National Gendarmeria revealed a total of
195 kilograms of marijuana hidden in the false bottom of one of
the trucks and in the spare tires of one of the semi-trailers.
</P>
<P>
The authorities estimated the street value of the illegal drug
at about 500,000 U.S. dollars.

ROME, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Police chiefs from European capitals
met in Rome today to discuss laws and issues involving regional
and international crime, such as drug trafficking and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also focus on violence in sports, terrorism,
trade in human beings and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Italian Interior Undersecretary Nicola Sinisi told the 19th
Conference of Police Chiefs that cooperation is essential for
fighting major crimes on borders which have threatened the
security in the European nations.
</P>
<P>
Rome Police Chief Rino Monaco said police were virtually
powerless in fighting loan sharking when victims of the crime
would not collaborate. It was a crime for which Rome held the
record in Italy.
</P>
<P>
New computer systems were the key to making cities like Rome,
which used to be crossroads for organized crime and illegal
immigration and a target for international terrorism, safer for
old people, students and children.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Expected to End Fleet Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's visit to Ukraine today is expected to bring an end
to disputes over the Black Sea Fleet division.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference before Chernomyrdin's visit, Ukraine's
Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko said Ukraine would lease part of
Sevastopol to Russia for 20 years, and this was expected to be
signed by Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukrainian and Russian experts had also completed
negotiations on three documents -- the status of the Russian fleet
in Ukrainian territory, the division parameters of the fleet and
financial issues of the division.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian prime minister also pointed out that signing
these documents would surely face opposition from both Ukraine and
Russia, but the documents would clear obstacles in developing
Ukrainian-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said in Moscow today that his Wednesday visit
would aim to sign the leasing agreement and so pave the way for
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Kiev scheduled for May
30. Yeltsin is expected to sign a long-delayed basic political
treaty with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president had insisted on dividing the fleet before
the two countries could sign the political treaty, while Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma wanted the treaty enacted before the fleet
division.
</P>
<P>
Because of failures in resolving disputes over the fleet,
Yeltsin twice delayed his promised visit to Ukraine in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Russia claimed the fleet after the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991, dampening relations between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Sees Fewer Births </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
reported 43.88 million fewer births than anticipated over the past
26 years, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The second most populated province after Henan, Shandong now
has one of the lowest birth rates and population growth rates in
the nation. By the end of 1996, the province's population stood at
87.38 million.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Provincial Family Planning
Commission, the birth rate in Shandong last year was 10.6 per
thousand and the national average stood at 16.98 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
During four successive years, the natural population growth
rate, calculated by comparing births with deaths, was kept below
four per thousand. The national average last year was 10.42 per
thousand.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government attributes the drop to standardized
and systematic family planning services, including publicity and
education on family planning along with the distribution of
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the province's "integrated programme" which
connects family planning services with an improved standard of
living for farmers and rural economic development have also played
a major role in changing farmers' attitudes toward reproduction,
said Zhang Chuanli, director of the Shandong Provincial Family
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 93 percent of the villages
had carried out family planning education programmes to
disseminate policy and knowledge. Some 91 percent of married women
have taken various contraceptive measures in accordance with their
own needs and physical conditions.
</P>
<P>
Provincial and local governments at all levels have started
33,000 household income-generating programmes for farmers with
economic difficulties who are willing to follow the state family
planning policy.

<HEADLINE> Social Action Urged to Fix Flaws That Trigger Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Legal experts have called for
social improvements to fix flaws that trigger crimes, the China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Tough enforcement is not enough to curb the increase in crime
in China, but must be combined with social improvements," the
daily quoted researchers as saying at a national criminology
seminar yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the China Crime Studies Society, a non-governmental
organization, agreed that crime prevention is not just about laws
aimed at deterrring wrong doers. At the heart of the problem there
must be social actions to fix the flaws that trigger crimes, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not only concerned with crimes, but also mistakes and
bad behavior which may be too minor to be called crime," said
Professor Kang Shuhua of Beijing University and chairman of the
society.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the society blame the crime tide in recent years
on factors that include an incomplete legal system and social
inadequacies of wrongdoers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is a fast transforming country. When the social system
and its mechanism are not complete, crimes are sure to rise. Many
other countries have had similar problems during periods of
transformation," Kang said.
</P>
<P>
"Tough anti-crime action is very important, but it is not a
permanent cure," Kang said.
</P>
<P>
The society praised the "comprehensive control of public order"
policy of the government, which mobilizes all social sectors,
including legal departments, administrative bodies, schools,
communities and families to work together.
</P>
<P>
Crime prevention requires tight macro-controls to eliminate
negative social factors such as corruption. It also requires the
cultivation of ideological values and the upgrading of education
and the moral level of the nation, they said.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old society is made up of nearly 2,000 scholars,
lawyers, procurators and judges.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Confidence Roars High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Consumer Confidence
climbed to a 28-year high in May, driven by high employment and
low inflation, according to the New York-based Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
The private research group said that the index hit 127.1 this
month, up almost 9 points from April's reading of 118.5.
</P>
<P>
The report also helped push high both the New York stock market
and the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Both components of the Index scored sharp gains. The Present
Situation Index jumped to 152.2, advancing nearly 11 points from
April's 141.6 figure. The Expectations Index, which has proven to
be a key measure of future business activity, reached 110.3, up
from 103.2.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index, calculated from a 1985 base of
100, is derived from responses to questions sent to 5,000
households nationwide by the Conference Board. The survey asks
people about such matters as job availability and home-buying
plans.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 33 percent of Americans say current business conditions
are "good," up from less than 32 percent in April. The percentage
of people who feel "jobs are plentiful" rose from 31 percent in
April to nearly 36 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are also confident about future economic growth.
Nearly 19 percent believe business conditions will improve over
the next six months, up from 16 percent last month. Nearly 18
percent see more jobs created, compared with 14.5 percent in
April.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the National Association of Realtors reported that
sales of previously owned homes fell 2.4 percent in April, the
second small monthly decline in a row.

Wijaya rallied from 10-0 down in the third game to overcome

Wijaya, who beat Jantti in the Swedish Open last year, said
motivation was one of the reasons that put him behind then.

"I was not in full motion in the second set and when it was
10-0 suddenly I waked up to speed up and attack more," he said.
</P>

Rasmussen of Denmark all won in straight sets.

China had an easy 2-0 victory over France's Sandra Dimbour as all
16 women's singles seeds, half of them Chinese, went through the
opening round without much glitch.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Ye needed only 17 minutes to win 11-4, 11-2 and her
world number two compatriot Gong Zhichao also scored a no-sweat
11-3, 11-0 victory over Julia Mann of England.

<P>
The other Chinese seeds, including Dai Yun, Yao Yan, Wang Chen,
Zhang Ning, and Zeng Yaqiong, also coasted into the second round

<P>
NEW YORK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Technology shares drove the New
York stock market to new highs today despite a weak bond market,
where long-term interest rates jumped to higher levels.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average added 37.50 points to
7,383.41, setting another record.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 435.93
million shares as against 415.50 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 2.68 to 849.71, and

The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.50 to
598.44.
</P>
<P>
IBM, meanwhile, was the Dow's biggest gainer.

Stocks started the day mostly lower as bond prices fell,
boosting the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond above the
unsettling 7 percent level.
</P>
<P>
The Dow also drew a boost from AT&AMP;T, which rose after the Wall
Street Journal reported that the telecommunications giant is
discussing a big merger with SBC Communications, a local-phone
player.
</P>
<P>
The market was not affected much by a report this morning
showing that consumer confidence skyrocketed to a 28-year high in

<HEADLINE> Canada Seizes Fourth US Vessel in Salmon War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A fourth U.S. fish boat was seized
by the Canadian Coast Guard today in the escalating Pacific salmon
war.
</P>
<P>
A Seattle-based boat was arrested off northern Vancouver Island
and was being escorted to Port Hardy, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the seizure, the U.S. State Department said it had
postponed the Pacific Salmon Treaty talks with Canada that were
scheduled to resume Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are being delayed "until a more favorable climate for
discussions can be achieved," State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Canada has already seized three U.S. vessels in the last two
days as they were passing through Canadian waters.
</P>
<P>
The actions were taken when the U.S. fish boats failed to
comply with Canadian regulations requiring them to hail in and
stow their gear, according to Canada's Fisheries and Oceans
Department.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Canada allowed U.S. fishing vessels to travel
freely between Washington and Alaska states, while requiring ships
from all other countries to report to its coast guard.
</P>
<P>
The law was amended last year so that U.S. vessels had to
report as well.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Canada stepped up enforcement of measures, following
the collapse of talks with the U.S. on a new Pacific salmon
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the three U.S. boats was fined 300 Canadian dollars
(219 US dollars) each in the Port Hardy provincial court, the
reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The next Croatian presidency will be
competed among three candidates, according to a statement of the
Croatian Electoral Commission today.
</P>
<P>
The three presidential candidates are incumbent President
Franjo Tudjman, whose Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) also holds
the majority in parliament, Zdravko Tomac of the Social Democratic
Party and Vlado Gotovac of a nine-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
All three have gathered the minimum 10,000 signatures required
for being a presidential candidate, with Tudjman topping the list
with 120,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
As an every five-year event, the Croatian presidential
elections are scheduled for June 15, and the campaign will start
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ivic Pasalic, vice president of the HDZ, has predicted that the
popular president will be re-elected in the first round of the
contest with 57 to 62 percent of the votes, while Tomac has
declared his goal of at least entering the second round.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy helicopter ship
Kearsarge is moving toward Sierra Leone, ready for evacuation of
Americans from the country, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told a briefing that the situation
in Sierra Leone was calm after a weekend military coup, but the
Kearsarge would be offshore within 24 to 48 hours and "ready to
conduct contingency operations if necessary."
</P>
<P>
"It is planning to stop probably 20 or so miles off the shore
and wait and see what happens," Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Kearsarge left Atlantic waters off Zaire,
where it had been on stand-by for a possible evacuation from
Kinshasa, and would stop off Sierra Leone on its way to its
regular station in the Mediterranean, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein to Reopen Talks With British Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), is to reopen talks with British
officials Wednesday to put new life into Northern Ireland's peace
process, said local reports today.
</P>
<P>
After British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the lift of a
ban on the official contact in mid-May, British officials and Sinn
Fein leaders met in Belfast last Wednesday, the first such meeting
over the past 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said the meeting of last week was constructive, but
it was too early to judge whether they had improved prospects for
an early IRA cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The IRA quit a 17-month cease-fire in February last year and
resumed its military campaign to achieve the aim of ending British
rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's talks will be held on the eve of a Dublin meeting
between Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and Irish
Foreign Minister Dick Spring.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British and Irish officials hope that the peace
negotiations, to be resumed on June 3 in Belfast, will rekindle
the peace drive. The talks, adjourned in March, have been riven
with inter-party wrangling.
</P>
<P>
So far, Sinn Fein has been barred from the peace negotiation on
Northern Ireland. Irish Republicans say the IRA will not call a
fresh truce until Britain guarantees that Sinn Fein will get a
seat at the talks.

UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
today "strongly deplored" the attempt to overthrow the
democratically elected government in Sierra Leone and called for
an immediate restoration of constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement on the situation in Sierra Leone,
the council was "deeply concerned" about the the military coup
d'etat Sunday in Sierra Leone, especially when the United Nations
was assisting the process of reconciliation in that country.
</P>
<P>
Noting a communique of the Organization of African Unity, the
council underlined the imperative necessity of implementing the
Abidjan Agreement which continued to serve as a viable framework
for peace, stability and reconciliation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council strongly condemns the violence which has
been inflicted on both local and expatriate communities, in
particular United Nations and other international personnel
serving in the country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council recalled the obligations of all concerned to ensure
the protection of United Nations and other international personnel
in the country, and called for an end to the looting of premises
and equipment belonging to the United Nations and international
aid agencies.

<HEADLINE> US Policy Toward Iran Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. policy toward Iran
remained unchanged despite the change of president after Friday's
election in the country, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is in Iran's court regarding any future contact with
the United States government," State Department spokesman John
Dinger said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington would engage in a dialogue with Tehran's new
leaders only if they changed their "behavior."
</P>
<P>
Iran's President-elect Mohammad Khatami, who won a landslide
victory in the election, said Washington was "the source of the
strained ties between Iran and the United States."
</P>
<P>
"Any change in relations with the United States is dependent on
change in American policy toward Iran," Khatami said at his first
news conference since Friday's victory.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we don't see any sign of such a change in U.S.
policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday that the
United States would take a wait-and-see approach to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
She said everything depended on how the new Iranian government
dealt with some key issues concerning the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The United States has tried to isolate Iran in economy since
the 1979 Islamic revolution, but failed in many respects as many
Western countries did not agree with the U.S. "behavior."

<HEADLINE> Croatia, Yugoslavia Sign Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Croatia and Yugoslavia
today signed two agreements aimed at further improving relations
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
After their talks here, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic
and his Yugoslav counterpart, Milan Milutinovic, signed a Consular
Convention which will facilitate diplomatic communications between
the two states and visa permission for their citizens.
</P>
<P>
A treaty on mutual legal assistance was also signed during
Milutinovic's one-day visit to Zagreb, during which he and Granic
met for the third time since the two countries established
diplomatic ties in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two nations are expected to sign treaties next month on
border crossing, interior affairs and restoration of full road and
railway traffic, which are already under intense discussion at the
expert level, the foreign ministers told reporters after their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting this morning, Granic and Milutinovic discussed
the issues of bilateral concern, such as integration of Eastern
Slavonia into Croatia, the repatriation of refugees, economic
cooperation and protection of minorities in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said that the primary interest of Yugoslavia was to
facilitate the return of Serb refugees from Yugoslavia back to
Croatia and to ensure easier communications in all fields between
citizens of the two countries so that they could exercise their
civil, human and property rights.
</P>
<P>
Granic reiterated Croatia's stand that the right of refugees to
return was not in question, but it had to be agreed upon and
organized since "the return of refugees is legal, but also a
political, economic and security issue."
</P>
<P>
Granic stressed that the agreement on normalizing relations
between the two countries had considerably contributed to the
stability in the region and to the common interests of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers are scheduled to meet in Belgrade for
further talks when a number of bilateral agreements are ready for
signing.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Calls for Restoration of Legitimate Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's ousted
president asked West African states to help restore his
democratically elected government, which was overthrown by a coup
last weekend, Ambassador James Jonah announced here today.
</P>
<P>
President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah had made an appeal to West African
countries to help restore democracy, he said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He was also authorized to ask for sanctions against the coup
leaders, including non-recognition of the regime and a travel ban
on the organizers of the revolt, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there had been a firm commitment from the West
African group of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) to restore the legitimate government of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
But Jonah said that he was not going to the UN Security Council
to ask for sanctions or endorsement of any intervention as African
nations had a right to intervene.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council is holding a meeting to discuss the
situation in Sierra Leone today.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan also issued a statement
condemning the coup soon after it took place in Sierra Leone.
