<P>
BANGKOK, December 10 (Xinhua) -- China pulled further away in
the Asian Games medal tally as its gymnasts and sharpshooters
snatched 15 gold medals on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China topped the medal standings with 50 golds, 35 silvers, 23
bronzes after hauling in 25 golds on the fifth day of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained second with a 21-23-28 record with South Korea
third with 19-10-7.
</P>
<P>
Host Thailand overtook Kazakhstan in the medal standings,
placing fourth with a 7-10-17 collection.
</P>
<P>
With its unmatchable depth, China swept eight golds from 10
gymnastic finals, boosting its total golds to 10.
</P>
<P>
Kui Yuanyuan, Bi Wenjing, Liu Xuan and Xu Jing triumphed in the
women's vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercises
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wei, Zhang Jingjing and Li Xiaopeng won the men's floor
exercises, horizontal bars and parallel bars respectively, whereas
their teammate Xing Aowei shared the top honor in the pommel horse
with Pae Kil-Su from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
China only let go two gymnastics golds as Thailand's Amornthep
Unchai took the rings event and South Korean Yeo Hong-Chul walked
with the men's vault title.
</P>
<P>
Despite the eight-gold harvest, a top Chinese gymnastics
official said China's advantage in the sport was on the ebb.
</P>
<P>
"The rest of Asia is catching up rapidly," said Zhang Jian,
chairman of the Chinese Gymnastics Administration Center. "China,
South Korea, Japan and Kazakhstan all have abilities to win gold
medal in the 2000 Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shooters, who just managed four gold medals in the
first three days, came out of lethargy as they nailed seven gold

route to taking the women's 63kg class title, while Olympic
champion Zhan Xugang landed the men's 75kg division gold.

clean-sweep of the Asian Games diving golds and silvers on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yilin and Yu Zhuocheng finished 1-2 in the men's 3m
springboard, as Cai Yuyan and Li Na swept the top two postitions
in the women's platform.
</P>
<P>
On the final day of the judo competition, China took two golds
through Tang Ling and Yuan Hua, increasing their total to three,
the same as South Korea and two less than Japan.
</P>
<P>
China pulled even with Japan in the swimming pool on Thursday
as they won two golds apiece with the other event going to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Wang Haibin grabbed the men's foil fencing title while

<HEADLINE> Russia Test-launches Missile With Multiple Warheads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Strategic Missile
Force on Thursday made a successful test and combat launch of an
RS-22 intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads
from a railway missile system.
</P>
<P>
All the 10 warheads fired from Plesetsk cosmodrome in north
Russia "hit targets at the Kamchatka test site with high
precision," Interfax reported. Kamchatka is located in Russia's
Far East.
</P>
<P>
The launch completed this year's program of extending the
service life of the missiles and checking the possibility of
keeping them on combat duty, the Strategic Missile Force's press
service said.
</P>
<P>
"The reliability and nuclear safety of the strategic missile
systems remain at due level," it said.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the strategic missile force successfully
test-launched a new Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile
from the same launching center, completing "a key stage in
developing the missile complex of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the new Topol-M missile system and the
extension of the service life of strategic missiles on duty meet
the aims and purposes of army reform, fully conform with the
government's policy for strategic armaments and reliably guarantee
the security of Russia," Force Commander-in-Chief Vladimir
Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is counting on the Topol-M missile to equip its
strategic missile force for the next century as most of its
ballistic missiles currently in service have outlived their
service life.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Perminov, chief of the strategic missile force's
general staff, said late November that 58 percent of the missiles
have outlived their service life.
</P>
<P>
"The service life of almost 70 percent of space probes, 90
percent of ground services and one third of launch systems is also
over," Perminov said.
</P>
<P>
The first regiment equipped with 10 new Topol-M missiles in
Tatishchevo will come on duty this year.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who oversees the
country's military industry complex, said last Friday the
strategic missile force would acquire 10 more Topol-M missiles
next year. By the year 2000, Russia plans to have 40 Topol-M
missiles in service.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Asks U.N. to Stop Israeli Mock Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Thursday resorted to
the United Nations to seek its help to stop Israeli escalating
mock air raids on some major Lebanese cities.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Lebanese Prime Minister-Designate Salim Hoss asked him to
intervene in the Israeli violent act against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
No further details are available.
</P>
<P>
The resounding sonic booms caused by Israeli fighter-bombers,
which flew low over Beirut and some southern cities for the second
day Thursday, continued panicking local residents.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese southern target cities are Sidon, Tyre and Iqlim
Toufah area.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli warplane swooped low over Beirut at 10:00 a.m.
(0800GMT) and broke the sound barrier, rattling windows and
setting off car alarms all over the city.
</P>
<P>
Cars ground to a halt and residents scurried for shelter in
shops and apartment buildings for fear that the city was really
under Israeli attack.
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents still remembered the 1996 Israeli air and
artillery blitz against the country.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1996, Israel launched attacks, codenamed the "Grapes
of Wrath," on Beirut and some southern villages, during which
nearly 200 people, most civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in three and a half years that Israeli
warplanes have broken the sound barrier at such a low-level flight
over the capital.
</P>
<P>
There was no apparent fuse for the mock raids, especially as
south Lebanon is enjoying a period of relative calm after tense
November, when seven Israeli soldiers were killed by Lebanese
guerrillas' attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been
spearheading a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation
troops. South Lebanon is a flashpoint of clashes between the two
sides.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Demands Spending Reform in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder warned Thursday there could be no east European
enlargement of the European Union (EU) without the reform of
costly farm and structural aid spending under the so-called Agenda
2000.
</P>
<P>
Setting out his goals for the EU's Vienna summit which opens
Friday, Schroeder said that for the EU, "it must be clear --
agreement on Agenda 2000 is a precondition" for having new members.
</P>
<P>
"Without this reform, taking in new member states is not
imaginable," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said reforming agricultural subsidies and
infrastructure spending, which devour most of the EU's annual
98-billion-U.S.-dollar budget, would be the toughest task faced by
Bonn while Germany held the bloc's rotating presidency in the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"If this does not succeed then (enlargement) will be harder to
achieve, if it can be achieved at all," he said, adding that no
date for possible membership of the applicant states could
currently be set.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also demanded a cut in Germany's EU bill, saying
Germany's net annual contribution to EU amounts to 13 billion
dollars, much higher than 2.67 billion dollars paid by Holland,
the next biggest net contributor.
</P>
<P>
Slashing and reforming farm spending remained a priority, he
said, adding that Bonn believed member states should begin to pay
the bill for their own farmers instead of taking money from
Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Canada's New Housing Prices Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new housing price
index was 1.0 percent higher in October compared with the same
period a year earlier, Statistics Canada said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The index, which quotes contractors selling prices for new
houses, rose 0.1 percent between January and August of this year,
the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In October, the largest monthly increases were noted in the
cities of Charlottetown and London, where they were up 1.0 percent
and 0.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, these increases were almost completely offset by a
monthly decrease of 0.6 percent in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
There were no other decreases in 10 of the 21 cities surveyed
in October, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
On a year-to-year basis, the largest increase was recorded in
the active Calgary market, where prices were 7.2 percent higher
than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The largest annual decrease was noted in Victoria (-6.5
percent) and Vancouver (-5.1 percent) where market conditions
remain very competitive, the agency said.

shuttlers, both suffered setback in the semi-finals four years ago
at Hiroshima, waltzed into the finals of the current Asian Games
badminton tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Something have taken place in the past fours years, we are
looking forword to pocket at least three golds in this Games,"said
Chinese head coach Li Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
At the Hiroshima Asian Games, the Chinese were humilated to go

Asked what percentage of their winning chances, the former
two-time world doubles champion said:"In the women's competitions
we are sixty but in the men's it is fouty-five to fifty-five.''

with little problems. They will meet defending champions South
Korea in Friday's finals.

World number two Sun Jun of China combined long drives with
drop shots, keeping Hwang Sun-Ho of South Korea running to and
fro. Hwang got only six points before losing the first set 6-15.
But in the second set, the Chinese shuttler had to fight harder to
finish the match 15-10.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei, ranked 4th in the world, followed up
with a tough win over All-England champions Lee Dong-Soo and Yoo
Yong-Sung 15-6, 11-15 and 15-13 in 56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The following match between China's Luo Yigang and Ahn
Jae-Chang of South Korea was even fierce. Luo came from behind in
both sets to outclass the South Korean 15-9 and 15-11 in 51
minutes, caputring the winning point for the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese second doubles pair Liu Yong and Yu Jinhao fought
hard but lost to South Korean combination Ha Tae-Kwon and Kang
Kyung-Jin 15-8, 8-15 and 15-12.
</P>
<P>
The Up-and-down player Dong Jiong from China, now ranked eighth
in the world, did not concentrate his efforts on the last match,
losing to former world runner-up Park Sung-Woo 15-7 and 15-4.
</P>
<P>
World champions Indonesia met little difficulties by trouncing
the Malaysians 4-1.
</P>
<P>
In the women's competitions, the Chinese tought a badminton
lesson to the Japanese girls by blanking them 5-0 while the
Indonesians were bitterly defeated by the South Koreans 4-1.

<HEADLINE> Zyuganov: Russia's Missile Deal With Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov stressed here Thursday that Russia's
contract with Cyprus for the latter's purchase of the Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles must be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Zyuganov, who arrived here
Wednesday for a first ever two-day visit, said that Russia would
withstand the pressure exerted by the U.S. in order for the
contract to be executed.
</P>
<P>
He added that Cyprus had the right to choose the weapons
systems to strenghthen its defense and the S-300 missiles posed no
threat to any third country.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to bolster its defenses, Cyprus had decided
earlier last year to buy the Russian missiles, but Nicosia's
decision has been criticized by the U.S. and some European
countries because they believe that the installation of the
missiles will increase the tension on the divided island republic.
Turkey has also threatened to use force to prevent the deployment
of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his disappointment over Russia's loss of all
the major weapons markets in the world, the communist leader
pointed out that if only one major arms seller was allowed to
dominate the world market, the prices of weapons would be too high
for many countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Peshawar-based U.S. Consul
General Brad Hanson Thursday stressed the need for investigations
into the reported massacre of innocent people by Afghan warring
factions in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Hanson said that there were reports that many Taliban prisoners
were killed by the forces loyal to the anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance in May 1997 and reports on genocide of civilians by the
Taliban in Mazar-e-Sharif in September this year when the militia
attacked the northern Afghan city.
</P>
<P>
Hanson made these remarks at a function in Peshawar, capital of
North West Frontier Province, to mark the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
He said all these incidents deserve thorough investigations by
the international community to deter the recurrence of such
happenings in Afghanistan or any other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a seminar held in Peshawar in connection with the
observance of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, the National Commission of Human Rights of
Afghanistan urged the Afghan warring factions to respect human
rights in the war-battered country.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the seminar asked the Afghan intellectuals to
launch awareness campaigns among the displaced Afghan people
across the world to educate them on their rights and duties.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the Afghan warring groups to keep in view the
respect of human rights in treating prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
The speakers, while asking the international community to make
consolidated efforts for protecting human rights in Afghanistan,
also stressed the need for identifying the areas where human
rights violations take place.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Get Big Donations in Next Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will get a total of
2.2 billion U.S. Dollars in the next three years to support its
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in the final statement of the Donors'
Conference which ended here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
James Adams, the World Bank Country Director for Uganda, told
a press conference after the meeting that delegates from more
than 40 donor countries and agencies agreed to offer the money
because they have been convinced by Uganda's achievements.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's economy has maintained an average growth rate of more
than five percent in the past decade, the highest on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Of the donation, about 850 million Dollars will be
quick-disbursing budget support. These amounts, together with
disbursements from existing commitments, are expected to meet
Uganda's financing requirements over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the World Bank will roughly provide 25 percent of
the total amount and most of the money will be used in physical
infrastructure development, such as road and bridge construction,
social infrastructure like health, education as well as
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's expenditure accounts for 18 percent of the country's
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but its revenue can only account
for 12 percent of the GDP. The balance will mostly come from
donors.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Gerald Ssenduala thanked the donor community
for their support and pledged more transparency in the use of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, his country will expand tax base to
increase revenue so that Uganda will not depend so heavily on
donors' money.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes to See All Human Beings Enjoy Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday voiced his hope to see that "all human
beings enjoy their human rights."
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is simple: to make every day matter in the fight
to broaden the horizons of human rights until that day when no man
is tortured, no woman is abused and no child is denied his dignity
-- when all human beings enjoy their human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the statement in his speech to a plenary
meeting of the 53rd General Assembly session, held here in
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. The meeting is part of the gala event at the U.N.
headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
"Human Rights Day 1998 is a day for all of us who enjoy human
rights to imagine life without them -- and to think how hard we
would fight to retain them," he said, "It is a day for those who
are still denied their human rights to dream again of asserting
them, and to know that their dream is our dream -- the dream of
all human rights for all."
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is a day for us to recall not only the rights
attained over 50 years, but also the rights denied; to pursue
the achievement of justice by all and for all; to defend against
the abuse of human rights with greater vigilance than ever, and
to pursue the violators of human rights with greater persistence
than ever."
</P>
<P>
"It is the day to renew our commitment to globalizing justice
in the age of globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To the United Nations, this anniversary is more than a
milestone. It is a mirror that reflects how far we have come and
how long we have yet to go," he said.
</P>
<P>
December 10 is the World Human Rights Day. The date this year
coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Adopted in the aftermath of the World War II, the U.N. document
is intended to prevent a repetition of the horrors of the
Holocaust and other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the pronouncement that "all human being are born
free and equal in dignity and rights," the declaration set out to
cover the range of human existence.
</P>
<P>
Having been translated into more than 200 languages, the
declaration has become the most quoted international document on
human rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Poor progress had been
made on economic and social rights in the past decade, Mary
Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of the General Assembly to
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, Mary Robinson said the actual situation in the
right to development was far from being encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said twenty percent of the world's population own
in excess of eighty percent of the wealth and consume eighty
percent of the world's resources.
</P>
<P>
The High Commissioner said it is shameful that people in
industrialized countries should enjoy such high levels of
prosperity while over a billion people are denied the most basic
needs -- adequate food and shelter, clean water, education and
health care.
</P>
<P>
"It is not sufficient that we give assistance when disasters
strike poorer countries. Generous though such gestures may be,
they do not get to the root of the problem. What is needed above
all is recognizing the systemic disadvantages that so many people
are burdened with, how far they are removed from the ideal
proclaimed in the Declaration that they should be free and equal
in dignity and rights," she added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Two Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A Kosmos-3M rocket carrying two
satellites, one Russian and one Swedish, was launched Thursday
from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Nadezhda satellite will become part of the
Russian-U.S. KOSPAS/SARSAT network, designed to locate ships and
planes in distress and send instant SOS messages to rescue
centers, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish micro-satellite, Astrid-2, weighs only 35 kilograms
and scientific equipment accounts for one third of the weight.
</P>
<P>
Astrid-2 is used for measuring electric and magnetic fields in
the atmosphere, and registering the density of electrons. The
satellite may also be used to film polar lights in ultraviolet
rays and measure the absorption of ultraviolet rays in the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The Nadezhda Russian satellite, weighing 870 kilograms, has a
two-year service life.
</P>
<P>
It will take no longer than two hours to pass a message from an
emergency buoy to a data collection center on land.
</P>
<P>
The KOSPAS/SARSAT project was inaugurated on November 23, 1979,
when the Soviet Union, the United States, France and Canada signed
the Hamburg memorandum to develop a network. More than 7,000
people have been rescued in the years since with the help of
Russia's Nadezhda and the United States' NOAA satellites, Interfax
said.

<HEADLINE> Donors Demand Full Accountability of Fund in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Donors who have announced a
plan to commit some 2.2 billion U.S. Dollars to Uganda in the
next three years asked for full accountability of their money to
be donated.
</P>
<P>
They made this request at the Consultative Group Conference
Thursday here in response to reports of rampant corruption among
government officials and of big increase in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
"Donors expressed their support for the Poverty Action fund
while stressing the need for accountability at all levels. In
both health and education, the government presented sector
investment strategies for potential funding," said a final
statement of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"However, donors expressed particular concern about the level
of defense expenditures. While recognizing the regional and
internal security issues that confront Uganda, they saw a risk
that pressures for higher defense spending could undermine
Uganda's record of macro-economic stability or divert government
resources from priority expenditures," the three-page document
said.
</P>
<P>
Bernand Ryelandt, a European Commission representative, said
that President Yoweri Museveni has pledged that the increase of
defense spending will affect the spendings in priority areas.
</P>
<P>
Although Uganda is developing at a rare rate in the region,
one third of its expenditure budget is provided by the donors. In
1998, donors provided the east African country with 850 million
U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pak PM's Visit to U.S. Ends With No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has returned home from an official visit to the U.S.
to the criticism from the opposition and the media for "failing"
to achieve any breakthrough on nuclear and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharif said, "I feel that as a result of my visit and
my comprehensive talks with President Clinton, a new basis has
been laid for our bilateral relations, one which is free of
friction and pressures that was quite dominant in the past."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the local media late Wednesday night
that from his high profile visit "an honorable settlement for the
decade-old issue of F-16 planes is close at hand."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan paid 658 million U.S. dollars for 26 F-16 fighter
planes which were never delivered to this nation in the wake of
U.S. punitive sanctions for Islamabad's alleged nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of nuclear non-proliferation, which figured atop
on the agenda of the talks between Sharif and Clinton, the prime
minister reiterated that "Pakistan can't sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) under coercion."
</P>
<P>
Sharif had gone to the U.S. seeking the U.S. assistance to
alleviate Pakistan's economic difficulties, triggered by the
sanctions imposed after its nuclear tests in May this year.
Washington formally lifted part of the sanctions on the eve of
Sharif's arrival in the U.S. on December 1.
</P>
<P>
Clinton supported Pakistan's decision to adhere to the CTBT by
September 1999 but reiterated that more progress needed to be made
on these issues before Washington lifts the remaining sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Press reports suggested that the U.S. wants Pakistan to freeze
production of fissile material, which forms the core of a nuclear
weapon, pending conclusion of Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty.
</P>
<P>
This step, according to local analysts, will be a big strategic
disadvantage for Pakistan in view of India's superiority in this
field.
</P>
<P>
Arif Nizami, a senior columnist, said that any unilateral
moratorium on fissile material production by Pakistan will rob it
of its nuclear deterrence vis-a-vis India.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Washington, Sharif said that Islamabad would
not sign CTBT until its long-running dispute with New Delhi over
the Kashmir issue was settled.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told Sharif that he was ready to play his part for
settling the dispute, which caused two of the three wars between
the two South Asian nations, provided India also agrees to it.
</P>
<P>
India so far vehemently rejects third-party mediation on the
Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The issue of extradition of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,
who has taken refuge in Afghanistan, was another major issue that
came up for discussion in the talks between Clinton and Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Sharif declined to give direct response to the volley of
questions by the reporters on his return from Washington on the
Osama issue, only saying "we will continue to fight out terrorism
and will cooperate with other countries in this connection as
well."

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Lawyers Want to Set Aside Lords' Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- An official in the judicial
office of Britain's Highest Court said on Thursday that Lawyers
for former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet have asked the Law
Lords to set aside one of its decisions.
</P>
<P>
"We have received a petition that the judgement be set aside,"
the female official said, referring to the decision the Law Lords
made two weeks ago that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
She said the petition would be discussed by a committee of the
law lords which would decide whether to have a full appeal
hearing.
</P>
<P>
No decision of the Law Lords, Britain's Highest Court, has ever
been set aside before, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet' lawyers have accused that the Law Lords' ruling on
Pinochet on November 25 should be reconsidered because Lord
Hoffmann, who cast the deciding vote in a 3:2 voting, had been a
director of Amnesty International Charity for several years and
his wife is an administrative assistant in the human rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was house arrested on October 16 on a Spanish warrant.
A Spanish accused that he is responsible to the deaths and
disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule in Chile,
which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, British Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Jack
Straw ruled that the extradition process against 83-year-old
Pinochet could go ahead in British courts.
Pinochet is required to attend a court hearing on Friday.

<HEADLINE> SADC Faces Cereal Deficit of 300,000 Tons in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa faces a cereal
deficit of 300,000 tons in the 1998/99 season, the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) Regional Early Warning Unit
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest food security monthly update released in
Zimbabwe's capital, the regional body, basing on the final crop
estimates by member states, said the cereal deficit had been
revised downward from the 510,000 tons assessed earlier.
</P>
<P>
Maize surpluses totalling 1.29 million tons were assessed for
Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi reflected a surplus in rice.
</P>
<P>
Deficits in wheat, millet and sorghum were noted in most of
the countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
On the progress made with cereal import and export programs,
the monthly report said 42 percent of planned regional imports of
823,000 tons had arrived by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
On climate for the period from January to March 1999, the unit
predicts that normal to above-normal rainfall is expected in most
of the subcontinent including Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho and
Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> Russian Cabinet Approves Draft Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government on
Thursday approved a draft budget for 1999 that provides for an
impressive reduction of the tax burden on companies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the draft would be sent to
the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, either Friday or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The next year may prove to be a prelude for a rise in
production," Primakov said. "I am not sure of a rise but
conditions for it must be created."
</P>
<P>
Overall revenues are projected at 11.85 percent of GDP and
spending is planned at 14.4 percent of GDP, Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov told a news conference after the cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
The deficit is targeted at 101.5 billion rubles (about 5.08
billion U.S. dollars), or about 2.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The budget projects a primary surplus before debt servicing
costs of about 70 billion rubles (3.5 billion dollars), or 1.64
percent of GDP. It sets aside 9.5 billion dollars for servicing
the country's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Privatization revenues are expected to total 15 billion rubles
(750 million dollars), Zadornov said.
</P>
<P>
The budget also sets aside 27 billion rubles (1.35 million
dollars) for pay increases. The money allowances of army officers
will jump 60 percent on January 1 and on April 1 the salaries of
civilian government employees will rise by 50 percent, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov said the 1999 is based on predictions of 30 percent
inflation next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, military spending
planned for 1999 accounts for 3.1 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin complained that the police
allocation of 11.4 billion rubles (570 million dollars) in the
budget is not enough, but "this level will enable the ministry to
carry out its functions."

<HEADLINE> National Congress of Angolan Ruling Party Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The fourth national congress
of Angola's ruling People's Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA)
concluded Thursday to coincide with the 42nd anniversary of the
founding of the party.
</P>
<P>
A new central committee of the MPLA was formed during the
meeting, with its members increased from 179 to 251.
</P>
<P>
However, it is well noted that some well-known leaders of the
party and government have been excluded from the new committee.
They include Prime Minister Franca Van-Dunem, MPLA General
Secretary Lopo do Nascimento and former prime minister Marcolino
Moco. This means they will have to give up their present
position.
</P>
<P>
The congress also approved the general resolution at its
closing ceremony, which noted that the MPLA is "a party of the
masses" whose political ideal is to achieve "democratic
socialism", and current task is to achieve peace and national
reconciliation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the strategic goal for the MPLA
is to develop its economy and uplift Angolan people's living
standard through the "socialist market economy".
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called on all the people in the country to
"contain" the military forces of the opposition National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and isolate its
chairman Jonas Savimbi, whom it again accused as a "war
criminal".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Speaker to Summon House for Impeachment Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives, put lawmakers on notice
Thursday that the House will convene next Thursday to debate any
articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton in relation
to the Monica Lewinsky affair approved by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In a "Dear Colleague" letter prepared for all 435 lawmakers,
Gingrich said any written report approved by the committee would
be available by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich prepared the letter as Republicans on the House
Judiciary Committee moved to approve up to four articles of
impeachment by week's end.
</P>
<P>
The proposed articles allege Clinton committed perjury,
obstructed justice and abused his office to conceal his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
When the House adjourned last October, it authorized Gingrich
to convene a lame-duck session, in preparation for any impeachment
proceedings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has been all but invisible since deciding to retire,
and his letter offered no hint of whether Republicans would grant
Democratic demands for a vote on a lesser punishment such as
censure.
</P>
<P>
Nor did Gingrich say how long debate on articles of impeachment
would last.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said he did not
expect the president to make any statement on impeachment
proceedings before departing for the Middle East on Friday.
</P>
<P>
If the House approved an article of impeachment, which requires
only a majority vote, it would be the first such act against a
president since the Andrew Johnson case was sent to a Senate trial
in 1868. Conviction requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate.
Johnson was acquitted by a single vote.

</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Chen Jinhua, visiting vice-chairman of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
Tembo said China is a integral country. Zambia pursues the "one
China" stand just like it supported the restoration of China's
legitimate seat in the United Nations in the past.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the "extremely good and long-term relations" between
the two countries, and thanked China for its assistance in the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Tembo expressed his hope that the good cooperation will be
further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Chen told Tembo that China is an all-weather friend of Zambia
and Africa as a whole. He also thanked Zambia for its support to
China in the international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Chinese delegation held talks with the deputy
speaker of Zambian parliament and signed an agreement under which
CPPCC will provide Zambian parliament with office equipment.
</P>

The Chinese delegation arrived here Thursday for an eight-day
visit to Zambia.

GENEVA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade

Ruggiero has said that he will not run for the position again

</P>
<P>
To date, only around 90 out of the 132 WTO members have
expressed their preferences during the secret consultations which
began in late October.
</P>

A large majority of the members hold that the new WTO chief
should be selected by consensus, saying that recourse to a vote,

<HEADLINE>   Syria Intends to Resume Talks: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Thursday that Syria has indicated
it wants to restart talks with Israel, which broke off two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio cited Netanyahu as telling a group of Israeli
editors that Damascus has "made sorts of statements" on the
resumption of the talks. He stressed that if Syria really
mean it, it can find a way to do that.
</P>
<P>
However Netanyahu ealier denied Syrian President Hafez Assad
recently channeled messages to him that Israel will enjoy "quiet
borders" with Syria and Lebanon if it returns the Golan Heights,
which was taken by Israel during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
After seven Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon
in 10 days last month, Netanyahu rejected public calls for a
unilateral troop withdrawal from Lebanon, but said that he will
consider renewing peace talks with Syria to find a long-term
solution.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the major power-broker in Lebanon, has insisted that
there will be no solution to Israel's headache in southern
Lebanon unless Israel enters negotiations over the return of
the Golan Hights.
</P>
<P>
There have been rampant speculations that Israel and Syria
will seek ways to restart the talks after Israel signed a
land-for-peace accord with the Palestinians in Oct.
</P>
<P>
Israel media reports said that several contacts has been
initiated to determine whether talks can be resumed between the
two sides. Israel army radio said that Washington has sent out
feelers to Assad, who replied that he is ready to meet with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, however, have been at odds over how to resume
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria says the former Labor government in Israel has
offered in previous talks to surrender the Golan in exchange
for peace and therefore the negotiations should restart from
that point, but Netanyahu insisted that the talks should be
resumed without preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government to Resettle Land-Hungry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said Thursday his government will have to move fast to
allocate land for resettlement in order to avoid a public outcry.
</P>
<P>
Opening the central committee meeting of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) to prepare for
the annual national party conference, Mugabe said the government
needed to pacify the masses who were now skeptical of its
intentions, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not enough to tell people to be patient as they wanted
to see concrete preparatory steps being taken in their own
districts as an assurance of promises about to be fulfilled, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The annual party conference to be held in Gweru of central
Zimbabwe from Friday to Sunday, is expected to discuss issues
concerning land, economy and health.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is also ZANU-PF's first secretary, said the
government had acquired 841 farms as part of a long-term program
to obtain five million hectares of prime land to resettle more
than 150,000 poor peasants, and that work should start to
allocate land to the people.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the worry over the poor performance of the
economy which he blamed mainly on poor export earnings, low
investment levels and high prices of consumer commodities.

A spokesman of the Zambian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
announced in a statement here Thursday that Chiluba has invited
heads of state from Angola, Botswana, DRC, Kenya, Gabon,
Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and
Zimbabwe, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the summit, which aims to foster a peace
initiative or a "real" ceasefire acceptable to all warring
parties, will be preceded by a meeting of foreign and defense
ministers of the invited countries scheduled for next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, whose country remains neutral in the conflict, has
been mandated by the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) to mediate in the four-month old DRC crisis and is
spearheading an initiative to end the war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has drawn Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad to
fight alongside the DRC government army, while DRC's two tiny
eastern neighbors, Rwanda and Uganda, are believed to support the
Tutsi-led rebellion aimed at toppling President Laurent Kabila's
government.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Voices Regret at Saudi Crown Prince Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Thursday termed as
"regrettable" a remark by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul
Aziz that Iraq is still pursuing a cunning role in carrying out
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah "clearly adopted an American stand in defense of
UNSCOM's vicious actions and practices to prolong the embargo
imposed on Iraq," a unnamed spokesman of the Ministry of
Information and Culture said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was speaking in response to Abdullah's speech at
the just concluded 19th summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) has been in
charge of the weapons inspections in Iraq since the end of the
Gulf War in 1991 to ensure Baghdad's eradication of all weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused UNSCOM of serving the U.S. interest and
trying to prolong the punishing sanctions imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Crown Prince's speech "expressed
disrespect for the suffering of Iraqi people," and "whoever
listens to the Saudi official's statement will recognize that he
has quoted complete expressions from the American-designed
statement against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq hopes Abdullah may "bypass the
U.S.-Zionist-Kuwaiti propaganda against Iraq" which he said is
unacceptable to most countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia have
been cold since the 1991 Gulf War, in which Saudi Arabia sided
with the U.S.-led allied forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of Zimbabwe
Thursday postponed to January 18 next year the sentencing of
former president Canaan Banana who has been convicted of 11
counts of sodomy offenses.
</P>
<P>
The High Court in Harare was scheduled to pass sentence on
Thursday morning on Banana who is on the run and believed to be
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Banana, 62, fled the country before the High Court convicted
him on November 26, of all the 11 counts of sodomy, attempted
sodomy and indecent assault leveled against him.
</P>
<P>
The state has issued a warrant for his arrest and sought the
assistance of Interpol to bring Banana back to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Banana surfaced during the trial of his
former aide-de-camp, Jefta Dube who is now serving a 10-year jail
term for killing his colleague who had teased him as "Banana's
wife".
</P>
<P>
Dube had told the court during his trial that the former
president sexually abused him.
</P>
<P>
Some of Banana's former cooks, security guards and other males
he picked from the streets, also alleged that the former
president had sodomized them while he was still in office and
after, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Thursday.

Homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe and can carry a jail term
of two years or more.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Appeals for Relief Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Disaster Prevention
and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) of Ethiopia appealed Thursday
for about 223,800 tons of relief assistance to feed the victims
of both natural and man-made problems through the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
At a donors meeting attended by ambassadors, U.N. agencies and
non-governmental organizations here, DPPC commissioner Simon
Mechale said it is estimated that 2,157,000 Ethiopians will need
food assistance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The figure together with the 394,430 people currently
displaced due to the border crisis adds up to 2,551,510, he said.
</P>
<P>
Simon said the establishment of a non-food emergency
contingency stock is one of the focus of attention of the DPPC in
1999.
</P>
<P>
He said, the DPPC has in collaboration with some U.N. agencies
and interested non-governmental organizations been working on the
mechanisms of establishing a non-food emergency reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has approved the establishment of the
contingency stock and donors' favorable response is expected to
building up the stock, Mechale added.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded the DPPC's partners of the opportunities
created to purchase locally produced food for relief from areas
that are expecting a bumper harvest and thereby encourage farmers
to increase production in future years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the DPPC called on the international donor
community to give 572,835 tons of relief food required to feed
4.2 million needy people in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is expected to harvest 10 percent more grains than
that of 1998, according to an earlier announcement made by the
Ethiopian agricultural ministry.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Uses 3-D Technology to upgrade Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Mobil Producing Nigeria
Unlimited has used 3-dimensional (3-d) seismic technology to
increase its crude oil production and reserves in the company's
oil fields in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day forum held here Thursday, Andken
Ejayerjehe, a senior geo-physicist, said his company had invested
80 million U.S. Dollars to move from 2-d to 3-d technology
between 1989 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Following the introduction of the 3-d technology, he noted,
the company's crude oil production has increased by 120 percent
to 800,000 barrels per day, bringing the company to the position
of second highest producer of crude oil in this West African
country.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the technology has also increased crude oil
reserves in the company's acreage allocation of 800,000 acres to
2.9 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
Ejayerjehe told the forum that his company was already eyeing
the 4-dimensional technology in order to meet its goal of
producing one million barrels a day by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the 3-d technology has enabled the company to
gather a lot more data on any acreage and to readily detect
faults which could impede oil production.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Aret Adams, Special Adviser on Petroleum
resources to the Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar,
stated that the 3-d data acquisition technology by Mobil had
revealed that horizontal well technology is the most effective
strategy for developing oil fields in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that the implementation of a 36-horizontal wells
program increased oil production in the company's fields from
30,000 barrels a day in 1989 to 130,000 barrels a day in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Adams suggested that the improved technology should be applied
in all oil and gas fields in Nigeria to enable the country to
achieve its target of 40 billion barrels of reserves and four
million barrels of daily production by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Faces Court Action on Packaging Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is facing a court
action for not respecting the European Union's (EU) packaging
waste directive, the European Commission said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Belgium, the commission has decided to make
applications to the court for two separate infringements of the
directive, which aims to prevent and reduce the environmental
impact of packaging and packaging waste as well as to ensure the
smooth functioning of the EU internal market through a common
framework for imposing environmental controls on packaging.
</P>
<P>
Under the directive, the first infringement concerns the
failure by Belgium to communicate to the commission measures
transposing certain requirements of the directive into national
law, in particular a provision limiting the concentrations of
heavy metals present in packaging and transitional provisions for
packaging manufactured before the entry into force of the
directive.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's second infringement relates to the failure to ensure
a separate chapter on packaging waste in its waste management
plans. The commission said the decisions reflect its concern that
complete national legislation and adequate waste management plans
should be put in place to meet the goals of the directive.

<P>
The American soldiers ordered the crew of the ship to stay at
the stern of the ship, he added.

LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Health and Safety
Executive criticized the country's Railtrack on Thursday, saying
it had not done enough to improve the condition of the railways.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report the HSE said that the number of rail
deaths had doubled in the last year, although the number of
serious train accidents fell to the lowest level in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the number of collisions and
derailments had fallen from 105 the previous year to 89 - the
lowest figure since records began in 1959, but the number of
people killed on the railways, excluding trespassers and suicides,
rose from 25 in 1996-97 to 48 in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The HSE criticized Railtrack, which runs Britain's rail
network, saying there were still too many derailments caused by
poorly maintained tracks.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Inspector of Railways, Vic Coleman, challenged
Railtrack to "demonstrate their commitment to improving both track
condition and their control of contractors".
</P>
<P>
He criticized them for "several failings" in railway structure
maintenance, including bridges.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England cut
interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 6.25 percent Thursday
at its last meeting of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted
for the third month in succession to reduce its base rate for
lending from 6.75 percent to 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows another month of unremittingly gloomy
economic news, with some analysts warning that the manufacturing
sector could be on the verge of outright recession.
</P>
<P>
A new survey of business leaders found the vast majority
expected the UK economy to see a downturn in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The poll, by Mori, showed that only 1 percent of company chief
executives predicted an improvement in the economy next year,
compared with 89 percent that expect it to worsen.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that with consumer and business confidence
plunging, the UK economic slowdown has now become unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
Employers and unions had warned that at least a repeat of last
month's 0.5 percent reduction was needed to prevent hundreds of
thousands more jobs being lost in the fall-out from the global
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
However, 6.25 percent, the UK's base lending rate is still more
than double that of most of its European competitors.
</P>
<P>
The 11 countries joining up to the euro all cut their interest
rates last week to 3 percent, in a surprise co-ordinated move.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Bank's decision, Kate Barker, chief economist
at the Confederation of British Industry said: "This second 0.5
percent cut is welcome as it proves the MPC is prepared to act
against the dangers of deflation."

LAGOS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- More than half of children in
Sierra Leone are deprived of education because of the civil war,
a report from Freetown said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
Representative in Sierra Leone, Anthony Bloomberg as saying that
in some part of the country, seven out of every 10 children are
out of school.
</P>
<P>
"Even when children enroll themselves in school, high drop-out
rates and repetition of school years are reflective of doubtful
quality of education," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's Ministry of Education said that 45 percent of
the children in the West African country attend primary school
and only 25 percent of that number continue on to the secondary
level.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Social Welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs
Shirley Gbujama said hundreds of school buildings have either
been looted, burned down or destroyed as a result of rebel
attacks, while thousands of children under 18 have been recruited
as fighters.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government has pledged in its 1999 budget
to increase funding for education and pay tuition fee for
children in the first three years of primary school, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations development report for 1998,
Sierra Leone is now the poorest country in the world, where life
expectancy is 37 years and annual per capita income is estimated
at 171 U.S. Dollars.

Brussels, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Thursday that it had adopted 21 action programs in 10 member
countries to promote and market quality beef and veal for the
1998/99 marketing year.
</P>
<P>
The 10 program related EU members are Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain
and the United Kingdom. A EU regulation from 1993 provide for the
implementation of measures to promote and market quality beef and
veal.
</P>
<P>
For 1998/99 marketing year, the commission received 25 new
applications from 10 member states and 21 eligible programs have
been accepted.
</P>
<P>
Considering quality veal and beef, the programs adopt a number
of different promotional approaches: advertising campaigns in the
media; dissemination in magazines and papers; point-of-sale
marketing measures; public relation measures; participation at
trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the marketing strategy varies according to
EU member states but always revolves around three themes:
reassuring consumers and increasing their confidence in the value
of quality beef and veal; guaranteeing the existence of
independent checks at all stages from the producer to the
consumer; increasing the market share of quality beef and veal.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Strategic
Grain Reserve (SGR) has reached the lowest level since it was
established seven years ago, a senior official with the Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official who refused to be named, said the SGR has been

The government has not paid 5.3 billion Shillings (7.85
million U.S. Dollars) for emergency food supplied by the Food

<P>
"Since the establishment of SGR in 1991 the government has
been providing thousands of tons of grain every year for people
affected by disasters but it never paid for the supplies. As a
result, we are lacking money to fill the stock," he said, citing
25,000 tons of grain released by SGR this year for people
affected by floods caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The official said the highest stock in the reserve was 130,269
tons in 1992 when the purchases were 69,482 tons while the stock
before the purchases was 60,787 tons.
</P>
<P>
The official said in 1996 SGR had 82,171 tons which dropped to
60,119 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
This year, he said, the initial stock was 42,031 tons while
the purchases by November 23 were 3,526 tons, making the total
stock reach 45,557 tons, less than 10 percent of the required
supply.
</P>
<P>
The official said chances were slim for the Food Security
Department to attain the targeted goal of purchasing 25,000 tons
of grain this season.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for appropriate measures to enable the
department to fill the SGR stock which he said, is very important
especially at a time when the country is experiencing food
shortage.
</P>
<P>
Most regions in Tanzania are facing grave shortage of food due
to the floods throughout the country and drought which hit 15 out
of 18 regions in the mainland, and the government has sent teams
of experts to make assessment of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives said
that initial assessment by 15 regions indicate that some
523,247.8 tons of food are required to feed their respective
people between this month and next March.

<HEADLINE> Low Salary Responsible for Corruption in Uganda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Low salaries or salaries not
paid reliably have been one of the key causes of both petty and
grand corruption in Uganda, a U.N. System Agencies' statement
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement presented to the Consultative Group
Meeting being held here by the U.N. System Agencies, greed on the
part of service workers, poor example from the top, poor
supervision, lack of job security and lack of punishment of
corrupt people are all held responsible for the rampant
corruption in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni told the meeting that inefficiency
of the judiciary mainly explains Uganda's pervasive corruption.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the government's own estimates as showing that
slippage through diversion and misuse of funds amounts to as high
as 10-20 percent of annual aggregate expenditures.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the World Bank mission's report, a conservative
estimate of the direct economic loss from corruption amounts to
some 250 to 350 million U.S. Dollars annually," the state said.
</P>
<P>
A survey recently conducted by the Office of the Inspector
General of Government showed that payment of bribes is most
prevalent with the police, where 63 percent of respondents
reported having to pay a bribe to obtain services, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Reports of some ministers' abuse of office in the country's
privatization process, mainly in the sale of some big
parastatals, erode people's confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
MPs demanded at least five ministers found complicated in the
issue be punished for their mistakes which resulted in heavy
losses to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh, former senior presidential advisor on defense and
security, admitted over the weekend that he had bought the
country's biggest commercial bank illegally, making almost all
eyes glued to parliament's investigation into corruption of some
high-ranking officials.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone External Trade Growth Slows: Eurostat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Euro-zone had a trade
surplus with the rest of the world of 6.6 billion ECU in August,
according to the European Union (EU) statistical office, the
Eurostat, which released the figures from its head office in
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
This gave a total surplus of 53.2 billion ECU for
January-August, down 2.5 billion on the same period last year. And
the trade of extra-EU 15-member region was 1.3 billion ECU in
surplus in August. But there was a surplus of only 9.7 billion ECU
in the first eight months compared to 29.2 billion in
January-August last year.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat shows extra-and intra-trade growth in August was
weak for both the euro-zone and the 15-country EU region, with
extra-EU 15 exports even falling compared to August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The whole EU trade with U.S. was well up in the first eight
months. And effects of the situation in Asia financial markets can
be seen in a fall in exports to Japan (-14 percent) and Taiwan (-2
percent), while the replacement of Hong Kong by the Czech Republic
in the list of main trading partners.
</P>
<P>
However, trade growth with China remains strong with exports up
17 percent and imports up 16 percent, the Eurostat shows.

UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N weapons
inspectors were able to carry out their work unimpeded, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said teams of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction conducted their inspections without blockade from
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said at one site, which Iraq declared to be sensitive,
UNSCOM inspectors were delayed for 45 minutes, and differences
over procedure were resolved, and the team was allowed to inspect
the site.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan did not make any
comments on Iraq's action on Wednesday and he was waiting for the
report from UNSCOM Executive Chairman Richard Butler on Iraq's
compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Butler is expected to submit the report to the Untied Nations
Security Council early next week, when the Council will decide
whether or not to conduct the comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance.
</P>
<P>
The Council will not do so until it proves that Iraq has
cooperated fully and unconditionally with the Untied Nations arms
inspectors.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Thursday voted overwhelmingly to
revoke the clause of destruction of Israel in the national charter.
</P>
<P>
In the session of the 124-member body, 105 were present and 81
votes were in favor of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's letter to
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in which the clause was declared null
and void.
</P>
<P>
This is a prelude to Monday's meeting of the Palestinian National
Council (PNC) session during which the Charter will be formally revoked,
an action specified in the Wye River Agreement signed between the
Palestinians and Israel on October 23 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye accord, the PNC and delegates of other
Palestinian groups are to reaffirm the Arafat letter on Monday,
thus completing the process of revoking the charter.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the PNC revoked the charter in April 1996, but the
current Israeli government does not accept the result, demanding
another session and formally nulling the clause.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels Bury Remains of 78 Killed in War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels fighting to
topple President Laurent Kabila Wednesday buried in dignity the
remains of 78 ethnic Tutsis allegedly massacred by loyalist
troops soon after the rebellion broke out on August 2 in Congo.
</P>
<P>
The State-run Radio Rwanda reported Thursday that ceremonies,
officiated by top rebel officials led by Congolese Coalition for
Democracy and delegations from Rwanda and Burundi took place in
Uvira town, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Congo (K), a
story reaching Xinhua here by Rwandan News Agency (RNA) said.
</P>
<P>
Survivors told about 5,000 people from North and South Kivu
provinces that victims were rounded up by Kabila's forces and
imprisoned in local churches, schools, and health centers.
</P>
<P>
"Men were singled out, and taken away. They never came back,"
one woman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 78 victims were allegedly dumped into a mass grave. They
included 40 ethnic Banyamulenge soldiers, among whom was
commander Pascal Nyarugabo.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Wamba dia Wamba claimed that the 78 victims were
just a few among those killed in Kalemie district.
</P>
<P>
He urged Kabila to "release women and children held in jails
in Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi ad Kinshasa."
</P>
<P>
The rebels vowed to fight until Kabila is ousted from power,
and "peace and respect of human rights are restored" in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The international community was blamed for having been
"looking on" as president Kabila is "perpetrating the
extermination of some sections of the Congolese population."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. senator
Thursday condemned Britain's decision to allow a Spanish request
for the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
In an article in the Washington Post, Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms said the decision would deter
autocratic leaders from ever stepping aside peacefully and
allowing a democratic government.
</P>
<P>
"If dictators cannot be offered amnesty or safety in exile,
they will never hand over to democratic movements. The incentive
will be for greater repression, not less," said Helms.
</P>
<P>
Helms made clear his backing for Pinochet's 1973 coup, in which
he ousted elected left-wing president Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
"Much has been said of human rights abuses during the Pinochet
era. I do not condone abuses by anyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the majority of Chileans will tell you that (the coup)
... rescued their country from ruinous anarchy," he said,
adding that when Pinochet left power in 1988, "he left Chile a
free, thriving, prosperous, democratic nation."
</P>
<P>
Helms said the Chilean people had made "a conscious decision to
move on" from the Pinochet era and that their wishes must be
respected.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who first requested
Pinochet's arrest in London in October, charged him with
responsibility for the deaths or disappearances of 3,000 people
during his rule.

LUSAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Thursday spoke highly of China's economic progress made
in the past years and its policy of self-dependence.
</P>
<P>
When receiving at the State House an 11-member delegation of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
led by Vice-Chairman Chen Jinhua, Chiluba also expressed the hope
that China and Zambia could cooperate in mining, agriculture and
trade.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia could learn from China, the world's largest
developing country, and would like to move forward together with
China.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Chinese leadership for its success in turning
China into a world power and for its economic reforms and the
open-door policy China pursued in the past 20 years and said
Zambia admired the way in which the Chinese people defended what
they believed in.
</P>
<P>
"We get inspired by your leadership and the spirit of the
Chinese people," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also said Zambia would continue its current economic
reforms and should make decisions by itself.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chen, who arrived here last Friday for a
week-long visit, said his delegation was impressed with the
social stability and the economic growth Zambia enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the mutual relations between China and Zambia could
be strengthened and could grow further in the coming millennium.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. arms inspectors continued
their surprise and routine visits to suspected Iraqi sites
Thursday with full cooperation from the Iraqi side, said an Iraqi
official.
</P>
<P>
Hussam Mohammed Ameen, head of the Iraqi liaison with the
U.N. arms inspectors told the Iraqi News Agency that eight
inspection teams of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) made visits to 13
sites, one of which is not under long term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Ameen said two teams were helicoptered to their destinations,
and the tag-checking team visited a site in southern Baghdad,
adding that a missile team visited a site in western Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said that a UNSCOM team headed by Australian
Roger Hill inspected a site related to the national security. The
inspection was carried out according to the modalities that are
applied to sensitive sites, he added.
</P>
<P>
The same team also inspected a private house, said Ameen,
adding that the Iraqi personnel accompanying the team asked the
team not to enter the house unless its owner agreed.
</P>
<P>
However, two members of the team entered the house to the
surprise of the family, said Ameen, stressing that this attitude
is shameful because it aims at provocation only.
</P>
<P>
An IAEA discussion team continued meeting with Iraqi
officials whereas a 7-member biological team headed by Briton
David Kelly left Iraq Thursday after concluding its mission,
said Ameen.

JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Interim
Political Authority (IPA), preparing for new elections within 18
months, elected two chairmen at its inaugural meeting in Maseru
Thursday, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi
told a press briefing that the authority had elected Khauhelo
Raditapole of the Basotholand Congress Party and advocate
Lekhetho Rakuoane of the Popular Front for Democracy.

troika was indeed very happy that the IPA at its inaugural
meeting had demonstrated that it is able to live up to
expectations of the people of Lesotho," Mufamadi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC negotiating team was satisfied the momentum
had been unleashed to maintain and intensify the spirit of
cooperation toward the holding of fresh elections.

Rakuoane told a media briefing that the election of two
chairmen from different parties demonstrated that Lesotho's
political leaders were united and that they would use the IPA to
change the country's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi left the 24 Basotho political leaders to continue

SADC countries -- Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique -- returned

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran Thursday slammed a
New York Times report on its intention to acquire biological
weapons as "simply distorting the actual activities of biological
industry" in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The New York Times article alleging that Iran intends to
acquire biological weapon is simply distorting the actual
activities of biological industry in Iran and therefore it is
categorically rejected," said a press release from Iran's
Permanent Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times Tuesday carried a report, saying "Iranians
lure needy ex-Soviet scientists" in order to get biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's peaceful biological program falls within the provision
of Article X of the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of
Biological Weapons, to which Iran is a party," the news release
said.
</P>
<P>
The convention also "provides for the state parties to the
convention undertake to facilities, and have the right to
participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment,
materials, and scientific and technological information for the
use of of bacteriological (biological) agents and toxins for
peaceful purposes," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is actively engaged in all international efforts to
strengthen the verification system of the 1972 convention.
Moreover, unlike many other members of the 1925 Geneva Protocol
for the Prohibition of the Use of Toxin Weapons, Iran has joined
the protocol without any reservation," said the news release.
</P>
<P>
"It is self-evident that no nation can nowadays deprive itself
of the benefits of progress in the field of biology and
biotechnology which directly correlate with standard of everyday
life," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is no exception and accordingly attempts, to the degree
that its limited resources allow, to take advantage of this
scientific progress," said the news release. "In this context,
Iran like many other states has benefited from the knowledge and
cooperation of scientists from all over the world including from
Russia and Western countries."

<HEADLINE> PNC Central Committee Nullifies Anti-Israel Clauses in Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the session of the 124-member body, 105 were present and 81
voted in favor, overwhelmingly approving a letter from the
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to the
U.S. President Bill Clinton declaring the provisions in the
charter null and void.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the letter has paved the way for the 730-member
PNC plenum to nullify the clauses formally Monday, in presence of
U.S. President Bill Clinton who is to pay his first visit to the
Palestinian self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister insisted on Thursday that the PNC take a
vote in Monday's gathering under the Wye River Agreement signed by
the two sides on October 23 in Washington. Otherwise, he said the
issue will not be settled down.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians say a vote is not required according to
the peace agreement. Arafat stressed Thursday that there will be
only an acclamation in the meeting to confirm the nullification of
the clauses.
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross, who arrived
here early this week, is trying to arrange a compromise over the
issue before Clinton began his visit in the region on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the PNC revoked the charter in April 1996, but the
current Israeli government does not accept the result, demanding
another session and formally nullifying the clauses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian demonstrations continued on Thursday
in protest against Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
security prisoners in the Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank city of Ramallah, about two thousands
Palestinians took part in the funeral of a Palestinian youth who
was killed in the clashes with the Israeli soldiers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
And hundreds of the relatives of prisoners also gathered in
Gaza and urged Israel to fulfill its commitment under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Israel would release 750 prisoners
by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel freed 250 prisoners but most of them were
common criminals instead of the political prisoners, who were
arrested due to anti-Israel activities as demanded by the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Warns Against Israeli Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League warned Thursday
that Israel's continued settlement activities in the occupied
Palestinian territories will not serve peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli acts and practices do not help build confidence
between the signatories to the peace agreements," a statement
issued by the Cairo-based pan Arab organization said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was released to mark the 11th anniversary of the
the Palestinian Intifada (uprising) in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Signed agreements demand that Israel not take unilateral
actions on Jewish settlements, an issue which should be solved in
the final-status talks, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But Israel is continuing expanding Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, a move which has prompted protests from the
Palestinians and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League said in the statement that it sides with the
Palestinian prisoners in Israel, who are observing hunger strike
until they are released.
</P>
<P>
It called on the United States, a key sponsor of the Middle
East peace process, to step in to press Israel into fulfilling its
obligations under the Wye peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel signed the peace agreement on October
23 in Washington on, among other things, Israeli release of 750
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel has set free some 250 Palestinian prisoners. But most of
them are criminals, not political prisoners jailed for resistance
against Israeli occupation, as demanded by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been staging demonstrations in the West
Bank in protest against Israel. One Palestinian has been shot
dead and more than 50 others wounded when Israeli troops opened
fire at the protesters.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet arrived on early Friday afternoon at Belmarsh Magistrates
Court in south-east London for his first public appearance since
his arrest nearly two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He entered the court building out of view of hundreds of
opponents and supporters gathering outside.
</P>
<P>
One group of cheering supporters of the General jumped up and
down screaming "Free Pinochet".
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested on October 16 while he was recovering
from a back surgery in a private hospital in London.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused him of responsibility for the deaths
and disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule in
Chile and requested his extradition to Spain to face charges.
</P>
<P>
Friday's hearing, at which Pinochet is required to answer his
arrest warrant for the first time, is expected to set a committal
date for extradition proceedings to take him to Spain.
</P>

A date could also be set for a committal, or main extradition
hearing, which will be the first substantive stage in a process

<HEADLINE> China's Education for All Above Other Developing Countries: UNICEF Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China's achievements in
education for all over the past five decades have by far exceeded
other developing countries with a large population, says a report
of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Mr. Edwin J. Judd, UNICEF representative in China, today
congratulated China on its performance for extending access to
basic education nearly for all children, when he addressed a
launching ceremony of the Chinese edition of the UNICEF 1999 State
of the World's Children in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He pledged the UNICED will implement the Primary Education
Project in China's 102 poor counties and 12 provinces and offer
them with a wide range of technical resources and innovative
activities which they adapt to local conditions and needs.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important milestones of the UNICEF is assuring
access for the estimated 12 million plus out-of-school children,
many of them girls living poor, remote rural and minority areas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Education for All: Making the Right a
Reality," the report points out that by 1996, primary school
enrollment was 98.8 percent over 136 million children, junior
secondary 82.4 percent, and senior secondary 31.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
National policies in China indicate an intention to continue
market reforms to modernize the economy while retaining basic
values of fairness and equity in society, the report says.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Program of Action for Child
Development in China in the 1990s, China's educational goals are
to popularize compulsory primary education in whole China and
largely popularize compulsory junior secondary educations in
towns, cities and the more economically-developed rural areas,
while eradicate, to the greatest extent possible, illiteracy among
the adults and youths in the age group 15 to 40 years throughout
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Pregnancies among under-age
girls have leapt by 11 percent in England and Wales, according to
the latest British government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The most recent figures for conception by girls aged 13-15 show
a rise to 9.4 pregnancies per 1,000 in 1996, compared with 8.5 per
1,000 in 1995, the Office for National Statistics revealed on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
More than 75 percent of those pregnancies were among
15-year-olds, and over half of all under-age conceptions were
aborted.
</P>
<P>
The survey, called Birth Statistics 1997, also found that
marriages fell to their lowest level last year since World War I,
with a corresponding increase in children born to unmarried
parents.
</P>
<P>
The number of children born out of wedlock rose sharply from 23
percent 10 years ago to 37 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered single mothers - suggesting one-parent
families - has remained constant around the 50,000 mark since
1987, while there has been a significant increase in children
registered to unmarried parents co-habiting.
</P>
<P>
Numbers rose from 75,000 births jointly registered by unmarried
parents 10 years ago to 142,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A vast majority - 98 percent - of births occur in hospital,
rather than at home, and 99 percent of those take place in a
National Health Service hospital.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Made Honorary Citizen of Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Former German Federal
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was declared on Friday an Honorary Citizen
of Europe, only the second-ever person to receive the award.
</P>
<P>
All the heads of state and government attending the two-day
European Union summit here were present at the award presentation
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During his 16-year chancellorship which started in 1982,
68-year-old Kohl left a very strong personal mark on Germany's
reunification and Europe's integration process.
</P>
<P>
Despite pressure from ever-higher taxes since the German
reunification in 1990, Kohl had managed to maintain his country's
contribution toward European Union coffers.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the largest net contributor to EU budget, last year
paid 22 billion marks (13 billion U.S. dollars) to the EU budget,
or 11.08 billion ECU more than it received in the form of
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Kohl told the leaders of EU countries at the ceremony that even
though the train of Europe sometimes puffs ahead slowly and may
even pull to a grinding halt, people should not lose sight of the
(European integration) destination.
</P>
<P>
"The European integration is a precious treasure that benefits
many more people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl is the first person to made an Honorary Citizen of Europe
since 1976 when the accolade went to former French foreign
minister Jean Monnet, who actively pushed for European integration
in the 1950s.

law-enforcement departments need to implement the central
government decrees and work harder for the region's economic,
cultural and ethical progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also called on two farmers and gave gifts behalf of the

<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- At least nine passengers on
board a Thai Airbus were confirmed dead after the plane crashed in
the southern province of Surat Thani.
</P>
<P>
Airport sources confirmed a TV report that flight TG261 of the
Thai Airways International was carrying 232 passengers and 14 crew
members. Rescue workers saved at least 30 passengers, including
foreigners from the debris. Some were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed into rubber trees 3-5 kilometers from the
destination while on its way from Bangkok to Surat Thani. It
exploded into a fireball, TV reports quoted witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Theksuban rushed
to the scene to lead the rescue work. He told reporters from the
scene that poor visibility was the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
TV footage showed a heavy downpour which obstructed rescue
work. Survivors were seen bleeding all over and screaming.
</P>
<P>
It was still unknown how many foreigners were on board the
plane.

<HEADLINE> 3 World Records Fall as China Keeps Momentum (Day Six) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China continued its awesome
gold hunt in weightlifting, swimming, shooting, canoeing on the
sixth day of the Asian Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese prowess in women's weightlifting reached a dizzying
height when Sun Tianni shattered all three world records in the
69kg category to win, as Chinese Chef de Mission Yuan Weimin put
it, "the most valuable gold."
</P>
<P>
Sun lifted a record weight of 111kg in the snatch and 135kg in
the clean and jerk, before grabbing a third world record with a
total score of 245kg. The previous overall mark of 242.5kg was
created by fellow Chinese Tang Weifang early this year.
</P>
<P>
Eleven weightlifting world records have stumbled at the Games,
nine of them by nearly invincible Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would break world records here," said the 23-year-old
Sun from Southeast China. "My hard work paid off."
</P>
<P>
In the snatch, Sun bettered Tang's world record of 110.5kg set
early this year. Her clean and jerk lift was 1.5kg over the
old world mark.
</P>
<P>
In men's weightlifting, Chinese Yuan Aijun only finished second
in the over-85kg class, after Iran's Shashin Nassiri-Nia.
</P>
<P>
In swimming, China won half of six golds medals at stake,
with Japan taking two and Malaysia one.
</P>
<P>
China's world champions didn't let supporters down as world
record holder Wu Yanyan led Chen Yan in a 1-2 finish in the
women's 200m medley, repeating their top-two placing at the
world championships in Perth in January.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hua, the 16-year-old Chinese, won her second gold in the
Games as she touched home first in the women's 800m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chengji, from Shanghai, splashed home first in the
men's 50m freestyle sprint.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Takashi Yamamoto snatched his second gold here when he
out-touched defending champion Xie Xufeng of China in the men's
200m butterfly final.
</P>
<P>
The day's relay gold went to Japan, whose women led all the
way to win the 4x100 medley relay.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Lim Keng-Liat denied Chinese Fu Yong a second
backstroke title when he posted an Asian record time of 55.53
seconds over 100m.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shooters, who aim for 15 golds here, came closer
to their goal with a three-title haul on Thursday which boosted
the total goals to 14.
</P>
<P>
Asian champion Ning Lijia took the free rifle three positions
title after leading the Chinese to the team gold, while compatriot
Jin Yongde won the men's standard pistol.
</P>
<P>
The standard pistol team gold went to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
China also grabbed two canoeing golds in the women's K-2 500m
and K-4 500m races.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan turned out the biggest winner in canoeing by
sweeping five golds.
</P>
<P>
In badminton, China won the women's team title with a 3-1
victory over South Korea but lost the men's top honor to
Indonesia which triumphed 4-0.
</P>
<P>
China overcame DPR Korea 3-1 for the women's table tennis team
gold while its women's tennis squad lost 2-1 to Chinese Taipei in
the team final.
</P>
<P>
In the day's last event, Malaysia outlasted Thailand 6-4 in
doubles snooker final.
</P>
<P>
With a 11-gold collection, China now tops the medal standings
with 61 golds, 44 silvers and 26 bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Japan finished second in a 23-26-32 record and South Korea
was third in 20-13-23.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government to Help Farmers Weather Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vanclief will now take the package to the provinces, in the
hope that they agree to add an extra 600 million dollars (400
million U.S. dollars) to bring the entire bail-out up to a total
of 1.5 billion (985 million U.S. dollars) over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the program will be to target the many
farmers in Canada who, I am confident, will succeed over the long
term, but due to circumstances beyond their control need help
right now," said Vanclief.
</P>
<P>
Grain and hog production makes up about 30 percent of Canada's
total farm output, and involves almost 90,000 farm families.
</P>
<P>
About half of those "are in serious trouble, or will be", said
a Canadian agriculture official, adding that some farmers are now
sustaining losses of 4,000 Canadian dollars (2,600 dollars) a week.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from Statistics Canada, grain prices have
dropped 25 percent from a year ago, while hog prices have seen an
even sharper fall of more than 60 percent, mainly because of the
Asian financial crisis and a subsidy war between the United States
and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> National Strike in India Against Govt Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A one-day national strike
was called in India Friday to protest against the economic
policies of the government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), disrupting normal life in several states of the country.
</P>
<P>
Millions of workers, peasants and students took part in the
strike, jointly organized by constituent trade unions and
organizations of peasantry, agricultural workers, students, youths
and women under the name of the National Platform of Mass
Organizations (NPMO).
</P>
<P>
NPMO said in a press release Friday that the general strike had
peaked in its sweep and reach in terms of mass mobilization and
participation.
</P>
<P>
Workers and employees bravely defied repressive measures and
intimidatory steps, as witnessed in the states of Haryana and
Punjab.
</P>
<P>
While no major incident was reported during the strike, some
300 were arrested in Orissa, 150 in Bihar and 30 in Tamil Nadu for
various offenses including violation of prohibitory orders.
</P>
<P>
However, normal life was not affected in the capital of New
Delhi but workers stayed away in the industrial areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
NPMO said that around 70 percent of coal miners and over 80
percent of banking and insurance employees participated in the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Out of four million employees under different state
governments, more than 80 percent took part in the strike, which
was total in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
The BJP-led government appealed in vain Thursday to trade union
leaders to withdraw the strike on the ground that it would
adversely affect the economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike hit hard in sectors like transport, postal services,
banks, ports and docks, but essential services like water, power
and milk supply were exempted.
</P>
<P>
Security was beefed up and extra vigil was mounted across the
country to deal with any contingency during the day.
</P>
<P>
Indian Airlines, which is mainly on domestic flights, canceled
its flights between Delhi and Calcutta Friday and changed its
schedule of certain flights due to the strike.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the strike was supported by All-India Anna
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and a breakaway Congress group, Tirnamul
Congress. Both are BJP allies in the coalition government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, says that the
news media need to play a bigger role in developing democracy and
the legal system by increasing public awareness of the law and the
people's congress system.
</P>
<P>
Li told a workshop on reporting on the law and the legal system
held by the General Office of the NPC Standing Committee that they
need to create a group of qualified legal reporting correspondents
for the country's democracy and legal system to help implement the
strategy of governing the nation by the means of law.
</P>
<P>
Li said that this year is the 20th anniversary of the Third
Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), which has historical significance to the
Party and the nation. He said that the meeting shifted the focus
of Party work to the economy and started the development of
socialist democracy and a legal system.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, China's democracy and legal system
have improved and are recognized world-wide, Li said, and its
congress system has played a still greater role.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that the growth of socialist democracy and
legal system is an important component part of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and a theoretical basis for guiding the further development
of socialist democracy and improvement of socialist legal system
for the past 20 years.

proposed, for the first time in Party history, that the nation be
governed by law and that a socialist country governed by law be
established, he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised this heritage and the development of Deng Xiaoping's
theory on democracy and legal system by the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory role of the NPC and its standing committee is
essential, he noted, and the legislative, administrative,
judicial, and procuratorial departments are merely divided by
different functions but have the common goal of building socialism
with China's characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The media should publish positive reports, but should also
expose serious cases of violating the law, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guan'gen, who is a member of the Political Bureau and
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Head of the Publicity
Department of the CPC Central Committee, attended the workshop and
spoke to the gathering.

BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- We Jianxing, a member of the
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau,
emphasized today the need for a ceaseless effort at strengthening
the party style and clean government and continuing the
anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, discipline inspection commissions have
penalized 2.35 million CPC members, he said.

<P>
Corrupt elements like former Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong have
been driven out of the Party, Wei told a forum of the CPC Central

the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Eleventh CPC Central
Committee.
</P>

the beginning of China's new historic period of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It also laid a firm, scientific, ideological foundation for the
building of party style and clean government as well as the
anti-corruption drive, he said.

BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Five children from China's
poorer areas told a children's forum held by the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) at Beijing's People's University's Middle
School today about their wishes for a better education.
</P>
<P>
They were invited with other Chinese children to express
themselves at the forum, to mark the release of the Chinese
version of UNICEF's State of the World's Children 1999 in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Mo Zhonglian, a girl from a mountainous area in southwest
China's Guizhou Province, told the gathering: "I had a nightmare
one day: when I entered the school and opened my bag, a sudden
wind blew my books away and left me unable to study."
</P>
<P>
Mo was a school dropout long before the "Spring Bud Project",
which is sponsored by the Chinese Children's Fund, helped her to
enrol in a special class for girls. She asked: "When will all
girls in mountaneous areas be able to go to school?"
</P>
<P>
In China, female children account for 60 percent of the school
dropouts between the ages of 7 and 11, and account for
three-fourths of those who don't complete primary school.

<HEADLINE> Yammoto Beats Asian Record to Win Men's Butterfly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Takashi Yamamoto of Japan set
a new Asian record here on Friday when Lim Keng-Liat turned out a
dark horse to win Malaysia's first gold medal in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Yamamoto, who clinched the men's 100m butterfly
on Tuesday, clocked a winning time of 1:56.75 to beat his own
Asian record in the men's 200m butterfly.
</P>
<P>
The former Asian mark of 56.99 was set by him in the last World
Championships in Perth, Australia in January.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Kinki University student overcame a medicore start
and took the lead from China's Xie Xufeng in the 150-meter mark to
power his way home. Xie came in second in 1:59.67, with Han
Kyu-Chui of South Korea third in 2:00.46.
</P>
<P>
"I felt great to break my own record here," said Yamamoto. "I
think nobody in Japan now can beat the new record."
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can narrow the gap between me and the world-class
swimmers. I wish I can join them in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
But it was Lim who stole the limelight as he seemed to come
from nowhere to take Malaysia's first gold medal in the games with
a win in the men's 100m backstroke, breaking, though only briefly,
the war of gold medals between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old high school student made a powerful start and
finished the course in 55.53, a new Games record.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very surprised to win, for I only expected to get into the
top two," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first gold for my country in the Games, so I felt
I have made history," said the elated Malaysian swimmer.
</P>
<P>
China's Fu Yong, who was crowned in the 100m backstroke,
followed Liat in second 56.40, with Raymond Papa of the
Philippines third in 56.83
</P>
<P>
"He swam excellently, and I don't feel disappointed to have to
settle for the silver," said the Chinese swimmer.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yanyan and Chen Yan, both world record holders, finally
shrugged off the poor form haunting them these days when they
finished one-two in the women's 200m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
Wu, 20, finished first in 2:15.22, well below her own world
record of 2:09.72. Chen Yan, who suffered stomach upset, was
second in 2:15.54. The bronze went to Cho Hee-Yeon of South Korea,
who was timed 2:15.95.
</P>
<P>
Wu' coach tried to explain why his protege's time was far below
her own record.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very satisfied with her performance," he said. "Nobody can
always achieve good time, besides she has to reserve some energy
in the following 4x100m medley."
</P>
<P>
But it was Wu who underlied China's loss in the medley event,
of which the gold was won by the Japanese foursome in 4:06.70,
also a new Games' record.
</P>
<P>
Wu was no match to Tomoko Hagiwara in the backstroke leg, and
was 1.48 second in her Japanese rival's wake. Her other three team
mates just could not overcame the gap, and had to be satisfied
with a silver in 4:08.54.
</P>
<P>
"Wu's speciality is individual medley, not backstroke, and she
lagged behind the Japanese swimmer too much" said Shan Ying, who
won the first swiming gold on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"That's the main reason for our loss, " Shan said.
</P>
<P>
But team mates' loss failed to affect Jiang Chengji who won the
men's 50m gold win this year's world fourth best time of 22.38,
also a new Games' record.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who draped a Chinese flag to take a victory walk at the
poolside after the win, said: "our Chinese swimmers can lose the
competitions, but can not lose the morale."
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Jiang, who switched his speciality from 100m
butterfly to 50m freestyle, said: "I hope this will not be my last
gold in major international competition "
</P>
<P>
The last glory of Friday in the pool was captured by Chinese
prodigy Chen Hua when she won her third gold in the women's 800m
freestyle in 8:38.00. Sachiko Yamada of Japan finished second in
8:39.21, with Eri Yamanoi, another Japanese, in third in 8:56.90.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Chen, who was the stop-gap for Chen Yan in the
women's 4x100m freestyle, brought China's gold tally in the pool
to 11, only one shy of Japan's 12.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Electronic Visa Information System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- An Electronic Visa
Information system (ELVIS) for textiles exports subject to the
United States' visa requirement will be launched as from January
1, 1999, Hong Kong Trade Department said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
ELVIS is a new Electronic Data Interchange Service to be
jointly launched by the Trade Department and Tradelink Electronic
Commerce Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Acting Assistant Director-General of Trade Ting Lup-wong said,
"What we are starting on January 1 is a test phase during which
both the ELVIS version and the paper version of a visa are sent to
the U.S. customs."
</P>
<P>
"But when ELVIS is implemented in its full electronic phase,
customs clearance will become a paperless process and presentation
of paper visa at the U.S. end will no longer be required," he
said.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of ELVIS, the Trade Department will
transfer visa data of approved licenses to Tradelink. Tradelink
will then convert the visa data into ELVIS message which could be
transmitted to the U.S. Customs.
</P>
<P>
Ting said implementation of ELVIS will help facilitating the
trade and maintaining Hong Kong's competitiveness vis-a-vis other
exporting economies.
</P>
<P>
"By replacing the paper visa copy with electronic message under
the ELVIS, textiles traders exporting to the U.S. can save time
and avoid any possible loss of visa copy during transit or postal
delay," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Military Sanctions to Go in Few Months: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Friday said ban on U.S. military sale to the country
would be lifted in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
"I think there are positive prospects for the lifting of U.S.
military sanctions against Pakistan in the next few months," Aziz
told the Pakistan Television's program of "Sawaray Sawaray."
</P>
<P>
He said one of the objectives of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's
recent visit to the United States was to remove restrictions on
military sale to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Americans had removed partial economic sanctions but
maintained ban on military sale to Pakistan because of the
Pressler Amendment 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with American leaders, Sharif insisted that
there is imbalance between India and Pakistan in terms of nuclear
and other weapons, which should be removed, according to the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Pressler Amendment 1990, Aziz said, "We had not
bought any spare parts and military equipment from the United
States."
</P>
<P>
The American administration made it clear to the Pakistani
leadership that the issue could be settled after progress on the
nuclear issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that these sanctions could not be continued for
a long time," he said, adding that the tension in the relations
between Pakistan and the U.S. after the nuclear tests has been
removed.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that another objective of Sharif's
visit was to project the Kashmir issue at the international level.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have realized the sensitivity of the core issue
and U.S. President Bill Clinton also hinted that his
administration would help dialogue between India and Pakistan if
both countries agreed, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz said, "W achieved substantive progress on the
F-16s issue" during the prime minister's visit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton accepted that the U.S. should not have been unfair to
Pakistan on the F-16s issue as Pakistan had paid the money but
neither it got the planes nor the refund, he said.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton presented proposals which are very positive
and we are seriously considering these proposals and we will
shortly announce details about this," Aziz said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Promote Cleaning Industry for Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Ministry of
Manpower Friday announced that it plans to professionalize and
promote the cleaning industry as a way to revitalize employment
creation.
</P>
<P>
While briefing a press conference here Friday afternoon on the
labor market situation in Singapore in the third quarter this
year, the ministry's Secretary of State Tan Chin Nam said that a
key step in employment revitalization is on the identification and
promotion of the cleaning industry, a sector that has been
traditionally shunned by local workers.
</P>
<P>
Tan also said the ministry has embarked on an industry
promotion program to bring about more jobs for local workers in
the cleaning sector, and its two sub sectors, namely, the
commercial cleaning industry and the domestic services industry,
have been identified for industry promotion.
</P>
<P>
For commercial cleaning industry, Tan said a first step would
be to set appropriate standards to upgrade the industry.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Manpower is working with the Institute of
Technical Education (ITE) on certifiable training program in
cleaning and with the Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) on
evolving industry standards, and these two projects are in the
pipeline and will be launched early next year, he added.
</P>
<P>
For the domestic cleaning industry, he said, there are 360,000
households staying in five-room flats or above, which could form
the potential market for domestic services.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100,000 foreign domestic service workers in
Singapore and some of these domestic services can be undertaken by
locals, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a job creation opportunity, he elaborated, the ministry
plans to professionalize domestic cleaning by working with
training providers to provide professional training for local
domestic helpers.
</P>
<P>
Citing the cleaning industry in Denmark as an example, Tan said
workers engaged in the industry are not maids and they must be
professionalized through training.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Moves Asia Business Unit To Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chevron, one of the world's
top 10 oil and gas companies, moved its Asia business unit from
California to Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Richard Matzke, President of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, who
made a special trip to Beijing to make the announcement, said that
they are extremely pleased with their exploration and production
success in China.
</P>
<P>
They have had 10 very successful years in China, he says, and
find government policies supportive. Chevron's Beijing Office will
be expanded to increase flexibility in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Matzke brought a gift from headquarters: Chevron plans to
invest 60 million U.S. dollars in China in 10 wildcat wells, its
most significant wildcat drilling in the world. They will be in
the South China Sea, Bohai Bay, and the Shengli Oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Chevron made its decisions in response to low oil prices amid
low demand as a result of the Asian financial crisis as well as to
the announced merger of Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
Chevron expands investment during a low period when costs are
lower so as to be strong enough to reach the peak when the economy
improves, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Chevron is exploring three offshore areas in China: Bohai Bay,
the Pearl River Basin near Hong Kong, and the South China Sea. The
120-year old oil company began to export kerosene to China early
in the century when electric light bulbs were not popular in China
and people used lamps.
</P>
<P>
Chevron has put some 400 million U.S. dollars into exploration
and production in China since it started cooperation with the city
of Guangzhou in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Calls on ASEAN to Regain Credibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan Friday called on the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) to regain credibility so as to meet new
challenges.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which holds a summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, next week, must
evolve an integrated grouping further or risk becoming irrelevant,
Surin said before leaving for Hanoi to attend the ASEAN foreign
ministerial meeting prior to the summit.
</P>
<P>
"It (ASEAN) has to regain its credibility, it has to regain its
international confidence," Surin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It has to assure those outside potential investors that the
atmosphere here is conducive to digesting whatever forms of
assistance coming in," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN leaders will debate on, among other topics,
Thailand's proposal for "flexible engagement" in the internal
affairs of member countries, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The debate, which would pit Thailand and the Philippines
against other countries, would be pivotal to ASEAN's development.
</P>
<P>
Another topic is how to make ASEAN effective and relevant.
</P>
<P>
"They have to discuss this themselves, how far, how fast, how
quickly they want to go," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's code of "non-interference" has meant in the past the
members were reluctant to comment on, for example, unrest in
Indonesia, or human rights abuses in certain countries.
</P>
<P>
It has also added to the difficulty of deciding whether
Cambodia, whose ASEAN membership was put on hold last year because
of factional violence in Phnom Penh, is now sufficiently stable to
join.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's concept of "flexible engagement" was watered down to
"enhanced interaction" at the grouping's ministerial conference in
Manila in July. Some countries have called for clarification of
the concept.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maynmar, Laos,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Out to Revive Property Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has been trying
to revive its property sector as a way to boost the national
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the prevailing regional financial crisis since July
last year, Malaysia's property market has been stagnant this year
with property prices plunging by 20-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reviving the sector has been one of the priorities suggested by
the National Economic Action Council which released its National
Economic Recovery Plan in July this year.
</P>
<P>
To revive the property sector, the government eased the credit
squeeze on the sector implemented late last year and early this
year, enabling banks to give out loans and many housing developers
to introduce various schemes to make it easier for people to buy
properties, particularly houses.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has also established Special Funds for Low and Medium
Cost Houses, with a total sum of 2 billion ringgit (526.315
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The property market has attracted some attention of late,
especially after the disclosure at the Senate that property
reserved for Bumiputras (aboriginals) worth 4 billion ringgit
(1.052 billion dollars) were unsold.
</P>
<P>
A month-long Home Ownership Campaign, endorsed by the National
Economic Action Council (NEAC) and being organized by Bank Negara
Malaysia, the state bank, the Housing Developers Association and
the Association of Banks in Malaysia, is scheduled to kick off
Saturday with the aim of increasing house ownership as a way to
spur economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"What has been built has to be sold because a lot of capital
and liquidity is trapped. That is why property market players are
launching the campaign," a player said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage prospective buyers, a basket of incentives have
been offered for buying homes priced up to 250,000 ringgit (65,789
 dollars).
</P>
<P>
A total of 222 property companies nationwide have stated their
intention to participate in the campaign to be launched by
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, offering residential
and commercial properties originally valued at 5.228 billion
ringgit (1.375 billion dollars) at a discount of at least 10
percent off the market price, Kajang Utama Bhd Managing Director
Mazlan bin Ali said Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, all banks and finance companies would
offer 95 percent financing for residential properties costing up
to 200,000 ringgit (52,631 dollars) and interest rates of 9
percent per annum will be provided for houses or apartments
costing up to 100,000 ringgit (26,315 dollars), Azman Hashim,
chairman of the Association of Merchant Banks in Malaysia, said.
</P>
<P>
As part of its contribution to the campaign, the General
Insurance Association of Malaysia will give a 25-percent discount
on the insurance premiums for properties bought during the
campaign, its Executive Director Lim Chia Fook said.
</P>
<P>
Other incentives include the waiver of processing fees and
stamp duties as well as reduced legal fees and expedited loan
applications.
</P>
<P>
With the new incentives and with property prices almost
reaching the bottom, some observers said that the campaign is
expected to head off an over-supply situation and help build up
buyers' confidence that has been affected by the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
They said the campaign might also spur loan growth in the
banking sector. The loan growth so far officially estimated at
about 3 percent is far away from the 8-percent growth target set
by the government for this year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Not Experiencing Banking Crisis: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said that his country has some problems with the
banking sector but it does not experience a banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
He made this remarks at a press conference held Friday morning
in the capital of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no crisis because the government has taken
corrective measures in time. There would have been a crisis if
we had not intervened," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There were mistakes, but the situation has been corrected and
not allowed to slip further," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the government injected fund in Uganda
Commercial Bank (UCB) and Greenland Bank instead of some other
banks, the president said UCB was a government bank and that
there was a huge sum of deposits in the bank.
</P>
<P>
To save the bank is to save people's interests, Museveni told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bank of Uganda should not license banks they are
not sure about, banks which cannot meet the required parameters,
adding that there is some mismanagement in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Museveni refuted some allegations that his brother, who
recently admitted buying UCB illegally, was doing business for
him. He said his only property is cows.

<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- About 1 out of every 120
Chinese suffers from asthma, a common lung disease characterized
by breathing problems, according to China's asthma control
institute.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 10 million asthma sufferers here, 40
percent of whom are below the age of 14, according to Prof. Chen
Yuzhi, director of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics' Asthma
Clinic and Education Center.
</P>
<P>
Many young people with the disease do not get proper
treatment. The disease is still not curable at present, Chen says,
but can be controlled with proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
World Asthma Day is today. Its theme is "Help Our Children
Breath". It was started by the World Health Organization (WHO),
Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and European Respiratory
Society (ERS).
</P>
<P>
Scientists have discovered a link between asthma and viruses
and bacteria, emotional and certain environmental factors, and
allergic reactions caused by foods and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The disease affects some 150 million people around the world
and kills 100,000 people each year.
</P>
<P>
Chen says that there are 3 times the number of asthma sufferers
as 10 years ago and studies have shown that about 75 percent of
the children with the disease will live lifelong with asthma, but
25 percent of them may become very sick when they are grown up.

JOHANNESBURG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has
received no request for the extradition of fugitive former
Zimbabwean president Canaan Banana yet, South African Press
Association quoted the Justice Ministry as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Harare High Court Thursday postponed to January 18 passing
sentence on Banana, who was convicted in absentia of sodomy and
other sexual assault crimes on November 26.
</P>
<P>
His defense lawyer Josephine McNally said the delay was to
allow the authorities time to extradite Banana.
</P>
<P>
South African executive director of Interpol, Dave Bruce, said
there was no indication that Banana was still in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Border posts had been put on full alert, but no record existed
of him entering or leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Banana was refused official documentation from the Department
of Foreign Affairs, but met South African President Nelson
Mandela last week.
</P>
<P>
Interpol spokesman Deon Niemann said earlier this week that if
Banana was found in South Africa, he would be treated like any
other illegal alien and deported to Zimbabwe as soon as possible.

<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) released its Chinese version of the State of the
World's Children 1999 today in Beijing, asking for more spending
on education in poverty-stricken parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Edwin J. Judd, UNICEF representative in China, at a ceremony
for the report, praised China for its outstanding performance in
providing basic education nationwide, and pledged to offer further
assistance to China's poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The report's theme is "Education for All: Making the Right a
Reality". Its original was released by Carol Bellamy, executive
director of UNICEF, in London on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It says that more than 130 million children of primary school
age in developing countries, including 73 million girls, are
growing up without access to basic education.
</P>
<P>
China, which has a fifth of the world's children, needs to
continue its strong commitment to education for all and exercise
global leadership in improving education quality, Judd said,
emphasizing the need by children in poor ethnic-minority areas for
basic conditions, supplies, and good quality teaching, with
subjects that are relevant to their specific local conditions.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Continues to Rise in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A labor report released by
Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Friday shows that the
situation in the country's labor market was grim in the third
quarter this year and employment outlook for the fourth quarter
will still be poor.
</P>
<P>
The report says demand for labor weakened considerably, total
employment shrank for the two quarters in a row, job losses
increased and retrenchment slowed down slightly in the third
quarter in line with the contraction in economic activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, total employment declined by
20,268 or one percent in Singapore in the quarter and this was the
second consecutive fall in employment following the decline of
5,863 or 0.3 percent in the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 4.5 percent
in September from 2.3 percent in June, reflecting difficulty in
securing jobs among graduates who entered the labor market in the
middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,633 workers were retrenched in the third quarter,
bringing to a total of 21,073 the number of workers retrenched in
the first nine months of the year.
</P>
<P>
An MOM official said the figure of laid-offs in the third
quarter was lower than the 7,309 fired in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
But this moderation in retrenchments does not necessarily
reflect an improvement in the labor market as firms may continue
to freeze or cut their recruitment of new staff in view of the
slowdown in demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of job vacancies plunged to a new low of 15,465 in
September, 65 percent below the 44,614 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The report finally says that the employment outlook for the
fourth quarter of 1998 remains poor especially in the
manufacturing sector and the MOM has formulated a four-prong
strategy for re-deployment of displaced workers, renewal of
workers, realignment of employment practices and revitalization of
employment creation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) should increase reforms in its cadre appointment system and
its campaign against corruption in its development work next year,
according to Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu underlined the need for development to be carried out in
line with the spirit of the Fifth Party Congress, the general
program of the CPC Central Committee for next year's work, and the
CPC general statement that the Party needs to be managed with
strict discipline.
</P>
<P>
The CPC should study Deng Xiaoping theory further, focus on
building cadres' ranks, try to improve grass-roots party
organizations, and solve the more serious problems in party
building and development to provide a strong political and
organizational guarantee for next year's reforms and development,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hu told the heads of organization departments of the provincial
and autonomous regions and municipal party committees of the CPC
here today about the CPC's experience of the past 20 years, since
the third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee held in late
1978.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has made progress and accumulated valuable experience
in its work of Party building along with the great cause of
reform, opening up and modernization drive, which has provided new
topics and enrich new contents for the Party building, Hu said.

BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi
today asked domestic exporters to do everything possible to
increase exports and to work hard to explore the domestic market
in a bid to improve economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on trade and economic
cooperation, Wu Yi said the country's foreign trade sector faces
severe challenges next year because it has been severely affected
by the serious financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wu proposed that more local companies be allowed to export
their own products, and encouraged local manufacturers to process
their own materials overseas, that private producers be allowed to
export their own products, that exporting be diversified, that
large multinationals be used to help restructure the country's
foreign sector, and that exports of complete sets of Chinese
equipment be increased.
</P>
<P>
The main task for domestic trade next year is to increase
domestic demand and to explore the domestic market in both urban
and rural areas, Wu noted.

<HEADLINE> Half of S. Asia Population Lives in Poverty: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the
population in South Asia lives in severe poverty, earning less
than one U.S. dollar a day, said a report launched by UNICEF (the
United Nations Children's Fund) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, "The State of the World's Children 1999", said
child labor is a persistent problem, a cause and consequence of
low enrollment and high drop-out rates, it said.
</P>
<P>
Pupil-teacher ratios are high in some countries, greater than
60 to 1 in India, particularly in the early grades. Teacher
education and training need upgrading, and rural schools are often
remote and poor in quality, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Areas Education Project in Pakistan, which seeks
to improve education quality and accessibility in poor and
disadvantage areas, is training 720 teachers and establishing 10
pilot community schools, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, the Intensive District Approach to Education for
All (IDEAL) educates teachers about children's individual learning
patterns and promotes more child-friendly classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The report said that nearly two thirds of women in South Asia
are illiterate, compared with about one third of men. The gap
between girls' and boys' primary enrollment rates is over 10
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Discrimination is most severe in war-torn Afghanistan, where
the Taliban authorities have barred girls from school. In
Bangladesh, in contrast, the primary school attendance rate is 75
percent, with boys' and girls' rates on a par.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of children entering primary school drop out
in South Asia before reaching grade five, the highest regional
rate, the report said.

NANNING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Wu Bangguo, at a
gathering to mark the 40th anniversary of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in Nanning, its capital, today, asked the region
to accelerate development and improve the standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that members of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, south
China, have contributed to guarding China's territory and
sovereign integrity and to Chinese culture, and that Guangxi is
expected to make an effort to improve its regional ethnic autonomy
system and to maintain unity among ethnic groups and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
These are needed for Guangxi's economic and social development

</P>
<P>
He asked the region to cultivate more officials and talented
people in ethnic groups and encouraged them to play bigger role in

Wu also asked for resolute measures to deal with crimes like
smuggling and drug trafficking to create a stable and sound social

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. envoy and a
U.N. official met here Friday to coordinate efforts to reduce
regional tensions over Cyprus' decision to deploy Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Miller, the U.S. State Department's coordinator for
Cyprus and Dame Ann Hercus, the U.N. Resident Representative
refused to talk to reporters after their 90-minute meeting at the
U.S. Embassy in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Miller said in a statement on arrival Thursday that a solution
to the deployment of the Russian-made missiles ordered by Cyprus
may open ways to an overall solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the S-300 missile issue is an issue we are concerned
about... we are working with the Cyprus government on this issue
to find a solution that I think is mutually satisfactory," the
U.S. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were U.S. Ambassador Kenneth
Brill and British High Commissioner David Madden in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Miller will fly to Athens later Friday on his way to Istanbul,
Turkey, where he will join Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special
presidential envoy on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On December 12 -13 Holbrooke and Miller will participate in
a meeting of Greek and Turkish Cypriot businessmen, part of a
Holbrooke initiative to promote closer cooperation between the
Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
The two will fly to Athens on December 14 for talks with senior
Greek officials.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to boost its defense,
a move rejected by Turkey which has threatened to launch
preemptive strike on the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and other western countries have opposed the
purchase and were moving through diplomatic channels to achieve
the cancellation of the deployment of those missiles.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister Tenders Resignation for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan minister in charge of
privatization Matthew Rukikaire has tendered a resignation to
President Yoweri Museveni for his failure to properly supervise
the country's privatization process.
</P>
<P>
Rukikaire's resignation comes a day after a report by the
parliamentary select committee on privatization recommended his
sacking, along with three other ministers for corruption and
nepotism in the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua in a
telephone interview Friday morning that she does not know the
matter. However, Information Minister Basoga Nsadhu said later
that the resignation has been put on the president's desk.
</P>
<P>
"We know he has tendered a resignation and it is now on the
president's desk. We will announce the result tomorrow
(Saturday)," Nsadhu said.
</P>
<P>
A New Vision newspaper report said the government had
pressured the privatization minister to resign because he was
mainly responsible for the rampant corruption in the
privatization process of some key parastatals like Uganda
Commercial Bank (UCB) and Uganda Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh, Museveni's brother and former senior presidential
advisor on defense and security, admitted buying UCB through
illegal means over the weekend, raising the curtain for the
exposure of alleged corruption of some ministers.

<HEADLINE> China Outshines South Korea in Women's Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China outwitted South Korea as
Asia's two most powerful teams met here Friday in the 13th Asian
Games' women's volleyball preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese spikers had a good start in the first set when they
rushed ahead 4-0 against the old rivals but failed to keep the
momentum as the tough Koreans soon caught up with effective
blocks.
</P>
<P>
After levelled at 5-all, the Koreans began to overtake the
leading pace with solid defenses, fierce attacks and powerful
serves to reap the set 15-6.
</P>
<P>
The second set was a repitition of the first in the beginning
with the Chinese women establishing a 9-1 lead before being clawed
back point by point to 11-10.
</P>
<P>
At the critical moment, Zhu Yunying, the youngest of the team,
was fielded in by Chinese coach Lang Ping to replace veteran
setter He Qi.
</P>
<P>
The replacement proved effective, stimulating the Chinese to
varify their tactics with diversified strikes and eventually win
the set 16-14.
</P>
<P>
After winning the second, the Chinese women kept their top
forms with dominance over the net and sealed the match smoothly by
taking the following 15-5 and 15-8.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese coach Lang Ping was deeply impressed with the
tough performances of the Korean women, saying their fast rhythm
was difficult for the Chinese to catch up.
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard game today," Lang said after the victory, "But I
am quite satisfied with my players, though they were a little bit
slow in getting used to the Koreans' rhythm."
</P>
<P>
"The game is getting harder and harder, we have to prepare for
more difficult matches," she said.
</P>
<P>
In another women's volleyball match Friday, Thailand beat
Kazakhstan 3-0 and will meet China in the semi-final, while Japan,
as No. 1 in Pool A, will vie for a final spot against South Korea.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Seeks Funds to Help 22 Million Refugees in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is seeking 914.8 million
U.S. dollars to help 22 million refugees and other displaced
people world-wide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The funds we are asking for, around 11 cents per refugee per
day, can make a huge difference in the lives of the most
vulnerable people in the world," said Sadako Ogata, chief of UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
"Ongoing or renewed conflicts in Kosovo, the Caucasus, the
Great Lakes region, West Africa and other areas are complicating
humanitarian responses and prolonging human suffering," said Ogata.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR needed funds not only to look after refugees forced to
flee their homes because of violence and persecution, but also to
help those returning to areas devastated by war and facing dim
prospects for rebuilding their lives.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said that the nature of UNHCR's work required both
predictability and flexibility of funding. "We need to know early
where we stand to avoid interruption of life-saving activities,
and we must have the flexibility to deploy resources where they
are needed most," she said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR relies almost exclusively on voluntary contributions,
which cover 98 percent of its annual expenditure.
</P>
<P>
If no new emergencies erupt in 1999, the refugee agency's
biggest operations will be in the former Yugoslavia (156 million
dollars), the Great Lakes region of Africa (98 million dollars),
East Africa and the Horn (96 million dollars) and West Africa (80
million dollars).

lines for the growth of Mongolia-China relations into the next
century.

leaders and parliamentarians of both countries has been formed and
the cooperation between the two parliaments have enhanced

<HEADLINE> Asian Visitors to Australia Fall Down Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia saw more than
150,000 fewer visitors coming to it between January and October
this year compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Other than the Asian financial crisis, immigration policy was
blamed for the dramatic downturn in the number of Asian visitors
and increased visa problems for British backpackers.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said Friday about 3.3
million visitors, mostly tourists, came to Australia between
January and October this year, compared to more than 3.45 million
visitors in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Visitors number from Southeast Asia dropped 18.6 percent while
those from Northeast Asia slumped 17 percent, although growth in
other markets helped to boost the figures.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from Australia's top tourism market, Japan, fell by 7
percent in the 10 months to October, while arrivals from Korea,
Indonesia and Malaysia declined by 76 percent, 45 percent and 24
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Task Force said immigration policy as well as the
Asian economic crisis was behind the decline.
</P>
<P>
The organization's chief executive Christopher Brown called for
an inquiry into the relationship between the Department of
Immigration and the inbound tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
"While the economic crisis in Asia is outside Australia's
control, it is hard not to draw the conclusion that a range of
decisions by Australian immigration officials are holding up the
recovery in tourism activity and costing Australian jobs," he told
reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the decision to charge some Asian visitors 50
Australian dollars (32 U.S. dollars) for visas had contributed to
the decline in tourist numbers.
</P>
<P>
British backpackers, he said, were now facing a nine-week wait
in London for working holiday visas.
</P>
<P>
Brown said tourism growth from the United Kingdom had stalled
at a time when the value of the Australian dollar against the
pound should see a boom in British visitors.
</P>
<P>
In more bad news for the local tourism industry, more
Australians were taking holidays overseas, particularly to
Southeast Asia and Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million Australians traveled overseas in the nine
months to September, up 7 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from other key tourist markets such as New Zealand and
the U.S. increased.
</P>
<P>
Visitors number from China, seen as a major future tourism
market for Australia, increased by 21 percent in the 10-month
period.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Tanzania Agree to Strengthen Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Tanzania
Friday agreed to strengthen existing bilateral ties by promoting
more trade and investments between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and Tanzanian President Benjamin William Mkapa at a
bilateral delegation meeting here, according to Malaysian Foreign
Ministry's Deputy Secretary-General Ghazzali Sheikh Abdul Khalid.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides expressed interest in strengthening relations in
the areas of economic, trade and investment. It is noted that
while Malaysia, in its current economic circumstances, has limited
capacity to invest in Tanzania, the opportunity for an increase
in trade is there and needs to be explored," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is interested in sharing Malaysia's experience in the
context of diverting and privatizing its private sector as the
African country is now embarking into such development, Ghazzali
Sheikh told reporters at a briefing after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ghazzali said Malaysia would explore the possibilities of
sourcing products from Tanzania, especially raw materials, while
Malaysia would seek to increase its export of palm oil and Proton
cars, among others, to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said this would be pursued under the agreement reached by
the leaders of both countries to strengthen existing bilateral
ties via promoting trade, economic and investment ties.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa arrived here earlier Friday for a three-day official
visit to Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government is
donating 61 million yen (458,646 U.S. dollars) worth of oral polio
 vaccine (OPV) to Myanmar for its fourth National Immunization
Days (NIDs), which are falling on Saturday and on January 17,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The donation will cover 260,000 vials for 2.6 million children
in Myanmar, according to a press release of the Japanese Embassy
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese non-governmental organization (NGO) is also donating
OPV and 23 other young Japanese donors, who are students, are
visiting Myanmar to acquire information on the effectiveness of
their donation as well as the health condition in the country, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has donated about 977,443 dollars worth
of OPV for NIDs in Myanmar from 1995 up to now and also provided
medical equipment worth 225,563 dollars to the country's National
Health Laboratory in 1996.

BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) and the China Aerospace Corporation will send up a
340-kg satellite on a Long Match IV rocket next year to explore
the environment in outer space.
</P>
<P>
The SJ-5 satellite will be used mainly to study the single
event upset (SEU), space incidents that can damage satellites or
other space craft computer systems.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese meteorological satellite FY-1 launched in September
1990 was affected by one such upset that rendered it inoperable
much earlier than was scheduled, according to a professor at CAS's
Center for Space Science and Applied Research.
</P>
<P>
China has used SJ-1 and SJ-4 satellites to study SEUs and to
look for ways to protect satellites by monitoring high energy
particles and other things in space, he says, and the SJ-5 will be
able to collect more data.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Hits Parts of Southern Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Unusual heat wave measuring
as high as 42-43 degrees Celsius hit some parts in Southern
Australia including Melbourne and Adelaide during the last couple
of days.
</P>
<P>
Melbourne recorded its second-highest December temperature this
century Friday, Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Ken
Dickinson told reporters. Melbourne reached 41.9 degrees at 2:55
p.m. local time Friday, while at Horsham and Warracknabeal in
Victoria state's west it peaked at 43 degrees.
</P>
<P>
And Victoria would face another hot day Saturday with an
expected top of 41 degrees before a cool change arrived, Dickinson
said.
</P>
<P>
A total fire ban has been declared for the whole of Victoria
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's high for Melbourne was the second hottest December
temperature this century behind the 42.1 degrees recorded in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Dickinson said a cool change was not expected to hit Melbourne
until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. Saturday and would bring the temperature
down to about 22 degrees for Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
The heat also kept the Metropolitan Ambulance Service (MAS)
busy with people collapsing across the city.
</P>
<P>
MAS duty team manager Wayne Butterfield said there had been
numerous cases throughout Melbourne, including some people
collapsing at the Presidents Cup golf at Royal Melbourne golf
course.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of them have been elderly people," Butterfield
said. "A lot of the elderly people live by themselves - they're
not well and they're frail and what they need is people to keep
regular checks on them."
</P>
<P>
In another large city Adelaide, South Australia state, elderly
people were advised to take special care as temperatures were
forecast to remain 42 degrees Celsius Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The South Australia's ambulance service said extreme heat was
believed to be a factor in the deaths of four elderly people who
collapsed in the street as the mercury reached almost 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
A 42-degree top Friday would give Adelaide its hottest December
day for more than 10 years.

BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan showed their depth
in canoeing by winning five out of seven gold medals in the final
day's competitions in Pattaya on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The other two gold medals went to Chinese women, who
clean-swept all three gold medals in the Hiroshima Games four
years ago but saw one slip off their hands in the K-1 500 meters
event.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, which were competing in their second Asian Games
after its independence, broke the original order of Asia's
canoeing by topping the medal standings with 8-3-0.
</P>
<P>
China, a dominant power before the former Soviet Union republic
returned to Asia, was second with 3-3-2. Uzbekistan finished
third with 1-4-4.
</P>
<P>
"With their economy returning to the right track, their
canoeing is gradually becoming as powerful as ever," said Wen Ye,
manager of Chinese national canoeing team.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese had expected that they could bagged all the three
golds in the women's events, but Zhou Yingjie failed to fulfill
the task in the fiecely-blowing wind which has hit the competition
since the Asian Games started.
</P>
<P>
Chinese national coach Xu Jusheng attributed Zhou's defeat to a
lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
"She is only 19," Xu said. "It's hard for a youngster to deal
with such a difficult situation. But she has a lot of potential, I
hope she can make a breakthrough for China at the 2000 Olympic
Games."
</P>
<P>
China has never won a medal of any kind at the Olympic Games.
The fourth place in the Atlanta Olympics was their women's best
finish.
</P>
<P>
"For the men, to enter the final eight at the Olympics will be
not bad," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Meng Guanliang, winner of the men's C-1 1,000 meters on
Thursday, led the first 350 meters in the C-1 500m event before
his boat turned upside down in the Prachan Reservior at Pattaya.

BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution indexes for some
major cities in north and northwest China increased over the past
week, indicating heavier pollution, according to the weekly report
issued by the China Environment Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the polluted air in the cities to unfavorable
weather conditions. Although light rain and snow in the north
during the early part of the last week helped reduce pollutants in
the air, low wind speeds in the latter part of the week were
unfavorable for dispelling pollutants.
</P>

Lanzhou, Xining and Hohhot reported serious air pollution, with
high levels of suspended particles. Lanzhou has now suffered
from serious pollution for the past three straight weeks.

retrenchment, declaring the restraining order "misplaced and
uncalled for."
</P>
<P>
According to PAL, the NLRC also upheld PAL management's right
to implement the retrenchment program, especially at a time when
the airline's very existence was at stake in the midst of the
financial turmoil it was undergoing.
</P>
<P>
In supporting the initial complaint of the Flight Attendants
and Stewardess Association of the Philippines (FASAP), Labor
Arbiter Mayor had directed PAL to set aside its notice of
retrenchment to around 1,400 cabin crew members and restore them
to their previous positions.
</P>
<P>
PAL had appealed the order, arguing that the labor arbiter
overstepped his bounds since the Labor Code does not empower him
to issue preliminary injunctions -- only the NLRC itself is
authorized to issue such writs.

<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- As close neighbors, China and
Mongolia enjoy favorable conditions to boost economic and trade
co-operation which also offers huge potential, said Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji when meeting with visiting Mongolian President
Nachagyn Bagbandy here today
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic and trade relations present a sound
development trend, he said, citing the fact that such bilateral
trade volume reached 250 million US dollars last year and that
China has maintained its position as Mongolia's second largest
trade partner.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to cooperate with Mongolia in various sectors
and hopes that both sides will adopt a long-term perspective to
drive co-operation forward on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The premier also thanked the Mongolian government for its
support on issues concerning Taiwan and Tibet. Since the
normalization of relations in 1989, bilateral co-operation has
witnessed rapid progress through the concerted efforts of both
governments and peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Bagbandy also expressed satisfaction over the smooth
growth of bilateral ties, explaining that developing relations with
China is a key principle of his country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said it would continue to observe relevant treaties and
documents already reached and make efforts for the development of
even better bilateral ties taking the two countries on a
roller-coaster of good fortune into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy warmly thanked the Chinese government for its
assistance to Mongolia over the past years. He said that Mongolian
business people were always keen to conduct business in China,
expressing the hope both governments would care for and promote
the implementation of related projects of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, meanwhile, said he was happy to notice that Mongolia has
achieved a lot in the past few years despite the obstacles on its
way forward. China believes and sincerely hopes that the Mongolian
people, under the leadership of president Bagbandy, will achieve
much in developing the economy and upgrading their living
standards.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed the guests on China's domestic economic
situation as well as the continuing reform and opening

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Long term and stable relations
between China and Mongolia will be the cornerstone of the two
countries' cooperation in the 21st century said China's president
Jiang Zemin today in a meeting with Mongolian president Nachagyn
Bagbandy who is here for a six day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged his Mongolian counterpart to join with China
in cementing mutual trust and friendship on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
During the talks the two leaders also examined international
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Bagbandy on his first state visit to
China since he assumed the presidency in June last year, Jiang
pointed out that China and Mongolia share long common borders and
reminded him that there is a deep traditional friendship between
the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries normalized their relations in 1989,
bilateral friendly cooperation in various fields including
politics, trade, culture and education have enjoyed a rapid growth
with remarkable achievements, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He cited the bilateral treaty on friendship and cooperation
signed between the two countries in 1994, which, in Jiang's words,
laid a firmer political and legal foundation for further
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been great changes in the international
situation in recent times, Jiang confirmed that China has always
been aware of and paid attention to its friendship and cooperation
with Mongolia, believing that it is in the fundamental interest of
the two peoples and conducive to regional peace, stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
He explained that China constantly has a positive attitude
over Mongolia's own appreciation of China's "one China" stance in
terms of its lawful and justifiable territorial claims.
</P>
<P>
China, said Jiang, has also always appreciated the priority
given by Mongolia to its ongoing friendship with its two big
neighbors China and Russia, believing that it is in the interest
of all countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that during this visit, the two sides will
issue a joint statement which will be recognised internationally
as another important document for guiding bilateral relations and
will dictate the development direction of continued and further
bilateral ties.

<P>
Jiang pointed out that both China and Mongolia, two developing
neighbors, are conducting many serious and necessary economic
reforms while also facing the common task of developing their
economies and raising the living standards of their respective
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic and trade cooperation in the past few years
have continued to expand thanks to the sterling joint efforts of
the two sides, and China has been Mongolia's second largest trade
partner for a number of years, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that both sides have good political relations and a
common aspiration for cooperation, Jiang said that so long as the
two sides make joint efforts to honestly and openly follow the
principles of equality and reciprocity to explore new cooperative
ways suited to their own conditions, bilateral economic and trade
relations should move ahead in leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
On the Asian financial situation, Jiang said that there have
emerged some new unstable elements in Asia, and that the crisis
has brought about unfavorable impacts on the region's economic
development and political and social stability.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Asia's general situation is good,
and peace and development are still the region's mainstream
life-force.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that in his view, from a middle- and
long-term perspective, Asia, especially east Asia, will continue
to be the most vigorous and hopeful region in the world.
</P>
<P>
He was pleased, he added, that faced with the financial crisis
on its doorstep, the Chinese government had adopted a highly
responsible attitude and made significant contributions to easing
the crisis and safeguarding regional stability.
</P>
<P>
China will join all Asian nations in making positive efforts
for a lasting stability, prosperity and development of the region,
Jiang emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Bagbandy said that the Mongolian government also
attaches great importance to its relations with China and is keen
on furthering them, believing that through this visit, the two
will enjoy continually fruitful and long lasting friendship,
making them important partners into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the historically smooth development of
bilateral relations, confirming that the joint statement to be
issued will be a vitally important document, because it will be a
true guide to the development of bilateral friendly ties in the
21st century.

Next year will be the fifth anniversary of the bilateral treaty
on friendship and cooperation and the 50 anniversary of bilateral
diplomatic ties, which will see Mongolia host grandiose
celebrations to progress relations even further and in an all
encompassing manner.
</P>
<P>
Outlining Mongolia's pro-active foreign policy, Bagbandy
reiterated that his country will give priority to the development
of its friendship with China and Russia, and is delighted with the
improvement and advancement of Sino-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the once contentious border issue between
Mongolia and China has long been consigned to the waste bin of
history and Mongolia is now utterly satisfied with this peaceful
and friendly border. He went on to add that he hoped both sides
could make joint efforts to create even better conditions for the
development of border areas and adopt measures to crack down and
eventually eliminate crimes such as smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy stated that Mongolia's position on the Taiwan question
is most emphatically clear-cut, holding that Taiwan is an integral
part of China and stressing that the government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing
the whole of China.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia supports China's principle of "one China, two systems"
and "peaceful reunification", and opposes Taiwan's wrongful
insistence on independence and its misguided and impertinent
attempt to re-join the United Nations, Bagbandy stressed.
</P>
<P>
He went on to point out that Mongolia also does not recognize
the "Dalai government-in-exile"; does not allow Dalai to conduct
any political activity in Mongolia, and has repeatedly refused
Dalai's applications for visits to Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his deep and warm satisfaction with the smooth
growth of bilateral economic and trade cooperation in the past few
years and an appreciation for China's sincere assistance to
Mongolia, Bagbandy said he hoped to further expand bilateral
exchanges in various aspects including economy, trade, culture and
education.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Mongolia supports an early access to the
World Trade Organization for China, and spoke highly of China's
policy for not devaluating the yuan during the current Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony for
Bagbandy.
</P>
<P>
Later, the two presidents attended a ceremony during which they
signed five documents including an agreement on economic and
technological cooperation between the two governments.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Biggest Fertilizer Factory Incurs Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chittagong Urea Fertilizer
Factory, the biggest fertilizer producer in Bangladesh, has
incurred a loss of about 2.5 billion taka (51.5 million U.S.
dollars) in the past 24 months due to frequent suspension of
production caused by shortages of gas, The Financial Express
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation
(BCIC) were quoted as saying that the factory needs an additional
supply of 17 million cubic feet of gas per day, but its supplier
Petrobangla, the country's national petroleum corporation, could
not meet the demand because it is receiving a small supply from
the Sangu Gas Field.
</P>
<P>
So Petrobangla has turned down BCIC's request for additional
supply of gas, forcing it to suspend the production at the
fertilizer factory.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only discouraging for the foreign investors in the
energy sector but also to the fertilizer industry," the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
BCIC's daily demand of gas for its fertilizer industry is about
184 million cubic feet per day, out of which Petrobangla supplies
about 158.5 million cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
The total demand of gas for the fertilizer sector in December
is estimated at about 282 million cubic feet per day, of which
Petrobangla will supply about 219 million cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong factory was out of production for over 13 months
during the past two years, which has caused colossal damage to the
sophisticated machinery of the plant.
</P>
<P>
The factory last suspended production on December 2 on the
advice of the BCIC. On December 8, the BCIC again directed the
factory to stop production by December 9.
</P>
<P>
The production target of the factory during the fiscal year
from July 1998 to June 1999 was fixed at 550,000 tons. Because of
suspension of production, the country might face a shortage of
urea in the rice-growing season, they feared.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China's central government
plans to increase aid for the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
with the improvement of China's comprehensive national strength.
</P>
<P>
The government released the news in a letter from the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, and the Central Military Commission congratulating the
region on its 40th anniversary of founding.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Guangxi has developed remarkably since
1958, its economic and social conditions have greatly improved,
its unity has been strengthened, and the standard of living raised.
</P>
<P>
The region's steady growth, they said, has contributed greatly
to China's reforms, opening up and modernization and has helped
guarantee national security.
</P>
<P>
The letter attributed these achievements to the efforts of
ethnic groups in the region, local CPC committees, local
governments and military personnel, and aid from the central
government, and other provinces, regions and cities.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth shows the importance of adhering to the
leadership of the Communist Party, taking the road of socialism
with Chinese characteristics, and the regional ethnic autonomy
system, it said, and emphasized the importance of economic
growth, the reforms, and opening up.
</P>
<P>
China is going through a very important period for its reforms,
opening up and modernization, they said, and the region should
strive for greater achievements based on its past successes for a
brighter future for itself and the country.

</P>
<P>
Dealers said banks, which have seen the largest gains through

<HEADLINE> 57 Detained Bank Chiefs Granted Bail in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-seven Nigerian bank
chiefs held in police custody in the last 26 months without trial
have been granted bail by the Lagos High Court.
</P>
<P>
Justice Olugbani of the court granted them bail Thursday,
each in the sum of 50,000 Naira (about 580 U.S. Dollars) with two
sureties in the like sum, The Post Express newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He ruled on their bail application, saying that "in view of
the liberty of the detainees which is being jeopardized by the
continued detention without trial, I hereby grant each of them
bail in the sum 50,000 Naira."
</P>
<P>
The detained bankers who were alleged by the Nigerian Deposit
Insurance Corporation to have committed financial crimes against
their various banks had been held in police custody without
trial.
</P>
<P>
The matter came up for hearing on November 30 this year after
Nigerian police defied the court's earlier order to produce the
detainees in court or show cause why they should not be released.
</P>
<P>
Following the hearing, Justice Olugbani gave the police and
the Attorney-General of the government who are defendants in the
suit the last opportunity to defend the suit.
</P>
<P>
The matter came up thrice for adjudication after the order was
made but on each hearing date, the respondents neither failed to
show up nor offer any explanation as to why the applicants were
still being detained despite the court's order, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Olugbani observed that none of the respondents
including the Inspector General of Police had deemed it necessary
to file their defense in the suit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the first oil
refinery in Mongolia will begin early next year in a joint venture
with China's Huafu Industrial Company.
</P>
<P>
Officials from China and Mongolia today in Beijing signed the
contract worth 39.7 million US dollars to build the site and
jointly extract oil in the Dzuunbayan area in southeast Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts are for the annual extraction of a million tons of
oil with a refining capacity of 500,000 tons. The other 500,000
tons will be exported to China. The first oil is expected in
October next year.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Huafu Industrial Company in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province and Oyuni Undraa Suubba Company of
Mongolia said that they expected production to begin in October
next year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese company will have a 70 percent stake in the new
"Zuunbayan Refinery."
</P>
<P>
Song Yuzhong, chairman of Huafu's board of directors, told
Xinhua that work will begin on the site next February using
Chinese equipment, expertise and personnel.

<HEADLINE> EU Summit Held for Employment Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is set to
map out its next employment strategy when its heads of state and
government meet here on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the inauguration of the single currency in three weeks,
the 15-nation union are determined to push for more jobs to boost
social stability as well as economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel said in his formal
invitation to the summit that the aim of the summit was to give a
further strong boost to common European efforts to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
He added that the fact that the EU had created 1.3 million new
jobs in 1998, as against the one million by the United States in
the same period, showed that the European economic model was
thriving.
</P>
<P>
EU-wide unemployment rate dropped for the first time in six
years to below 10 percent in September this year and remained at
9.8 percent or equivalent to 16.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
Though Germany and France urged the European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation union, to work out the union's
employment strategy, Commission President Jacques Santer preferred
not to go that direction this time around.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman disclosed just before the summit that
the leaders will examine a tentative partial quantification which
requires that 20 percent of the unemployed in the union will be
offered training and similar measures.
</P>
<P>
These measures are designed to help youth and adults find jobs
before reaching six and 12 months of unemployment respectively.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate for people under the age of 25 were 19.1
percent in the European Union and 21.1 percent in the euro
zone.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Proposes Elections on March 31, 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala Friday recommended that the king dissolve the
parliament for elections on March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the prime minister's private
secretariat said that the move was taken according to a decision
of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Koirala also submitted to the royal palace the resignations
tabled by ministers of the Communist Party of Nepal
(Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which decided Thursday to pull out of
the coalition with Nepali Congress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 62 members of parliament from the CPN-ML and the
party's supporters have gone to the royal palace to request for a
special session of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the party and its supporters are planning to
table a no-confidence motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML asked its eight ministers, two state ministers and
three assistant ministers to resign en masse Thursday, alleging
that its ruling partner Nepali Congress had failed to implement
the agreements reached with it and other left parties in August.
</P>
<P>
The agreements focus on such issues as the law and order
situation in Nepal, withdrawal of Indian troops from Kalapani of
far-western Nepal, reviewing of the controversial 1950 Indo-Nepal
Friendship Treaty and holding of general elections in a free and
just manner.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML issued a sternly-worded ultimatum on November 17,
threatening to pull out of the government if the agreements were
not enforced by December 1.
</P>
<P>
Later it agreed to extend the deadline as Koirala requested for
more time to work out a solution.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post said Friday that the CPN-ML took the sudden
move because Koirala refused to sack Inspector-General of Police
Achyut Krishna Kharel and induct five more CPN-ML MPs into the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
After helping the minority government of Nepali Congress get
passed in parliament the policies and programs and budget for
fiscal 1998/99 starting in July, the CPN-ML joined the government
in late August.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML threw its weight behind the Nepali Congress
government after the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) withdrew its support.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the CPN-ML, which broke away from
the CPN-UML in March, does not want to see the government fall for
new elections, because it needs time to reorganize itself.
</P>
<P>
But CPN-ML General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam said recently that
his party was ready for new elections.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition CPN-UML has been pushing for immediate
elections.

<HEADLINE> Transfer of Power Issues Pivotal Before Macao's Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Before Macao's handover next
year, solutions must be found to major issues relating to the
transfer of power between China and Portugal, a senior Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Macao Branch of the Xinhua News
Agency, pointed out that China is paying particular attention to the
localization progress of Macao's principal civil servants and
judicial officials.
</P>
<P>
Such issues as the transfer of the Macao government's assets
and archives, and the funds for public servants' old-age pensions
are also important for the smooth operation of the Macao Special
Administrative Region government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang made these remarks during the "Issues on Macao's Handover"
symposium, which was jointly sponsored by the Department of
Publicity of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the
General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army, and several other government . The symposium was attended by
more than 1,200 senior officials from the Party, the government
and the army.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that key issues also include the participation of
local people in handover affairs and the promotion of Macao's
political stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's greater national strength and the concept
of "one country, two systems" are the major factors leading to the
return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland before the end of
the century.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Increase Domestic Demand in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China will further increase
and expand domestic demand and invest more in fixed assets to
assure rapid and sustained growth of the economy, according to a
senior official.
</P>
<P>
These step will be taken to offset the negative influence on
economic growth brought on by declining export demand because of
the deepening Asian financial crisis, Zeng Peiyan, minister in
charge of the State Development Planning Commission, said here
today at a national planning meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to implement active fiscal policies
and appropriate currency policies to maintain the momentum of
growing investment, speed up adjustments to the investment
structure, and raise investment quality and profits next year.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to reconstruction in the wake of last
summer's flooding, harnessing lakes and rivers, and the
installation of water-control facilities. Efforts will be made to
consolidate the construction of basic facilities and support the
domestic production of major technical equipment and high-tech
industrial projects, Zeng said, adding that overlapping redundant
construction will be strictly banned.
</P>
<P>
Zeng emphasized that China will further expand its domestic
consumer market and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of China's economy will reach or come
near the target of eight percent for this year, and price rises
are expected to remain moderate, he forecast.
</P>
<P>
The country's total grain output in 1999 is expected to surpass
that of this year, and this year's foreign investment will
continue to rank first among developing countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Aging Oilfields Still Productive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Aging oilfields in China's
eastern regions will continue to be major sources of oil in the
early part of the next century, with annual output forecast at 115
million tons by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The dozen or fields include Daqing, Shengli, Liaohe, Huabei,
Dagang, Jilin and Zhongyuan, which currently pump out 90 percent
of China's annual crude oil.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the year 2000 Daqing, Shengli and
Liaohe, three of the largest oilfields in China, will stabilize
their outputs at 53 million tons, 26.5 million tons and 15.5
million tons, resectively.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the annual outputs of the Huabei, Dagang and
Jilin fields will reach around five million tons each. Last year
the Jiangsu Oilfield in east China's Jiangsu Province produced one
million tons, a figure Chinese oil experts expect to be beaten by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Other fields in the eastern part of the country such as
Zhongyuan, Henan and Jianghan also report an increase in
production levels.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Tianxiang, a senior expert with the China
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), despite an ongoing drop in
production, the fields involved are forecast to maintain a
relatively good output into the first twenty years of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the older oilfields in eastern China,
mainly Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe, have succeeded in controlling
the rate of decline to within 14 percent by taking a series of
effective measures, including stablizing oil levels by injecting
water into the wells.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prospecting in the fields has been accelerated to
increase the production capacity to 64 million tons, which has
effectively, although relatively, maintained the output levels.
</P>
<P>
Li announced that by the year 2000 China expects its onshore
oil output to reach between 145 million and 150 million tons, with
29.5 million tons of that total coming from the newly developed
fields in the western and central parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
And he confidently predicted that China's offshore oil
production will maintain its fast growth, with annual output
forecast at 16 million tons by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Faced with declining oil prices worldwide this year, China has
managed to reduce the negative effects by reducing imports of
crude oil and related finished oil products, increasing the
domestic oil supply for foreign-funded enterprises and cracking
down on illegal oil imports
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's petroleum industry has been
dramatically re-shaped to help it become more market oriented.

<HEADLINE> China Now Major Oil Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- By the turn of the century,
China will have verified oil reserves totaling 2.5 billion to 3
billion tons and is planning to pump 150 million tons of oil and
25 billion cu m of natural gas a year.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach these targets, the Chinese oil industry is to
launch a series of eight massive research and technology projects
as well as complete 32 technological developments.
</P>
<P>
This now means that China has become a major figure in the
world's petroleum science and research sector as well as in
production, according to senior oil expert Li Tianxiang.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is head of The Petroleum Scientific and
Technological Commission under the China National Petroleum Corp
(CNPC), said that China, which last year in Beijing hosted the
bi-annual World Petroleum Congress (the 15th) for the first
time, has made a major contribution to the world's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
This, he added, was because it had developed a successful
continental petroleum geology program as a result of decades of
research.
</P>
<P>
Over the years this has enabled China to discover 27 large
oilfields with reserves of more than 100 million tons each, such
as those at Daqing in the Northeast and Renqiu in the North.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has developed an efficient oil extraction
technology, was extremely proficient in other techniques such as
stabilizing oil reserves by water injection and in using the
polymer-drive extraction method.
</P>
<P>
Other major oilfields like Shengli, Liaohe, Zhongyuan, Huabei,
and Daqing in the Bohai Bay area have developed a continual
exploration technology, which has helped prove oil reserves of
7.28 billion tons and ensured annual crude output of 61 million
tons, making the Bay the second largest oil and gas production
base after Daqing, China's largest oil complex.
</P>
<P>
In the exploration of complex oil layers, Chinese engineers
have devised a thermodynamic technology to explore heavy crude oil
reserves; this has been mainly by the use of steam which has
enabled the annual extraction of 12 million tons of heavy crude
oil, the fourth largest output in the world.

CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar defied

<HEADLINE> SDB Merges With China Investment Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The China State Development
Bank (SDB) has announced that beginning today, the
China Investment Bank (CIB) will be merged into the SDB, with the SDB
assuming all of the CIB's creditor's rights and liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The merger has been ratified by the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SDB said that this is the first merger
within China's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"The merger is an integration of the advantages of two banks,
which is quite different from takeovers or acquisitions of
financial institutions in the past due to mismanagement
or insolvency," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the merger, the CIB will continue its
businesses as usual and there will be no damage to any client's
interest.
</P>
<P>
"The merger is beneficial for reinforcing credit management and
improving credit asset quality," he added.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1994, the SDB is China's largest policy-oriented
bank, and over the past four years it has made great contributions
to the development of the national economy by supporting key
construction projects in infrastructure, basic industries and
pillar industries. At present, it has total assets worth 500
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The CIB was founded in 1981 with 29 branches and a highly
competent professional staff.
</P>
<P>
The merger enables the SDB to fully leverage the network of the
CIB, sharply increase the credit management force, and effectively
improve asset quality, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
After the merger, the CIB will retain its original name and
will apply for a capital market business license from the China
Securities Regulatory Commission in order to function as an
investment bank. It will also be restructured, and will maximize
its stock assets in order to eventually be able to raise funds
for the state's key industry and construction projects solely from
the market.

<P>
TOKYO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo on
Friday with the key Nikkei index briefly slipping below 14,400 for
the first time in more than three weeks, following an overnight
tumble on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 402.16 points, or 2.72
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 14,405.64, after moving
between 14,382.06 and 14,729.95.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 21.62 points or 1.90 percent to
1,118.16.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section more than doubled to about 787
million shares from Thursday's 360.41 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling on Wall Street Thursday was partly attributed to
growing concern about deflationary pressures on the world economy,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Selling on the Tokyo market was also stirred by disappointment
with a plan by the Japanese government and the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) to cut national income tax by 20 percent
and local income tax by 15 percent in 1999, as the plan would
result in a tax increase for households with annual incomes of
less than 9 million yen (about 76,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far outpaced
gainers 942 to 248, with 111 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Leaders Asked to Enable Refugees Back Home in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, December 10 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana urged Bosnian leaders on Thursday to take their share of
responsibility for implementing the Dayton accord in 1999.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Sarajevo after his meeting with
top Bosnian leaders, Solana said that 90 percent of the
responsibility for the implementation of the Dayton accord falls
on the Bosnian people and their leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said that the major tasks in 1999 in Bosnia are to speed up
the repatriation of refugees, improve the administrative work and
restructure the police forces and judiciary system.
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-strong Stabilization Force (SFOR) will remain in
Bosnia for another six months and the reduction of SFOR troops
will be discussed afterward if the situation permits, said Solana,
who was on a one-day visit to Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Solana held talks with all the three members
of the Bosnia Joint Presidency -- the Croat Ante Jelavic, the
Moslem Alija Izetbegovic and the Serb Zivko Radisic.
</P>
<P>
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees figures show that there are
about 1.2 million refugees in Bosnia although the five-year war
ended in 1995 with the signing of the Dayton peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Shrugs off Israeli Mock Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Unruffled by Israeli
escalating mock air raids on Beirut and other cities, Lebanon's
anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerrilla group has said that it will not
respond to such a "political and psychological provocation."
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli act was aimed at lifting the morale of a military
reeling from fatal resistance blows," Hezbollah Secretary General
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said in an interview with the Daily Star
published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Iran, was leading a
guerrilla war in a bid to oust the Israeli-occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Last month, seven Israeli soldiers were killed in less than 10
days in the group's bombing ambushes in southern Lebanon where
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in 1985 to allegedly
protect its north.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli mounting death toll, which has reached 23 since
the start of this year, rekindled heated debate in Israel over
its military presence in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the past two consecutive days, Israeli fighter-bombers
swooped low over Beirut and other southern cities, breaking sonic
booms which rattled windows of buildings and sparked panic among
residents.
</P>
<P>
"Breaking the sound barrier is nothing new to us. It's been
happening for years," Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah leader denied that its operations in the south had
ebbed since November to avoid wide-scale Israeli retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"The patterns of resistance varies. Sometimes we lay traps for
them and wait for days before they fall into the ambush. Our
strategy is to strike whenever there's opportunity to do so," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that sometimes their operations are successful and
other times they are not.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of 1998, a total of 30 Hezbollah guerrillas
have been killed in conflicts with Israeli troops and its proxy
South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges to Fine-tune Exchange Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Friday its
present exchange control regulations will be maintained for the
time being, but pledged to consider measures to fine tune them.
</P>
<P>
The stand was conveyed to a group of foreign fund managers
operating in Malaysia by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
at a special closed-door briefing here Friday organized by the
newly-appointed financial advisor to the government, Salomon Smith
Barney, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long session, Mahathir consistently said the
exchange control measures adopted by Malaysia were short-term and
that they would be lifted once Malaysia is convinced that normalcy
is returning to the marketplace, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
The fund managers inquired if the one-year moratorium, which
Malaysia imposed on the foreign holding of Malaysian shares and
transfer of funds from September 1 this year, would be lifted, and
expressed concern that the prolongation of the ruling would have
an adverse effect on fresh capital investment, the news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also briefed the fund managers that Malaysia took
pride in consistency and predictability, and that the country's
rapid growth was dependent on foreign direct investment while
foreign portfolio investment was relatively new.
</P>
<P>
He also told the fund managers that there was a need to bar
excessive speculation in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange market
and to prevent unethical practices and wanted to see the KLSE
reflecting fundamental values.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted Yeo Kar Peng, director and chief representative
of Salomon Smith Barney, Malaysia as saying on the overall the
fund managers are "pretty satisfied with Malaysia's policy
direction."

<HEADLINE> New U.S. Research Network Created for Chip Industry Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A new national research
network to conduct cutting-edge projects that are critical to the
growth of U.S. technology industries has been created, the
country's Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The network, comprising the federal government, semiconductor
industry and 14 prestigious universities, will lead to the
creation of six national Focus Centers that will sustain 60
million U.S. dollars per year in new research activities.
</P>
<P>
Over a 10-year period, the program is expected to channel more
than 600 million dollars into the research universities including
the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford, MIT and
Princeton.
</P>
<P>
Contracts for the first two Focus Centers, focusing on design,
test and interconnect research, have been awarded to a network of
universities from seven states. Both centers will investigate
technological challenges, including industry technologies needed
over the next 15 years and critical issues that must be resolved
in order to maintain the chip industry's historic pace of
innovation.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the design and test research refers to software
programs used to create chips as well as the testing of
semiconductor components to ensure circuit work
correctly. Interconnect research will address the wiring that
connects the millions of transistors on a microchip.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the research centers will come from SIA member
companies, a consortium of U.S. semiconductor suppliers and the
Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
In addition to funding research, the Focus Center program will
provide new monies for faculty and student salaries, equipment and
upgrading university research facilities.
</P>
<P>
The tiny microchip drives virtually all electronics
products. Even the Internet is, in reality, a world wide web of
semiconductors. In the mid-1990s, semiconductors also started
driving the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
According to SIA statistics, the semiconductor industry has
surged from the 17th largest industry to become the largest
manufacturing industry in the United States. In 1996, the chip
industry created 41.6 billion dollars of value for the
U.S. economy -- 20 percent more than the motor vehicle parts and
accessories industry. SIA expects the U.S. chip market to surpass
61.46 billion dollars in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Tax Collection Down Despite Logging Yield in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian government
collection in logging revenue has dropped more than 60 percent
this year as compared with the previous year, despite a harvest of
 millions of dollars worth of trees.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of 1998, the government collected less
than 5 million U.S. dollars in logging taxes, according to a
Finance Ministry draft budget. In 1997, the government collected
12.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
And it seems realistic for the government to realize its plan
to collect 19 million U.S. dollars in 1999, the Cambodia Daily
quoted an environmental watchdog as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Agriculture Minister Chhea Song, who oversees the
forest industry, defended the government's performance and its
projections for next year.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, there is lower income because of unstable political
situation, while some companies have not operated their
concessions," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Chhea Song said, the government will seek to increase
the tax on tree cut by concessionaires from 14 to 54 U.S. dollars
per cubic meter. It will also allow only about 400,000 cubic
meters of trees to be harvested, he said.
</P>
<P>
World Bank-funded technical assistance teams estimated that
more than 4 million cubic meters of trees were harvested in the
last dry season, more than 90 percent of it illegally. They said
no more than 500,000 cubic meters should be cut in a year if
sustainability is to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Widespread concern about Cambodia's logging operations, coupled
with corruption which prevents the government from collecting full
revenue from timber, have led to cutbacks in aid to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen has vowed to take severe measures to
prevent illegal logging, including using the military to crack
down on illegal loggers.
</P>
<P>
It was said there were 30 timber companies in Cambodia, but
only a small number of them operated in accordance with the law
and regulations.

<HEADLINE> China's Biggest Chemical Fertilizer Maker to Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sichuan Lutianhua Group
Co., China's biggest chemical fertilizer producer, will set up a
subsidiary for raising fund on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the State Administration of Petroleum
and Chemical industries, the subsidiary will issue 100 million A-
shares, shares issued to Chinese investors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the parent corporation, also one of the
country's 18 chemical industry producers in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, had total assets worth 1.75 billion yuan at the
end of 1997, with an assets-to-debt ratio of 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Lutianhua Group made 116 million yuan in profits and turned
out 748 million yuan worth of products last year.
</P>
<P>
Money raised from the issue will mainly be used for new
projects, technical upgrading and enlarging the corporation, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
China's chemical industry had 50 listed companies by March of
this year, which had raised 15 billion yuan through issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say that the listing of state-owned chemical
industrial enterprises can provide plenty of money for the
enterprises and greatly sharpen their competitive edge.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Launch 2nd Stock Exchange Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's second stock exchange
will start operation soon in the federal capital Abuja, Nigerian
Minister of Finance Alhaji Usman has said.
</P>
<P>
Usman told reporters in Abuja Thursday that all arrangements
have been made to this effect and that the board of the Abuja
Stock Exchange will be constituted soon.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a second stock exchange has been resisted by the
Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) in Lagos, the old capital and
traditional commercial center.
</P>
<P>
But the authorities argued that with the relocation of the
capital from Lagos to Abuja, the national economic weight would
also be moving towards Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Friday quoted Usman as saying that a
high-powered Nigerian delegation sent to discuss debt relief and
debt rescheduling with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
World Bank and Paris Club has returned to Nigeria "very hopeful
of a good result."
</P>
<P>
He also called for a higher allocation for debt service in the
1999 budget, rather than the two billion Naira (23.5 million U.S.
Dollars) in the past budgets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met
here today with Lyonpo Jigme Thinley, foreign minister of the
Kingdom of Bhutan, who is leading a delegation attending the
China-Bhutan 12th round of border negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the two peoples have had close contact since ancient
times and have enjoyed harmonious relations since then, even
though the two countries have not yet formed formal diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Chinese government is grateful for the
support given to China by the Bhutanese government on such issues
as human rights, Tibet and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the China-Bhutan agreement on maintaining peace and
tranquility along the border area, the first-ever pact between
the two governments, will have significant and far-reaching
impact for both countries.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement also will play a positive role for
the development of Sino-Bhutanese good-neighborly friendly
relations, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China has always believed that every nation,
large or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, is a member of the
international community, and has the equal right to participate
in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"As a close neighbor of South Asia,
China is willing to solidify and strengthen equal and mutually
beneficial relations with all countries in the region on the basis
of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Thinley said that the two countries are closed linked with each
other across mountains and rivers with an everlastingly friendly
state-to-state and people-to-people relationship. Bhutan highly
appreciates the positive role played by China in the global arena and
international affairs, and is ready to deepen the existing
good-neighborly and friendly relations based on the five
principles of peaceful co-existence, he said.
</P>
<P>
He considers that the newly signed agreement fully demonstrates the
mutual trust and understanding between the two countries, and lays
a fine foundation for the consolidation and development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed the guests on China's economic situation, and
asked Thinley to extend sincere greetings to King Jigme Singye
Wangchuck on behalf of himself and Chinese president Jiang
Zemin. Thinley brought greeting and good wishes to President Jiang
and Premier Zhu on the king's
behalf.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Output Predicted to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Crop levels in the main tea
growing areas are expected to decline in the next few weeks
because of the prevailing dry weather, according to a report from
the African Tea Brokers (ATB).
</P>
<P>
It was sunny in the areas west of the Rift Valley including
Kericho, the country's tea capital, and only scattered afternoon
showers had been reported, the Daily Nation newspaper Friday
quoted the ATB report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Areas east of the Rift Valley had received moderate amounts of
rainfall and although days were warm, night temperatures remained
cold, said the report issued by the Mombasa-based ATB Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that tea crop levels could be affected unless
more rainfall was received.
</P>
<P>
The crop figure for October this year was 27.9 million
kilograms, an increase of 37.13 percent compared to 7.5 million
kgs in the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative figure now stands at 245.08 million kgs, 71.89
million kgs or 41.51 percent above the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Five sales were held during October when a total of 368,568
packages were sold at an average price of 1.58 U.S. Dollars,
compared to four sales in October, 1997, when 245,436 packages
were sold at an average price of 2.36 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan blenders were strong in all sales and Britain lent
good but selective support following quality. Other major buyers
are Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and other Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Tea and coffee currently are the main source of Kenya's
foreign exchange earners following the collapse of the tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 both commodities are auctioned in U.S. Dollars once
a week, ensuring a directly flow of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Prices of the two commodities have been good in the
international market for most of this year although prospects for
next year are not clear.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1998, a Hard Year for New Zealand (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has witnessed
1998 a hard year both economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
The country has been puzzled by an economical situation in
1998, with its gross domestic product (GDP) falling into recession
for the first time since 1992, and the government financial
surplus disappearing and its accounts dropping into the red again.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand had enjoyed brisk economic activity before 1998
with its GDP growing at an annual rate of between two and six
percent or even higher, the surplus in the government Budget
increasing, and the unemployment rate reducing. At the beginning
of the year, the government forecast with confidence that 1998
would see the GDP of the country growing at a rate of 2.8 percent
and a surplus of 1.3 billion New Zealand dollars (689 million U.S.
dollars) in its account book. But the fact is that it has failed
to attain all its expected targets.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the gloomy global economic outlook, the Asian
economic downturn in particular, the GDP of New Zealand registered
one percent contraction in the first quarter of the year,
followed by 0.8 percent fall in the second quarter. Manufacturing
activity in the second quarter was at its lowest level since the
third quarter of 1995, while activity in the primary industries
was at its lowest in over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand import and export volumes dropped by 1.2 percent in
the first half of the year, compared with the corresponding period
of last year. Its international payments deficit continues to
hover near record levels. The balance of payments deficit in the
year to June 1998 was 6.6 billion NZ dollars (3.5 billion U.S.
dollars) or 6.7 percent of the GDP. This was the worst annual
figure in the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The number of bankruptcies in the country have surged almost 22
 percent to a 10-year high. According to official figures, There
were 2,455 bankruptcies in the first three quarters of this year.
It is expected that the total number of bankruptcies this year
would exceed last year's record high of 2,658.
</P>
<P>
The economic contraction was also reflected in falling
employment. Official figures showed that the unemployment rate in
the second quarter was 7.7 percent, but fell to 7.4 percent in the
following quarter, showing the jobless people dropping to 138,000
from 143,000. However, many local economists attributed the fall
in unemployment in the third quarter entirely to a drop in the
number of people actively seeking work. They said the jobless
people had become discouraged and dropped out of the labor force.
But either government officials or local economists still believe
the unemployment rate will rise to 8.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, New Zealand has seen several dives in the sharemarket.
It hit a new five-year low on October 2 with the NZSE40 Capital
Index falling to 1,668 points, about 1,000 points lower from a
year ago. That meant the combined value of the 40 leading stocks
fell to 37 billion NZ dollars (19.62 billion U.S. dollars) from 60
billion NZ dollars (31.8 billion U.S. dollars). For the whole year
the NZSE40 Capital index has been rising or falling almost below
the mark of 2,000 points. The New Zealand dollar has also devalued
by more than 10 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Australia-New Zealand bank estimates, the Asian
economic crisis, which has caused sharp drops in Asian visitor
arrivals and investments in New Zealand and a reduction of 500
million NZ dollars (27 million U.S. dollars) in its exports to
Asian in the past year, has pulled the New Zealand GDP down 1.2
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the difficulties caused by the Asian economic
crisis, the New Zealand government has during the year been active
in expanding its traditional markets in Britain and other
countries in West Europe, the United States and Australia, while
opening up new markets in Latin America. It also announced a
series of "Policies for Progress" to stimulate the economic
activity, expand exports, promote tourism industry, and increase
migrants. The efforts have paid off. New Zealand exports have kept
growing since September. There are signs that the country's
economic activity has made positive growth in the second half of
the year and the country is emerging from recession. But for the
whole year, economic contraction will be unavoidable. The New
Zealand Treasury recently forecast the Economy would shrink by 0.9
percent for the current year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Poor economic performance has greatly weakened the financial
resources of the New Zealand government. Although the government
has twice cut its expenditures by 615 million NZ dollars (326
million U.S. dollars), it still can't prevent red figures from
appearing in the government accounts. A few days ago the
government forecast a financial deficit of 52 million NZ dollars
(27 million U.S. dollars) for the current year, instead of a
surplus of 1.3 billion NZ dollars as planned at the beginning of
the year. The current year's deficit would be followed by a
serious 1.3-billion-NZ-dollar (676 million U.S. dollars) deficit
in 1999-2000 and a one-billion-NZ-dollar (520 million U.S.
dollars) deficit in 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
Economic difficulties have caused political instability. 1998
has seen political turbulence in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Severe disputes on the sales of the government-owned shares in
the Wellington International Airport triggered the exchange of
open accusation between leaders of the National Party and NZ
First, who formed the Coalition government at the beginning of
the current administration in 1996. This led to the separation of
the association of the two ruling parties in August.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Coalition forced Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley to reorganize the government as a National-led Minority
government. The new government was established on sandy beach
since the votes that the ruling National Party could count on in
the 120-seat Parliament were reduced from 70 to 62, including 18
from independent MPs and MPs from small political parties.
</P>
<P>
Recently independent MP Deborah Morris announced that she would
quit Parliament from December 20. The resignation of New Zealand's
youngest MP, who chose to leave NZ First to which she owned her
seat when the Coalition government fell apart in August, would cut
the National-led Minority government's majority on confidence
issues to 61-59.
</P>
<P>
The polls in recent months show that the support rates for the
Labor Party always have been close to 50 percent. According to the
results of these polls, the Labor Party with its own votes plus
the votes it gets from minor parties that fail to obtain at least
five percent of the nationwide party votes would be able to
organize a single party government.
</P>
<P>
The results of the polls have made the Labor Party excited all
these months. The Party seems to be sure to win the next election.
It is said that the Party caucus has already secretly made
arrangement for the next Cabinet. For it all is ready except the
arrival of a date for the next election.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Party has been struggling for maintaining
its status as a ruling party. Taking the advantage of somewhat
recovery in economic activity and exports in the second half of
the year, Prime Minister Shipley has repeatedly told people that
the National-led government has guided New Zealand through serious
economic times caused by the Asian crisis and it is her Party that
is "the best party" to lead the nation into the next century.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Shipley released the seven goals and eight
strategic priorities of the New Zealand government for the next
three years. This indicates that Shipley-led government eyes for
making its way not only to the next November, but to another
three-year term for the administration of the country.
</P>
<P>
Viewing from the votes in the 120-seat Parliament, the National
Party now has only 61, including 17 from independent MPs and MPs
from minor political parties. It seems the present New Zealand
government is hanging on by its fingertips. In the case of
February's confidence vote the government would be brought down by
just one MP switching side. But up to now the 17 non-National MPs
have pledged their support to the government until the finish of
its term in next November.
</P>
<P>
1999 is an election year for New Zealand. Prime Minister
Shipley will face a great challenge in next February. It is still
too early to predict whether she will lead the government to tide
over the confidence-vote crisis and prevent a by-election. If she
succeeds, the new challenge facing her will be how to make proper
policies to stimulate the economic activity in the country and
ensure the people that the country has really got out of the
recession and has bright prospects for economic recovery. If the
National Party's popularity rises next year, it is difficult to
say who will be the owner of the Beehive to greet the new century.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka's Peace Process: A Bumpy Road Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- When leader of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Velupillai Prabhakaran voiced the
willingness to hold third party mediated peace talks in his
"Heroes Day" speech on November 26, it seems that there is at last
some light seen after the 15 blood-shedding years of war.
</P>
<P>
Considering Sri Lankan government's sustained peace efforts,
from both political and military angles, and the conditions the
LTTE attached to the future negotiation, however, one can only
foresee a bumpy road ahead to the lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's current People's Alliance (PA) government has been
seeking some political settlement with the LTTE since its
inauguration in 1994. The following move is the launch of a
comprehensive set of proposals of devolution, the very concept of
which constitutes the cardinal principle of the newly drafted
constitution.
</P>
<P>
With an aim to promote ethnic harmony, this political package
grants far reaching concessions to the ethnic Tamils, extending
wide power to the regional authorities and making appointments of
provincial governors on the recommendations of the provincial
chief ministers.
</P>
<P>
Deliberately as it is planned, the LTTE, who gets the most
consideration in the package, has totally rejected it. On the
other hand, the larger portion of the Sinhala community including
the powerful Buddhist clergy are opposed to it on the ground that
too much is being given to the Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government's inability to obtain support from
other political parties, especially the approval of the major
opposition party United National Party (UNP), made it hard for the
package to become law.
</P>
<P>
Despite the domestic setback of striking a political solution,
however, the Sri Lankan government has managed to acquire a
favorable international environment to solve the ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
India banned the LTTE in 1994, and the United States and Canada
declared it a terrorist organization in succession last year. Only
recently, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister's South Africa trip brought
an official denial of permitting LTTE to shift its so-call
international secretariat there.
</P>
<P>
The exploration of political means for peace haven't slackened
Sri Lankan government's military attempts to settle the national
conflict. After "Operation Jayasikuru" (Sure Victory) launched on
May 13, 1997, government troops recently assumed a new round of
attacks against the LTTE under "Operation Rivi Bala" (Sun Force).
</P>
<P>
Yet, the meager victories gained at the cost of heavy losses do
not promise military settlements feasible either. In fact, the
Defense Ministry was forced to call off the former operation
without achieving its main aim of establishing a land-based Main
Supply Route along A9 highway to Jaffna. For only a near two
thirds of the highway was recaptured after 18 months, with an
additional loss of Kilinochchi, an important county further north.
</P>
<P>
As to the latter operation, security forces are also facing the
daunting task to prevent Tamil rebels' infiltration and attacks
after they have brought an area of 134 square kilometers under
control.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the unceasing political and military pressure at
home and the worsening conditions abroad leave the LTTE no other
way out but to accept the government's call for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the preconditions for peace talks in Prabhakaran's
speech are more than what the government can accept. Prabhakaran's
call for third party mediation is in disparity with the stand of
the government which has only third party facilitation in mind.
</P>
<P>
Since the government has long considered the conflict
essentially an internal problem of Sri Lanka, it would be
unwilling to accept such a condition which opens the door to
internationalize the conflict, much to the detriment of Sri
Lanka's interests.
</P>
<P>
Then Prabhakaran's demand for a climate of peace and goodwill
created to hold peace talks makes the government, as well as
people at large, suspicious of his sincerity.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the previous blunder made by the government in
1994 of being dragged into long-drawn-out negotiations with the
LTTE on relatively trivial matters without addressing the real
issues has taught it a lesson of acting warily.
</P>
<P>
The government's hesitation so far to respond to Prabhakaran's
call for peace seems to show that it wants to be on the safe side
this time. Indeed, the hitherto witnessed fluctuating situation
between victory and failure in the battlefield, and between war
and peace on the negotiation indicates Sri Lanka's road to the
lasting peace is by no means smooth.

<HEADLINE> China to Regulate Trust, Investment Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) - China plans to overhaul and
consolidate the trust and investment sector because of
accumulating problems that have cropped up in the operations of
trust and investment firms.
</P>
<P>
A detailed draft on investigations into this matter has already
been prepared, some inefficient companies will be closed, and
the management of trust and investment firms will be tightened,
according to a central bank official.
</P>
<P>
Only two months ago, the central bank closed the Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp. (Gitic), the nation's
second largest trust and investment company. So far, four such
companies have been closed for the same reason: the inability to
meet maturing-debt obligations.
</P>
<P>
The failure of Gitic sounded another alarm for the nation's
trust and investment sector, indicating the urgent need to
consolidate this poorly regulated sector in order to protect
China's financial system.
</P>
<P>
One ranking official also said the government may close still
more inefficient trust firms to maintain financial stability.
</P>
<P>
China now has a total of 242 trust firms, with total assets
exceeding 460 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Slack internal controls, non-standard management systems, and
the lack of stable funding sources have combined to pose financial
problems for the trust firms, said a central bank official.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, trust firms are far from being managed
independently since local governments are always calling on them for
money to cover fiscal deficits or finance projects.
</P>
<P>
Along with closing more firms in debt-repayment difficulty, the
government is expected to restrain the business scope of trust
firms and tighten supervision over them.

<P>
VIENNA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Switzerland reached a trade deal late on Thursday, which was
expected to end the isolation of the latter that by-stepped the
single European market in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited bilateral trade deal settles the long-standing
dispute over taxes levied on 40-ton trucks using roads through
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The final obstacle to the trade accord was lifted when Portugal
lifted its generic objection. Swiss President Flavio Cotti was
expected to fly to Vienna on Friday to sign the accord.
</P>
<P>
The deal was needed to fill the gap left open between the
15-nation union and the central European country after Switzerland
voted in 1992 not to join the European Economic Area (EEA) trade
zone between EU and other western European countries.
</P>
<P>
The EEA accord created the largest single market in the world.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations aimed to reach the bilateral trade accord was held
on again and off again for the past three years and climatized
after the EU and Switzerland finally resolved a big obstacle last
week.

leaving their homes, like 23-year-old He Li from Liaoning, who
is delighted that she can call up books from the Provincial
Library on its own web site.
</P>
<P>
"It's much easier than physically visiting the library and
it changes the whole concept of using the facilities," she said.
</P>
<P>
One of the main advantages for browsers and readers is that the
library's web site has a comprehensive index which points to
actual books.
</P>
<P>
The vice director of the library's technology department, Li
Donglai, believes that this is one of the significant benefits of
being on-line.
</P>
<P>
And the service also allows browsers and readers to access the
library's valuable collection of 120,000 rare books, some dating
back 200 years, which, because of their age and fragile condition,
were previously only available on a restricted basis.
</P>
<P>
Li and his colleagues began inputting the IBM technology for
digitalizing their library earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Library, the largest in northeast China, boasts a
collection of three million volumes including 560,000 volumes of
rare and ancient books.
</P>
<P>
"This on-line service detailing most of our catalogue of books
is just the beginning," said Li. "Our next job is to develop a
wide ranging information resource."
</P>
<P>
However, a shortage of funds has restrained Li from
digitalizing every book in the library. "We don't have the
capacity or resources to digitalize one million books every year
like the American Library of Congress," Li added. "But we are
speeding up and in less than a month we managed to input 5,000
volumes."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a project to establish China's first nationwide
on-line digital library was agreed two years ago by the giant IBM
computer corporation and the National Library of China in Beijing,
which is the fifth largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to input all of the National Library's collection
of close to 20 million books and make them available via the
Internet with a super-charged web site.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A number of overseas
automotive industry executives who are attending an ongoing auto
fair in Shanghai have expressed the intention of building new
plants in China for the production of environment-friendly auto
products.
</P>
<P>
The fair, called "automotive parts and accessories, workshop
and service station equipment," is on from December 9 to 12. More
than 300 domestic and overseas business people are attending the
fair, which is a showcase for many foreign environment-friendly
auto products such as exhaust filters.

<P>
China currently has 3.5 million private vehicles, and
this figure is expected to climb rapidly over the next few years.

Some observers believe the market for environment-friendly auto
products will be great in China as the state will soon enact
stricter standards for auto exhaust, and people's
awareness of environmental protection will continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, sponsored by the Adsale Exhibition Service
Corporation of Hong Kong, and the Shanghai International Exhibition
Company, seminars on environment-friendly automobiles are also
being conducted.

<HEADLINE> National Strike Affects Normal Life Across India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Millions of workers,
peasants and students went on a 24-hour general strike Friday
morning across India, protesting against economic and social
policies of the central government led by the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP)
</P>
<P>
Initial reports reaching here said that strike, which began at
6:00 local time, has affected or paralyzed normal life in many
states with the eastern city of Calcutta wearing a deserted look.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported from Calcutta that
shops and markets, business establishment, offices and educational
institutions remained closed and buses, trams, taxis, local trains
and all other modes of transport remained in their depots and
garages.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines, which is mainly on domestic flights, has
canceled all its flights to and from the city.
</P>
<P>
This is the first strike called against the policies of the
BJP-led government, which came to power in March this year, for
its failure, among others, to check price rise of essential
commodities and closure of industrial units.
</P>
<P>
The strike is jointly organized by the constituent trade unions
and organizations of peasantry, agricultural workers, students,
youth and women under the name of National Platform of Mass
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The central government appealed in vain Thursday to the
organizers to withdraw the strike on the ground that it would
adversely affect the economy in the coun4ry.
</P>
<P>
In the southwest state of Kerala, the strike not only hit the
functioning of factories and workplaces but also threw normal life
out of gear throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
In most towns of the state, PTI said, shops and business
establishments were closed, and buses, taxis and trucks were off
the roads and educational institutions went without classes.
</P>
<P>
In the northeast state of Bihar, all police stations have been
put on maximum alert as left parties and trade unions affiliated
to them have decided to go ahead with the strike despite an order
by a high court in Patna, capital of the state, restraining them
from observing the decision.
</P>
<P>
The upper house of Indian parliament, Rajya Sabha, suspended
its session for the day amidst noisy scenes by non-Congress
opposition parties demanding suspension of question hour to
discuss the nation-wide strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike affected normal life in the Southeast state of Tamil
Nadu mainly due to the absence of buses trains and other means of
transport.
</P>
<P>
Reports from eastern state of Manipur said normal life in
Imphal, the capital, was disrupted as most private vehicles
remained off the roads and most long-distance bus services were
canceled.
</P>
<P>
It was reportedly said that the strike would effect normal work
in major sectors like transport, postal services, banks, ports and
docks, public sector and industrial undertakings, but services
like water, power and milk supply would have been exempted.
</P>
<P>
Security has already been beefed up and extra vigil mounted in
many areas of the country to deal with any contingency during the
strike.
</P>
<P>
So far no major incident has been reported anywhere in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Thursday
approved financing to enhance the economic reform program in
Mozambique and the private sector development in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
A 150 million U.S. dollar grant will be provided to Mozambique
to boost the reform operation and stabilize the
economy. Mozambique began economic reform in 1987 aimed at
transforming its centrally-planned economy into a market one.
</P>
<P>
The reform includes liberalizing import and price control,
privatizing state-owned enterprises, reforming the financial
sector, improving tax and trade policies and increasing social
sector spending.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will provide Cote d'Ivoire with a partial risk
guarantee of 30.3 million dollars equivalent to support the Azito
Power Project operated by a private company.
</P>
<P>
The project will provide power to meet expected growth in
demand and improve service delivery at a competitive price. The
demand for electricity in that country has been growing annually
at 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The project, consisting of a power plant and a transmission
component, is estimated to cost some 223 million dollars. The
guarantee will be used to secure financing for the associated
transmission line.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Salesmen in East China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The eastern China port city
of Ningbo has been charming a number of foreign traveling salesmen.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people are no longer so curious about seeing foreigners
on the streets since the country's opening up to the outside in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of foreign salesmen, however, is still a novelty.
Their strangely spoken Chinese and foreign working style have not
become a barrier to their work, but rather seem to have a special
charm in attracting customers.
</P>
<P>
They were soon nicknamed "Yangpaojie" (busy foreign salesmen)
by local Chinese for the efficiency and diligence they bring to
their activities.
</P>
<P>
Two of these foreigners, Hillman and Hilbert, came from Mexico
and were employed by a sugar and tobacco company in Ningbo a few
weeks ago. Now they knock on doors, going from shop to shop to
sell their products, and sales have been soaring since they began.
</P>
<P>
Now foreign salesmen are frequently seen in shopping malls and
hotels inquiring about the latest market trends, mainly in the
fields of video equipment, safes, luxury garments, cosmetics,
air-conditioners and color TV sets.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cracks Down on Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai authorities are
stepping up their efforts to crack down on tax evasion to ensure
the growth of state revenue.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, tax records of businesses and
individuals will be opened to public scrutiny, sources at the
Revenue Department revealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department has made plans for opening up information about
payers' value-added tax, names and other tax details to Revenue
Department offices, possibly starting next month.
</P>
<P>
Current tax codes state that only the director general of the
Revenue Department has the power to reveal the names and tax
payments of businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The anti-tax evasion campaign would extend the power to other
Revenue Department officials, the sources said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
If the plans succeeded in deterring tax evasion and increasing
state revenue, the information disclosure plan would be expanded
to cover other taxes, such as corporate tax and excise tax, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
"We want to utilize peer pressure to help encourage people to
comply with the tax codes," one department official said. "The
public will be able to know who has paid tax and who hasn't."
</P>
<P>
Businesses, for instance, will be able to see how much tax
competitors are paying, and help monitor and investigate potential
cases of tax evasion for the authorities to follow up.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is also aimed at reassuring honest taxpayers
that they are not being cheated by their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The department collected 499 billion baht (13.8 billion U.S.
dollars) in tax in the 1998 fiscal year that ended in September,
3.8 percent less than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
It has set a collection target of 530 billion baht (14.7
billion dollars) for fiscal 1999, although Finance Ministry
officials privately say that 488 billion baht (13.5 billion
dollars) is more realistic because of the recession.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tax office catering for businesses with annual
turnover exceeding 500 million baht (13.8 million dollars) is
scheduled to be opened in next April.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the department will transfer 300 accounts to the new
office and later expand coverage to all 2,700 firms nationwide
that meet the criteria.

<P>
The inquiry will be headed by IOC vice president Keba Mbaye of
Senegal, a highly respected former World Court judge.
</P>
<P>
The case involved in nearly 400,000 U.S. dollars in
scholarships presented to relatives of IOC members by the 2002
Winter Olympic Games Salt Lake bid committee.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship fund was first disclosed two weeks ago by a
Salt Lake radio station.
</P>
<P>
IOC executive board member Marc Hodler, a Swiss lawyer who
heads the IOC oversight panel on the 2002 games, said the
scholarship fund - described as "humanitarian aid" by Salt Lake
officials - amounted to a "bribe."
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's
500,000 dollars project was an effort to buy key IOC members'
support.
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake lost the '98 race to Nagano, Japan, in 1991. It won
a landslide vote over Sion, Switzerland, for the 2002 Games in
the 1995 balloting.
</P>
<P>
Following allegations of bribery and other influence peddling
in previous Olympic votes, the IOC assigned Hodler to draw up new
rules and restrictions to weed out the possibility of corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The rules are very clear: gifts should not be higher than 100
dollars," he said. "If (the Salt Lake scholarship fund) is a
gift, that gift is irregular. If it would be connected with the
voting, of course, it's corruption."
</P>
<P>
Hodler added that he would propose that only the 11-member IOC
executive board and leaders of sports federations select Olympic
cities - rather than the full IOC assembly.
</P>
<P>
Hodler said he would also propose that any IOC member found
guilty of accepting favors should be expelled from the
organization.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Falls with Rising Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China's import and export
volume for the first eleven months of the year dropped 0.2 percent
on the 1997 level to end the period at 286.5 billion U.S. dollars,
the Customs said today.
</P>
<P>
Total exports in the January-November stood at 163.9 billion
dollars, up 0.2 percent on a yearly basis, with imports down 0.6
percent at 122.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus grew 2.3 percent on the same 1997 period to
41.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In November, China's exports suffered a decline of 9.7 percent
to 15.1 billion dollars, while imports rose 2.1 percent to 12.3
billion dollars, with the monthly trade surplus standing at 2.8
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the Customs, China's exports to Asian nations
dropped sharply due to the intensifying impact of the financial
crisis engulfing Asia.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Asian nations during the January-November period
stood at 87.8 billion dollars, a fall of 9.8 percent, or 9.56
billion dollars, from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of exports to Asian countries in terms of
China's total fell to 54 percent, compared to the 1997 level of
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Asian countries, China's exports to other parts of
the world jumped 14.9 percent to 76 billion dollars in the 11
months, enabling the country to enjoy relative stability in terms
of exports.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in imports for the first 11 months was 0.2
percentage less than the figure for the first 10 months,
indicating steady development in imports, the Customs said.
</P>
<P>
Customs duties rose substantially due to adjustments in import
tax policy, intensified anti-smuggling efforts and improved mix of
imports and exports between January and November.
</P>
<P>
More capital- and technology-intensive products were exported
in the past 11 months, while the import of chemical products,
machinery and transport equipment was also on the rise, as against
a decline in that of agricultural, mineral and steel products.

</P>

Kenya Times:
</P>

million U.S. Dollars for the compensation of the August 7 bomb
blast victims including the rebuilding of Ufundi House and the
Co-operative Bank Building in Nairobi.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Witnesses Declining Sugar Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, one of the country's major sugar bases, has produced 16
million tons of sugar during 1998, 1.9 million tons less than the
figure in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This represented the biggest decrease in the province's sugar
output in the past decade, according to today's Market Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the fall to the reduced growing area and
severe drought, as well as lower purchasing prices.
</P>
<P>
Sugar prices have dropped by some 20-30 percent on last year's
levels.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the fact that 20-odd sugar refineries have
delayed payments have dampened the enthusiasm of farmers and in
turn affected production.
</P>
<P>
The provincial agricultural department noted that delayed
payments will quite likely have a negative influence on next
year's sugar production, which even in a year free of natural
disaster could still fall by one million tons.

<HEADLINE> JOC Welcome Government's Support for Osaka's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Olympic Committee
(JOC) welcome Japanese government's support to Osaka's bid for the
2008 Olympic Games, according to Teruji Kogake, Chief de Mission
of the Japanese delegation for the Bangkok Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Kogake said Osaka will also take the chance to build their own
national training center.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Cabinet ministers gave their support to Osaka's bid to
host the 2008 Olympic Games and that decision paved the way for
government financial support for at least half of the 80 billion
yen (about 680 milion U.S. dollars) budget to build an Olympic
stadium and a swimming pool if the city wins the bid.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that the government has decided to support
Osaka's bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games," said Kogake at a
press conference here this morning, "As an economic powerhouse,
Japan still has no national training center for top athletes. I
hope the Osaka bid will serve as an opportunity to develop in
Japan the national training center program."
</P>
<P>
Kogake considered Beijing as Osaka's strongest bidding rival in
Asia and he believed Japan has the advantage of successfully
hosting three (summer and winner) Olympic Games while China is
just bidding for its first Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"China has presented a city which is a strong competitor to
Osaka in the bid. We have to do our best carefully. The eyes of
the world will look at the two cities from many angles and
aspects." Kogake said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Osaka and Beijing, Kuala Lumpur and Paris also
expressed their hopes of hosting the 2008 summer Olympic Games.
The International Olympic Committee will decide the host city in a
vote in early 2000.

<HEADLINE> Indian Workers, Peasants Go On National Strike Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Millions of workers,
peasants and students in India are going on a one-day national
strike Friday to protest against the worsening economic situation
and the economic and social policies of the ruling Bharatiya
Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
The general strike is jointly organized by the constituent
trade unions and organizations of peasantry, agricultural workers,
students, youth and women under the name of National Platform of
Mass Organization.
</P>
<P>
The BJP-led government appealed in vain to trade union leaders
to withdraw the strike on the ground that it would adversely
affect the economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike is most likely to affect normal life in the country
especially in sectors like transport, postal services, banks,
ports and docks etc., but essential services like water, power and
mild supply have been exempted.
</P>
<P>
Security has already been beefed up and extra vigil mounted
across the country to deal with any contingency during the strike,
which was called by National Platform of Mass Organizations.
</P>
<P>
Indian Airlines, which is mainly on domestic flights, has
canceled its flights between Delhi and Calcutta on Friday and
changed its schedule of certain flights due to the strike.

<HEADLINE> Chief Justice Highlights Challenges to Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Custodial violence,
investigative abuses and social exploitation pose the greatest
challenge to human rights in India, the Times of India said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Unless human rights were made the focal point in good
governance, the daily quoted Chief Justice of India A. S. Anand as
saying on Thursday, no progress was either possible or sustainable
as no amount of economic development could be sustained without a
baseline of respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function organized here by the National Human
Rights Commission (NHRC), Anand said, the greatest and most urgent
challenges of human rights in India were in the areas of maternal
and child care, child education, child labor, child abuse and
protection of minorities and weaker sections.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the chief justice declared that these
great societal issues were not issues of excellence but of
survival.
</P>
<P>
According to Anand, some 100 million people had been killed in
armed conflicts and 120 million more deaths had resulted from
politics-related violence around the world this century.
</P>
<P>
At the threshold of the new millennium, he said, no country
could look back on its own record of human rights with any sense
of pride.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speakers of the Indian parliament reaffirmed India's
commitment to respect and protect human rights and fundamental
freedom in the country.
</P>
<P>
G. M. C. Balayogi, speaker of Lok Sabha, the lower house, and
Krishan Kant, speaker of Rajya Sabha, the upper house, said that
special attention would be given to protecting the rights and
freedoms of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward
communities, minorities, women, children and persons with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
These could be achieved through democratic, constitutional,
legal, developmental and educational processes, involving the
legislative, executive and judicial arms of governance at the
national and state levels as well as the civil society, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) launched the first world asthma day on Friday to highlight
the plight of asthma sufferers and raise public and professional
awareness about this condition.
</P>
<P>
Some 180,000 sufferers die of asthma every year, according to
the WHO in a statement marking the asthma day with "Help Our
Children Breathe" as the theme. The day will be marked every
December 11 under different themes.
</P>
<P>
The WHO estimated that there are between 100 and 150 million
people in the world, including many children, suffering from the
deadly disease. "For them it can be a life-and-death struggle
against recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing caused by
asthma," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Asthma is a serious condition that affects the lives of
millions of people in both developed and developing countries,"
said Dr Nikolai Khaltaev, a WHO expert.
</P>
<P>
Today, the WHO said, an estimated eight percent of the Swiss
population suffers from asthma as against only two percent some
25-30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe as a whole, asthma cases have doubled in the
last 10 years. In the United States the number of asthmatics has
leapt by over 60 percent since the early 1980s and deaths have
reached 5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
Asthma is not just a public health problem for the developed
countries, Dr Khaltaev stressed.
</P>
<P>
"India, for example, has an estimated 15 to 20 million
asthmatics. However, in the developing world, the incidence of
asthma varies greatly: from over 50 percent among children in the
Caroline Islands to virtually zero in Papua New Guinea," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the goals of the World Asthma Day is to inform people
about the best methods for diagnosis of the disease and to promote
modern treatment of asthma with anti-inflammatory drugs alongside
the widely used bronchodilators.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO researchers, significant risk factors that
heighten the chance of developing asthma include genetic
predisposition, indoor and outdoor allergens, smoking, low birth
weight, air pollution and occupational sensitizers, as well as
certain drugs and respiratory infection. Strong emotions,
physical exercise and even the weather can exacerbate the
condition.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Remain Little Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Council of
Wool Exporters (ACWE) said in its weekly report that while wool
auction prices remained essentially unchanged this week in the
eastern markets of Sydney and Launceston they fell just over two
percent in west Australia's coastal city of Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said the AWEX eastern market indicator gained one cent to
finish at 508 Australian cents per kilogram clean, based on a drop
of three cents in the north and a rise of four cents in the south.
</P>
<P>
This saw their corresponding region indicators close the week
at 518 and 499 Australian cents per kilogram clean respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Western region indicator fell 11 cents to 465 Australian
cents per kilogram clean, reflecting a drop in auction prices last
week when there was no sale in Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
A total of 86,118 bales were offered for sale with 17.4 percent
passed in, comprising 11.7 percent in Sydney, 12.5 percent in
Launceston and 26.7 percent in Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
A total of 104,000 bales are expected at the final sales before
Christmas in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle next week, but ACWE
and Wesfarmers expected the market to hold up.
</P>
<P>
"The large offering next week will place pressure on the
market, as will the presence of tender wool. This could cause
prices to ease early in the week," Wesfarmers said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Rejects New Zealand's Bid for Apple Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia Friday rejected a
bid by New Zealand to export apples to Australia, citing
quarantine risk as the main obstacle.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), the
country's official quarantine body, said the decision was taken
after a risk analysis, which found the major quarantine risk from
New Zealand apples was that they could carry fire blight, a
bacterial disease not present in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Friday's announcement follows years of controversy about the
New Zealand application, made in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Australian apple producers have expressed concern about
competition from the imports and the risk of orchard disease.
</P>
<P>
AQIS said New Zealand's proposal had been based on the
contention that mature fruit were not a vector for fire blight.
</P>
<P>
But the AQIS risk analysis found apples sourced in the manner
New Zealand proposed could carry fire blight bacteria.

<HEADLINE> Academy Cites Hidden Dangers in U.S. Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences released a report today citing hidden dangers in the
U.S. economy which is currently experiencing spectacular
development.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that the impact of ongoing financial
crises in Asia and Russia continues to mount and suggests the
possibility of a new round of inflation resulting from rising
wages.
</P>
<P>
The report also points to the danger involved in declining
investments and the distinct possibility of bearish stock market
due to falling company profits.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy, which accounts for close to a forth of the
global total, has witnessed dramatic growth in 1998 and has been
one of the most important elements helping to stablize the
international economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the possibility of a recession in the U.S. increases
the chances for an international economic crisis, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the report downplays the chances for a recession
in the near future due to increasing domestic consumption and
the rebounding investment demand.
</P>
<P>
The report noted the fact that the first balanced budget in
some three decades have a positive long-term influence on the
U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> India Makes New Proposal for Road Transit over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- India has made a new proposal
for road transit over Bangladesh to carry goods to its four
land-locked northeastern states, but the Bangladeshi side has not
accepted it, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal contains that Indian trucks or vehicles would
carry goods bound for northeastern Indian states (Assam, Naga,
Mizo and Tipura) through Bangladeshi entry points, The Financial
Express daily newspaper Friday quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The entire consignment will be thereafter carried by
Bangladeshi trucks or vehicles to Indian border points in
accordance with the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh could not respond to the Indian proposal for various
political-economic reasons, they stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's first fear is that a road transit to the Indian
vehicles would yield little economic benefit to Bangladesh, and
except some taxes and duties, Bangladesh would not be economically
benefited.
</P>
<P>
The second fear is that a direct road transit will provide
opportunity to dump Indian goods into Bangladeshi market creating
a negative on the country's industries, and the third fear is that
Bangladesh road transport business would be affected if the direct
road transit is allowed to India.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was placed during the two-day trade talks between
the two countries, which were held in Dhaka on last Tuesday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh could not respond to the new proposal instantly but
promised to examine it in the light of regional cooperation as
envisaged in the South Asian preferential Trade Arrangement, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Growth in India Falls in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Industrial growth rate in
India fell to just two percent in October compared to seven
percent in the same month last year, according to official figures
released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Based on data on index of industrial production, overall
industrial growth for the first seven months of the current fiscal
year (April to October) stood at 3.6 percent against 6.2 percent
recorded in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by Ministry of Planning and Programme
Implementation showed that manufacturing sector had the highest
growth rate of 2.8 percent in October, followed by electricity at
0.1 percent and a negative 2.6 percent for mining.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative growth stood at 3.8 percent in case of
manufacturing, 6.3 percent for electricity and minus 0.7 percent
for mining compared to growth rates of 6.2, 6.9 and 5 percent
respectively during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall industrial growth in October was slightly
higher than that in September when it grew by only 1.4 percent,
but contrary to expectations of an improvement in industrial
activity during the second half of the financial year beginning
April 1.
</P>
<P>
Growth in consumer goods, which accounted for over one-fourth
of the index of industrial production, turned positive in October
to 2.5 percent from a negative 4.6 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative growth rate in this sector improved to 1.7 percent,
but was still below the 3.1 percent achieved last year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released last week showed that India's exports
in October fell sharply to 2.59 billion U.S. dollars from 2.94
Billion U.S. dollars registered in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank (WB) made a depressing forecast last week for
India, warning that failure to achieve its stipulated growth
target of over 6 percent for the current year would represent one
of the biggest challenges for the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In its ninth annual report on the world economy, it says that
"policy drift" and weak industrial performance had slowed India's
economy. Besides, depressed export markets in East Asia and Japan
are a blow, since they had come to account for a significant share
of India's exports.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report complains about the lack of any "concrete
proposal" in India's budget for 1998-99 for further substantial
reductions in the public sector deficit.
</P>
<P>
"If growth targets of over 6 percent do not materialize, the
total public sector deficit could well persist at more than 9
percent of the GDP, representing one the biggest challenges for
the Indian economy," it warns.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Olympic Champion Comes Back to Diving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta Olympics diving
titlist Xiong Ni, who came back from retirement in May, will take
part in the World Cup diving competition in New Zealand next
January, Chinese diving team leader Xue Li said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Xiong, who claimed the gold in the men's
three-meter springboard in Atlanta Olympics, will join another
Olympic champion Sun Shuwei in the World Cup, Xue said.
</P>
<P>
But Fu Mingxia, 21, who achieved a golden double in women's
springboard and platform in Atlanta, will skip the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Though already having resumed training, all these three Olympic
titlists missed the Asian Games. "They haven't adjusted their
forms to the best, and can hardly make dives of high difficulty
degrees, " Xue said. "So we didn't risk fielding them in the
Games."
</P>
<P>
But Xiong, silent since the 1996 Olympics, will once again
stake his claim to the world diving throne held by Dmitry Sautin
of Ukraine, Xue said.
</P>
<P>
"Xiong's physical condition is good, except for a slight
chronic waist injury," Xue said. "He has one month to prepare for
the World Cup and that's enough for him to improve the difficulty
degree of his routine. "
</P>
<P>
"But whether he will have a chance to take part in the 2000
Sydney Olympics, it depends on his forms as well as his
performance in the trials," Xue said.
</P>
<P>
Xiong retired after winning the three-meter springboard gold in
China's National Eighth Games in October, 1997. But he announced
his comeback in May this year and resumed routine training.
</P>
<P>
Before finally landing a gold in the 1996 Olympics, Xiong won a
silver and bronze respectively in the Seoul and Barcelona
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> India Against Fresh WTO Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- India did not agree for
fresh round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO)
until developing countries were allowed to enjoy a fair share of
economic benefits of global trade, a government official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Developing nations would have to codify the special and
differential treatment clauses under the Uruguay Round and be
allowed to get a feel of it besides its impact, Commerce Secretary
P. P. Prabhu said at a G-5 symposium here.
</P>
<P>
Only after that, fresh round of negotiations could be
considered, he said at the Symposium of Special and Differential
Treatment Provisions for Developing Countries in Uruguay Round
Agreements which opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Though provisions had been made for special and differential
treatment at the Uruguay Round of talks on General Agreement on
Trade and Tariff (GATT), it was yet to be extended to developing
and least developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Returns of benefits to developing countries had been below
expectations despite giving major concessions in area of market
access, Prabhu said, adding that significant tariff barriers and
high variance still affected exports interests of the third world
countries.
</P>
<P>
In particularly, he said, agricultural tariffs, which resulted
principally from tariffication, were much higher than the average
industrial tariffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Environment Ministry
on Thursday rejected a dam project to save sinking Venice from
rising waves, citing damages to the lagoon city's ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
The project, codenamed "Moses", envisions massive mobile
floodgates totaling 12 kilometers long at the lagoon's three
mouths to the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the project said it would rescue the famous
tourist resort from the mounting threats of tides. The city's
renowned St. Mark's Square was hit by flooding of over one meter
for 137 times between 1988 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, after more than 10 years of study over the dam scheme,
advisors said the project would destroy the canal city's
ecological system, not to mention a huge cost of 4.4 trillion lire
(2.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"(The plan) cannot be considered compatible with the current
critical condition of the ecosystem, including the lagoon, the
city and the drainage basin," the ministry's environmental
commission said in its report.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Revenge for World Cup Loss to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese soccer squad,
still smart from its crushing defeats to Iran in the World Cup
qualifiers, vowed to take its revenge in Saturday's clash with the
western Asian soccer power at the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a game of revenge," said British head coach Bobby
Houghton, who took the helm of a demoralized Chinese team after
its former coach Qi Wusheng resigned in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
In the World Cup final qualification tournament earlier last
year, China lost 2-4 and then 1-4 to Iran and didn't make the
French World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese players feel hurt about their World Cup losses to
Iran," said Houghton. "Their form has been improving and they
can't wait to square off with Iran."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, China handed a 6-1 defeat to Oman which had
upset Iran in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Oman's victory over Iran boosted our morale," said Chinese
assistant coach Jin Zhiyang. "We have no pressure and are
determined to slug out with Iran. I really want to know -- Is
China better than Iran, or just the opposite?"
</P>
<P>
Chinese team captain Fan Zhiyi, who plays for English division
one club Crystal Palace, said China now held an edge over Iran.
</P>
<P>
"They are not the same team with the one in the World Cup," he
said. "I think we have an advantage."
</P>
<P>
Oman head coach Burridge Viera, whose team can qualify for the
quarter-finals if China either draws or defeats Iran, told Chinese
coaches that Iran's defenders on wings were weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese can use their speed to slice open Iran's defence
from both sides," Viera said.
</P>
<P>
China is now so crazy about soccer that a recent internet poll
showed over 90 percent of sports fans regarded the soccer gold as
"the most valuable" of the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Despite five failed attempts to make the World Cup finals and
its poor standard, China now has exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jihai plays in the same club with Fan Zhiyi, striker Yang
Chen is a recruit of Germany's Eintracht Frankfurt and youngster
Li Jinju plays for French division one club Nancy.

<HEADLINE> NATO Launches Kosovo "Extraction Force" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Despite Yugoslav objections,
NATO's "extraction force" for Kosovo, based in Macedonia, was
officially launched early Thursday near Skopje following a
ceremony conducted by NATO military authorities and the Macedonian
government.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ceremony in Kumanovo, a town near the border of
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, James Ellis, commander of NATO
forces in southern Europe, and the Macedonian Defense Minister
Nikola Kljusev, promised the "extraction force" won't violate Yugoslav
sovereignty or violate its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Ellis described the "extraction force" as well-trained,
well-equipped and competent at its task, adding that it will be
used only when unarmed verifiers of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) are in danger of being attacked.
</P>
<P>
"The force's tasks will have successfully completed its work if
the force ends its mission without being used," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under NATO's November 13 resolution and the accord reached
between NATO and Macedonia, the first troops of NATO "extraction
force," composed of 1,700 soldiers from France, the United
Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, arrived in Macedonia
on December 7.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Trade Data Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Statistics New Zealand said
Friday that the terms of New Zealand trade index rose 1.4 percent
in the third quarter, after recording a fall of 3.5 percent in the
second quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
The trade index compares export and import prices to measure
the amount of imported goods a fixed volume of exports would
fund. A rise means the purchasing power of exports has increased,
and a drop means the opposite.
</P>
<P>
in a media release, Statistics NZ said the terms of trade index
rise in the third quarter was a result of increases in export
prices, up 2.8 percent, and import prices, up 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the New Zealand dollar weakened by 2.4
percent and was 11.8 percent lower than a year ago. A decline in
the NZ dollar has an upwards influence on both import and export
price indexes.
</P>
<P>
The import price index in the third quarter was 5.4 percent
higher than a year ago. This could be largely attributed to the
fall of the NZ dollar. Apart from a slight fall in the first
quarter this index had risen for six consecutive quarters.
</P>
<P>
The export price index had risen for the fifth consecutive
quarter and was 6.7 percent higher in the third quarter this year
than in the same quarter 1997. The meat price index recorded the
most significant rise of 8.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Trade Balance Steadily improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The trend in New Zealand's
merchandise trade balance has shown steady growth for the latest
five months, NZ Deputy Government Statistician Ian Ewing said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The lower New Zealand dollar has helped to sustain exports
despite economic difficulties in Asia and other export markets,
Ewing said in a media release.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the provisional merchandise trade
balance of New Zealand for the month of October was in deficit by
461 million NZ dollars (240 million U.S. dollars) compared with a
deficit of 267 million NZ dollars (138.9 million U.S. dollars)
for the previous October.
</P>
<P>
Large deficits are typical at this time of year and in recent
decades no surplus has been recorded for the month of October,
Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports in October were 1,891 million NZ dollars
(983 million U.S. dollars), 3.2 percent higher than in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
For the year to October 1998, provisional merchandise exports
of New Zealand were 22,286 million NZ dollars (11,611 million
U.S. dollars), 4.6 percent higher than in the previous year.

<P>
The News:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thai PM to Push for More ASEAN Cohesion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai will urge ASEAN countries at the upcoming ASEAN summit in
Hanoi to strengthen their cohesion for promoting political and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He will also call on ASEAN to unite in helping members pass
this critical stage of the economic crisis, Foreign Ministry
Permanent Secretary Saroj Chavanaviraj said in remarks published
Friday by the Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Chuan will make the calls in a speech at the summit of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations scheduled for next Tuesday
in Hanoi. Apart from Thailand, ASEAN comprises Brunei, Burma,
Laos, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"The premier is expected to call on political and economic
development being implemented to help members tackle the current
economic crisis," Saroj said.
</P>
<P>
Saroj will lead a delegation of senior officials to prepare for
the two-day meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan will emphasize the importance of ASEAN's unity,
efficiency and effectiveness and the necessity of reverting to the
style of the past when ASEAN spoke in one voice or act in
concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The premier will tell ASEAN members to emphasize their close
cooperation and solidarity and give less attention to their size,"
Saroj said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan's proposal will be reflected in the Hanoi Declaration and
Plan of Action to be released at the end of the summit, Saroj
said. Both documents would stressed the importance of promoting
ASEAN unity and cohesion to enable non-ASEAN nations to retain
confidence in the association's policies and its commitment to
market liberalization.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Cambodia's membership to ASEAN, Saroj said
the grouping, facing the Herculean task of tackling economic and
financial crisis, had no time to delve into helping solve
Cambodian conflicts.
</P>
<P>
With ASEAN members being divided over the timing of Cambodia's
entry into the group, senior ASEAN officials decided to defer the
decision to their foreign ministers. Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos,
Indonesia and Malaysia have been pushing for Cambodia's admission
at the upcoming summit, while other members are more cautious.
Dissenting members say they want to see political improvements now
that Cambodia has formed a coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Endeavor's Astronauts Step Into Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The six astronauts on the
U.S. space shuttle ``Endeavor'' Thursday entered the space station
now under construction to turn on the lights and prepare for
future assembly crews.
</P>
<P>
Flight commander Robert Cabana and Russian cosmonaut Sergei
Krikalev's first steps into Unity, the second element for the
international space station built by NASA, occurred after opening
a series of hatches leading from the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the darkness within the Unity, the two astronauts had
to carry lanterns. Their first task was to turn on the
lights. They were followed by the rest of the crew members.
</P>
<P>
The six astronauts had a lot of work to do inside the space
station, including hooking up a communications system. They
continued on into the Russian-built Zarya control module, in which
the Russian cosmonaut replaced a faulty battery.
</P>
<P>
Others were to transfer tools from the shuttle to the space
station for later use. They will even leave behind clothes for the
first permanent station crew scheduled to arrive in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is reported they will work through Friday, then exit the
space station and then prepare for Tuesday's return to the Earth.

<HEADLINE> America's Spielberg Routed by China's Domestic Movie Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- America's huge box office movie
hit "Saving Private Ryan" has been given the cold shoulder in
China and removed from cinemas early.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, movie distributors in east China's Anhui Province said
they didn't even realize half of the expected four million yuan
box office takings.
</P>
<P>
Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg's film about a squad of
U.S. army soldiers on a rescue mission in World War II topped the
movie charts in America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
But Yang Siqing, an official with the Provincial Film
Distribution Company said, "We were forced to finish showing the
film five days ahead of the 25 day schedule through lack of
interest.
</P>
<P>
"In sharp contrast, domestic movies such as 'Zhou Enlai's
Diplomacy', 'Days Without Hero', and 'A Time to Remember' have
become great successes," said Yang. Each of the domestic movies
has taken over one million yuan at the box office.
</P>
<P>
Movie sources in Beijing said that Spielberg's violently
gruesome blockbuster did not do as well as expected in China, and
neither did its predecessor 'Deep Impact', which was also a
massive U.S. hit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ye Daying, the respected director of 'A Time to
Remember', has been attracting much attention from cinema goers
and the media in Beijing who rate his work highly.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Zhiyou, secretary-general of the Anhui Film
Association, Chinese film audiences have become much more
discerning, certainly foreign movies are involved, and are
increasingly interested in "home-grown" films.
</P>
<P>
Until fairly recently film studios, distribution firms and
cinemas throughout China used to operate independently. And
neither the government nor those who invested in the movie
industry seldom bothered about profit margins when considering
film projects.
</P>
<P>
However, that all changed dramatically in 1992 when six of
China's major film studios found themselves in serious financial
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Within a matter of a few years they were forced to start
competing with each other and box office returns became a matter
of some importance. New movie making companies sprang up in
Shanghai and Beijing and emphasis was placed on quality and wooing
the audiences.
</P>
<P>
Yang explained that today audience reaction and box office
returns play a major part in decisions affecting film making.
</P>
<P>
For example, cinemas throughout China have been packed for the
very moving film 'Days without Hero' which tells the story of a
soldier, Lei Feng, who became famous nationwide for helping others
in the 1960s. Tickets sales have easily topped four million yuan
(482,000 US Dollars) in Beijing alone.
</P>
<P>
Pundits believe China's comprehensive reform and successful
opening up drive has helped transform the country's movie business
into a hard commercial and extremely profitable animal.
</P>
<P>
"All aspects of film and television program making, from the
creative side through to production and distribution must now be
market led," insisted Yang Hongbin, section chief of Beijing's
Bureau of Culture.
</P>
<P>
"These days even the cultural and arts sector in China must
take into account basic economics and the ground rules for
successful investment linked to profits have become a priority."
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 Nobel Prize winners
in science and literature received their awards here Thursday as
two rival statesmen from Northern Ireland shared the peace prize
in Oslo in neighboring Norway.
</P>
<P>
At a grand ceremony in Stockholm's Concert Hall, Swedish King
Carl XVI Gustaf presented a gold medal to each laureate while a
check for 7.6 million kronor (about 980,000 U.S. dollars) was
awarded for each discipline.
</P>
<P>
The laureates are German Horst Stoermer and Americans Robert
Laughlin and Daniel Tsui for physics, American Walter Kohn and
British John Pople for chemistry, Americans Robert Furchgott,
Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad for medicine, Portuguese Jose
Saramago for literature and Indian Amartya Sen for economics.
</P>
<P>
Kohn, a chemistry prize winner, was the only laureate not
present at the ceremony because of a family illness. He will
receive his award at next year's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
American academics were the biggest winner of this year's Nobel
prizes, with all eight science laureates teaching at
U.S. institutions.
</P>
<P>
Saramago is the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel
literature prize and Sen is the first Asian to win the economic
prize.
</P>
<P>
In Oslo, Protestant leader David Trimble and Catholic
nationalist John Hume collected the Nobel peace prize for their
role in forging a groundbreaking peace accord in April aimed at
ending 30 years of bloody violence in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Aid Cut not to Affect Aid to Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese government aid
delegation here has announced that the possible 10 percent
reduction in Japanese global aid would not affect the total aid to
Sri Lanka, a local newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Island reported that Yataka Yokoi, Director of the Loan Aid
Division of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a press
conference Thursday that Sri Lanka was one of several countries
that would not see a reduction in aid from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is the ninth largest recipient of Japan's bilateral
aid and Japan has traditionally been the largest donor to Sri
Lanka. In 1977 Japanese aid made up 70 percent of total bilateral
assistance and almost 40 percent of total foreign assistance to
Sri Lanka, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This year the loan assistance to Sri Lanka is a colossal 195
million U.S. dollars. It will fund the phase two of the
transmission and substation development project to improve the
reliability of substations and enhance power transmission.
</P>
<P>
A number of other projects under the grants component of
Japanese aid have also been planned, which include the
establishment of a nursing school, reconstruction of bridges and
improvements to 25 junior schools, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Officials Say Latin America Weathers Financial Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials with
economic institutions said Thursday that countries in the region
have "successfully" weathered the international financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Mattar, regional advisor for the Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), said the region has gone
through a financial crisis, but it has come out of it unscathed.
</P>
<P>
The region underwent stock market volatility when it was hit by
the Asian financial crisis, but the economy is growing in a
healthy way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though Brazil does have some problems this year with a 0.5
percent growth rate, most of the countries have a healthy economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the timely economic adjustment of the countries
in the region and to the end of short-term speculation on capital,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Rodolf Buiteleaar, head of CEPAL's Industrial Development
Unit, agreed with Mattar, saying that Latin America has been
attracting foreign investors, surpassing Asia, despite the
negative effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that Brazil and Mexico will still be the countries that
attract the most direct foreign investment in the region in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has received nearly 8 billion dollars in direct foreign
investment this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says It Seeks Close Ties With Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Thursday that it is eager for a cooperative relationship with
Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez and is encouraged by the
conciliatory statements he has made since his election.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has sent a letter to Chavez
congratulating him on his election and expressing confidence that
Chavez "will address the challenges facing his administration in a
democratic manner," said State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have a cooperative relationship with Mr. Chavez and
his administration, continuing the traditionally strong ties we
have with Venezuela," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that he will govern and institute change consistent
with Venezuela's democratic traditions and as required by the
Venezuelan constitution."
</P>
<P>
Chavez probably would be welcome to visit the U.S. either
before or after his inauguration on February 2, said other
officials.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president-elect was denied a U.S. visa in 1996
and has been on an immigration service "lookout list" of
undesirable aliens who are barred from entering the U.S. because
he led a coup attempt in 1992 while serving as an Army colonel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department noted that heads
of state normally are given U.S. diplomatic visas.
</P>
<P>
Chavez has promised fiscal discipline and national
reconciliation, prompting surges in the Caracas stock market,
after he was elected last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Chile Becomes Important Investment Recipient and Investor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chile has become one of the
main recipients for foreign investment and an important investor
in Latin America, a report released by the Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean (Cepal) said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Chile has become international in both directions," said
Joseph Ramos, the representative of the Cepal Productive and
Entrepreneurial Development Division, as he presented the 1998
Report on Foreign Investment in the Region.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign direct investment in Chile this year will
be around 5 billion U.S. dollars, compared to 5.4 billion
dollars registered in 1997, while Chilean investment in the rest
of Latin America was 2 billion dollars last year, and will reach
2.2 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This is significant for a country whose economy is only four
percent of the region's gross domestic product," said the Cepal
official.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ramos agreed with reports that Spain replaced the United
States as the biggest investor in Chile, mainly because of the
entrance of the Endesa Spanish consortium into Chile.
</P>
<P>
Ramos added that most foreign investment in Chile has been made
since last year due mainly to the introduction of new projects and
the expansion and modernization of enterprises already operating
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Bank Liquidation Costs Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA) Thursday revealed that it has so far
cost 226 million U.S. dollars to overhaul beleaguered banks under
its supervision.
</P>
<P>
The agency's chairman Glenn S. Yusuf said that the total costs
consisted of 1.67 trillion rupiah (222 million U.S. dollars)
denominated in rupiah and 4 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said liquidating 10 banks in April and August cost 1.61
trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"Costs associated with liquidating the banks stemmed largely
from the blanket guarantee scheme under which the government meets
all of the banks' obligations," Glenn told House of
Representatives' Commission VIII for the state budget and finance.
</P>
<P>
The 10 banks liquidated in April and August were Bank Dagang
Nasional Indonesia, Bank Umum Nasional, Modern Bank, Bank Surya,
Bank Subentra, Bank Kredit Asia, Bank Pelita, Hokindo Bank, Deka
Bank and Centris International Bank.
</P>
<P>
A further 11.7 billion rupiah was spent on consultants fees,
along with 13.4 billion rupiah for administration and office
costs, 35 billion rupiah in accountants and lawyers' fees, and for
communications consultants and advertising, the chairman was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
All funds denominated in rupiah were provided by the government
through the state budget.
</P>
<P>
Glenn said the World Bank has so far provided 4 million U.S.
dollars of the 10.8 million U.S. dollars it pledged following an
IBRA request for 20 million U.S. dollars in assistance.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 24 banks under IBRA's supervision,
including Bank Central Asia, Bank Danamon, Bank Tiara Asia and
Bank PDFCI, which were taken over by the government last August.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Abolishes Capital Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Parliament of Bulgaria
abolished capital punishment on Thursday under a new penal code
passed in the second reading.
</P>
<P>
Death penalty will be replaced by life imprisonment without a
right to a pardon, according to the new penal code.
</P>
<P>
However, the new law said life imprisonment will not be imposed
on persons under the age of 20 or on women who are pregnant at the
time the crime is committed.
</P>
<P>
The parliament said a death penalty already sentenced will not
be commuted to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Svetoslav Louchnikov, chairman of the parliamentary legal
committee, explained the president has the right to change the
sentence of the already convicted.
</P>
<P>
On November 27, the parliament passed in the first reading a
bill amending the penal code on the abolition of capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Capital punishment was introduced in Bulgaria in 1886 in the
country's first penal code. It used to be imposed only for high
treason, assassination of the head of state, premeditated murder
and arson.
</P>
<P>
In 1968, capital punishment started to be imposed for
premeditated murder of state officials and one's father, mother or
children.

WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Michelle Kwan of the
United States will spearhead the strongest field of any event
this season in the World Pro Skating Championships here this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The International Skating Union has sanctioned the event. It
is also the biggest challenge Kwan will have.
</P>
<P>
"This competition is a great event because it is a chance for
all of us as amateurs to compete against professionals," she
said. "I'll get to skate against Chen Lu of China and also work
on my short program and intepretive long program."
</P>
<P>
With Tara Lipinski no longer eligible and Nicole Bobek still
slumping, Kwan, the world champion this year, might easily win
her third national crown in February.
</P>
<P>
Kwan realizes she must continue to upgrade her technical
skating and jumps. One reason she lost the Olympic gold medal to
Lipinski was her rival could do more difficult maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
"People who are coming up will be very strong and determined,
and you have to be ahead of the game and keep on working," she sai
d. "I still have to put in the same effort, determination and
motivation to reach 2002." Endtem

WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The organizers of an NBA
exhibition game said they will give all proceeds to charity

<P>
"Because of the cancellation of the NBA All-Star game, the
players want to do this for the fans in Philadelphia and the
world," said Curtis Polk, president of Falk Associates Management
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This means the proceeds won't be divided between needy players
and charity, all profits will be donated to UNICEF and other
charities.
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales have been delayed twice, casinos showed little
interesting to support it and the December 19 event was regarded
as too hurry to have a good sellout.
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope to raise $1 million from broadcast rights and
the sale of 13,000 tickets at $25 to $50 apiece. Players in the
Dream Teams from 1992 to 1998 are expected to give the show.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA officially announced in Lausanne Thursday their expanded
32-team European Champions' League and 124-team UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Both competitions will start next season and they herald the
start of a new era of virtually year-round European club soccer.
</P>
<P>
Next season's European program starts with the first round of
the Intertoto Cup on June 19 1999 and ends with the Champions
League final on May 24, 2000 -- just 17 days before the European
Football championship begins in Belgium and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In all, 526 matches will be played in the two competitions,
with, for the first time, UEFA Cup matches taking place in
February and with only one week, rather than the two or three
weeks which have been the tradition for so long, seperating first
and second leg matches.
</P>
<P>
The new format sees the end of the European Cup Winners Cup
which started in the 1960-61 season. From next season domestic
cup winners will go into the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The changes had been expected as UEFA revamped its leading
competitions following threats by the continent's leading clubs
to break away and form a rebel Super League.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup will be merged into one
competition, with 25 teams competing in a qualifying round and 96
entering the cup proper. Matches will be played on Tuesday nights.
</P>
<P>
The Champions' League will be contested by 32 teams instead of
the current 24, with games taking place on Wednesdays and
Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
In all 72 teams will take part in the Champions' League -- but
40 of them -- mainly from the smaller European countries -- will
be eliminated during three qualifying rounds between July and
August. The 16 who make it through to the third qualifying round
before being eliminated move across to the first round of the
UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The champions and runners-up of Europe's powerhouse leagues -
Italy, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands and England - will
all be assured of places in the new Champions' League, along with
the champions of Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The other 17 berths in the league includes the defending
champions and other 16 who have fought their way through the
qualifying rounds.
</P>
<P>
Those 32 are then split into eight groups of four with the top
two in each group advancing to the second group phase consisting
of 16 teams in four groups of four.
</P>
<P>
The top two in those groups then advance to the quarter-finals
which are played as a two-legged knockout, the same as the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The final, as always, consists of one match, which means that
the two finalists will each have played 17 matches to reach that
stage -- and as many as 23 in the unlikely event they have
survived from the opening qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
UEFA will officially announce on Friday the exact format of
the competitions.

SANTIAGO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Chilean businessmen expressed
Thursday their concern over the effects the Augusto Pinochet case
can have on their business.
</P>
<P>
National Chamber of Commerce President Fernando Lihn voiced his
support to the actions of the government related to Pinochet
detention in London, where he has been detained for 55 days.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trade relations with Spain and Great Britain
should not be affected in principle and that if there is a
deterioration in the relations, "the only loser will be Chile."
</P>
<P>
"We sell them 10 and they buy one from us. We are the big
losers," said Lihn.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has talked clearly" about not
breaking relations with none of the two countries, which are the
biggest foreign investors in Chile and have capitals in sectors
such as banking and energy.
</P>
<P>
However, Pinochet sympathizers who have harassed the Spanish
and British diplomatic missions have asked the authorities to
break relations with both and to boycott their products.
</P>
<P>
They also want the ambassadors of the two countries to be
declared "persona non grata."

<HEADLINE> IOC Chief "Praises" Doping Scandals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch said in Lausanne on
Thursday major doping scandals had indirectly helped sport in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Thursday, Samaranch, paying
a courtesy visit to the executive committee of UEFA, European
soccer's ruling body, told reporters the scandals surrounding Ben
Johnson at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and this summer's Tour de
France must be seen in a positive light.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, these cases are not good for sport in the short
term, but in the long run they have had a positive effect," the
International Olympic Committee president said.
</P>
<P>
"Until Ben Johnson tested positive in Seoul in 1988, the IOC
were almost alone in the fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
"The positive aspect of that case, and of the Tour de France
this year, was that it called to the attention of federations and
governments the extent of the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Now they are working together with the IOC on the same
principle that doping is wrong."
</P>
<P>
The sports federations will meet in February to implement
sanctions against doping. "This is a positive aspect of these
major doping scandals of the past," said Samaranch. "They could
help speed up the fight against doping."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch was visiting UEFA as soccer is one of three sports
-- the others are cycling and tennis -- who are not entirely
happy with all aspects of the doping initiative launched by the
IOC and which is the subject of a world-wide meeting of the
Olympic sports federations next February.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch is also planning to meet FIFA president Sepp Blatter
on January 6 to work out a compromise over soccer's stance on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
FIFA agrees with the anti-doping initiatives in principle, but
has reservations about the implementation of sanctions which
could be interpreted as restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch admitted that former Olympic sprint champion
Florence Griffith Joyner's reputation had suffered in the wake of
Johnson's positive test for steroids at the Seoul Games.
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner died in September, aged 38. An autopsy proved
she had died from natural causes, but Samaranch said: "We should
not speak ill of the dead but there is no doubt that in the
public's mind her reputation suffered as a result of what happ
ened with Ben Johnson in Seoul."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Nothing against her was ever proved and she never
had any connection with doping. She was a great athlete and she
will always be remembered for what she achieved."

concerns about the lucrative terms offered to former BSkyB
executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance and the manner of their
appointment.
</P>
<P>
A confidential meeting was called on Thursday after apparently
angry exchanges at last week's scheduled get-together between the
20 clubs.
</P>
<P>
Six of the teams - Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool,
Newcastle, Leeds and Wimbledon - had demanded to be allowed to
see the financial terms of the contracts offered to the two
advisers.
</P>
<P>
Reports had indicated that not only was Leaver ready to resign
immediately after the row last week but that he could even be
voted out of office by the clubs in Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
However despite the continuing concerns of some clubs, there
is not believed to have been a vote of no confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
The general consensus seems to have been that whatever qualms
some chairmen may still have on certain issues, Leaver and
chairman Sir John Quinton retain the legal right to make certain
decisions without having to refer back to the clubs.
</P>
<P>
The Premier League announced in a statement: "The clubs have
held a useful meeting on a range of issues relating to the
appointment of media advisers.
</P>
<P>
"There is, despite Press speculation, to be no change to the
leadership of the FA Premier League, " said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson: Time for a Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Alex Ferguson fears Manchester
United's bid for European glory could be scuppered by the
Premiership's fixture congestion, according to the BBC on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Man United manager believes the only way to give English
teams a chance in continental competition is to impose a
mid-season break in domestic football.
</P>
<P>
United booked their place in the quarter-finals of the
European Champions' Cup with a 1-1 draw with Bayern Munich at Old
Trafford on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
But Ferguson is concerned his side might suffer a repeat of
last season's problems, when United cruised into the last eight
only to see their run ended by injuries.
</P>
<P>
"Come March a lot of things come into play and I hope I have
the same squad to pick from," Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
"I would be delighted if I were in that position because it is
so important to have all your players.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the teams like Dynamo Kiev can go for a break now and
get their injuries sorted out.
</P>
<P>
"They will go on a nice wee trip to the Canary Islands, while
we are battering through the winter, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson argues that Premier League bosses should be mindful
of advances made north of the border.
</P>
<P>
"I think we should take a leaf out of Scotland's book and take
a January break. I don't understand it, but that's why you need a
big group of players to cope with it.
</P>
<P>
"On pure ability I would be quite confident about our chances,
but come March I hope that ability and freshness will still be
there.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got seven games in December and that taxes you.
You just hope that you can come through that without any
injuries," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand pole vaulter Denis
Petuchinsky was stripped of the Commonwealth Games silver medal
awarded in Kuala Lumpur in September after he was tested positive
for banned substances.
</P>
<P>
Petuchinsky, a former Russian star who was granted New Zealand
citizenship just a few weeks ahead of the Games, was guilty for
traces of the steroid stanozolol.
</P>
<P>
The athlete attended the Games Federation Court on Thursday
when it was said on his behalf he had prescribed for him after an
appendix operation a legitimate drug containing stanozolol.
</P>
<P>
But court chairman Mike Fennell said after the hearing: "We
were not satisfied that the drug, taken in June, would be present
in the sample taken from the athlete three months later at the
Games."
</P>
<P>
Petuchinsky was barred from taking part in the next
Commonwealth Games in 2002 and faces a two-year ban when the
findings of Thursday's hearing are forwarded to the International
Amateur Athletic Federation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hopes Cambodia to be Admitted as Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said Indonesia hopes that the sixth Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit can decided to admit
Cambodia into its membership.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Cambodia can be admitted as a full member of ASEAN as
soon as possible considering that the country has successfully
solved the problems that prevented it from becoming a full
member," Alatas said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN put Cambodia's application for membership on hold in view
of the political turmoils that hit the country some time ago.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Cambodia now seemed to have overcome those
troubles.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement in the political situation in Cambodia,
there was no reason anymore to postpone the country's admission
into ASEAN membership, Alatas was quoted by Antara News Agency
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN had previously stipulated that Cambodia could join the
organization after it had formed a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Alatas admitted there were certain countries that had not yet
fully recognized the improvements in the situation in Cambodia.
They were still questioning various factors affecting the
coalition government formed by Hun Sen, including the setting up
of a Senate and the position of the Senate chairman in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Alatas said, the ASEAN ministers still had to hold
further discussions about the matters at the Ministerial Meeting
to be held December 12 through 14.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian delegation to the summit would be led by
President B.J. Habibie and further consist of a number of
government officials, including Alatas and the Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be held in Hanoi, Vietnam, on December 15-16,
was expected to adopt a "Hanoi Plan of Action" and "Hanoi
Declaration" as well as various agreements in trade and services,
Alatas added.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now comprises Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Thailand, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Hendry Sets to Quit Snooker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Six-time world snooker
champion Stephen Hendry disclosed Thursday that he is on the
brink of quitting the sport after the latest in a string of
dismal defeats.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish superstar was dumped out of the German Masters in
a 5-2 quarter-final mauling by Malta's Tony Drago.
</P>
<P>
And a demoralised Hendry then announced: "If I carry on like
this I'm seriously thinking of chucking it in at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
"It is just down to confidence. When I haven't got any I hate
playing the game.
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I want to do is take anything away from Tony.
He played really well and deserved to win but my form just gets
worse and worse, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Hendry, who for most of the 1990s has been perceived as almost
invincible within the game, suffered perhaps his worst defeat
ever, when he was whitewashed 9-0 by unknown Scot Marcus Campbell
in the UK Championship three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Hendry, who lost his world No.1 spot to fellow Scot John
Higgins earlier this year, added: "I'll still keep practising,
trying to solve the problem and I'll prepare properly for
tournaments, but I feel terrible about my game."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer
club Arsenal captain Tony Adams will be sidelined for months
after the defender underwent surgery on a back injury.
</P>
<P>
The England international is recovering in Florida after being
ordered by manager Arsene Wenger to rest the shoulder, which has
troubled him all season.
</P>
<P>
But despite the "very successful" operation, Adams admitted
the prospect of retirement, which he revealed last month was a
possibility, had not yet been dispelled.
</P>
<P>
"I'll try everything - anything - before I call it a day," he
told London's Evening Standard.
</P>
<P>
"Retirement is my very last option, but the reality of it is
that it is an option I must consider, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal had been hoping Adams would not need surgery for the
injury and the news of his continued absence is a further blow to
a club plagued by injuries.
</P>
<P>
Wenger already has headaches over the fitness of a host of
established stars, including Emmanuel Petit, Patrick Vieira, Marc
Overmars, Dennis Bergkamp, Martin Keown and Remi Garde.
</P>
<P>
Adams has not played since the Champions' League defeat by
Lens on November 27.

ATHENS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Greek branch of the human

demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy in Athens to protest against
the ongoing execution of convicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, dressed in black, hang an effigy of the Statue

Kostis Papaioannou, president of AI's Greek branch, handed a

Nearly 500 people have been reportedly executed in the U.S.
since the death penalty began to be re-enforced in 1977.

<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- All three main European stock
markets suffered Thursday from weakness on Wall Street, a weak
dollar and the nervousness of the approach of the euro.
</P>
<P>
UK shares drifted on the day. There was a muted reaction from
leading shares to the Bank of England's decision to cut the cost
of borrowing by 0.5 percent to 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts had expected the cut in rates and traders
remain cautious about the deterioration in the UK economy.
</P>
<P>
At the close the FTSE 100 index of leading shares had dropped
slightly by 8.8 points to 5,660.
</P>
<P>
"The rate cut was already factored in and the consensus
believes it is wholly warranted," said Richard Jeffrey of
Charterhouse Bank.
</P>
<P>
German Xetra Dax finished 26.27 points lower at 4,650.30. The
key share index traded in a range between 4,741.9 and 4,606.66.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment mirrored the rest of continental Europe, constrained
by Wall Street's sell-off when trade got under way in New York
with Paris Cac 40 finished 25.27 points lower at 3,746.97.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Determined to Visit Mideast Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Thursday that he was determined to go to the Holy Land this
weekend despite the fact there are diplomatic potholes and
security hazards on his path.
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged the difficult circumstances he will
encounter on the three-day visit to Israel and the
Palestinian-controlled land in the West Bank, but he told a White
House ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights that he was committed to pushing for
peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinians and Israelis are struggling to bridge mutual
distrust to implement the Wye accords," Clinton said, referring to
the agreement he helped forge in October at the Wye River
Plantation in Maryland between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The trip, agreed as part of the Wye negotiations, comes at a
time as Israel's peacemaking with the Palestinians is on hold,
Israeli internal politics is in turmoil and Palestinian-Israeli
violence is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Members of Netanyahu's cabinet have publicly called on Clinton
to stay home, but Clinton's aides insist it still makes sense for
the president to visit Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
during his three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said on Thursday that
Clinton believes it was important that he carry through on a
commitment that was "an important part" of the Wye agreement in
which Israel pledged further withdrawals from the West Bank in
exchange for firmer Palestinian security assurances.

William Cohen will visit Germany and meet German officials next
week en route to a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty

Cohen will fly to Bonn Sunday and is expected to meet

including Germany's plans for an in-depth study of its defense
needs and military spending, according to U.S. officials.

The new Bonn government created a major stir within NATO
recently with a call for the alliance to change its policy
developed during the Cold War and declare that it would no longer
be the first to use nuclear weapons against an enemy.
</P>
<P>
That call by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer at a

<HEADLINE> Britain to Allow Human Egg Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The watchdog that controls
fertility treatment in Britain said Thursday that the practice of
egg sharing will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) said
that instead a ban that it had been considering, the organization
would be drawing up tighter guidelines to regulate the procedure.
</P>
<P>
The HFEA also decided that payments to sperm and egg donors
would be allowed to continue for the foreseeable future.
Previously, the authority had said it would like to see an end to
such payments.
</P>
<P>
"The HFEA believes that the donation of sperm or eggs to create
new life should be a gift freely and voluntarily given," Ruth
Deech, chairman of the HFEA, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, she added that "it has become clear that the removal
of payments in the present climate would seriously jeopardize the
supply of sperm donors."
</P>
<P>
Egg sharing involves a woman, whose only means of becoming
pregnant is to undergo in-vitro fertilization (IVF), agreeing to
donate her eggs to a recipient who cannot produce eggs in return
for the IVF treatment.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, egg and sperm donors in Britain can be paid up
to 15 pounds (25 U.S. dollars) as "expenses." Most sperm donors
are students, and in particular medical students.
</P>
<P>
Recently there has been a shortage of donors in the UK, and
part of the reason is that some donors fear they may in the future
be sought out by any children conceived with their sperm.

LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced Thursday that
it plans to lead an international efforts to save the world's
coral reefs, which have come under severe threat from rising sea
temperatures and pollution.
</P>
<P>
The UK is to press for all the scientific work on coral reef
and other ocean problems to be brought together in a single,
powerful U.N. body, John Prescott, the British Deputy Prime
Minister, told a meeting on the world's ocean held in London.
</P>
<P>
That way, Mr Prescott said, there will be a better chance of
seeing just how bad the situation is and acting effectively to
prevent it worsening.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said that he would make the proposal to the
forthcoming meeting of the U.N.'s Commission on Sustainable
Development, to be held in New York in April, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Coral reefs need the most urgent action, Prescott said, because
"the evidence is that 10 percent of the world's coral reefs may
already be degraded beyond recovery, and 60 percent may now face a
medium to high threat of destruction."

<P>
To ease inflation is one of the priorities of the government.
In 1997, the inflation rate reached as high as 151 percent. The
government projected a 45 percent inflation rate for this year.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Reports Iraq's interference with UN Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq interfered with at
least two other U.N. arms teams during the past week, a U.N.
report said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report was the second weekly summary produced by the Untied
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction since Baghdad announced to
resume full cooperation with the Untied Nations on November 14.
</P>
<P>
The report for the first time revealed the two other incidents,
both five days ago. There were reports Iraq blocked U.N. arms
inspectors from entering a site in its capital on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said during a chemical monitoring inspection on
December 5, Iraq's representatives "placed unacceptable conditions
on the photography of bombs, citing national security concerns. No
photographs were taken."
</P>
<P>
An inspection by a biological weapons team, also on December 5,
was postponed for one day after Iraq "imposed conditions on the
conduct of the inspection on a Friday," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Iraq unsuccessfully sought to prevent the
team from photocopying a set of documents the following day.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM report said during chemical monitoring inspections,
"undeclared dual-use pieces of production equipment, once again,
were found."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday's incident, the summary said there was evidence
that the site "contained materials of significance to UNSCOM's
disarmament mandate."
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM is providing the Untied Nations Security Council with
brief weekly reports on its work prior to a possible comprehensive
review by the Council on Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, is expected to
provide the U.N. chief with a more detailed report early next week
on how far Iraq has complied with its promise to resume full and
unconditional cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Universal Declaration Reaffirmed as Common Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly session Thursday adopted a resolution at its plenary
meeting, recognizing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as
"a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all
nations."
</P>
<P>
The resolution also described the declaration as "the source of
inspiration and a basis of subsequent progress in the field of
human rights."
</P>
<P>
The resolution, submitted by President of the General Assembly
Didier Opertti, was adopted by consensus on the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stressed "the necessity for further national
efforts as well as enhanced international cooperation, with a view
to fully realizing all human rights and fundamental freedoms,
including the need to promote greater awareness of the rights" set
forth in the declaration and other international human rights
instruments.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reaffirmed that all human rights are universal,
indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that the
international community must treat human rights globally in a fair
and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis.
</P>
<P>
The adoption is part of the activities in commemoration of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the General
Assembly on December 10, 1948.
</P>
<P>
Adopted in the aftermath of World War II, the U.N. document was
intended to prevent the repetition of the horrors of Holocaust and
other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which has been translated into more than 200
languages, has become the most quoted international human rights
document.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Election Commission Rejects Fines for Clinton, Dole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Election
Commission (FEC) Thursday unanimously refused to order the
campaigns of President Bill Clinton and former Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole to pay back millions of dollars in
taxpayer funds for violating spending limits.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners voted 6-0 against their auditors'
recommendation that Clinton and Dole repay millions because they
illegally coordinated advertising run by the Democratic and
Republican parties, causing their 1996 presidential campaigns to
exceed spending limits.
</P>
<P>
The commission had already decided Wednesday to reduce any
possible Dole repayment by millions of dollars by considering
Republican ads as expenditures for the primary rather than the
general election, changing the repayment formula.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote, limited to the repayment issue, didn't
definitively resolve whether the party ads should be considered
contributions to the Clinton and Dole efforts.
</P>
<P>
The auditors still are expected to refer the issue for
investigation by the FEC's enforcement division. But it is deemed
doubtful the commission would approve any other enforcement action
after rejecting the repayment. Four votes are needed for the FEC
to take action.
</P>
<P>
The commissioners made it clear they didn't accept the
auditors' reasoning.
</P>
<P>
"I don't adopt the recommendations, I don't adopt the findings,
and I don't adopt the legal analysis," said Commissioner Karl
Sandstrom, a Democratic appointee.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lee Ann Elliott, a Republican, said party "issue
ads" shouldn't be considered campaign spending if they don't
specifically urge people to vote.
</P>
<P>
Russell Verney, head of Ross Perot's Reform Party, said he
wasn't surprised by the vote. "Their function is to protect the
parties," he said of the commissioners.

<HEADLINE> Geologists Say Glaciers Suppress Volcanic Eruptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- New research into the past
800,000 years has shown that glaciers prompted volcanic eruptions
after they retreated north.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have known for decades that large erupting volcanoes
such as Mt. St. Helens in Washington and Mt. Pinatubo in the
Philippines can alter climate by spewing smoke, gases and ash into
the atmosphere. However, the opposite also occurs -- that
environmental change can trigger volcanic eruptions.
</P>
<P>
Reporting at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting in
San Francisco Tuesday, Dr. Allen F. Glazner, professor of
geological sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, said that they have performed field and laboratory research
and reached the above conclusion.
</P>
<P>
He said that when they looked at almost the last million years
of geologic activity in eastern California, they found that
volcanoes tended to erupt between glacial cycles. When the
glaciers were present, he said, the volcanoes were pretty much
subdued. When the glaciers retreated, volcanoes became much more
active.
</P>
<P>
Previous study had shown a similar pattern around islands and
coastlines. But how glaciers suppress eruptions is not known,
Glazner said.
</P>
<P>
One possibility, he said, is that all the extra weight of the
glacial ice holds the magma or molten rock in place. When the ice
melts and the water evaporates, less weight on the Earth's crust
triggers volcanoes to erupt.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why they are interested in the connection between a
natural process-volcanism and climate, he said that partly they
want to know how much of the recent global warming is due to
people burning fossil fuels and how much is just natural.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Iraqi Refusal Serious, Attack Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen on Thursday described as a "very serious situation"
the refusal by Iraq to allow U.N. inspectors into a ruling Baath
Party office, and warned it could prompt a no-notice military
action.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with (UNSCOM Chairman Richard) Butler," he told
reporters at a photo session with Georgian Defense Minister Gen.
Lt. David Tevzadze. Butler said on Wednesday that Iraq's
prevention of of U.N. inspectors from entering the Baath party
office for checking.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is important for the U.N. inspectors to "be
allowed to complete their mission."
</P>
<P>
"We intend to wait until the completion of his inspections and
that of his team before coming to any conclusion about the nature
of the lack of cooperation on the part of Saddam Hussein," Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Iraq is still subject to U.S. attack at any time
without warning, Cohen replied: "The answer is yes."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer told
a group of defense writers that U.S. forces who were ready to go
to the Persian Gulf generally had an attitude of "let's do it and
get it over with."
</P>
<P>
But he declined to concede that Saddam Hussein had
out-manuevered the United States. "I think every time we use the
military option, we get Saddam Hussein's attention," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Replace B-52s Near Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
sending seven B-52 bombers to the island of Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean to replace seven B-52s now based there in a routine

<HEADLINE> German Government Wants to Reduce One Million Jobless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The German government wants to
reduce unemployment by one million people by the end its
legislative term in the year 2002, Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new German government staked its political fortunes on a
large reduction in the number of jobless, if the government failed
to achieve its goal, "we will have failed", Lafontaine said in an
interview with German ZDF television.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless in Germany currently stands at 3.9
million, or the unemployment rate stands by 10.2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Lowering the number of unemployed from nearly four million to
three million by 2002 would "be quite a success", Lafontaine said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a leading cabinet member mentioned a
specific figure in connection with a reduction of high
unemployment in Germany which has puzzled the German government
for the past years.
</P>
<P>
The German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has so far refrained
from mentioning a specific figure about a reduction of jobless in
Germany, since he came to power last September.
