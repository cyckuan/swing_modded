<HEADLINE> US Spy Base in UK Taps Phones For MI5, Independent says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22, (Xinhua) -- Britain's MI5 and MI6, the
security services, are believed to be evading British regulations
on telephone-tapping by seeking a US overseas spy base in Britain
to do it for them.
</P>
<P>
A university computer lecturer who has made a study of
electronic eavesdropping told the Independent on Sunday he
understood that the 1760 staff at the heavily-guarded base called
Menwith Hill in Yorkshire, England were used regularly to tap
phones in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"If the security service wants to tap your phone and wants
nobody to know, there are two ways they can do it: illegally - or,
entirely above board, ask US personnel at Menwith Hill do do it,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications industry experts and the pressure group
Liberty fear the top-secret US listening-post is being used by
Britain's intelligence agencies and police to avoid the
requirement to obtain Home Office warrants authorizing tapping.
</P>
<P>
Under US law, the phone-tapping of foreign nationals in a
foreign country does not require any license. Even though it is on
British soil, Menwith Hill is US-owned and regarded by the US
government as under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Liberty said it had been concerned for some time that "a US
base is spying on British citizens and that spying is unregulated
by British law".
</P>
<P>
John Wadham, its director, accused the Government of "turning a
blind eye to what is going on". Menwith Hill, he claimed, was a
violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights,
preserving the privacy of the individual.
</P>
<P>
Liberty is so concerned that it is prepared to go to the
European Court of Human Rights. Geoff Hoon, Labor MP and
telecommunications spokesman, said it was "worrying if Menwith
Hill is behaving in this way".

<HEADLINE> Dalian Keeps Winning Streak in China Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Dalian Wanda recovered from a
0-1 deficit in the 10th minute to outplay Guangdong Hongyuan 3-2
Sunday in Dalian, keeping its momentum in the China's professional
Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
Wanda's Wang Tao took the limelight with a hat-trick in the
neck-to-neck match.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Hongyuan opened the scoring 10 minutes into the
match while Wang Tao responded with two goals in a span of five
minutes, making Dalian a 2-1 lead in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Yao Debiao pulled back two-all for Guangdong in the 49th
minute. But Wang Tao, 1.94 meters, finally broke the deadlock and
scored the winner in the injury time.
</P>
<P>
Although the win, Chi Shangbin, head coach of Dalian, was not
very satisfied with his players, saying they were a little bit
nervous. "They were on pressure at home and also had the problem
in defense."
</P>
<P>
Dalian remains atop in the team standings with 39 points out of
11 wins and six ties.
</P>
<P>
In other matches Sunday, defending champion Shanghai Shenhua
edged Yanbian Hyundai 1-0 in a home match. Forward Xie Hui scored
the only goal with a header on a free kick of his teammate Shen Si
at the closing time.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was second in the standings at 32 points, followed by
Chinese Army at 28 and Guangzhou Apollo, 27.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Apollo was beaten by Beijing Guo'an, runner-up last
season, 0-1. Chinese Army scored a 2-0 win over Guangzhou Songri,
new comer in the Serie A this season and the bottom of the tally
with 10 points, having one victory, seven draws and nine defeats.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Sangsung conceded 0-1 to Jinan Taishan in its
away-match.

<HEADLINE> African TV Producers Lack Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Inadequate funding and lack
of support of producers by African television stations are the
major problems faced by film-makers in the region.
</P>
<P>
At a three-day workshop of the Pan African Union of Women
Film-Makers (UPAFI) which began in Harare on Sunday, participants
said distribution of their productions within Africa and overseas
was poor.
</P>
<P>
UPAFI's east African representative Anne Mungai told the
workshop lack of finance for the organization was affecting
communication among members because there was no budgetary
allocation to enable networking.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 regional representatives of UPAFI which will go
into a closed working session on Tuesday on projects and
financing issues.
</P>
<P>
UPAFO coordinator Aminata Ouedraogo said the idea was to
foster closer cooperation which could be used as a platform to
lobby governments and increase women's opportunities in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to unite all cinema practitioners and give new
image of women in cinema," she said.

<HEADLINE> Jumping to Flea Market in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- One morning, the telephone
at the Huaihai Used Goods Store in Shanghai rang 50 times.
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls bombarded the once-silent second-hand shop
after it carried an advertisement announcing it will open a
second-hand computer market.
</P>
<P>
A shop employee said all of the calls were made to ask the
prices of the outdated computers, which had been abandoned by
enterprises. Some of the calls came from parents who want their
children to learn beginning computer skills; others were made by
college students who must complete schoolwork or write resumes.
</P>
<P>
In China's largest industrial city, the market for second-hand
goods is at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
During the course of large-scale urban reconstruction,
disposing of used furniture and household appliances has been a
headache for many Shanghai citizens. But used items are filling
shops throughout the city, and many people, including the city's
migrant workers, are eager to nab some of life's necessities at a
lower cost.
</P>
<P>
Every day, groups of migrants swarm to the Dongjie flea market
to buy small pieces of furniture, black and white TVs, and other
odds and ends. Some pedlars also flock there to buy used garments
to re-sell to people in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
For many Shanghainese, hunting for used goods is a hobby. Old
clocks or watches, musical instruments, books or magazines, and
fine-quality furniture have become popular among flea market
patrons.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that in the next few years, out of nostalgia,
Shanghai residents will decorate their homes with used antiques.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Wanbo Antiques Company has collected several
old-fashioned dressing tables and chairs, piling them in a
warehouse which has several hundred square meters of storage space.
</P>
<P>
The city has at least five companies similar to Wanbo, each
with a yearly business turnover of more than 500,000 yuan (about
60,000 US dollars). And numerous small stores are selling antique
furniture made of padauk, a hard wood.

ISLAMABAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) will make a further investment of 629 million US

Tariq Saigol said investment opportunities still exist in the

ATHENS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece's 8.5 million voters
went to polls today to elect a new 300-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The last opinion polls showed the ruling Panhellenic Socialist

to neck with both losing voters to four smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the two major parties, the Political Spring Party,
Communist Party of Greece, the Coalition of the Left and Progress
and newly-established Democratic Social Movement are the main
hopefuls to win seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Greek President Kostis Stephanopoulos, PASOK President and
Prime Minister Costas Simitis as well as other party leaders cast
their ballot in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the reinforced proportional electional system, the party
with the largest vote is virtually guaranteed power.

<P>
KATHMANDU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An international oncology
conference opened here today with local health experts calling for
public awareness on cancer in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day conference, Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba said his government is planning to establish a
specialized cancer treatment center in the eastern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to tobacco as one of the deadliest carcinogens, Deuba
underlined the need to educate the public against smoking.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has agreed on the recommendations of
anti-cancer groups to impose rules against smoking in public
places and levy taxes on tobacco products with a view to
discouraging smoking, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nepali health experts attending the conference urged the
government to impose restrictions on production of cigarettes in
the country.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the government and political parties in the
country to launch a campaign for promoting public awareness on
cancer and stopping cigarette advertising in the government media.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government was
urged today to take harsh measures against fishermen who net
small fishes in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The Fishermen Cooperative Society in Busia District, western
Kenya, said the fish in Lake Victoria has become scarce because
most of the fishermen are using small fishing nets which were
trapping even young fishes which are not mature for consumption.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the quantity of fish in different beaches in Port
Victoria has gone down drastically, said the non-governmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
The lake is shared by three east African nations including
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> UK Chancellor Faces Crunch over Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke warned today that Britain must sign up to
a single currency with the first wave of countries provided it was
in the national economic interest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC radio, the Chancellor said it would be
"pathetic" for Britain "to do its traditional business of not
being able to make their minds up and then joining late".
</P>
<P>
Claiming that it was now "very likely" that a single currency
would come about, Clarke said it "could offer prospects of
stability, low interest rates, and a zone of economic conditions
which attract inward investment and stimulate growth of trade".
</P>
<P>
Britain withdrew sterling from the original Exchange Rate
Mechanism (ERM) in September 1992 after intense speculation in
foreign exchange markets pushed it lower.
</P>
<P>
European finance ministers meeting in Dublin agreed on the
architecture of a new currency grid to be set up after European
Monetary Union (EMU) to limit fluctuations between the
newly-launched Euro single currency and currencies waiting to join
when their economies are ready.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe that British ministers are
ready to challenge Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's defiant stand in
support of European Monetary Union and his refusal to change the
Government's "wait and see" policy.
</P>
<P>
Senior Tories now acknowledge that increasingly visible
divisions mean Prime Minister Major will have to decide whether to
rule out a single currency during the next Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lord Tebbit yesterday urged the move even if it cost the
Chancellor's resignation and possibly that of deputy prime
minister Michael Heseltine, claiming it was a "price worth paying"
to win the election.
</P>
<P>
The observers expect that row will reach a head at a political
Cabinet meeting before the Conservative Party conference, where
grassroots Tories have tabled nearly 200 motions hostile to Europe
or opposing a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Clarke attacked Lord Tebbit for having "got so out
of tune" with party policy and for fuelling a "civil war" that
would help Labor leader Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Clarke insisted that the Cabinet's position to decide in due
course whether to join a single currency must stand, saying "it
was reaffirmed by the full Cabinet five months ago".

<HEADLINE> Olympic Foursome to Renew Rivalry in Shanghai WVGP Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The top four teams from the
Atlanta Olympic Games will renew their intense rivalry when they
line up for the World Volleyball Grand Prix Finals in Shanghai on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four teams Cuba, China, Brazil and Russia all took their
places in the 470,000 U.S. dollars Shanghai Finals after
four-week, eight-preliminary tournaments held in Sendai, Jakarta,
Osaka, Beijing, Honolulu, Macau, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
China, who won the Sendai and Macau tournaments, finished third
among the top four qualifiers after their strong performances in
the preliminary events.
</P>
<P>
Organizers could not have asked for a better lineup for the
Finals as teh countries involved were all among the top four at
the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
It is also a repeat of the 1993 Finals when Cuba won the title
ahead of China, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Brazil, second place to Cuba in the preliminaries, won the
1994 Finals while the United States took up honors last year.
</P>
<P>
China, who like Cuba and Brazil, has reached the Finals every
year since the tournament's inception in 1993, will be hoping to
capture its first overall title in front of home fans.
</P>
<P>
The United States, South Korea, the Netherlands and Japan were
fifth to eighth places respectively and disqualified for the
Finals.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain, Biggest Arab Aluminum-Producing Country: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain said it is the
biggest Arab aluminum-producing country, and ranks third as far
as the world aluminum output is concerned, according to the head
of the Bahraini-Saudi Aluminum-Marketing Company (BSAMC).
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Saqr el Khalifa, the BSAMC chairman, was quoted by
Bahraini newspaper Akhbar El-Khalij today as saying that
Bahrain's aluminum output accounts for as much as 53 percent of
the total aluminum output of all Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
El Khalifa pointed out that though the aluminum industry is
sophisticated and very complicated, 84 percent of those engaged
in it in the country are Bahrainis, and most of the production
executives are natives of Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's aluminum sales last year amounted to 820 million
U.S. dollars, compared with 630 million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The country's aluminum sales within the Arab world including
itself reached 370 million dollars last year, compared with 260
million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's aluminum sales to other countries of the world
especially those of the Far East in 1995 totaled 450 million
dollars, compared with 370 million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
El Khalifa expected Bahrain's aluminum sales in 1996 will come
to approximately as much as those in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Congratulates Netanyahu On Jewish New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat phoned Israeli Prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today to wish him a prosperous Jewish new year of
5757, which started on September 14.
</P>
<P>
The call was made on the eve of the Jewish Yom Kippur Holiday
today.
</P>
<P>
The move is apparently a good-will gesture of the Palestinian
leader for the Israeli rightwing Likud leader. The two men met
and shook hands for the first time on September 4, an action
that demonstrated a U-turn in Netanyahu's attitude toward Arafat,
whom he called "terrorist" only a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
Jews throughout Israel are joining their coreligionists around
the world in marking Yom Kippur, which started tonight. The
holiday is marked by a 25-hour fast and a complete shutdown of
all public services.
</P>
<P>
Programs of Israel Radio and Israel Television are suspended
along with air flights and other public transport services.
</P>
<P>
The fast began at 5 p.m. and will end Monday at 6:12
p.m.. Special services are to be held in synagogues tonight and
all day Monday. Thousands of worshipers are expected to come to
the Western Wall in Jerusalem during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
This year's Yom Kippur is shadowed by tensions between Israel
and Syria on the Golan Heights and between Israel and Lebanon
along their entire common border.
</P>
<P>
During Yom Kippur in 1973, Syria, along with other Arab
countries, launched a surprise attack on Israeli troops on the
Golan Heights Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Accuses Israel of Trying to Create Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak today accused Israel of trying to create a problem with
Egypt by expressing concern over Egypt's massive military
exercises which ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli prime minister wants to make a problem," Mubarak
said. "I never imagined that he would create this problem."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks after the Israeli press reported
Friday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu objected to
the maneuvers and expressed concern over them.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that if Netanyahu felt concern, he should
contact Egypt and "we would speak frankly."
</P>
<P>
After receiving an army's report on the exercises, code-named
"Badr '96," he said that Netanyahu had no reason to worry about
the maneuvers, the largest ever conducted by the Egyptian armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
"The games were code-named Badr in 1993, during the time of
(late Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin, and now they are called Badr
during the time of Netanyahu, so why should this upset them?" he
said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian troops ended Friday 10 days of maneuvers participated
by 35,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi has
said that the exercises were not directed against anybody.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Egypt would fully respect the peace
agreements which Egypt signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say that we have a peace treaty with Israel and we
fully respect our treaties," he said.

<HEADLINE> Six Groups Win in Macao LA Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Six groups representing the
interests of business, labor and neighborhood committees won today
in the last election of Macao's Legislative Assembly (LA) before
1999.
</P>
<P>
The group of the Macao Economic Promotion Association formed by
business people won 12,029 votes, topping the list of 12 groups,
while the group of the neighborhood committee came second with
11,045 votes.
</P>
<P>
Each of the two groups had two people elected.
</P>
<P>
The group of labor obtained 10,528 votes, listing on third with
one person elected.
</P>
<P>
The other victorious groups are the Macao Prosperity League,
the Macao Construction League and the Democratic New Macao. Their
votes range between 6,300 and 7,500 and each had one people
elected.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight members of the 23-seat LA were to be directly
elected today, while eight were to be indirectly elected by
interest groups. The remaining seven are to be appointed by the
Macao governor.
</P>
<P>
A total of 74,964 voters out of the 116,000 registered voters
took part in today's balloting, braving a humid weather and heavy
rains. The voter turnout was 64.38 percent, the highest in the
history of Macao's LA.
</P>
<P>
The surge in the number of actual voters and the increase in
candidates, which rose to 62 of 12 groups, show that Macao people
are becoming increasingly confident of their future, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Carvalho, a Macao Government official in charge of
election affairs, told reporters that he was quite satisfied with
the enthusiasm of voters, saying that it has met the government
expectations.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the number of candidates indicates that people
are paying more attention to the election," said Tang Chou Kei,
deputy editor-in-chief of the Va Kio newspaper. "They also wish a
better future for Macao. The enthusiasm will help the society move
in a positive way."
</P>
<P>
Today's voting was basically in good order. Within the
balloting period from nine o'clock this morning to eight o'clock
in the evening, the number of people grew steadily despite a heavy
rain in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The authorities established 14 voting sites in the Macao
peninsula and its two islands. Bus companies increased buses to
carry people to the voting sites.
</P>
<P>
The 12 competing groups represent the interests of different
groups ranging from the labor, neighborhood associations, business
to liberal organizations, among others.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's IFP, ANC to Meet on Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) said today it would meet with the African
National Congress (ANC) to discuss the finalization of the
national constitution.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary for us to meet with a delegation of the
ruling party because the constitution is the law of the country,"
IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said IFP's National Chairman Frank Mdlalose who is
also Premier of the Kwazulu/Natal, had sought to meet Thabo
Mbeki, Deputy President of the ANC, stressing the need for South
Africa to strike a settlement on the Kwazulu/Natal issue by a new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The ANC had declared itself open to talks with the IFP over
the national constitution, but so far it has not responded to the
call by the IFP.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the Constitutional Assembly early last
year, citing ANC's failure to honor an agreement on international
mediation on some major constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's new constitution, adopted by the Constitutional
Assembly in May this year, was rejected by the Constitutional
Court on September 6.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the court ruling, the proposed constitution failed
to be certified because it did not comply with all of the 34
constitutional principles demanded by the interim constitution.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest in Paris Visit of Pope Paul II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people
demonstrated this afternoon in Paris, protesting the visit being
made by Pope John Paul II in France and calling for the protection
of the secular identity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Singing revolutionary songs and shouting revolutionary slogans,
the demonstrators, including members of leftist groups,
ecologists, anarchists and pro-abortion activists, numbered
15,000 at the peak of the demonstration, according to organizers
of the protest.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were particularly angry with the ceremony
held today in Reims marking the 1500th anniversary of the baptism
of an ancient French king, Clovis, which was presided by the pope
and cost tens of millions of francs.
</P>
<P>
Alain Krivine, spokesman of the Revolutionary Communist League,
said that by claiming the baptism of Clovis to be the baptism of
France, it is imposing Catholicism as a national ideology on
France.
</P>
<P>
"We already have Debre and Le Pen. (To add) the pope, it is
really too much," he said.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jean Debre has been much criticized for his
hardline policy towards illegal immigrants, while the National
Front president Jean-Marie Le Pen is under fire from both right
and left political forces for his repeated racist speeches.
</P>
<P>
Senator Jean-Luc Melenchon from the Socialist Party said:
"France is neither Catholic, nor Islamic, nor a non-believer. It
is Republican and secular."
</P>
<P>
He warned of the danger of Catholicism becoming again an
imposed religion as it was in Medieval France.
</P>
<P>
Some pro-abortion activists were holding banners which read:
"My body belongs to myself," expressing opposition to any
attempt to ban abortion in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators said that it is not the paperless immigrants
but the pope who should be expelled on a charter plane from
France.

BELGRADE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Parliament
Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik said on Sunday the Serb entity in Bosnia
would insist on the full implementation of Dayton accords because
there exists no other alternatives.

Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the consistent implementation of the
provisions of the Dayton agreement," Krajisnik said in an
interview to the local radio of Serbian city of Kragujevac, which
was carried by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>

<HEADLINE> At Least 400 Million Dollars Spent in Lobbying for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Special interests spent at
least 400 million dollars trying to influence the federal
government in the first half of 1996, according to an analysis of
the first disclosures under a new lobbying law.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures ranged from millions to less than 10,000 dollars.
Experts say the figure is probably conservative.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're at all out of bounds with the thought of
a billion-dollar-a-year industry," said Ron Shaiko, an American
University professor who teaches lobbying.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press derived the 400 million spending total by
randomly sampling one of every 50 of the more than 9,000 lobbying
reports on file at Capitol Hill and using their reported lobbying
expenses to project an industry-wide total.
</P>
<P>
In addition, AP randomly reviewed some 1,800 reports in greater
detail, and searched the reports of 200 of the most active players
in Washington. Those methods further bolstered the 400 million
figure.
</P>
<P>
Among the largest spenders in the first half of 1996:
</P>
<P>
--Philip Morris, 11.3 million dollars. The tobacco giant spent
its money primarily in a fight to keep tobacco products from
coming under regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
--The American Medical Association, 8.5 million dollars. The
nation's largest professional group for doctors lobbied on
Medicare and Medicaid, tobacco regulation, health care and
legislation to change liability reform.
</P>
<P>
--The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 7.5 million dollars. The
chamber lobbied heavily on behalf of the Republican "Contract with
America," which included many business-friendly provisions.
</P>
<P>
Under a law that took effect January 1, groups that lobby on
federal legislation or regulations must file reports estimating
their expenditures twice a year. The first were due beginning
August 15.
</P>
<P>
Other major spenders this year include General Motors, the
Christian Coalition, General Electric, the Chemical Manufacturers
Association, AT&AMP;T, pharmaceutical maker Pfizer, and banking giant
Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of other interests reported spending more than one
million dollars, including major players in the oil,
telecommunications, defense and pharmaceutical industries.

<HEADLINE> Greek Communist Party Satisfied with Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the Communist
Party of Greece (KKE) Aleka Papariga tonight expressed her
satisfaction over the elections result.
</P>
<P>
According to Papariga, the election result was characterized by
two positive features.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, she said, was the reduction in the strength of the two
big parties and secondly, the increase in the KKE's share of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
The latest announcement from the interior ministry based on 50
percent of the votes accounted so far showed the ruling
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) is winning the victory with
41.7 percent and the main opposition New Democracy Party with 38.7
percent. Both recorded a significant fall from the 1993 general
elections when the former got 46.9 percent and latter 39.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Greece, however, got 5.2 percent of the
votes this time compared with 4.5 percent in 1993 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Papariga believed that KKE could now play a more substantial
role and protect the rights of workers.
</P>
<P>
She also attacked the current electoral law which favors the
big parties, describing it as "daylight robbery".
</P>
<P>
The leader of another left-wing party -- Coalition of the Left
and Progress Nikos Konstantopoulos described the election result
as a "great victory" for his party.
</P>
<P>
The party is expected to wing 4.9 percent of the votes and
entered the parliament for the first time with some 10 seats.
</P>
<P>
"The Coalition is the political force which changes the
political scene," he said in a televised statement.

<HEADLINE> Kontic: Foundation Laid for Long-term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister
Radoje Kontic said Sunday the foundations had been laid for a
long-term and stable cooperation between Yugoslavia and Romania.
</P>
<P>
During the Yugoslav-Romanian talks, both sides agreed that the
upcoming lifting of the international sanctions on Yugoslavia gave
wider space for the promotion of bilateral relations, conducive to
the signing of a number of inter-state accords during the
three-day visit, said Kontic upon his arrival to Belgrade after an
official visit to Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, the sanctions against Yugoslavia
will be automatically lifted 10 days after the successful holding
of the Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
Kontic described his visit to Romania as significant for
enhancing bilateral cooperation, especially economic, and added
that the volume of trade could reach 450 million U.S. dollars in
1997, while exchange could be doubled in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav businessmen who went to Romania with him had signed a
15-million-dollar contract, and the signing of new contracts was
to be expected in the period to come.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five agreements were also signed -- three in
agriculture, one in industry and one in tourism, Kontic said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added he had fruitful and useful talks with
Romanian leaders, including Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu,
President Ion Iliescu, Lower House Speaker Adrian Nastae, and
Senate President Oliviu German.
</P>
<P>
All were unanimous in their commitment for a further
development of overall relations with Yugoslavia and lent
unreserved support for Yugoslavia's reincorporation into the
international community, Kontic said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about economic cooperation with Romania, he said
accords had been reached on liberalizing mutual trade and
conditions for free circulation of goods and capital, as well as a
number of non-monetary payments accords.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed it is necessary to improve border trade and
encourage the development of higher forms of cooperation, as well
as financial and banking cooperation," Kontic added.

<HEADLINE> Coal-Rich Shanxi to Have More Expressways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- North China's mountainous
Shanxi Province will have another new expressway by October 1.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the expressway will be in
operation by China's National Day, which falls on October 1. It
starts in Yangqu near the provincial capital Taiyuan, and ends in
Wusu in the south.
</P>
<P>
The expressway, the second of its kind in this province, is
jointly funded by Shanxi and the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 26-km expressway, which will join National
Highway No.108, began in July of 1993. The project plan also
includes the building of six bridges.
</P>
<P>
The province's first expressway, the Taiyuan-Jiuguan
Expressway, opened in June.
</P>
<P>
The operation of this 2.8-billion-yuan expressway, which
zigzags through the Taihang Ranges, makes the National Highway
No.307 from Qingdao, a port city in east China's Shandong
Province, to Yinchuan, the capital of northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region, a thoroughfare inside this coal-rich
province.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, China's leading coal producer, is located in the Loess
Plateau, with the Taihang Ranges to the east and Luliang Mountain
in the west. Inadequate basic facilities used to hinder the
transportation of locally-produced coal outside the province, as
well as hindering the speed of Shanxi's opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
The building of more expressways will help solve these
problems, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They held that the province, with help from the Ministry of
Communications and other central government departments, as well
as cooperation from neighboring provinces, is planning the
construction of four more expressways at the turn of this century,
including a 94-km six-lane expressway from Taiyuan to Yuanping,
north of Taiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work for the construction of this expressway is
underway. The project should be complete in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Builds Farmland on Polder Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,550 square kilometers
of polder area have been converted into cultivated land in east
China's Zhejiang Province, local statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The area is equal to the size of four middle-sized counties in
Zhejiang, where the per capita share of farmland is only 0.03
hectares.
</P>
<P>
So far three development zones have been built on the marshy
polder areas.
</P>
<P>
The Donggang Economic Development Zone in Zhoushan City has
built on 12 sq. km. of polder area, and sold the land use rights
to domestic and overseas investors at a price of 2.7 million yuan
per ha.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the zone gained a profit of 10 million yuan from land
sales, which have been used for the reclamation of more marsh land.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to turn 16,000 ha of polder area into land
for agricultural, or other use in the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Yantai Economic and Technological Develop Zone Prospering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A decade of development and
construction have transformed a one-time seaside wilderness into a
booming business area.
</P>
<P>
The economic and technological development zone in coastal city
Yantai, in east China's Shandong Province, is now a popular
investment spot.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the development zone has approved
contracts for the establishment of 805 foreign-funded businesses
and inter-regional cooperation enterprises, with contracts
involving almost two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far, 184 enterprises in the zone have started industrial
production, including 133 foreign-funded ones. A total of 6.88
billion yuan has been spent on fixed assets in the zone, where an
economic frame supported with machinery, electronic, food
processing and chemical fiber industries, has begun to take shape.
</P>
<P>
The development zone created 2.02 billion yuan in gross
domestic product (GDP) last year, up 24.9 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, the zone imported and
exported commodities worth 200 million U.S. dollars, and realized
87.65 million yuan in revenues, a rise of 39.7 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Yantai, located in the eastern coast of the Shandong Peninsula,
was one of the first coastal cities designated to open to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
The Yantai economic and technological development zone, which
started construction in 1985, covers the 10-km-long shore along
the Yellow Sea at Taozi Bay, and has a planned development area of
36 sq km. This area used to be a place of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Ten years of intensive construction has brought about a new
modern town, with sound basic facilities, and the development zone
is now capable of offering quality services in telecommunications
linking to other parts outside China, education, finance, health
care, tourism and trade. Bonded warehouses, with a combined floor
space of 140,000 sq m, have been built to provide convenience for
foreign investors to import raw materials and export their
products.
</P>
<P>
So far, businesses from 27 countries and regions have invested
money in the zone, and 80 percent of the foreign-funded
enterprises in the zone are export-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, a growing number of foreign investors
have made reinvestments in the development zone, said local
officials.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Pressed to Nominate Chavalit as Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Core members of the Thai six
coalition parties are to meet Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa
today and are expected to press him to surrender the premiership
to New Aspiration Party leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Banharn announced last Saturday he will resign within seven
days and choose a successor from his coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yet until Sunday, Banharn was unyielding, and sources said he
would try to block Chavalit's rise by nominating Pramarn
Adireksarn, Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party's advisory chairman, as
the party's candidate for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Somsak Prissanananthakul said Banharn
still had a say in the selection of his successor and in the
formation of a new administration.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister retains the right to make the selection and
the first choice should be someone from Chart Thai," he said.
</P>
<P>
Discussion on the selection of a new prime minister begins
Tuesday among leaders of the six coalition parties, Somsak said.
</P>
<P>
He said Banharn would resign as promised, but only after his
replacement had been picked and a new government was in shape.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the prime minister wanted a strong economic
team to be created which would be able to restore public
confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman gave the assurance that Banharn had no intention
yet of dissolving parliament.

issues including the dispute over the Sipadan and Ligitan islands.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia wants to settle the dispute over Sipadan and Ligitan
in a familial fashion between the two countries based on the
spirit of ASEAN," Indonesian Armed Forces Chief General Feisal
Tanjung said when announcing the news in Bandung, West Java
Sunday, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The military chief did not say when Soeharto would leave for
Malaysia, saying only that it would be "soon".
</P>
<P>
Soeharto canceled a trip to Kuala Lumpur in July because he had
to fly to Germany for a health checkup.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Malaysia have overlapping sovereignty claims over
the two small islands that lie off the coast of the Kalimantan
border between the Malaysian state of Sarawak and the Indonesian
province of East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The problem dated back to 1969, when a decision had to be made
on the borderlines of the two countries on the eastern part of
Indonesia's East Kalimantan. In that year, both sides agreed that
the "situation quo" should be maintained on Sipadan Island and the
Isles of Ligitan.
</P>
<P>
Geographically, Sipadan Island with an area of about 50,000
square meters, is located on 04.10 degree Northern Latitude on the
eastern part of East Kalimantan. While the 18,000-square-meter
Ligitan Isles are located parallel to the latitude.
</P>
<P>
The discord escalated in 1993 after Malaysia advertised to two
islands as its latest tourist destinations. Jakarta says this
contravened a 1969 agreement.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Malaysia are members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which also includes Brunei, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Millions of Chinese Farmers Benefit from "Spark Program" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of millions of
Chinese farmers have shaken off poverty and become better off,
thanks to the Chinese government's "Spark Program".
</P>
<P>
Han Deqian, vice-minister at the State Science and Technology
Commission, claimed that the program, launched in 1986, has made
brilliant achievements, saying "its biggest success is that the
program has brought the dual advantages of science and technology
to rural areas."
</P>
<P>
The decade-old Spark Program, initiated by the government, is
China's first nationwide plan to encourage economic development in
rural areas with the help of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China has launched 66,000 Spark Program
projects, covering 85 percent of Chinese counties.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the implementation of the program has
yielded 270 billion yuan (33 billion U.S. dollars) in output
value, 47 billion yuan of taxes and profits paid to the state, and
8.9 billion dollars of exports.
</P>
<P>
The official said the past 10 years witnessed a great leap
forward for China's rural enterprises, with 80 percent of the
Spark Program projects designed for the rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The training of farmers is also a major task of the Spark
Program. By the end of 1995, China had established more than 4,000
farmer training centers at various levels. Around 36 million
farmers have attended science and technology promotion studies.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister attributed the success to needs of China's
reform and the development of rural productive forces.
</P>
<P>
He added that common efforts made by the whole society was
another important factor for the effective implementation of the
program.
</P>
<P>
He explained that local governments, financial organs,
scientific research institutions, and social groups have all made
great contributions to the program.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, more than one million scientists and
technicians have participated in the program, and state banks and
financial organizations have provided 32 billion yuan (four billion
dollars) in loans to assist the Spark projects.
</P>
<P>
China is a major agricultural country with less than seven
percent of the world's total agricultural land, while the country
must feed 22 percent of world's population.
</P>
<P>
Han held that the only way to resolve the problem is by
depending on the promotion of science and technology in the rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the future development of the program, the
vice-minister said more projects will be launched in China's
central and western areas in the next five years, in an effort to
encourage the economic development of the areas where two thirds
of China's rural population live.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country also plans to establish another 100
state-level Spark Program intensive areas. It will mean that Spark
Program projects will cover 90 percent of Chinese counties.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes overseas investment in Spark Program projects,
and will introduce advanced technology and equipment suitable for
China's rural conditions, the vice-minister said.

<HEADLINE> World Quietest Aircraft Global Demo Flight Ended in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A brand-new MD-90 passenger
plane has been delivered to China Northern Airlines by McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
The US aircraft-maker used the aircraft for a 28,000 mile world
demonstration flight tour that ended in China.
</P>
<P>
China Northern, a backbone airline in the country, has ordered
11 MD-90s, with the latest delivery the third this year.
</P>
<P>
The 153-seat MD-90 has proved to be the quietest and the
cleanest commercial aircraft in its class in the world.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1989, the MD-90 program's first flight took
place in February 1993. Since then, 20 MD-90s have been delivered to
airlines throughout the world and additional orders for 123 have
been placed.
</P>
<P>
Twenty MD-90s are expected to be built and assembled in the
plants of four Chinese aircraft-makers in Shanghai, Xi'an,
Chengdu, and Shenyang. And four Chinese aircraft manufacturers
have already built 35 MD-80 aircrafts through Sino-US cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In order to display the MD-90, McDonnell Douglas launched a 1.5
million-US-dollar world demo flight tour between August 28 and
September 19, covering a dozen countries and regions flying over
28,000 miles - equal to more than once around the world.
</P>
<P>
While in China, which was the last leg of the trip, the MD team
was warmly welcomed by local airlines and government officials in
the four cities of Shenyang, Taiyuan, Urumqi, and Shenzhen, where
the exhibition flights were carried out.
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by MD-90's low noise, fuel efficiency, and
durability", Wu Baiwang, general manager of Taiyuan-based China
General Aviation Corporation, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Wu and two of his deputies, and Zhang Ruipu, general manager of
Urumqi-based China Xinjiang Airlines, who are former pilots, all
flew the MD-90 during the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The four airlines, based in the four cities where the
demonstrations took place, have all mapped out ambitious
fleet-expansion plans over the next five years, and are now in the
stage of cautious selection.
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by the four Chinese cities we've been to and the
new airport facilities there," said Donald Black, vice-president
and general-manager of sales and marketing for the Douglas
Aircraft division of McDonnell Douglas, "I'm sure MD will find a
broader market in China".
</P>
<P>
With a successful cooperation between MD and Chinese
aircraft-makers in the past 20 years, China has already become one
of the most important markets for MD, Black said.
</P>
<P>
The MD-90 twin jet is is an advanced mid-size, medium-range
aircraft. While carrying 150 passengers, the plane can fly for
3,820 km at a cruising speed of 812 kilometers per hour.

They called for early treatment of the disease, saying that if
encephalitic patients visit the hospitals in time, 90 percent of
them could survive.
</P>
<P>
Poor sanitation and unclean drinking water are considered as
the main cause of the outbreak of the disease, especially after

KATHMANDU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Fear of snakebite is
prevailing in some rural areas of the southern Nepali district of

<HEADLINE> Japan to explore oil in Kazakstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TOKYO, September 23 (Xinhua)-- Japan National Oil Corp. will
sign a basic agreement with the government of Kazakstan later
Monday to explore and develop oil fields in the country, Kyodo
quoted Nihon Keizai Shimbun as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the state-owned Japanese oil company will
have an exclusive license to explore Kazak oil fields for five
years beginning fiscal 1998, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
It will spend some 10 billion yen to conduct geological surveys
and evaluate possibilities in a mining area on the northwestern coast
of the Aral Sea and another inland site, according to Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
The two exploration sites are estimated to have an oil reserve
of 500 million barrels each, a senior Japan National Oil official
said.
</P>
<P>
The accord will also award private-sector Japanese companies and
consortiums with preferential rights for development in future
negotiations over concessions in the oil fields, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Agency of
Natural Resources and Energy hopes the project will provide Japan
with another major oil field in 2000 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
Japan has so far developed oil fields in the Middle East through
Japan Oil Development Co. and Arabian Oil Co.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Four Parties to Be Major Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders will have
to decide who they will vote on October 12 from 22 political
parties under a new election system, the Mixed Member Proportional
(MMP) representation system.
</P>
<P>
The 22 parties registered with the Electoral Commission have
fielded a total of 588 candidates to compete in the 65
electorates. They will also try to win the party vote from a
voter. However, the election will be dominated by a few big
parties.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the major players in the game are the National
Party, the Labor Party, New Zealand First and the Alliance -- the
four parties now represented in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The National Party, which styles itself as a center-right
party, is one of the two major political parties in New Zealand
which once virtually monopolized the power of the government for
many years. It defeated the Labor Party, its long-standing rival,
in 1990 and was re-elected to power in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Devoted to a free market economy, it continued the reform
started by the Labor Party in 1984 to free the economy from
government intervention and control. The New Zealand economy began
to recover and grow at the end of 1993 after years of recession.
This enables the National to attribute much of the economic
success to the policies it pursued, although many of them were
initiated by the Labor.
</P>
<P>
It is true that in the past few years, the economy has been
growing, unemployment has declined and the government finance has
markedly improved. But the National's experiment in the areas of
social welfare, health and education aimed at scaling down
government funding has failed to meet its expectation and produced
discontent from many New Zealanders. Now The opposition parties
focus their attack on the National for its neglect in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls suggest that the National could win over 35
percent of the votes in the election and remain the largest party
in Parliament. It is expected to stick to most of its present
policies, but will not be able to rule the country by its own.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Four Parties to Be Major Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Labor Party, the second largest party in Parliament, is no
longer what it used to be. It is the champion of the economic
reform in the mid and late 1980s, which later led to the
privatization of many state companies. This impaired its image as
the representative of the workers, and many of its supporters
believe the Labor has lost its past identity.
</P>
<P>
The reform line also split the party itself. Not only many
members on the "left" end have quit the Labor, many other members
wanting to deepen the reform have also deserted. The unity within
the party has been further weakened in the past few years over a
leadership crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although the popularity of the Labor has recovered a little in
recent months, its support rate now stays at around 15 percent,
behind both the National Party and New Zealand First.
</P>
<P>
While the Labor's support is waning, the popularity of New
Zealand First has gone up considerably. The sudden rise since
early this year is largely attributed to the immigration debate
stirred up by its leader Winston Peters.
</P>
<P>
Once minister of Maori affairs in the National government,
Peters was sacked from the cabinet for criticizing the government
after serving only one year on the job. After winning a parliament
seat in the 1993 election as an independent, he found New Zealand
First in the same year.
</P>
<P>
He is known for his stand against immigrants, Asians in
particular, and against foreign investments. His stance has won
support from quite many New Zealanders, mainly elderlies. As a
result, New Zealand First's support has soared in the past half
year and more, mostly at the expense of the Labor and the
Alliance. Opinion polls showed that at its peak, the party
enjoyed a support of 29 percent, surpassing the Labor by a big
margin.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in the party's popularity in the past two
months, New Zealand First now still stays at a little below 20
percent, and some analysts regard Peters as the "king-maker" in
the past-election effort to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The last major party is the Alliance. Its leader Jim Anderton
served as the president of the Labor Party from 1979 to 1984, but
quit the party in 1989 because of opposition to the economic
reform started by the Labor.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he set up the center-left New Labor Party. When the
Alliance was formed in 1991 with New Labor at its core, Anderton
became the leader of the new party. One year ago, opinion polls
rated him as the most preferred prime minister in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance is known for its approach against the sale of
state assets and stands for the state intervention in the economy.
Opinion polls indicate it now has a support of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the four, there are also some smaller players
running in the election. These parties, namely, the ACT
(Association of Consumers and Taxpayers), the Christian Coalition
and the United Party, are striving to pass the five percent
threshold required to be represented in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Despite their size, they may hold the key in forming the future
government. All the small parties are considered to be likely
coalition partners of the National Party.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Becoming Third Biggest Cashew Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expected to become
the third world's largest exporter of cashew nuts following India
and Brazil, this year.
</P>
<P>
Its estimated exports of cashews will be 24,000 tons for the
year, worth over 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports say Vietnam is exporting nuts to new
markets in Asia, Europe and especially to the United States which
is world's main buyer of cashews.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
has ranked cashews as the fourth most important crop after rice,
coffee and rubber. The nut is also one of Vietnam's 12 main
export-processed farm products.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's cashew plantations have been expanded to 250,000
hectares, of which 180,000 hectares are currently yielding crops.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Vietnam's total cashew output reached 110,000
tons. The figure is expected to increase to 120,000 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
During last eight years, Vietnam has invested over 18 million
U.S. dollars to build about 55 cashew processing plants.

NEW DELHI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Hectic activities grip the
political circles here on the eve of a meeting of the crucial
Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body
of the Congress, to select a successor to P.V. Narasimha Rao.

case to appear before it on September 30.
</P>
<P>
While the loyalists were still persuading Rao to continue in
his post, the dissidents were yet to arrive at a consensus
candidate to replace Rao.
</P>
<P>
The senior-most Congress Working Committee member and Treasurer
of the All-Indian Congress Committee (AICC) Sitaram Kesri appeared
to be emerging the front-runner for the post of the party's
provisional president. The name of the CWC member and former chief
minister of Kerala state A.K. Antony was also being mentioned in
party circles for the provisional presidency.
</P>
<P>
Rao has remained tightlipped regarding his plans for Monday's
CWC meeting, but till late last night he had not shown any
inclination to continue in his post.
</P>
<P>
The CWC meeting will be held here Monday evening at Rao's
residence. Rao will formally place his resignation from the party
presidency before the CWC and urge it to appoint in his place a
provisional president till the next AICC elects the new incumbent
after the ongoing organizational elections early next year.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda called upon Rao Sunday and
stayed with him for about 45 minutes. Congress party circles were
attaching significance to the meeting since it came a day after
the sessions judge rejected Rao's plea not to be named as
co-accused in the Pathak cheating case.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Method for Soiless Rice Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China's famous rice growing
paddies could have a new contender with the invention of a system
for growing rice in water without soil.
</P>
<P>
The eco-system, developed by Chinese scientists, has already
won a state-wide patent in China, and experts have called for it
to be introduced across the country.
</P>
<P>
They cited the new system as one way of helping to solve
chronic grain shortages in a country with a population of 1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
The new ecological system can grow high-yield rice and
vegetables in water without soil.
</P>
<P>
The project, called "multi-dimensional artificial ecological
agro-economic engineering system," has been developed by Yang
Zhonglie, visiting researcher at the Hunan Economic Geographical
Research Institutions. It has already passed the provincial-level
appraisal by 10 leading academicians and experts from Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Engineering and rice
research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The application of the system are expected to solve the three
key problems in soiless rice planting. They include fertilizer,
carrier and heat insulation compound material.
</P>
<P>
The newly developed system has been set up on the basis of
China's traditional and regular agriculture, with reference to
experience of sustainable agriculture and ecological agriculture
from overseas , and has obtained a Chinese patent.
</P>
<P>
Trial production in two Hunan counties since 1993 indicated
that the yield of early and normal harvest rice could reach 17,700
kilogram per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Rice, vegetables and flowers growing could have less pollution,
better quality and higher yields, with the application of this
system, experts said.
</P>
<P>
They called for this ecological system to be spread and
promoted earlier in the country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Taka Devalued Again This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi taka has been
devalued by 15 paisa against the US dollar with effect from today,
said the Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's buying rate for one dollar now stands at
42.35 taka as against 42.20 taka earlier while the selling rate is
now 42.55 taka instead of 42.40 taka.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Bangladesh has devalued taka
against the US dollar this month. Since the Awami (people's)
League government came to power in June, the Bangladesh Bank has
devalued taka three times.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi exporters have long been demanding a larger
devaluation of taka on the ground that their products were losing
competitiveness due to massive devaluation by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to banking sources, since the beginning of this year,
taka has been devalued by 4.20 percent against the US dollar due
to various reasons.

<HEADLINE> East China Sea Promising in Oil, Gas Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- the oil and gas reserves
beneath the East China Sea bed will have a far-reaching
significance for economic growth in the whole of east China, oil
industry experts here have predicted.
</P>
<P>
Major reserves have already been discoved in 16 high-yield
industrial oil and gas wells which have been sunk in the East
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
According to information from relevant departments, the most
noticeable is Baoyunting Oil and Gas Field, where Chinese oil
workers have verified 11 billion cubic meters of natural gas
reserves, and 4.8 million tons of crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Workers have also found encouraging oil and gas-bearing strata
at an area named "Chunxiao Structure" which is only 110 km away
from the coast of Zhejiang Province, and is believed to have
bright prospects for oil development.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that China has made tremendous progress in oil
prospecting and exploitation in East China Sea since it started
the work in the late 1980s, and over one billion yuan has been
invested in the project.
</P>
<P>
In the Pinghu Oilfield, which has proven natural gas reserves
of 40 billion cu m, work has started on the installation of
pipelines which will transport extracted gas from the oilfield to
Shanghai's Pudong New Area. It is expected that by 1999, the
oilfield will be capable of supplying Pudong with natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In July 1992 the Chinese Government announced the opening of
some of its offshore areas along the East China Sea, and invited
foreign investors to cooperate in the development of oil and gas
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 16 companies from seven countries around the world
have responded to the investment call, and poured 252 million
U.S. dollars into oil exploitation in the East China Sea. These
companies have sunk 14 wells in the area.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province has made plans and arrangements in a number
of its coastal cities for the building of more auxiliary
facilities to prepare for large-scale oil prospecting and
developments in the East China Sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A British non-government
organization has aided a protection project for garrulax galbanus,
one of the most endangered species of birds in the world.
</P>
<P>
The British Bird Protection Society has offered 1,160 British
pounds (sterling) to help pay for an investigation of the garrulax
galbanus.
</P>
<P>
The 25-cm long bird is found only in the green broad-leaved
forest in Wuyuan in Jiangxi Province and Simao in Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
A group of garrulax galbanus was discovered in August 1995 by
scientists from Institute of Zoology attached to Chinese Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
An American missionary collected China's first garrulax
galbanus specimen in 1921 in Wuyuan (now kept in New York Museum
of Nature), and later China collected another five specimens.
</P>
<P>
However, only one specimen is still preserved in China.

<HEADLINE> Malawi for Free Trade Agreement With Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A Malawian high-ranking official
has called on the governments of Malawi and Zambia to introduce a
free trade agreement to curb cross-border smuggling between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Joseph Kubwalo, Minister of State in
the Presidential Office of Malawi, when he officially opened the
first ever Malawi-Zambia Trade Exposition '96 on Sunday in
Chipata, capital of Zambia's Eastern Province, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kubwalo said that smuggling was adversely affecting cross-border
trade between the two countries and he urged the two governments to
act without delay to sign the agreement to curb it.
</P>
<P>
''The problem could be solved if the two governments concluded a
free trade bilateral agreement whose draft has been under
consideration for two years now,'' Kubwalo noted.
</P>
<P>
He commended the Malawi Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the
Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry for
organizing the exposition, which he said was an eye opener aimed at
promoting cross-border trade and investment between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malawi's participation in the trade fair was symbolic
of its practical commitment to the strengthening of economic and
political ties between the two countries which attached great
importance to promotion and strengthening of trade within the
region. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang To Develop New Wall Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Brickmakers in East China's
Zhejiang Province are eating up hundreds of hectares of valuable
farmland a year, and consuming massive amounts of energy for their
kilns.
</P>
<P>
Now the province is to pump up 580 million yuan into industrial
and technological upgrading, and developing more new wall
materials in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, workers will make a full use of
industrial waste to develop new wall materials, and most of the
new wall materials will be hollow clay and cement bricks.
</P>
<P>
The move is taken to curb the irrational use of large areas of
farmland for making solid clay bricks for building civil houses.
</P>
<P>
The province now has more than 2,000 chain kilning enterprises,
and some 10,000 small earthen kilns which are still making solid
bricks.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the businesses consume soil from 1,667 hectares of
land, including the destruction of 667 hectares of arable land,
and the energy used accounts for 50 percent of the total energy
consumption by the province's building materials industry.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the per capita share of arable land in the province
is only 0.037 hectares, one third of the national per capita
average.
</P>
<P>
However, this economically-developed province produces a large
amount of cinders a year. Thermal power generating stations alone
in the province produce four million tons of residue each year.
By the turn of this century, thermal power generation will produce
9.5 million tons of residue.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has set up a special office
responsible for wall material reform, which limits the production
of solid clay bricks and encourages recycling of discarded residue
into new useful wall materials, with the purpose of preventing the
shrinkage of farmland and saving energy.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the province now has more than 450
enterprises producing new wall materials, with a total annual
production capacity of 1.74 billion pieces of standard bricks.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities hope that by the year of 2000, the
province will produce 7.8 billion pieces of new wall materials a
year, and save energy worth one million tons of coal, protect 667
hectares of farmland from disappearing, and utilize three million
tons of industrial residue each year.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Cautious About Stone Dating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Discoverers of what is
believed the earliest evidence of human inhabitation in Australia
remained cautious about the accuracy of dating of their find.
</P>
<P>
Richard Fullagar of the Australian Museum said today that it
would take more than 12 months for scientists to confirm the
finding that they announced last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the answer," he said during a telephone interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Fullagar and his wife, Lesley Head, and David Price from the
University of Wollongong in East Australia announced at a press
conference on Sunday that rock carvings and stone artifacts
discovered in the Jinmium region in North Australia were dated
back as many as 176,000 years, doubling the length of history of
human inhabitation in Australia.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, they would be the first known relics of modern
man that aged beyond 100,000 years in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, in extensive coverage of the findings by local media
in the past few days, some members of the archaeological team said
that they were cautious about the date.
</P>
<P>
Rhys Jones, one of the most outstanding anthropologists in
Australia, was involved in the testing of fine quartz grain
samples from the sedimentary layers in which fragments of the
ancient artifacts were buried at the Jinmium site.
</P>
<P>
He told The Australian newspaper that the quartz grains might
be from some eroded or weathered stones that were buried in the
ground rather than from the rocks from which ancient people
chipped away to engrave images.
</P>
<P>
Fullagar admitted that the wrong sample of quartz grain could
fool the thermoluminescence (TL) method.
</P>
<P>
But Price, who runs a TL laboratory in the University of
Wollongong, said that he was confident of the finding.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sedimentary layers showed a clear sequence of
age that dated back from 2,300 years to 116,000 years. Radiocarbon
testing of the top layers of the sediment also proved the accuracy
of the TL method, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fullagar said that there were also other methods to determine
the relative age of the artifacts. According to rock carvings and
paintings already discovered in the area and all over Australia,
the eldest artifacts were mostly founded on the bottom of layers
of relics.
</P>
<P>
He said in the next few months, the team would made another
excavation trip to the Jinmium site, where the Miriuwung and
Gajerrong tribes of the Aborigine people have lived for numerous
generations.
</P>
<P>
They will bring back more quartz grain samples from another
site in the region and test them with more sensitive luminescence
method. Jones and an archaeologist from the La Trobe University
are responsible for the test.
</P>
<P>
Fullagar said that he was one hundred percent confident of the
finding. However, as it would pose a serious challenge to the
conventional belief that modern man originated from Africa about
100,000 years ago, extreme cautions was needed in confirming the
finding.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Phase Two of Land Plan to Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
soon to launch the second phase of the land acquisition and
resettlement program to pave the way for the equitable distribution
of land, the daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Experts of Britain, which has pledged assistance in the program,
are expected here today to assess Zimbabwe's capability
to undertake the program.
</P>
<P>
In an interivew at the weekend, Minister of Land and Water
Resources Kumbirai Kangai, who was in the United Kingdom recently to
discuss the land issue, said talks with the British government had
been successful and that the country had expressed its commitment to
help Zimbabwe undertake the program.
</P>
<P>
In 1980 the British government pledged a grant of 20 million
pounds to fund the resettlement program, but suspended its
assistance in 1989 after questioning the government's capacity to
effectively implement it.
</P>
<P>
The situation had now been reviewed and the remaining 3.5 million
pounds were now being utilised. Further assistance in the second
phase of the program will be agreed upon once the visiting team
presents its report to the British government.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has so far acquired more than three million
hectares of land which have benefited more than 63,000 families.
</P>
<P>
However, not much progress has been made in the last few years
due to lack of funds. Money availed by the Treasury has been
insufficient to undertake the program. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Taibai National Forest Park,
located near the world-renowned terracotta warriors in Xi'an, has
drawn over 3.6 million Chinese and overseas tourists since it
opened to public four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has earned the park in the Qinling Mountain 50 million
yuan (6.024 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of almost three hectares, Taibai Park features
hot springs, scenic plateau lakes, rare animal and plant species,
and well-preserved ancient glacier scenes.
</P>
<P>
Since it is conveniently located 110 kilometers from Xi'an,
which is the venue of several world-class sites of historical
interest, the park is considered a resort of natural beauty for
tourists swarming to the area.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate development, Meixian County where the park is
located, has mapped out ten preferential policies for luring
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
To date, about 300 million yuan have been spent in building
tourist facilities and roads.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, the park will become a tourist attraction in
parallel with other famous scenic spots, such as the Taishan and
Emei mountains, and the Shennongjia and Jiuzhaigou scenic areas",
said a local tourist official.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The non-oil exports of
Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil-producing and exporting country in
the world, are expected to grow by 15 to 20 percent annually over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>

Riyals (133.3 million U.S. dollars) to Europe alone in 1995,
according to Sunday's English daily Arab News.
</P>
<P>
Private sector's exports in non-oil products witnessed
considerable growth during the period 1991-94, rising to nine
billion Riyals (2.4 billion U.S. dollars). The metal industry
and chemical products sector have constituted the bulk of the
exports.

HARARE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Film producers from southern
Africa are coming together to make a series of six documentary
films on truth and reconciliation in the region to be released in
1997 at a total cost of 460 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Southern African Communications for
Development (SACOD) held in Harare on Sunday, coordinator Jorge
Ferrao said the 26-minute documentaries were expected to be story
driven, with an emphasis on personal experiences.
</P>
<P>
''There is a sense of amnesia in parts of the region and among
people now that apartheid has been scrapped and there is also a
sense of disappointment the past is not being dealt with in a way
to allow reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
''We are asking for treatments (story scripts) from SACOD
producers and other producers in the region and we will choose
the best from each country based on this idea,'' Ferrao said.
</P>
<P>
Overall propositions for the documentaries are expected to be
ready by November this year and films to be ready by 1997.

<HEADLINE> Building of LNG Power Station in Yangtze Delta Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Experts have started
discussions about building a liquefied natural gas power station
in the energy-starved Yangtze River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The power station under discussion by experts in Hangzhou will
cost two billion U.S. dollars for its first-phase project which
will include gas-fired 2.4 million kw steam joint circulation
generating units, a storage facility for three million tons/per
year of LNG, and a 150,000 dwt (dead weight tonnages) natural gas
berth.
</P>
<P>
The project was considered at a Yangtze River Delta LNG Project
Seminar in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 officials and experts from across the country, as
well as experts from the Shell Group Company, attended the
seminar, sponsored by Zhejiang Provincial Engineering Consulting
Association and Shell Group Company.
</P>
<P>
The demand for electricity is going up day by day in the
Yangtze River Delta because of a rapid economic expansion in the
region.
</P>
<P>
But the development and use of the traditional energy
(such as coal) has caused very serious
environment problems. So provinces in the Yangtze River Delta
are also looking for new energy sources, while making
active efforts to develop "clean energy" -- such as nuclear and
hydroelectric power stations.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the seminar believe that using natural gas
resources and related advanced technology to build a
LNG power station in east China is a good way for alleviating the
growing power shortage in the Yangtze River Delta.
</P>
<P>
They say that many countries in the world have built LNG power
stations which have proved to be even more efficient, low cost and
are cleaner than nuclear or hydroelectric power stations.
</P>
<P>
Participants also exchanged views and discussed related matters
including the location of the new station, construction scale and
pipeline route.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Not to Introduce "Multi-Politics" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The multi-politics and the
multi-party system do not suit Vietnam's situation, according to
an article released here today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese people only accept the leadership of the
Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), said the article carried by the
newspaper People's Army.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that the so-called "neo-ideology" as well
as the "multi-power system", which some Vietnamese were
advocating, were only other names for multi-politics. They are not
for the Vietnamese people, nor the nation, nor the country, but
for a small number of people.
</P>
<P>
"The social stability depends on the integration of the
political organizations. The union of ideology is the motive force
for social development," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Past experience shows the Vietnamese people have more trust and
love to the CPV and would never accept the leadership of any other
party, the article added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Aids Killing Herbs Faulted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The reported discovery of two
plants helpful to cure the dreaded acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (Aids) by Nigeria's Agricultural Ministry was debunked
by an international anti-Aids compaigner.
</P>
<P>
Beside scanty information provided on the clinical
capabilities of the herbs, Dr. Rita Isu Williams faulted the
discovery by juxtaposing the herbs' possible efficacy with the
rampaging effects of the HIV virus that causes aids, the Guardian
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
''The plants are most probably not intended to cure. The
plants most often ameliorate the condition of the Aids victim. If
you know the way in which HIV attacks the victim, you will know
that it is difficult to destroy because you will be destroying
the cells of the host,'' Mrs. Williams said, quoted by the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had reportedly announced at a conservation forum
in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, two weeks ago that two plants with
active anti-Aids ingredients were found in southeastern Cross
River State.
</P>
<P>
With four percent of the Nigerian population, which is put at
more than 100 million, already infected with the Aids virus, Mrs.
Williams warned that the country is ''at the verge of an Aids
epidemic''.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who is also the resident advisor of the family
health international, a non-governmental health organization,
revealed fear-inducing data on the Aids scourge, saying between
one and two percent of patients on admission in public hospitals
are having Aids, the newspaper reported.

information about trade opportunities. The import and export
information of some of China's businesses has been carried by the
network, and the rate of feedback reached 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the network can provide information about China's
current policies of foreign trade, as well as E-mail and EDI.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, CTNet, authorized by the Chinese
government, will also provide on-line information exchange and

<HEADLINE> Inexpensive Hotels in Lhasa Attract Foreign Visitors (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tourists can also rent bicycles from the hotel, where the 21
workers use simple English to receive guests.
</P>
<P>
The hotel normally receives 3,000 foreign tourists during the
busy tourism season from May to November. It is often full in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
An Italian couple praised the hotel for its clean environment
and good service.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 meters away from Palangxue is another
collectively-owned hotel, Ya hotel, which is also well received by
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
In front of the Ya Hotel is a tent, in which there are benches
and tea tables for customers to drink tea, play chess and chat.
</P>
<P>
Imamura Chiaki, a young Japanese tourist, who stayed in the Ya
hotel for a week, said that she spent all her time in the tent
except for going sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
She said, "I like it here very much because here I can not only
relax, but also make a lot of friends."
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that Lhasa currently has ten
collectively-owned or individually-run hotels designated by the
government to receive overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
Purpu Zholma, deputy director of the Tourism Bureau of Lhasa's
Urban District, said that the hotels can attract large numbers of
foreign tourists each year because most of them are listed in
tourism guides published in Europe, north America, Australia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
"But competition among them is very intense. Besides, Lhasa has
ten star-rated hotels," she said, noting that any inexpensive
hotel must improve their services in order to match, or beat the
competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- In a typical street in Lhasa,
foreign tourists can often be seen consulting tourist maps. Ask
the tourists why they are consulting maps, and usually the reply
is: "I am trying to find an inexpensive hotel."
</P>
<P>
Palangxue hotel near the Bargor Street in downtown Lhasa, is
one such hotel, keeping its lowest daily rate at 25 yuan (about
three US dollars), the same as eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hotel Manger Losang said, "We will always provide low-price,
and yet best services. This is our operational guideline."
</P>
<P>
Built in 1984, the hotel was one of the first hotels designed
for foreign tourists by the government in the capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Losang said, "I think the construction of hotels for foreign
tourists is a result of rapid urban construction in Lhasa."
</P>
<P>
The site of his hotel used to be a small village and Losang was
a vegetable grower. Later land was requisitioned by the government
for construction, so that villagers have become urban
residents. With tourism development prospects in mind, they built
the hotel using 780,000 yuan paid by the government to requisition
their land.
</P>
<P>
The hotel has 100 double rooms, most of which are characterized
by Tibetan styles. The restaurant provides western food and
Tibetan food.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conferecne (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan said here today that the huge
potential is yet to be tapped for furthering relations between
China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from a meeting between Li and Gennady Seleznev,
chairman of the State Duma of Russia, here this morning. Li told
Seleznev that China is willing to make concerted efforts with
Russia to push forward bilateral relations to a new high.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges and
bilateral ties have become particularly closer over recent years
with the efforts from the two countries, Li said, and exchanges of
high-level visits have been frequent and trade and economic
cooperation on rise.
</P>
<P>
Li told Seleznev that China is pleased with the development of
bilateral relations and believed greater potentiality is yet to be
tapped for further develop such relations. And the scale of
bilateral trade is not very worthy of the development level of
their economies, Li cited.
</P>
<P>
The world is generally developing in the direction of
relaxation after the cold war, Li said, yet the expected peace and
transquility have not been realized in a real essence.
</P>
<P>
A closer Sino-Russian relationship is not only in the interests
of the peoples of the two countries, but also beneficial to the
world peace and development, Li said, and various agreements
signed by the leaders of the two countries have produced and will
continue to produce great and positive impacts on the world.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev said China has made great achievements in developing
economy and is fully confident of its future, and Russia is
willing to continue to promote its friendly cooperation in various
fields with China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li briefed Seleznev on the CPPCC's place
and role in the Chinese political life and said that the CPPCC is
willing to make greater contribution to the growth of friendship
and cooperation between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev said that the CPPCC has established broad links with
foreign countries and has been playing a major role in the Chinese
social and political life, and the Russian State Duma is willing
to strengthen its exchanges and cooperation with the CPPCC.

<HEADLINE> "Red Flag" Car Rolls in New Manner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- In the 60s, many foreign
guests asked for three privileges from their Chinese hosts -- to
meet with the then paramount leader Chairman Mao Zedong, to stay
at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, and to ride in a "Red Flag"
limousine.
</P>
<P>
The car had been a political symbol since 1958, when the first
"Red Flag" rolled off the production line at the First Automotive
Works (FAW) in Changchun, capital city of northeast China's Jilin
Province.
</P>
<P>
To take a "Red Flag" used to be an honorable privilege only for
senior foreign guests, or high ranking Chinese officials. Traffic
policemen were long accustomed to saluting a "Red Flag" whenever
spotting one.
</P>
<P>
To meet the official demands for "Red Flag" cars, the
manufacturer suffered 60 million yuan in losses between the 60s
and the early 80s. It had to assemble the political cars in line
with a government order, regardless of their cost. Of course, the
state-owned factory never feared being in the "red" during those
"planned-economy" days.
</P>
<P>
Things have been changed greatly since China steered a course
towards reform and opening policies in the late 1970s. Nowadays,
anyone with enough money is able to buy or hire a "Red Flag" at
will.
</P>
<P>
However, a heated debate erupted at the end of last year, when
FAW, which has been making Audi cars with technological assistance
from Germany since the early 90s, began to produce several new
models of "Red Flag" cars, which look similar to Audi cars.
</P>
<P>
Opponents criticized the new-look "Red Flag" cars, as foreign
cars using a famous Chinese brand, claiming it hurt the national
feeling and confidence.
</P>
<P>
"Why should a Chinese 'Red Flag' bear the appearance of the
Audi?" they questioned.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese economists mocked at the opponents, and termed
them as being bounded by the outdated, planned economy. The
automotive industry has developed rapidly and people must not look
at the "Red Flag" cars through old glasses, they said.
</P>
<P>
FAW General Manager Geng Zhaojie insists that the new "Red
Flag" cars are home-made, with 82 percent of their parts
localized. The new "Red Flag" cars represent the upgrading of FAW
technologically.
</P>
<P>
FAW now has a yearly capacity of 30,000 "Red Flag" cars, but it
has to adjust the production according to the market which is
currently sluggish in the country. In the first six months of this
year, some 5,000 "Red Flag" limousines, both economic and luxury
versions, left the production line.
</P>
<P>
Since "Red Flag" cars have been designed to accommodate the
vast, ordinary consumers, the price have been reasonable, ranging
from 230,000 yuan to 520,000 yuan. More "Red Flag" cars are
expected to enter the homes of ordinary people, as more Chinese
people swap their two-wheel mode of transport for motorized
four-wheels.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Proud of Its Stability, Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- People of different ethnic
groups in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are proud of the
long-time stability and solidarity they have enjoyed in the past
five decades, a regional official has said.
</P>
<P>
"Even foreign friends and investors have shown their interest
in the situation in our region," said Bao Qiqige, a regional
government official in charge of overseas publicity affairs. She
made the remarks while talking to Xinhua reporters.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year old woman official, an ethnic Mongolian, insisted
that people of different ethnic groups feel equal and friendly
with each another.
</P>
<P>
"We always help each other whoever encounter problems," she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have attached great importance to
maintaining the cultures and traditions of different ethnic groups
in Inner Mongolia. Ethnic languages are being taught in primary,
middle and college schools in areas where ethnic people are
densely populated.
</P>
<P>
Although inter-ethnical marriage is common in the region, the
inter-ethnically wedded families, which are eulogized as
"Solidarity Households" by local people, have the right to decide
whether their children should follow one of the parents from
different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"I have a 'Solidarity Household' myself," Bao said. Her husband
is a Han, while their two children are registered as Mongolians
after their mother. In China, ethnic people enjoy favorable
policies in education and many other matters.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, there are 23 million residents
in the autonomous region, 16 percent of them are ethnic
Mongolians. Most of the Mongolians are herdsmen, who are now
leading a better life than those living in farm-based areas,
thanks to the reforms that have allowed herdsmen to keep and
benefit from their large stocks of animals.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, herdsmen are riding on motorcycles to drive animals
instead of riding horses in the past," she said, "and many
well-off herdsmen often entertain their relatives and friends with
family parties."
</P>
<P>
"All these indicate that ethnic people can keep their own
life-styles and traditions at their own will," Bao said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the solidarity between different ethnic groups,
the official said, "Han people and other ethnic groups have helped
each other in economic and social development. We Inner Mongolian
people know about this much better than any other people."
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, set up on May 1, 1947, was
the first ethnic autonomous zone in China. The success achieved in
Inner Mongolia made the central government determined to practise
regional ethnic autonomous systems in other densely ethnic
populated areas throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The success has also drawn attention from neighboring
countries, especially Mongolia and Russia, the latter has a large
group of ethnic Mongolians. Many experts from Inner Mongolia
Automonous Region have been invited to help teach old Mongolian
alphabets, according to Bao.
</P>
<P>
"I have visited Mongolia and Russia many times," she said, "and
people there were fascinated at the my talking, in Mongolian
Language of course, about the changes and development in Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region."
</P>
<P>
Her foreign audience were deeply impressed by China's efforts
to maintain ethnic traditions since 1949, she noted.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the official noted, stability and solidarity
have become a favorable investment factor for Inner Mongolia,
since many domestic and overseas investors have come to pour their
money in the region, mostly because of the stability and for the
rich natural resources and land resources.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Belarus Defense Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of China's
Central Military Commission Chi Haotian said today that the
Chinese armed forces are ready to develop all-round and an
all-faceted friendship and cooperation with their counterparts of
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also a state councillor and defense minister, made
the remark in Beijing this morning during talks with visiting
Minister of Defense of Belarus, Leonid Semeonovich Maltsev.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to China by a defense minister of
Belarus since the country gained its independence.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that the visit marks a new stage in the friendly
relations between the two armed forces, and is of great
significance.
</P>
<P>
On China's national defense policy and military building,
Chi pointed out that China is a peace-loving country, and China's
defensive national defense policy is decided by China's social
system and its development strategy.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "China threat" spread by some westerners, is a
result of ulterior motives, and at least, it reveals a lack of
knowledge about Chinese history and conditions, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
During the century before New China was founded in 1949, the
Chinese people had experienced great sufferings from aggressive
acts of foreign powers, continued Chi.
</P>
<P>
China will not take part in any arms race or military
blocs, seek spheres of influence, nor station soldiers abroad,
noted Chi, voicing that this is China's consistent stand.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China, with a comparatively low military
expenditure in the world, is to make lengthy efforts for the
development and improvement of people's life.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Chinese president Jiang Zemin and the
presidents of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan,
signed in Shanghai an agreement on building trust in military
fields in border areas, said Chi.
</P>
<P>
All international people of insight will view the signing
of the historic agreement as a contribution to not only the
stability and security in border areas of the five countries, but
also to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world at large, noted Chi.
</P>
<P>
China is an important force for safeguarding world peace, and
the signing of the agreement was a powerful counter-blow for those
who spread the so-called "China threat", said Chi.
</P>
<P>
Praising China for its great achievements in reform and
opening-up drive, Maltsev expressed his satisfaction with the
development of friendship and cooperation between the armed forces
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that such cooperation is based on mutual
understanding and reciprocity, and will continue to be developed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his current visit to China is aimed at furthering
the friendship and cooperation between the two countries and the
two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Maltsev also talked about Belarus' national defense policy
and military building.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks Chi presided over a welcoming ceremony for
Maltsev, who arrived in China on September 21 as Chi's guest.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments Withdrawn From Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Increasing investment
withdrawal has prompted Vietnamese authority to re-exam procedures
for licensing foreign investment projects, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Some 258 projects, totaled up to 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, had
been withdrawn by August this year, said the Vietnamese Ministry
of Planning and Investment (MPI) project monitoring bureau.
</P>
<P>
The revoked investment projects accounted for 14.25 percent of
the total licensed foreign investment projects and 6.4 percent of
total registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Hong kong has withdrawn 59 projects which presents 24.18
percent of its total investment in Vietnam. Thailand has withdrawn
23 projects, or 27.11 percent of its investment. More than 20
percent of Australia's investment projects and more than 15
percent of France's projects have also been revoked.
</P>
<P>
The MPI said the failure of foreign investors to honor their
agreed capital commitment was a major reason for revocation of the
licenses.
</P>
<P>
The breach of Vietnam's laws and regulations by foreign
investors as well as the disagreements between signatories to a
contract have been listed as the other major causes of the
withdrawal of investment licenses.
</P>
<P>
The MPI noted that the Vietnamese side should also be partly
blamed for the departure of foreign investment, such as poor
accounting and reporting systems, poor co-ordination between
government organizations, lack of adequate information about
foreign partners and tardy attention to contract violations.
</P>
<P>
To improve investment service, the MPI is taking measures to
perfect investment laws and policies so as to strengthen the
evaluation and management of foreign investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The MPI will also co-ordinate with other government agencies to
intensify the staff training for joint ventures, providing them
with not only professional skills, but also knowledge about law,
international practices and foreign languages.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Registers Lower Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a
smaller trade deficit in the first seven months of this year as a
result of a higher growth in exports versus imports, according to
the Statistics Department today.
</P>
<P>
The deficit stood at 1.4 billion ringgit (about 560 million
U.S. dollars) during the period under review as against the 6.9
billion ringgit (abut 2.76 billion dollars) a year earlier, the
department said in its interim "External Trade Summary" released
here.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew by 11 percent to 112.4 billion ringgit (about
44.96 billion dollars) while imports rose by 5.2 percent to 113.8
billion ringgit (about 45.52 billion dollars) during the review
period, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's balance of trade deteriorated in July
with a deficit of 624.5 million ringgit (about 249.8 million
dollars) after a surplus of 551.4 million ringgit (about 220.56
million dollars) in June, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Major commodities which registered significant increases in
export revenue in the period include thermionic valves and tubes,
photocells, palm oil, liquefied natural gas, plain plywood,
clothing and accessories and crude petroleum.
</P>
<P>
But sawn timber, rubber, methanol and sawn logs suffered big
decreases in export earnings.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the biggest import component was machinery
and transport equipment which accounted for 60.5 percent of the
total value of imports during the review period, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's major trading partners in January-July 1996 were
Japan, the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South
Korea, Thailand, Germany and the United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Poland Not to Wholly Depend on Russia's Natural Gas: Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Polish Prime Minister
Jan Olszewski said on Monday that Poland should not wholly depend
on Russia's natural gas, suggesting re-negotiations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Olszewski, who is the leader of the Polish Movement of National
Rebirth, said that Poland should not sign any long-term accord
with Russia on the supply of Russian natural gas from the Yamal
gas pipeline, which links Russia with Germany through Poland, the
Polish Press Agency reported here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord to be signed on Wednesday, the Polish economy
would wholly depend on Russia, which would become the only
gas-provider of Poland to meet 80 percent of the country's
consumption demand.
</P>
<P>
This would jeopardize Poland's sovereignty, Olszewski warned.
</P>
<P>
According to the European energy security standards, such
strategic materials as natural gas should have at least three
providers, and the volume of each should not surpass 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Polish Industry and Trade Minister Klemens Scierski said on
September 22 that the accord would do good to Poland and it was
unfounded to worry about the country's economic independence.
</P>
<P>
Poland and Russia signed a protocol in 1993 to build a
4,000-kilometer international gas pipeline linking Russia and
Germany through Poland.
</P>
<P>
Poland is expected to get 18-25 billion cubic meters of natural
gas from Russia by 2010, when the 680 kilometer pipeline in this
East European country is finished with Russia's investment of
three billion U.S. dollars.

LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Head of State General Sani
Abacha has assured Nigerians and the international communities
that his administration is committed to faithfully implementing
the transition to civil rule program to the logical conclusion.
</P>
<P>
In an address made on Sunday, Abacha brushed away the doubt of
his government's sincerity to the transition program, saying that
the enthusiastic response of Nigeria's political associations to
the program is an indication of its success, The "Daily Champion"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is carrying out far reaching reforms in
the different strata of the economy as a strategy toward laying a
solid foundation for sustainable democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
According the transition program of the military government,
the registration of political parties should end by October, the
presidential election will start in July, 1998 and a
democratically elected government will swear in on October 1 that
year.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been complaints that the conditions for
party registration are too harsh and frustrating. A recent report
indicates that of the 15 political groups seeking registration
for the election, only four might succeed.

<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Pope John Paul II completed his visit Sunday in France with
the celebration in Reims marking the 1,500th anniversary of the
baptism of Clovis, an ancient king of France. The pope avoided
making any speech which could cause further dispute over this
ceremony. But he remained rigid on issues of abortion and divorce.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a calculation by the International Crisis
Group, the turnout rate of Bosnia's presidential election last
week was 104 percent. The non-governmental group said that
2,431,554 people cast their ballots, against 2,341,000 people who
registered for the voting. Irregularities in the voting have
discredited Western organizations which supervised the election.
</P>
<P>
-- In Greece, the post-Papandreou era will be socialist. The
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) will continue to dominate
the Greek parliament after winning 42.3 percent of votes in the
legislative election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A dance of the vulture has begun in Russia after the
daughter of Boris Yeltsin claimed on Sunday that the decision to
let her father have a heart operation was "globally taken."
Communist Party leader Evgueni Zyuganov said that he is the
"legitimate candidate" for a new presidential election.
</P>
<P>
-- On the eve of his meeting with President Jacques Chirac
today in Paris, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said on

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Turning to Huge Mobile Communication Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The mobile communication market
in the Asia-Pacific region will surpass that of Western Europe in
size, expanding more than five times in the next 10 years, a South
Korean magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"The Trend for Communication Policy," the business magazine
published by South Korea's Communication Development Institute,
said in its latest edition that mobile communication subscribers
will reach 120 million in the Asia-Pacific region in 2005, from 22
million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Western Europe will have only 75 million
subscribers in 2005, a growth rate much slower than that in the
Asia-Pacific region, although Western Europe had a larger number
of subscribers in 1995 at 22.9 million, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic forecast stems from the projection that some of
the countries in the region will experience a tremendous growth,
especially South Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region is said to have enormous potential, as
its growth thus far has been kept to a minimum, registering only
four percent, compared with 17 percent for Western Europe in 1995,
indicating in part that the region will see a rapid expansion of
its mobile communication market from 2005.
</P>
<P>
Another factor is that the growth has been led by digital
mobile phone system, rather than analog ones whose market has been
on the decline, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Last year, analog mobile phone equipment sold 7.8 million units
worth 4.1 billion U.S. dollars in the Asia-Pacific region, while
the digital type sold 5.6 million units, valued at 4.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that the sales of digital phone sets
are estimated to reach 28 million units in the Asia-Pacific region
in 2005, although its sales volume will be only 4.7 billion
dollars, reflecting a deep cut in the price of mobile phone
systems.

<HEADLINE> PDP Sets Terms for Return to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palang Dharma (Virtue
Force) Party (PDP) has set its terms for returning to the
government although its future approaches remain uncertain, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
PDP Secretary-General Sudarat Keyuraphan said on Sunday that
the new cabinet must be filled with competent people to boost the
country's flagging economy, according to The Nation.
</P>
<P>
Sudarat said each party in the coalition should make a
sacrifice by giving up part of its cabinet quota to allow capable
people to handle the economic affairs, even if they are outsiders.
</P>
<P>
She declined to make any comment on who will be suitable as the
next prime minister, but indicated that the new prime minister
must have proven leadership abilities.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin Shinawatra, leader of the former coalition party, also
said his party does not want to get involved in the formation of
the new government, stressing that it wants to see whether the new
line-up comprises members acceptable to the public.
</P>
<P>
He said the PDP is ready to help if asked by the new
government, but if the new line-up is unacceptable, it will not
join.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin stressed that his party does not want to join and pull
out later.
</P>
<P>
The PDP abruptly quit the government led by Banharn Silpa-archa
in mid-August this year. Earlier in May, it also made a tactical
withdrawal from the coalition to leave room for a cabinet
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The top PDP officials made these remarks after Prime Minister
Banharn announced last weekend that he would resign within a week.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on who will be more qualified to be prime minister,
Thaksin said both New Aspiration Party leader Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh or Chart Pattana (National Development) leader
Chatichai Choonhavan are suitable.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Air Witnesses Highest Lead Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five scientists of the BAEC's chemistry division have carried
out a 17-month analysis in this regard. According to the analysis,
the quantity of lead found in Dhaka's air was 463 nanogram per
cubic meter of air during the low rain fall season of November,
December and January, which is the highest in the world against
383 and 360 nanograms in Mexico city and Bombay.
</P>
<P>
But between February and May, the medium rainfall period, the
concentration of lead in Dhaka's air falls to 253 nanograms per
cubic meter of air while the particulate masses are the lowest at
160 nanogram between June to August, when the rainfall is at its
highest.
</P>
<P>
Lead is emitted in the atmosphere by automobiles using leaded
fuel. In Bangladesh, all vehicular fuels are leaded. The upper
respiratory track of humans cannot block these fine particles and
thus they are deposited in the lungs and eventually enter the
blood stream, the BAEC warned, adding that lead intake can
severely effect intelligence level of children and cause
respiratory problems.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Intervenes to Dismiss Lawsuit against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri, responding to protests from intellectuals, has
ordered the dismissal of a lawsuit against a leftist singer
charged with offending Islam, Beirut's daily Middle East
Reporter said today.
</P>
<P>
The daily reported that Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, instructed
Justice Minister Bahij Tabbara at the weekend "to stop the
lawsuit against artist Marcel Khalife and all that he has been
charged with of insulting religious rituals in his song."
</P>
<P>
Khalife, a Maronite Christian, was charged Wednesday by
Prosecutor Abdullah Bitar with insulting Islamic rituals by
using a verse in Koran, the Moslem holy book.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor accused the singer of citing the verse from the
chapter of Yousef in a song titled "On my father, I am Yousef."
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the lyrics, "Did I commit
adultery when I said that I saw 11 planets and the sun and the
moon kneeling in front of me," resembled a Koranic verse in
which Yousef, the Biblical figure Joseph, addresses his father
Jacob.
</P>
<P>
Both Yousef and Jacob are revered in Islam as prophets.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources have said Khalife would face between six
months and three years in jail if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's law prohibits the slandering of religions or
religious figures.

He said that it is their confidence in Hong Kong's port which
has been the cornerstone of PDB's success and PDB will ensure them
the facilities they require.
</P>

the homepage is part of PDB's program to raise the profile of Hong
Kong port locally and overseas.

<HEADLINE> Nepal-India Treaty Paves Way for Border River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A treaty with India
ratified in Nepal recently has paved the way for a large scale
hydro project to be launched jointly by the two neighboring
countries, Nepali Water Resources Minister Pashupati Rana said
today.
</P>
<P>
The integrated development treaty of the Mahakali border river,
which was ratified by the Nepali parliament last Friday, opens a
new dimension for the economic development of Nepal through
harnessing its vast water resources, Rana told a press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty signed between the two governments last
February, a big-sized hydro project will be constructed on the
Mahakali river along Nepal's western border with India jointly by
the two countries on an equitable cost-and-benefit sharing basis.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 6480-megawatt Pancheshwar project including
a high dam of 315 meters is expected to start by the end of the
century with an estimated cost of about 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister Rana, Nepal and India will soon begin to
prepare a detailed project report on the Pancheshwar hydro project
as the Mahakali treaty has been ratified respectively in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India will jointly raise the fund for the Pancheshwar
project, Minister Rana said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Nepali government has plans to attract
foreign private investment for the giant project which will help
upgrade the country's economic growth significantly.
</P>
<P>
Power demand in Nepal, which stands at around 300 megawatts at
present, is expected to double within 10 years, estimates of the
Water Resources Ministry show.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Settlement Expansion Drives Palestinians to Despair (I) (by Huai Chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- While the hard-line Israeli
government is deliberately delaying the peace process with the
Palestinian Authority (PA), it has, to the exasperation of the
Palestinians, let loose Jewish settlement activities in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of Defense Yitzhak Mordechai last week
authorized a plan for the construction of 1,800 housing units in
the West Bank. They will be built upon land confiscated from
Deir Qiddies and Naalin, just west of Ramallah, paving the way
for 10,000 new settlers.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's decision has provoked vehement reactions from both
Palestinian circles and Israeli peace activists.
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a violation of the signed agreements. It is
the acceptance of time bombs, the planting of mines in the way of
anyone who seeks to pursue the peace process," warned Saeb
Erekat,Wednesday, Palestinian chief negotiator and PA Minister of
Local Government, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
News of the plan broke hours before Mordechai was scheduled
to meet PA President Yasser Arafat in Gaza for the first
time. "It is astonishing and a matter of grave concern that an
expansion plan of such proportions should have been declared
just before a meeting between President Arafat and Mordechai. It
raises questions regarding the intentions of the government,"
said Alon Arnon, spokesman for the Israeli Peace Now
organization.
</P>
<P>
He said: "This is the largest plan ever to have been approved
by the government since it assumed power and relaunched the
settlement program in August."
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Defense Ministry refused to confirm
Mordechai's figure of 1,800 housing units. She made a pretext
for the decision, saying that the settlement plan was
authorized by the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
However, she failed to mention the fact that it was also the
Labor government that froze the plan for the sake of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Israeli Army Radio, Pinhas Wallerstein,
head of the West Bank's Council of Settlers, announced that the
new housing units will be constructed in Matetyahu, a settlement
for religious Jews situated close to the cease-fire lines of
1948.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad that the Minister of Defense has finally given them
his approval," said Wallerstein satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, a flashpoint of conflicts between Jewish settlers
and Palestinians in the West Bank, the Israeli army has for the
second week prevented Palestinian shopkeepers from reaching
their stores in the Hebron vegetable market.
</P>
<P>
The shopkeepers were turned back after they tried to get into
their shops last Monday. They had been joined by members of the
Palestinian Legislative Council and scores of local residents who
showed up in an act of solidarity.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Moderate in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) A showed a year-on-year increase
of only 4.9 percent in August this year, substantially below the
increase of 6.1 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the government said that it is the lowest
inflation rate recorded since July 1987 for CIP A which is based
on lower income earners whose monthly expenditures are between
3,900 and 16,000 HK dollars (500 to 2,050 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moderation was also recorded in CPI B. In August, CPI B rose
by 5.5 percent, compared with 6.4 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Composite CPI, which is compiled based on the combined
expenditure pattern of all households, also showed a less rapid
year-on-year rate of increase of 5.4 percent in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the moderation in inflation could be
attributed mainly to slower price increases in the food component,
with a price decline for fresh vegetables and a more modest price
rise for meals bought away from home.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, slower increases in private housing
retails also contributed to the moderation.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first eight months of 1996 together, the increases
in CPI A and CPI B averaged at 6.1 and 6.6 percent. Over a year
earlier, the corresponding increase in the Composite CPI was 6.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> Australia-Indonesia Sign Financial Cooperation Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello and Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad today
signed an umbrella agreement to ensure greater cooperation between
financial sectors in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Similar memoranda of understanding were also signed by pension,
superannuation, insurance and accounting bodies from the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Costello said at the signing ceremony that similar cooperative
arrangements were being negotiated by the Australian and
Indonesian stock exchanges and the respective banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The memorandum is a strong signal for more business
cooperation, more investment and more joint ventures between firms
in Australia and Indonesia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said on the occasion that he hoped the agreement would
assist the exchange of ideas, materials, expertise and personnel
in the areas of insurance companies, pension funds and accounting
practices, and lead to further cooperation in other financial
sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia was eager to develop viable insurance and
pension schemes while its population was relatively young to avoid
the crises facing several European nations with rapidly ageing
populations.

<P>
The shopkeepers made their move following a meeting with the
Palestinian Municipality of Hebron on the previous day, during
which they decided to carry out the clause in the Oslo 2
agreement that allowed the stores to be reopened. The market was
closed by the Israeli military authorities following the 1994
Hebron Massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque.
</P>
<P>
When scores of youths tried to force their way into the
market, they were thrown back by the Israeli soldiers. Tensions
rose when other Hebronites backed up the youths and tried to open
a way into the market. They too were repulsed by the soldiers, who
also attacked the crowd, and ripped apart the slogans calling for
the Israelis to honor the Oslo 2 agreement to have the market and
shops reopened.
</P>
<P>
Inside the market, barely yards away from the protesters, a
crowd of Jewish settlers had been gathered by Rabbi Moshe
Levinger. an ultra-orthodox Jewish leader known for his extremist
anti-Arab attitude. The settlers chanted anti-Palestinian
slogans. They also held up placards on which they had
written: "This is Jewish territory. No one can cast us out."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Attorney Thiyab Sharabati responded that the
situation in Hebron was very explosive. "The shopkeepers' attempt
to have their stores reopened, and the strong support they have
received from the local populace clearly underscores the fact
that the situation has become most dangerous," he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Musa Abu Subha, member of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, commented that the decision to close down the market
and refuse to reopen it reflected a clear Israeli policy
governed by the objectives of the settlers.
</P>
<P>
"They aim to take over the market in order to link their
settlements inside Hebron with the settlements of Kiryat Arba on
the outskirts of the city," Abu Subha pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In East Jerusalem, another flashpoint of conflicts, the
Israeli authorities have continued to demolish Palestinian houses
inside the Old City, an action described by the Palestinians as
part of a plan to Judaize the city.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the home of Ayman Hassan Yaghmour and his family
of six was demolished by the Jerusalem authorities on account of
what it termed unlicensed building.
</P>
<P>
Yaghmour, 32, argued that he had merely been making much-needed
structural improvements. "It frustrates me that the municipality
gives out permits for settlers to build in the Old City, while
trying to empty it of its Arab residents," he protested.
</P>
<P>
On the evening before the demolition, negotiators representing
President Arafat's office in Gaza and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu failed to resolve the matter. Israel insisted
on the demolition, but offered Yaghnour the option of leveling the
house to the ground himself. Arafat's office refused both choices,
in order not to set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth house the local Israeli authorities
have demolished in East Jerusalem this year, but the second within
the Old City walls. Many more home-owners have received similar
warnings.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, member of the PLO Executive Committee, joined
Israeli peace activists in an indignant response to the
incident. They demanded that the Israeli government put a full
stop to the illegal house demolition.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the left-wing Meretz Party, which was a
partner with the Labor Party in the former government, have been
meeting with Palestinian jurists in order to discuss a legal
program of resistance to house demolition, instead of a
possible violent confrontation.

<HEADLINE> HK Savings Plans Assume Increasing Popularity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Sales of unit trusts
through savings plans in Hong Kong has almost doubled in the past
three years, the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA announced that it will host a savings plan exhibition
and seminars here on October 5 and 6.
</P>
<P>
"Savings plan is a relatively new service in Hong Kong and at
present, there are about 40 percent of our 45 member fund
companies that offer savings plans," said Lin Yoke Seetoh,
chairman of the HKIFA Unit Trust Sub-committee.
</P>
<P>
"For a number of fund houses, sales of unit trusts through
savings plan has almost doubled in the past three years," Seetoh
said.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the increased popularity can probably be
attributed to the increased commitment by more fund companies to
tap the local retail market and to offer services that can cater
to the general public, in particular non-investors.
</P>
<P>
Savings plans can serve as a good starting point for the
non-investors to achieve their long-term objectives, such as
planning for children's education and retirement, according to the
HKIFA.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Consumer Price Index for August Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Price Index
(CPI) was 1.4 percent higher in August than the same month of last
year, the Department of Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that all indices increased with food, miscellaneous and
education groups, which jointly accounted for more than
four-fifths of the total rise.
</P>
<P>
The highest increase in prices were recorded in education, due
mainly to higher tuition fees at commercial institutions,
universities and polytechnics as well as increased child-care
center charges.
</P>
<P>
Prices for packaged tours, admission charges to cinemas and
concerts, cigarettes and hair-dressing services also rose, while
cooked food, fresh fish, pork, cakes, eggs and fruit all cost
more.
</P>
<P>
Compared with July this year, the August CPI rose a marginal
0.1 percent. This was because of higher prices of clothing and
food, the Department of Statistics explained.

million dollars in 1995, local Arabic-language newspaper Al Ahram
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Head of the department Esam Farag said that the total exports

MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A former Muslim rebel group
has denied that it is conducting recruitment operations in order
to fill the 5,500 slots allocated to its members for integration
into the Philippine government army, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres told reporters here that
Chairman Nur Misuari of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
has denied such reports.
</P>
<P>
Torres quoted Misuari as saying the reports appeared to have
been tapped from "raw intelligence reports."
</P>
<P>
"No, there's no verification yet of this. I talked with Misuari
yesterday,... he said it's not true."
</P>
<P>
The government army intelligence had received reports that the
MNLF is beefing up its forces with new members who can meet the
qualifications for entry into the military.
</P>
<P>
Under the final peace agreement signed by the MNLF and the
Ramos administration on September 2, a total of 75,000 MNLF
members will be integrated into the government army and the
national police.
</P>
<P>
The government said earlier that to qualify for integration, an
MNLF member should at least be 5.2 feet (about 1.58 meters) in
height and 21 years old, and a high school graduate. Those
aspiring to be officers should be college graduates.

<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today expressed his satisfaction with the smooth development of
the Sino-Kiribati friendly ties during talks here with visiting
Kiribati President Teburoro Tito.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since the two countries established diplomatic
ties in 1986, their bilateral relations have developed
soundly. Frequent contacts between senior leaders of the two
countries have helped enhance mutual understanding and friendship,
and also played an important role in furthering the bilateral
ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sino-Kiribati two-way cooperation in the fields
of trade, health care, science and technology, and culture have
yielded satisfactory results and shown good development trends.
</P>
<P>
The two countries understand, support and cooperate with each
other in international and regional affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China adheres to the independent foreign policy
of peace, and advocates the position that all countries, big or
small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are equal, and all enjoy
equal rights to participate in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China and Kiribati, both developing countries in the
Asia-Pacific region, have each suffered from foreign aggression in
the past, and presently face similar tasks to develop their
countries' economy and increasing peoples' living standard, Jiang
added.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries have no conflicts of interest,
and furthering the bilateral ties will benefit the people of the
two countries, as well as contribute to peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has always valued the Sino-Kiribati ties,
and would like to join Kiribati's efforts to cement the bilateral
ties on the basis of mutual respect, trust, equality and benefits.
</P>
<P>
Tito described China as a great country with great history,
saying that the people of the two countries have a long history
of friendly contacts.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kiribati government and people cherish their
friendship with the Chinese people, and China's aid has played an
important role in the economic development of Kiribati.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that China, as a major country, will continue
to play an important role in international affairs to safeguard
world peace.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of his Kiribati counterpart.

TAS Director-General Leong Keng Thai said the TAS was looking
at certain types of companies as potential licensees.
</P>
<P>
Minister Mah said tender for the licenses will be conducted in
two phases, starting with the pre-qualification phase on March 1,
1997. Tenders will be invited to submit proposals to the TAS to
demonstrate their technical and financial capabilities to enter
and compete effectively in Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the
general staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) said here
today that China has taken a positive approach in developing
relations between its army and the Australian army.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Australian counterpart John Baker, chief
of the Australian Defense Force and one of the top military
leaders from Australia to visit China, Fu said that the relations
between the two armies began soon after the two countries forged
diplomatic relations in 1972.
</P>
<P>
He said contacts and dialogues between top army leaders of the
two sides have been significant in promoting ties between the two
armies, adding that the Chinese side has taken a positive stance
in Sino-Australia army relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Australia are two influential countries in the
Asia-Pacific region, and have major responsibilities to safeguard
regional peace and stability as well as promote economic
cooperation in the area, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
"Long-term, stable friendly ties between the two sides are not
only in the best interests of the two peoples, but are also
conducive to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific area and the
world," Fu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese army chief also briefed Baker on the country's army
construction and its defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Baker spoke highly of the achievements China has made in its
economic development. Noting that there has been good cooperation
between Australia and China in trade, economy and culture, he said
he hopes that exchanges between the two armies will continue.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Fu gave a banquet in Baker's honor.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Fu presided over a welcome ceremony and
accompanied Baker in reviewing the guard of honor of the three
services of the PLA.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Protection Vital to Sustainable Development, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Environmental protection is
the key to sustainable development, said State Councillor Song
Jian here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifth meeting of the China Council for
International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Song
said China, as a developing country, is always burdened with
economic development and environmental protection issues.
</P>
<P>
In order to realize the sustained, rapid and healthy
development of the national economy, China should solve both the
environmental pollution problems that have been left over from
history, as well as the new environmental problems that crop up in
the process of development.
</P>
<P>
The council is a non-governmental advisory body consisting of
Chinese government officials, internationally-recognized figures,
high-ranking foreign officials, noted experts and
professors. Suggestions made by the council have been well
received by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Song said that people have reached a common understanding of
the importance of sustainable development, and that planning of
economic development must be done in connection with population,
resources and environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has made significant progress in the
protection of environment, but the country's environmental
situation is still grim: environmental pollution, especially in
cities, continues to be aggravating, and the areas suffering from
ecological destruction are expanding.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, environmental pollution and ecological damage
have obstructed the healthy development of the economy, and even
pose direct threats to people's health, he added.
</P>
<P>
Song said that at present, environmental protection should
focus on dealing with the comprehensive relationship between
environment and development, legal construction, expanding
financial resources, increasing input, using science and
technology, expanding international cooperation and implementing
international conventions on environment.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rules Out Large-Scale Israeli Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri today ruled out a large-scale Israeli attack on south
Lebanon, but called on the Lebanese people to be "permanently"
cautious.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after a meeting with President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Berri said he did not see a "real danger" in the region, noting
that the threats made by Israeli leaders recently did not
necessarily mean a war between the Jewish state and its Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tension between Israel and Lebanon and Syria
was only created by the Jewish state who is trying to benefit from
a "no-decision period" before the upcoming presidential elections
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"That is only an Israeli attempt to exert pressure upon the
United States in order to benefit from the no-decision period
before the presidential elections in a purpose to obtain more
financial and military aids," the Shiite house speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a "permanent caution," Berri pointed out that a
strengthening of the Lebanese Army's positions in south Lebanon
came within a framework of treating the Israeli threats with
"serious" attitude.
</P>
<P>
Tension escalated in south Lebanon last week following a
series of violent clashes between Israeli forces and militants of
the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
spearheads a guerrilla war against the Israeli occupation in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol in the
so-called "security zone" in southern Lebanon last Thursday,
killing two Israeli soldiers and wounding some eight others.
</P>
<P>
In another attack on Saturday, Hezbollah guerrillas hit an
Israeli tank with rockets, wounding an Israel Defense Force
officer.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the guerrilla operations, Israeli jets and
artillery blasted Hezbollah bases at Iglim al-Toffah, a mountain
area opposite Israel's buffer zone in south Lebanon, wounding
two local villagers and causing serious damages.
</P>
<P>
The clashes took place amid Israel's escalating threats
against Lebanon and Syria, the only two Arab countries with whom
the Jewish state has not end a belligerent state.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli threats were interpreted as a response to recent
Syrian troop movements in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Syria redeployed its troops to the range
of mountains in the eastern part of Lebanon where Syria has
already installed SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Syria mustered about one third of its 35,000 troops in Lebanon
to the area from Beirut and its suburbs, leaving the posts to the
Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Information Minister Mohammed Salman said the move was
purely defensive in view of Israel's "repeated warnings and
threats" against Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the weekend, the Lebanese army sent reinforcements of
some 2,000 troops, backed with tanks and armored personnel
carriers, to the southern part of the Beqaa valley and
strengthened army positions in the area.

<HEADLINE> Solana Calls on France to Play Bigger Role in NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Javier Solana today
called on France to play a role "proportional to its capacity and
importance" in a new commanding structure of the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
"France is a very important country and should play a role
proportional to its capacity and importance. I hope that we could
find a solution so that France, as well as Spain, which are having
a rapprochement with NATO, will feel at ease in the new commanding
structure," said Solana.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary general made the statement following a
meeting in Paris with President Jacques Chirac, during which they
discussed the reform of NATO, relations between NATO and Russia,
NATO's eastward expansion, and the situation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
These issues will also be the focus of discussion at a meeting
of defense ministers of 16 NATO member states to be held this week
in Bergen, Norway, which is also expected to decide the future of
the Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia when its mission ends in
December.
</P>
<P>
Since his election in May 1995, President Chirac has engaged
France in a gradual return into NATO's integrated commanding
structure, from which France withdrew in 1968, while calling for
turning NATO into a Europe-oriented group and a more flexible
military structure for it.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told Solana today that "necessary political visibility
and operational capacity" must come with the building of the
European identity within the western military alliance, according
to presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a bigger decision-making power by Europeans
in future military operations to be launched by NATO in Europe,
while maintaining a unified trans-Atlantic commanding structure
traditionally dominated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
France, which has put the building of European Union (EU) as
the center of its domestic and foreign policies, wishes to build
NATO and EU into two parallel power groups in Europe, while
stressing the continuation of rapprochement between NATO and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France would continue its return to the
commanding structure of NATO, as long as the reform of the
alliance is "sufficiently significant for such a change."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the decision made by NATO at its Berlin
summit in June to build Groups of Multinational Inter-Military
Forces is a "very important step forward" towards the renovation
of NATO.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon said last week that the
reform of NATO "makes up another great axis of the redefinition of
France's policy on European security."
</P>
<P>
He said that to carry out the reform of NATO without affirming
its European identity is as impractical as building European
security without relying on NATO.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France has made it clear that any future military
operations in Bosnia must be launched jointly by NATO countries
and France will not stay alone in Bosnia after IFOR ends its
mission in December.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has recently called on NATO to hold an enlarged NATO
summit next year which will include Russia as a partner of
dialogue, as well as security arrangements for Central and Eastern
European countries which cannot enter NATO in near future.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that such an enlarged NATO summit could be held in
the middle of 1997.

limited fund.
</P>
<P>

whether to remove one of the two aircraft carriers now in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges More Efforts on Poverty Alleviation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a relief plan drafted in 1994, the country will
basically eliminate poverty for 80 million people by the end of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the poor population had dropped to 65
million.
</P>
<P>
While great achievements have been made in this area in the
past several years, Jiang pointed out that reaching this goal will
still be an arduous task. The current poor population lives in
remote areas that have an adverse environment and backward
economic development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that any delay of the anti-poverty campaign will hinder
the wellbeing of people in the country, and thus impair the whole
process of the social modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only an economic problem, but also a political one
which concerns the country's long-term stability," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a combination of state support and the
development of local resources is the basic solution for
overcoming poverty.
</P>
<P>
He urged people in the poverty-stricken areas to pay more
attention to the grain production, and to take advantage of the
local resources to develop diversified operations that would
increase the income of farmers.

<HEADLINE> Transmission of Africa's trade data to Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of
the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa K.Y. Amoako today urged
African countries to transmit their trade data to regional and
international organizations by the fastest means.
</P>
<P>
The call was made here by the ECA chief in his written opening
statement at the training workshop on international trade
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Amoako said economic integration and development efforts call
for the use of reliable and up-to-date international trade
statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, less than 20 out of the 53 African
countries regularly report their trade data to the commodity
trade ''Comtrade'' database at the United Nations headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The ECA ''was requested to conduct a study on problems faced
by African countries in the collection, processing and
dissemination of their trade data,'' he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The five-day training workshop, attended by representatives
from more than 20 African countries, is organized jointly by the
statistics division of the United Nations Department for Economic
and Social Information and Policy Analysis and ECA.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the workshop is to provide training to
national statisticians in the compilation of international trade
statistics according to United Nations concepts and definitions.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hold Anti-Settler Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Around 500 Palestinians
demonstrated at mid day today at the Dheisheh's Camp Cemetery in
Bethlehem in the West Bank, protesting against vandalization by
Jewish settlers of the Martyrs Memorial, according to a report of
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During the demonstration, families of the martyrs burned an
Israeli flag and chanted anti-Zionist slogans. The demonstrators,
hoisting flags of Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq, called on the
Palestinian Authority to make every effort to protect the
memorial and Palestinian properties and ban the Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, some Jewish settlers sneaked into the
cemetery painting words in Hebrew and David Star, a symbol of
Israel, on the memorial located in an area under the control of
the PA.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Dozens of Palestinian residents of Bethlehem
staged a demonstration on the Hebron-Jerusalem highway to
protest against continuous closure of Palestinian territories,
expansion of Jewish settlements and prolonged imprisonment of
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also protested against the continuous
Israeli construction in Rachel's Tomb. Palestinian religious
officials accused Israeli soldiers guarding the tomb of barring
them from entering the site and of thereby attempting to Judaize
the site.
</P>
<P>
Bethlehem, nestling south of Jerusalem in the Judean hills,
is a world-known Christian and Jewish holy site. It was handed
over to the Palestinian rule by the previous Israeli Labor
government in accordance with the Oslo 2 agreement, but Rachel's
Tomb is still under Israel's control.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Budget Deficit Bridged, Says Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The budget deficit of
Saudi Arabia, once was up to 4.9 billion U.S. dollars, has been
bridged to a surplus following the recent record rise of oil
prices, says a Saudi economic expert today.
</P>
<P>
Henri Azzam, advisor to the Saudi Ahli Commercial Bank (SACB)
told Kuwait News Agency that Saudi Arabia would for the first time
in this decade register a surplus.
</P>
<P>
His remarks coincided with the 64th anniversary of the
unification of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia today.
</P>
<P>
He said the deficit rose due to the deterioration of world oil
prices and the huge encumbrances sustained due to the Gulf War in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Following the suspension of the oil-for-food deal, which
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in six
months, due to Iraq's military action in northern Kurdish area
protected by the U.N. as a safe haven at the end of last month,
world oil prices shot up to 23 dollars per barrel, a record
unprecedented since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Azzam forecast that the oil price will keep up the 23 dollar
level or rise slightly during the last quarter of the year because
of the rise of world demand for oil and the freezing of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Hamad Al-Sayari, governor of the Saudi monetary agency agreed
with Azzam on the bridging of the state budget deficit due to the
rise of oil prices and the conservative monetary policy of the
Saudi government.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the last few years, Saudi government has cut down
government spending and maintained a budget balance compatible
with public revenues and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Also, Saudi Minister of Finance and National Economy said in a
statement earlier that the Gross Domestic Product in the Kingdom
rose to about six percent this year compared to about four percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia cleared all its foreign debts, Azzam
said, adding that the last instalment of 1.8 billion dollars was
paid up in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the Saudi economy still faces future challenges including
the diversification of its economic basis and less dependence on
oil as a major source of income.
</P>
<P>
This is coupled by developing Saudi manpower and securing jobs
to fresh graduates as the private sector is still reluctant to
employ the required number of local workforce while prefer
cheap expatriate workforce.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd said Sunday night at the eve of the national
day that Saudi economic policy for the next five-year plan hinges
on three corners: realizing economic competence at both government
and private sector levels, bolstering the role of the private
sector and upgrading manpower chances for employment.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is expected to realize an average 3.8 percent
annual growth of gross domestic product in the five year
plan period.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Rejects DPRK Demand for Return of Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Defense
Ministry today "categorically rejected" the demand made by the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for the return of its
submarine found to have gone aground near South Korea's east coast
as well as its crew and other personnel.
</P>
<P>
It has been proved that the case of the recent "intrusion" was
not an "inadvertent incident that occurred during routine
training" as the DPRK said, but was "a carefully premediated act
of provocation," Defense Ministry Spokesman Yoon Chang-no said in
a statement released here.
</P>
<P>
South Korea said that a group of armed DPRK people "infiltrated
into" Kangneung County in Kangwon Province of the country from a
grounded submarine on September 18.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, 11 DPRK people were found to have killed
themselves, nine were killed by South Korean troops and one was
captured alive. Five are reportedly still at large.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry quoted Ri Kwang-su, who was captured
alive, as saying that the armed DPRK people were sent to South
Korea to check military and civilian preparedness and conduct
reconnaissance on a military base in Kangneung County and radar
facilities on the top of Kaebang Mountain.
</P>
<P>
However, the DPRK said in a statement that the submarine, while
on a training mission, drifted after having an engine trouble and
hitting a rock in the sea.
</P>
<P>
"Since the submarine ran aground, our troops appear to have had
no alternative but to land ashore and, given that they landed on
enemy territory, there seemed to have occurred armed clashes,"
said the statement issued by a spokesman of the Ministry of
People's Armed Forces of the DPRK on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang demanded that Seoul "unconditionally" return to the
DPRK the submarine and its surviving crew as well as the bodies of
those shot and killed.

<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A new league, first ever
called the China Basketball Professional League, was postponed to
be opened on November 2 this year, organizers announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The eight-team league was original to be held on October 26
through next Feburary. But because of time pressure, the opening
date had to be changed, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
"One participating team has not yet decided," said Zhong
Tianfa, the vice-president of the Chinese Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
"But several teams intended to join the league. So I am sure
we'll have a team before the league starts," Zhong added.
</P>
<P>
The seven teams who have decided to take part come from Hena,
Jilin, Hubei, Tianjin, Fujian, Beijing and Shanghai. Most of them
are from the Chinese second division league.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 American players and eight American coaches will
be employed in the league with four players and one coach in each
team.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new league will be a challenge to the
12-team Chinese first division league called CBA (Chinese
Basketball Association).
</P>
<P>
"It's nice that there will be a competition in the China's
basketball market after the new league set up," said Xu Yinsheng,
the vice-minister of the Chinese Sports Ministry.

<P>
In addition, the poor areas should work to improve the
ecological environment by creating farmland, growing trees and
grass and regulating rivers and watercourses, to achieve a
sustained development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
And knowledge of various practical technologies should be
spread to increase the output and promote economic efficiency,
Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called for greater efforts to mobilize resources of
the whole society in the move to wipe out poverty.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng reiterated that, as they develop their
economies, the poor areas should pay more attention to solving
food and clothing problems, rather than increasing development
speed and launching new industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The state will increase its annual financial allocation for
poverty assistance by 1.5 billion yuan beginning next year and
continuing to the year 2000. The additional funds will be used for
construction of road, farmland and water facilities in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Another three billion yuan in loans will be added annually to
support those profitable projects in the farming and
livestock-raising sectors, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned commercial banks should also provide a certain
proportion for the poverty alleviation projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government currently earmarks 10.8 billion yuan
for poverty relief annually.
</P>
<P>
The central government also asked the provincial governments to
allocate a sum equal to 30 to 50 percent of the central
government's input to support the anti-poverty campaign, in
keeping with their individual financial conditions, Li said,
adding that the relief funds from various channels will be used
directly on anti-poverty projects in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the poor areas to consider environmental
protection even more as they develop their economy.
</P>
<P>
"Increased input, experiences obtained during the past several
years, plus efforts made by the whole society will ensure the
success of the anti-poverty campaign," Li said.

<HEADLINE> CAF Halves Ban on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of African
Football halved a four-year suspension to Nigeria for the African
Nations' Cup tournament, a confederation official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after meetings by the federation's
executive committee.
</P>
<P>
In February, the CAF suspended Nigeria for four years to punish
it for its pulling out a match after disputing with host South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria chalked up the Nations' Cup title in 1994 and made the
World Cup second round in that year.
</P>
<P>
The CAF decided to cut the ban to two years but left the fine
of 15,000 U.S. dollars unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The decision will allow Nigeria to participate in the African
Cup of Nations championship in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee of the CAF also announced an agreement
with the European Football Federation to hold a championship for
youths.

<HEADLINE> China to Treat Foreign-funded Enterprises as Domestic Counterparts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded enterprises
will be given the same treatment as their Chinese counterparts,
according to a senior official of China's Ministry of Chemical
Industry (MCI).
</P>
<P>
During a speech here at today's information release conference
on foreign economic &AMP; technological cooperation, He Guoqiang, vice
minister of MCI, said that China will gradually reduce the average
rates of import tariffs to the average level of developing
countries, and at the same time eliminate the preferential
conditions on tariff reduction and exemption for imported goods.
</P>
<P>
This means that China's policies for importing advanced
technology and equipment from abroad will be shifted from import
tariff orientation to market attraction, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that in exporting their products to China, foreign
companies will have to compete in the Chinese market on the
strength of high technologies and low costs.
</P>
<P>
However, import policies for chemical products and advanced
equipment urgently needed in China can be more flexible, provided
they have special state approval.
</P>
<P>
He added that as China's economy is linking more and more with
the international economy, the country further reduced the import
tariff rates beginning from April 1 this year. The average import
tariff rate of chemical products has already been reduced from
24.3 percent to around 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister also said that in the next five years, China
will form a group of large, high-tech chemical projects by means
of expanding international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue to strengthen cooperation with large
foreign enterprises and syndicates in this field, achieve new
breakthroughs in the construction of joint venture projects with
high and new technologies such as polyformaldehyde, MDI,
organosilicon and organofluorine, he said.
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, China will promote cooperation with medium
and small foreign companies in the fields of fine and specialty
chemicals and deep processing.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in the field of high and new technologies,
the country welcomes foreign companies to establish either
cooperative or equity joint ventures by way of technology
transfer.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to swap with foreign companies part of its
domestic market in some of these fields, in return for some of
their technology, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Funded Projects Auditing Network Formed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- a multi-level network for
auditing foreign-funded projects has been established in China,
and is playing an increasingly bigger role in the country's
economic development, according to a senior auditing official.
</P>
<P>
Deputy General Auditor Zheng Li said here today at an ongoing
national conference on auditing foreign-funded projects that since
1984, auditing departments in China have worked on projects using
overseas funds, including projects financed by the World Bank
(WB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), foreign funds,
and Sino-foreign joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 4,668 overseas-funded projects were audited, including
3,496 aided by the WB and 69 by the ADB. Financial discrepancies
involving 1.45 billion yuan were discovered in a number of cases,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the auditing departments have been
investigating government loans from abroad, and in 1995, 487 such
foreign-funded projects were audited. A small number of those were
found to have violated the rules.

To meet the demands for qualified personnel in the auditing
field, a number of training courses and programs have been held in
China and abroad.
